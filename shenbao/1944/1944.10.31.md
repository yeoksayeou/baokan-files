### Working Directions for Implementing the Alliance Treaty Chen Binhe Yesterday marked the first anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial and Commercial Federation, the Municipal Welfare Association, and the Journalists' Association jointly held a commemorative lecture meeting. Binhe was invited to speak, and his speech is transcribed below: Today is the first anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance. We are holding a commemorative lecture meeting here, which has two meanings: First, to review how we have implemented the spirit of the alliance treaty in the past year. Second, how to achieve the goals of the alliance treaty in the future. What is the spirit of the alliance treaty? It is based on mutual benefit and mutual cooperation. Here, let us review how we have implemented it in the past year and to what extent. When it comes to cooperation, it is of course mutual. China's cooperation with Japan can be divided into two aspects: the government and the people. Therefore, the alliance treaty also states [to seek methods of mutual assistance and amity in all aspects]. The so-called "all aspects" refers to the government and the people vertically, and politics and economy horizontally. What are the goals of the alliance treaty? It is to build Greater East Asia and ensure the stability of Greater East Asia. Simply put, the governments of China and Japan lead the people to cooperate with each other in politics and economy, and jointly move towards the goal of building Greater East Asia. This is the entire spirit of the alliance treaty. The day when Greater East Asia is built is the day when the alliance treaty is realized. However, at present, it is the time of the Greater East Asia War, and it is the time to clear the remaining forces of Anglo-American aggression in Greater East Asia. To build Greater East Asia and ensure its stability, we must first strive for victory in the Greater East Asia War. Recently, in the battle on the eastern sea off Taiwan and the Philippines, the Allied forces have defeated the enemy's American fleet, laying the foundation for victory in the Greater East Asia War. However, in order to ensure the final victory, we must engage in the work of [Victory First] in accordance with the spirit of the alliance treaty. This is to practice the spirit of the treaty. Once we understand this point, we will have a direction for our work. The government must strive for political reform, establish public order, curb prices, and stabilize people's livelihoods. The people must strive to increase production, assist the government, and urge the government to implement political reform. Only by working hard to reform in the peaceful areas and in the state of war, so as to make politics clear, the economy smooth, and the people's livelihood stable, can we, on the one hand, adjust the treaty at any time through consultations between the two countries, according to the exchange of notes and the circumstances. On the other hand, we can make the people under the rule of Chongqing understand the political stability and the stability of people's livelihood in the peaceful areas, and they will naturally yearn for it, and comprehensive peace will inevitably be realized. I have always believed that comprehensive peace, instead of empty talk and fantasy, is useless. It is better to do a few exemplary things in a down-to-earth manner, which will surely win people's hearts and unite them. Therefore, in addition to the joint efforts of our government and people, we also hope that the allied countries will also pay attention to this point, and further implement the new policy towards China, especially for the National Government's reform of politics, establishment of public order, and suppression of prices, and provide more active cooperation. Provide more practical assistance to the productive work of the Chinese people. Secondly, four years ago, when China and Japan signed the Basic Relations Treaty, Chairman Wang said: [The provisions of the treaty are flexible, depending on how we work hard. If we work hard, we can make it go in a good direction. Otherwise, it will only tend towards a bad direction.] The affiliated protocol to the alliance treaty signed last year stipulates that when comprehensive peace is restored and the state of war ends, Japan will withdraw its troops stationed in China and abandon its right to station troops. Therefore, some people's worries can be eliminated, and they should actively work in the direction described above. To restore comprehensive peace and realize the alliance treaty, everything requires our own doubled efforts.

The City Enthusiastically Celebrated the Anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Yesterday. Various Agencies and Organizations Held Commemorative Ceremonies. Yesterday (30th) was the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. At this critical autumn of the Greater East Asia War, the allied Japanese army has repeatedly achieved great victories on the front lines, severely damaging the stubborn enemy. The significance of this anniversary is extremely significant. Various agencies, organizations, and schools in the city raised the national flag of Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth early in the morning. At 10:00 AM, the municipal government held a reception for foreign guests in the auditorium. The municipal party headquarters, the New Citizens' Movement branch, and other organizations jointly held a commemorative ceremony in the auditorium of the municipal party headquarters. At 5:00 PM, the Journalists' Association, the General Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial and Commercial Federation, and the Municipal Welfare Association jointly held a celebration and commemorative lecture meeting at the Daguangming Cinema on Jing'an Temple Road. The event was unprecedentedly grand and enthusiastic. At 8:30 PM, Liu Yangshan, Director of the Municipal Party Headquarters, gave a special celebratory broadcast on Shanghai Radio. Municipal Government Authorities Hosted Foreign Guests The municipal government held a celebration meeting in the municipal government auditorium at 10:00 AM. Those present included Minister Zuo Mei, representing Counselor Sakata, Vice Admiral Kondo, Colonel Matsushima, Director Okumura, Secretary Nakada, Consul General Yano of the Japanese Consulate General, Tatsichiro Funatsu, Representative Matsuura of the Japanese Residents' Association, Chen Riping, Xiong Jiandong, Chen Binhe, and more than 40 bureau and department chiefs. Mayor Chen went to Beijing on official business, and Secretary-General Wu represented him in hosting the reception with the bureau and department chiefs, as well as counselors and secretaries. Secretary-General Wu also gave a speech, briefly explaining the significance of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the relationship between the signing and the Greater East Asia War. He also expressed that as the Greater East Asia War intensifies, the Allied Japan has achieved great results in the naval battle off Taiwan and the Philippines. China and Japan should unite and strive together and cooperate with each other to complete the war objectives as soon as possible. Subsequently, Yano, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, delivered a speech, stating that the purpose of the signing of the alliance treaty between China and Japan is to cooperate in building Greater East Asia. To build Greater East Asia, we must completely eliminate the Anglo-American forces of aggression in East Asia. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of China, had already expounded this meaning in the Pan-Asianism he advocated, which is worthy of our admiration. In order to realize the liberation of East Asia and strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, we sincerely hope that the Chinese side will provide greater cooperation. His words were earnest. Finally, they toasted each other to celebrate, and the meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM. Lecture Meeting by Four Groups The Shanghai Journalists' Association and other four groups jointly held a commemorative lecture meeting at the Daguangming Theater at 5:00 PM yesterday. The guests included Captain Shioda, representing Minister Matsushima of the Press Department of the Allied Forces' Fleet in China, Director Matsudaira of the Information Department of the Embassy's Shanghai Office, and the presidium: Tatsichiro Funatsu, Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, and Huang Jingqi. First, Huang Jingqi, the rotating executive director of the Journalists' Association, reported on the significance of the commemoration, and invited Tatsichiro Funatsu and Chen Binhe to give speeches on behalf of the people of the two countries (the speeches are published separately). The meeting lasted for more than an hour before ending. Then, [Long Live the Teacher] was shown, and the meeting adjourned at 8:00 PM. Director Matsudaira Discusses Enemy America's Concealment of Defeats The broadcasts of the US and Australia are contrary to each other. The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held its regular press conference at the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road at 2:30 PM yesterday (30th), receiving Chinese journalists from the city. Director Matsudaira of the embassy and Vice Consul Fukuma were present. Director Matsudaira expressed his thoughts on the anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty on the spot, and at the same time, he made a speech on the enemy America's extreme concealment of its defeats, stating: The enemy's statements on the war situation in the Pacific are even more ridiculous. For example, the declared losses of fleets and air forces have no accurate figures at all, and are vaguely worded. Secondly, the statements on the war situation in the war zones are even more chaotic, talking east and west, with no system at all. Furthermore, the broadcasts of the enemy's US and Australian sides are contrary to each other. The Australian statements are more profound, and their views on the current situation are deeply serious, and they warn the people to step up their efforts. However, the United States is only perfunctory. In this situation, the US government does not hesitate to conceal the facts of its defeats and deceive the people of the truth. This is actually because the election of the president is approaching, and before the preliminary election on November 7, it is absolutely unwilling to reveal the true war situation. This is actually a habitual technique used by Roosevelt to control his re-election as president. Traffic Safety Campaign, Today is the Sixth Day. The "Safe Traffic Week" organized by the city's police bureau is today the sixth day. The administrative office of the bureau dispatched personnel to various districts yesterday afternoon to inspect. As for today, it will focus on the driving of rickshaws, large carts, and small cart pullers. The following regulations for rickshaw pullers, large carts, and small cart pullers have been formulated: 1. Be careful and mindful when pushing and pulling, so as not to hit other pedestrians. 2. Strictly observe traffic signals at intersections. 3. Remember the creed of [Green light to go, red light to stop]. 4. Proceed on the left and do not make right turns. 5. Do not stop in the middle of intersections. 6. Do not load objects that are too large and heavy. 7. Park close to the sidewalk curb. 8. Drive slowly when crossing bridges or traveling on inclined roads. Securities Exchange Resumes Afternoon Business The Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange has decided to resume its afternoon session from tomorrow (November 1) to adjust its trading hours.

Minister Matsushima Talks About Enemy America's Bluffing Grew's Speech Reveals Desire for Peace Mr. Grew, former US Ambassador to Japan, delivered a speech at the US Navy Memorial Day dinner in Washington on the night of the 27th, saying that the United States is eager for peace due to the successive defeats in Taiwan and the Philippines. This fact deserves attention. Colonel Matsushima, Director of the Fleet Press Department of the Chinese side, made a statement yesterday, saying: [In the Leyte Gulf, our air force, with the determination to die, launched a fierce attack on the enemy's remaining ships and transport ships, and inflicted heavy blows on the enemy's land forces and aviation facilities. The enemy suffered an unprecedented disastrous defeat at sea, and the enemy was momentarily shaken, and was contemplating self-abandonment, while waiting for the arrival of reinforcements. And we finally believe that the decisive battle between Japan and the United States, with Leyte Gulf as the center, will continue for a considerable period of time, and the enemy's weakness of excessively long supply lines will give us many opportunities to attack. The enemy has concealed its losses. Since the 28th, the losses of the US Navy announced by the US Navy Headquarters and the US Navy Department have been extremely small, while the propaganda of our losses is very large. And Roosevelt, when meeting with journalists, even boasted that the US Navy is the largest force in the modern world, and Mr. Grew, the former US ambassador to Japan, declared that the United States should compromise with Japan in order to seek peace. And Mr. Grew has now abandoned his lifelong cautious attitude, and his words actually reflect the domestic situation in the United States. This example shows that the United States, on the one hand, is bluffing, and on the other hand, is concealing its losses. The United States is very anxious and uneasy about the current crisis in the United States. And we are now quickly dispatching aircraft and warships to the front line for a decisive battle, and annihilating the enemy's follow-up forces.] Manchurian and North China Police Administration Delegation Returns to Shanghai The [Police Administration Delegation] sent by the Shanghai Police Bureau to Manchuria and North China to inspect police administration departed on October 3 and returned to Shanghai on October 28. Lin Ji, the leader of the delegation, expressed his feelings about the trip to reporters yesterday. Japanese International Remittances Can Be Sent by Ordinary Mail The Shanghai Postal Administration recently issued a notice on the matter of developing international remittances to Japan. According to the current method, international remittances to Japan are sent to Japan as registered mail by ship. Recently, due to the reduction in ship schedules, the delivery of remittances has been delayed. In order to expedite the process, it is specifically stipulated that for any international remittance to Japan, if the remitter pays an additional special fee for ordinary mail, which is 6 Central Reserve Certificates, it can be sent together with express mail via train to North China and then to Japan. The Loss of the Nantong Maru Cannot Be Salvaged Regarding the case of the loss of the Nantong Maru of the China Shipping Company, the company sent the Qingshan and Xinping ships to the scene of the accident for investigation and salvage. It is reported that the Qingshan ship has returned to Shanghai, saying that the water is too deep to be salvaged. Regarding the aftermath of the Nantong Maru, the company has organized a Nantong Maru Disaster Committee and held a meeting yesterday (30th) afternoon at 4:00 PM to discuss progress.

Yesterday's News Report Time 7:05 Eliminate All Obstacles and Fully Destroy England and America Speech by Tatsichiro Funatsu Allied friends, Today, October 30th, marks the first anniversary of the signing of the Alliance Treaty between China and Japan last year. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial and Commercial Federation, the Shanghai Municipal Welfare Association, and the Journalists' Association are holding a first-anniversary celebration meeting. I am very honored and happy to participate in this grand event. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army and navy have attacked the key points occupied by England and America in East Asia like a hot knife through butter, and have completely driven the forces of England and America out of East Asia. However, the enemy England and America have not given up their ambitions and are still thinking of making a comeback, so they are carrying out a counterattack with all their strength. Until recently, the war has become increasingly fierce. Especially when the enemy America is holding presidential elections, the enemy American government can only adopt a blitzkrieg strategy in order to adapt to its domestic political relations, dreaming of defeating Japan in a short period of time. On the other hand, the Chinese National Government also joined the Greater East Asia War on January 9 last year. Burma and India also successively declared independence from England, and are now at war with England. The Republic of the Philippines declared war on the United States on the 23rd of last month, and now China, India, Burma, the Philippines, and Japan are all on the same front. Please think about it, if we, the East Asian countries on the same front, are defeated in the Greater East Asia War, then the future destiny of East Asia will be heartbreaking, and East Asia will return to the state of oppression of East Asian nations in the past 100 years, and will permanently become a colony of England and America, and East Asian nations will once again be their slaves. In order to seek the permanent liberation of Greater East Asia, we, the ten billion East Asian nations, must endure hardship and strive for independence and autonomy. We must unite as one, spare no sacrifice, eliminate all difficulties and obstacles, and break through and overcome them. And we must exert all our strength to completely defeat the forces of England and America, so that East Asia will forever be East Asia for East Asians. Recently, the sea and air battles between our army and the enemy America off the east coast of Taiwan, the Philippine Sea, and Leyte Gulf were unprecedented fierce battles in world war history, and Japan won a great victory. The great victory that we have achieved is a harbinger of the final victory of Greater East Asia for our Greater East Asian nations. We should all celebrate together. At the same time, we express our gratitude and reverence to the brave soldiers who sacrificed in this great war. In order to completely destroy England and America, we must make the greatest struggle and effort in the rear. Guiding Points Based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance, in order to win the Greater East Asia War, the Supreme National Defense Council of the Chinese National Government approved the Outline for Guiding Public Political Thought on August 26 and implemented it with emphasis on propaganda. The guiding points are as follows: 1. To make the people follow the teachings of the Founding Father; 2. To strengthen the people's belief in supporting the government and obeying the leader; 3. To make the people cooperate with the national policy; 4. To make them understand the Sino-Japanese Alliance and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration; 5. To strengthen the people's belief in the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War; 6. To make them understand and recognize the allied Japan; 7. To encourage them to practice the New Citizens' Movement; 8. To give full play to the people's spontaneous spirit and practical sense of responsibility towards society and the country; 9. To make the people practice wartime life; 10. To purify the people's thinking; 11. To increase production; 12. To cooperate in strengthening security work. It is firmly believed that if these key points can be realized one by one, the future of China will inevitably be bright.

### Japanese Air Force Continues to Achieve War Results, Bombing and Sinking Enemy Battleships and Cruisers, Turning Enemy Base on Leyte Island into a Sea of Fire

Philippine Base, 30th (Central News Agency) - A unit of the Japanese air force attacked the enemy fleet in Leyte Gulf on the evening of the 27th. The confirmed war results include the sinking of one enemy battleship, one cruiser, and one transport ship.

Philippines, 30th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese air force again bombed the enemy airfield on Leyte Island on the 28th, inflicting heavy damage on Tacloban Airfield, which had already been set ablaze by the Japanese air force. Approximately forty enemy fighter planes were set ablaze in short order, along with one large aircraft and one small transport plane. Additionally, nine enemy fighter planes and one P-38 type aircraft were shot down in aerial combat. The Japanese army only lost one plane due to self-immolation, and five planes did not return.

Philippine Front, 30th (Central News Agency) - Japanese ground forces on Leyte Island are fiercely fighting against superior American forces near Tacloban and Tolosa. Japanese aircraft have been dispatched day and night to relentlessly attack ships in Leyte Gulf and the American bridgeheads and airfields in Tacloban and Tolosa, achieving significant war results. However, the enemy is urgently repairing the Tacloban and Tolosa airfields, and P-38 type and two Grumman type carrier-based aircraft are landing to provide air cover for the advancement of their base's air power. Simultaneously, they are repeatedly reinforcing their forces in Leyte Gulf. On the afternoon of the 28th, there were forty transport ships and nine battleships or cruisers in Leyte Gulf. It is confirmed that the Japanese army has inflicted significant damage on them since the enemy forces landed. The Japanese air force launched several strong attacks from the afternoon of the 27th to the evening of the 28th, and the war results are as follows: In Leyte Gulf, one destroyer was destroyed, four transport ships were sunk, one was burned, and several large landing craft were burned. At Tacloban Airfield, fourteen enemy aircraft were shot down, three were burned, one was destroyed, and four fuel and ammunition depots and several runways were destroyed. At Tolosa Airfield, two ground facilities were destroyed, and anti-aircraft gun emplacements were destroyed.

Manila, 30th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army's land forces on Leyte Island are well-trained and highly spirited due to the active cooperation of the air force, and their fierce battles have yielded considerable war results. Japanese forces west of Tacloban are holding the high ground and refusing to retreat. Despite the enemy's fierce attacks, they suffered heavy losses and retreated. Enemy forces on the Tolosa side, led by tank units, are currently advancing to the vicinity of Dulag west of Tolosa, gradually encircling northward from Tolosa, attempting to isolate the Japanese positions on the high ground of Tamo in the middle of Tacloban and Tolosa, and intending to complete the connection between Tolosa and Tacloban. However, the Japanese army is bravely engaging them, and fierce battles are still ongoing. The Japanese army has launched night raids, inflicting considerable losses on the enemy. On the 25th, Unit Commander Suzuki personally led his troops in a heroic charge against the enemy positions under the moonlight in the Dulag area, causing the enemy to fall into great chaos.

### Japanese Prime Minister Encourages the Nation to Strive to Replenish Military Supplies, Speech at the National Convention in Osaka

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Osaka, the "100 Million People's Rage to Destroy England and America National Convention," sponsored by the Japanese government's Imperial Rule Assistance Association, was held at the Osaka Central Public Hall in Nakanoshima at 1:00 PM on the 30th, with the attendance of Prime Minister Koiso, State Minister Ogata, Imperial Rule Assistance Association President Kobayashi, and Speaker of the House of Representatives Okada. The convention adopted a declaration, expressed gratitude and condolences to the army and navy, and then Prime Minister Koiso gave a speech, expressing the government's determination to achieve victory. Subsequently, President Kobayashi, Speaker of the House of Representatives Okada, and others gave speeches, and the convention adjourned at 3:00 PM.

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) - The main points of Prime Minister Koiso's speech at the Osaka National Convention are as follows: The Japanese army and navy, with deep foresight, concluded the air battle over the sea of Taiwan, which was the prelude to the great decisive battle concerning the nation's destiny, with a great victory. However, the enemy may reorganize their forces and gather a large army to attack again, so preparations are currently underway. Since October 20th, the Japanese army has not only engaged the enemy forces landing on the coast of Tacloban, but also destroyed 94 enemy ships, 21 landing craft, and many aircraft in Leyte Gulf. They have made thorough preparations to annihilate the landed enemy forces and are currently expanding their war results. Furthermore, from October 24th to the present, they have launched fierce attacks on the enemy mobile units attacking the eastern sea of the Philippines from both sea and air, sinking and destroying over 27 enemy aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and transport ships, and shooting down over 500 enemy aircraft, in the prelude to the decisive offensive battle. The Japanese army has already reported a great victory, and the war situation is currently centered on the Philippines and its surrounding areas, and a full-scale decisive battle has begun. Moreover, the glorious victory of the Japanese army this time has enabled the war situation in Europe for its ally Germany to be more favorable in the future, and has further strengthened the unity among the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia. What we deeply regret is that in order to thoroughly destroy the enemy army, we must fully supply the unparalleled strong soldiers with the necessary aircraft and other weapons. It is the specialty of the Japanese army to defeat the enemy with fewer soldiers, which is also the case in this war result. However, even if we have the minimum amount of weapons and ammunition, no matter how strong we are, it is absolutely difficult to win. Although there is no need to have the same amount of materials as the enemy, we must ensure that the minimum level of weapons and ammunition is available so that the soldiers can exert their true value and be able to fight as they wish. All of our people must find ways to replenish them, and this is by no means difficult. With the current state of Japan, if 100 million people work hard together, there will be no worries about supplying the aircraft and other military supplies needed to destroy the enemy. The only goal we should strive for at present is to win the decisive battle, which is the way to protect the eternal existence of the Japanese national polity. Especially the severe victory or defeat of this Greater East Asia War is related to the survival of the country and the nation, and there is no room for compromise. If we do not win the decisive battle in the future, the country and the nation will be destroyed. Attempting to compromise with the enemy halfway is like a sick man's dream. We only have the path of striving for the final victory. Once the Japanese nation is destroyed, how will the Japanese people exist? We must fight to the end, destroy the enemy's arrogance, and only strive for the final victory, which is the way to protect Japan's eternal existence. It is useless to refute the enemy's unrealistic arguments now. The arguments of justice and humanity can only be stated to the enemy after the final victory is obtained. Completing the war and obtaining the final victory will allow Japan's morality to be promoted to the world, and the revival of East Asia can also be realized. Now the Japanese army has opened its victory assault route in the preliminary battle of the decisive battle. We only have to follow this assault route and move forward, so that the final victory can be realized as soon as possible. According to the current results, the enemy's will to fight has been slightly frustrated. Taking this opportunity, we should strengthen the frontline combat power, which is not allowed to hesitate. Only by implementing the policy of certain victory, the government has the determination to persist until the final victory is obtained. I also hope that the people will always be the government's support, until the day when the final victory is obtained.

### Foreign Ministers of China and Japan Hold Exchange Broadcast

Elaborating on the Significance of the Treaty of Alliance Between the Two Countries

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) - The 30th is the anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Alliance between China and Japan. To express congratulations, Foreign Minister Chu Minyi of China and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru of Japan held an exchange broadcast from 9:30 PM to 10:00 PM on this day, elaborating on the significance of the treaty of alliance between the two countries. The following is a brief record of the exchange broadcast by Foreign Minister Chu and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu:

Foreign Minister Chu stated that at the beginning of the National Government's return to the capital, it regarded peaceful reunification as the center of national construction. However, since Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, the situation in China has changed.

East Asia is the East Asia of East Asians. Since China and Japan are the two major countries and two major nations of East Asia, they should naturally follow the teachings of the Founding Father, be friends, and not be enemies. Standing on the same front, they should strive to eliminate England and America.

Since the launch of the Greater East Asia War, in less than a few months, the forces of England and America that invaded China and East Asia have been gradually eliminated. Due to this change in the situation, China and Japan signed the Treaty of Alliance between China and Japan on this day last year, and stipulated that from the date of implementation of the Treaty of Alliance, the previous Treaty of Basic Relations between China and Japan, along with all attached documents, would be invalid. After the signing of the Treaty of Alliance, the Japanese side abandoned the privileges it had obtained during the previous treaty, and at the same time thoroughly eliminated the points that China was worried about. Therefore, this doubt was dispelled at that time.

Since the signing of this Treaty of Alliance, China and Japan have progressed from friendly countries to allied countries, formed a permanent alliance relationship on a completely equal and mutually beneficial basis, and jointly devoted themselves to the construction of Greater East Asia. This is truly an unprecedented epoch-making new era in the history of East Asia. The Founding Father's hope that Japan would assist China and abolish unequal treaties has been realized.

Time flies, and the first anniversary has come again. We can only base ourselves on the Treaty of Alliance between China and Japan, unite the spirit of sharing weal and woe and living and dying together since the Greater East Asia War like steel, gather the total strength of the people, hold the belief that we will win, until the Greater East Asia War is completed and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is achieved. This will consolidate the guarantee of China's independence and autonomy. This is the feeling of commemorating the first anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Alliance between China and Japan today.

Foreign Minister Shigemitsu

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru gave a broadcast speech on the 30th to commemorate the anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Alliance between China and Japan. The gist of his speech is as follows: Is the so-called "lips and teeth supporting each other, good neighborly friendship" merely a hollow check and diplomatic rhetoric? If the relationship between China and Japan is based on "lips and teeth supporting each other, good neighborly friendship," why have there been so many misunderstandings, frictions, and conflicts between the two countries in the past? I admit that there have been many unsatisfactory aspects in the past relationship between China and Japan, but I do not believe that the reason for this should be attributed to the Chinese side. However, the unfortunate estrangement between China and Japan in the past was not necessarily the responsibility of China and Japan. It is more obvious that it was based on the instigation of a third country. We should say that because England and America used Asia as a colony, exploited and invaded it, East Asia has become a competition arena for the great powers. The policy of England and America to prevent the awakening of the East Asian nations is what has truly caused so many unfortunate histories to be repeated between China and Japan. The people of China and Japan are still lost in the international institutions built by England and America for their world colonial policy, but they have not been able to emerge. However, once they suddenly realized during the Greater East Asia War three years ago, they traveled all over East Asia and rang the alarm. Then they realized that when brothers are fighting within the walls, they can still resist foreign insults. It is the common responsibility of all countries in East Asia to punish foreign enemies and defend East Asia. Especially Japan, as the advanced country in East Asia, feels even more obligated. The Greater East Asia War is a war of self-awareness for the countries and nations of East Asia, and it is also a war to make the world aware of East Asia, to make East Asia recognize East Asia, to return to East Asia, and then East Asia can be liberated and revived. Therefore, China has progressed from a policy of sharing weal and woe to a policy of living and dying together, and finally participated in the Greater East Asia War. China and Japan have restored their original appearance. The spirit of the Treaty of Alliance between China and Japan last year has also been elaborated in the Greater East Asia Declaration. The reason is that what the Japanese Empire expects is to eliminate the ambition of England and America to monopolize and dominate the world, eliminate all prejudices, and not only not exclude any nation, but also cooperate with it to realize world harmony, so that all nations can get what they deserve. This spirit is also the basic tone of the Japanese Empire's foreign policy, and the purpose of Japan's war lies in this. In addition to having a firm and unwavering belief in this just war purpose, we also firmly believe that the war of justice will win the final victory, and move forward. The war situation in which we have thoroughly defeated the enemy in the decisive battle in the Philippines today is enough to prove this. Now the nations of East Asia are becoming more and more united based on the same policy as Japan, and are working hard to complete the war. This is truly an epoch-making expression in human history. As for the enemy England and America, they have also discussed more about peace after the war. Recently, at the invitation of the US government, representatives from England, America, and the Soviet Union gathered to hold a meeting. At that meeting, representatives from England and America were responsible for the anti-Axis alliance case. From this, we can see that what they expect is nothing more than to control the world with the three countries of England, America, and the Soviet Union, permanently conquer today's countries, and fulfill their ambition to dominate the world. Needless to say, the interests of small countries are not what they care about. This kind of behavior of England and America thoroughly reflects their attempt to dominate the international community with strong power. Because they know that the other party is incapable, they are not only scolding the Chongqing side today, but also regardless of whether it is Chongqing or Yan'an in China, they will not hesitate to use any places that can be used, in order to establish and strengthen their control over mainland China in politics, military affairs, and even economics. In order to realize their ambition to dominate the world, they are carrying out conquest for the purpose of destruction. On the contrary, we are aiming at construction, taking mutual cooperation as our duty, and then saving East Asia. This is what the people of East Asia deeply know. Today, when China is facing a major situation, the Chinese nation should rise up, advocate a national movement, save China's future under the great cause of harmony and cooperation, and strive for the revival of East Asia. Last January, the government of the Republic of China resolutely declared war on England and America. Since then, it has stood in a relationship of living and dying together with the Japanese Empire, and the Treaty of Alliance between China and Japan was also established a year ago. The treaty clarified the eternal good-neighborly relationship between China and Japan. Therefore, we firmly believe that China and Japan will be able to work together to jointly revive East Asia with other East Asian countries and nations, and contribute to world peace. On this day of the first anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Alliance between China and Japan, I would like to express my congratulations with full enthusiasm.

As Morotai Island is an important base point for the enemy to strengthen its air force in the Philippines, the losses suffered by the enemy have a great impact on the operation.

### Chairman Wang's Address on the Anniversary of the Treaty Between China and Japan

Light is in Sight, Strive Forward

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - Today, one year ago, there was an epoch-making historical event that is worth commemorating, that is, the conclusion of the Treaty of Alliance between China and Japan.

### The Light of Victory is Becoming More and More Obvious

This major event made China's nearly century-old history brand new, and also changed the face of the entire East Asian situation. Therefore, it is not surprising that it has attracted worldwide attention.

The Greater East Asia War has reached today, and it can be said that it has reached the most urgent stage of the decisive battle. The prelude to the great decisive battle in the Pacific is also being enthusiastically unveiled. Over the past year, the Philippines has resolutely declared war on England and America, and the Indian National Army has also been cooperating with the Japanese army, bravely attacking and embarking on the road of national revival and reconstruction of the motherland. Recently, the allied forces have launched large-scale offensives against the British and American aggressive forces that are falsely using Chinese territory as their combat base. The Pinghan and Yuehan lines have been successively cleared, and Changsha and Hengyang have fallen one after another. Guilin is also in imminent danger. When I think of these war zones, which are always our land, and the people who have been displaced due to the war, and the civilians who are always our compatriots, I cannot help but feel deeply moved. When I think of why our land has to be scorched for England and America? Why do our compatriots have to sacrifice for England and America? After the conclusion of the Treaty of Alliance, China and Japan have embarked on a just and peaceful path. Why do we have to be fooled by England and America to this day, to have East Asians kill each other, and to use China as a battlefield to scorch China? In addition to being moved, I cannot help but feel deeply pained. From another perspective, the brutal and vicious conspiracy of England and America is therefore becoming more and more exposed, and their situation of struggling at the end of the road is also becoming more and more desperate. In the past few days, good news has been frequently reported in the Pacific. The enemy American fleet in the sea of Taiwan and the Philippines has been defeated. In this way, the bases for England and America to invade East Asia are decreasing day by day, and the armed forces to invade East Asia are weakening day by day. Under such unprecedented blows and threats, the light of our victory is becoming more and more clearly revealed in the liberation of East Asia. Today is the anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Alliance. When we look back on the past, we are of course becoming more and more excited and more and more confident.
