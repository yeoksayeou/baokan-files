Editorial

### Implementing Streamlining of Government

Recently, central politics has shown a trend of gradual improvement. Simultaneously, responsible officials in various ministries are also making efforts in their respective areas. We consistently advocate political reform and hope for political enlightenment, and we are very pleased with this trend of improvement. However, in terms of the overall goal of political enlightenment, some trends of improvement are merely the beginning of the road to enlightenment. To reach the final destination of enlightenment naturally requires continuous effort. We believe that the most important issues currently, such as security, production, and education, all require the use of political power to overcome difficulties. To overcome these difficult problems, the authorities must possess the greatest determination and thorough reform is essential. Some trends of improvement are not enough and are still insufficient.

Furthermore, the trend of gradual improvement in central politics can exert leadership and influence on local politics. At the same time, it can also increase confidence in the victory of the Greater East Asia War. This is an achievement in the spiritual aspect.

Secondly, the material aspect is equally important and cannot be neglected. To give an example, all those who serve in government agencies are public servants, and their treatment should be as equal as possible. For instance, the difference in treatment between employees of the national bank and employees of administrative agencies such as the Supervisory, Examination, Education, and Judicial Yuan is clearly unfair. We have always believed that public servants' salaries must be sufficient to provide for their basic needs and to raise families. In this way, all political malpractices and loopholes can be reduced invisibly. If the central authorities are aware that public servants' salaries are low and their lives are difficult but do not seek fundamental solutions and fail to strictly correct illegal acts of corruption, it is tantamount to condoning them. In this way, political reform will be nearly impossible, and some trends of improvement cannot be sustained, and may only be a flash in the pan.

We have previously proposed the two points of streamlining troops and simplifying government. At a time when the issue of security is of great importance and when central politics is gradually improving, the streamlining of troops and simplifying government are even more urgently needed. Because failing to streamline troops can disrupt security and failing to simplify government can prevent politics from getting on the right track. This is a political experience of recent years and an undeniable fact. And simplifying government is a necessary path to material improvement in politics. Because overlapping and redundant agencies can only restrain each other, delay time, and are fundamentally inefficient. On the other hand, the establishment of redundant agencies increases idle and redundant personnel and consumes funds. In reality, redundant agencies are not necessary for administration, and the funds they consume take away from the funds of other necessary agencies. At the same time, the salaries paid to redundant personnel take away from the salaries of other necessary civil servants. Because of the existence of redundant agencies and idle personnel, the funds of necessary agencies and the salaries of necessary civil servants are reduced, which is the main reason for the decline in administrative efficiency, and therefore the reason why simplifying government is necessary.

In Shanghai, the total number of civil servants reaches more than 25,000 (excluding the First District Public Office and the Security Office). Given the current price index, whether the city government's income is sufficient to ensure a stable life for this large number of civil servants and their families is questionable. Therefore, we advocate that the merger of agencies under the municipal government and the dismissal of redundant personnel require review and adjustment. If the various bureaus and departments of the municipal government can work together, at least the number of personnel handling general affairs in each bureau and department can be reduced. This is one example. Secondly, there is considerable overlap in the organization between the First District Public Office and the municipal government, and it is necessary to merge them as soon as possible. The funds saved from the layoffs can be used to increase the salaries of necessary civil servants to improve administrative efficiency.

### National Government Declaration of War

On December 8 two years ago, at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with allied Japan. Since then, it has embarked on the New National Movement, engaged in safeguarding security, and improving people's livelihoods, with the aim of increasing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, countries such as Britain and the United States still used their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and even intensified it, going so far as to collude with the Chongqing faction to join the so-called British and American front, sending troops to Burma and India to have East Asians kill each other. Recently, their violence has been gradually defeated by the land, sea, and air forces of allied Japan, and their bases for invading East Asia have also been lost, and their cunning schemes have increased. They are also jealous of the peaceful development of the areas ruled by the National Government, and incite the Chongqing faction to continuously harass us in order to hinder the progress of various constructions, and even use their own aircraft, based in Chongqing, to repeatedly bomb our Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. The Chongqing faction, willingly driven by Britain and the United States and serving as rebels in East Asia, is despicable. Britain and the United States, harboring malicious intentions towards East Asia, are doing their utmost to sow discord in order to achieve their ultimate ambition of annexation. This is what the East Asian nations should jointly resist. The National Government hereby declares that from today onwards, it is in a state of war with Britain and the United States. It will do its utmost to cooperate with allied Japan to sweep away the brutality of Britain and the United States in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The countries of Manchuria and Thailand have long maintained friendly relations and share the same aspirations for the co-prosperity of East Asia. In the future, they should strengthen cooperation to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. The allied nations of Germany and Italy have been dealing with the forces of Britain and the United States in the West for many years, repeatedly winning glorious victories. Our country is now participating in the Greater East Asia War, and should echo them to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All our citizens should know that this is the only opportunity to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the attainment of peace and goodwill for the entire world are all closely related to this. Let us be of one mind and wholeheartedly strive to carry out this great mission of this great era!

January 9, Republic of China Year 32, Chairman Wang Zhaoming.

### Japanese Aircraft Attack Biak Island, Destroying Two Transport Ships, Major Fire Also Breaks Out in Enemy Coastal Positions

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – The battle to seize Biak Island is becoming increasingly fierce. The Japanese air force, in cooperation with the army, has been highly active in recent days, attacking enemy ships and enemy positions, with great results. On the afternoon of the 2nd, two enemy transport ships were destroyed off the coast of the island. One was a medium-sized ship, and the attack caused fires at two of their landing facilities. Two B-25 aircraft that came to challenge the Japanese were also shot down. One Japanese aircraft did not return. On the night of the 6th, Japanese aircraft also bombed enemy positions on the coast of the island, causing a major fire. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to their base.

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – An enemy force of about one division, equipped with tanks and artillery, landed near the mouth of the Tor River in New Guinea on May 16. The Japanese forces in the area launched repeated attacks on them from May 27 to June 2, eventually forcing part of the enemy force to retreat to Wakde Island, which is located off the coast. At the same time, the Japanese forces annihilated the main force along the coast and destroyed their heavy artillery positions. The Japanese forces are currently sweeping up the remaining enemy forces in the dense forests near the area. As of now, the confirmed results of the battle include the elimination of no fewer than 1,000 enemy soldiers. If the wounded are included, the enemy's losses will exceed 3,000. In addition, Japanese aircraft also launched attacks on enemy airfields in the area. On the night of the 5th, Wakde Island was bombed. The results of this bombing are unknown because it was carried out at night, but it certainly inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. A major fire broke out at the bombed location and lasted for two hours, which could be seen from the coast. Since the bombing, the Wakde Island airfield seems to have lost its function because no enemy aircraft have been seen taking off from the airfield.

Rabaul, 8th (Central News Agency) – On the morning of May 30, a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft on patrol near Rabaul discovered an enemy torpedo boat. The aircraft immediately attacked and sank it. At the same time, it also shot down two enemy fighters.

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 7th the results of the air battles in May as follows: The total number of enemy aircraft that attacked in various theaters in May was 32,764, which is about one and a half times the number of enemy aircraft that attacked in April (24,097). This number is the highest since the start of the war, while the Japanese side's losses in May were less than those in April (175 aircraft in April, 111 in May). These figures prove the superiority of the Japanese air force's performance. The progress of the battles in various theaters is as follows:

South Pacific: The number of enemy aircraft that attacked New Guinea totaled 10,067. Since May, when the enemy landed at the mouth of the Tor River and on Biak Island in New Guinea, the enemy air force has heavily bombed the landing sites. Therefore, the Japanese garrison forces fought against a numerically superior enemy, and their achievements were thus magnified. Enemy aircraft continued to attack the Bismarck Archipelago, such as Bougainville Island. The number of enemy aircraft that attacked the Bougainville area was much higher than in April. The fundamental reason for this is that the Japanese garrison on the island formed a highly effective defensive zone on the enemy's path of advance, so the enemy could not attack with ground forces. Therefore, the enemy repeatedly attacked with a superior air force to suppress the Japanese forces' defensive zone. The situation of enemy aircraft attacking the Banda Sea was roughly the same as in April. In the entire South Pacific region, 228 enemy aircraft were shot down and 160 were destroyed, for a total of 388.

Central Pacific: Compared to April, fewer enemy aircraft attacked in May, but there were still continuous air raids every day. The results included 113 enemy aircraft shot down and 48 destroyed, for a total of 161.

Burma: The number of enemy aircraft that attacked in April was 7,364, which increased to 10,686 in May. Because the enemy's paratroopers attacking Imphal and the ground forces attacking the Fugong area were in an unfavorable situation, the air force was increasingly strengthened, showering the Japanese front line with bombs and repeatedly attacking the Japanese rear supply lines. As a result, the air counterattack also became more intense. Compared to the 140 aircraft shot down in April, the number increased sharply in May, with 107 shot down and 90 destroyed, for a total of 197.

China: The number of enemy aircraft sorties in May doubled compared to April. The reason for this was the Japanese army's Henan operation and new operations in Central China, which caused the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing to continuously create disturbances. In addition to inflicting heavy damage on them, the Japanese air force also launched attacks on enemy air force bases, shooting down 45 enemy aircraft and destroying 115, for a total of 160, achieving great results.

North Pacific: There was no change in the total number of enemy aircraft that attacked. The enemy's attempts in this area have not been successful.

### Japanese Intelligence Officer Yokoyama Discusses the Invasion of Europe, Believes the German Army Will Win the Final Victory

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – Yokoyama, an intelligence officer from the 3rd Department of the Japanese Cabinet Intelligence Bureau, told the Sino-Manchurian press corps on the 7th: "We are not very concerned about this anti-Axis invasion of Europe. The German army has anticipated this battle since the start of the war in 1939 and has made thorough preparations. This battle is a critical moment in determining the enemy's survival, so it is predicted that they will convert a large amount of their resources into combat power and implement a total mobilization of personnel to make a final struggle. Therefore, it is difficult to predict how long the invasion will continue, but in the current process, although the German people are facing a major crisis, they have been able to overcome them one by one resolutely. With their nation's glorious traditional spirit as their background, and with modern science and unparalleled excellent troops, they are fighting desperately, so the final victory will belong to Germany in the future. The German people are equally concerned about the security of Europe and the security of their own country. Protecting Europe is protecting their own country. With this firm belief, they will surely overwhelm Britain and the United States. Conversely, the enemy is using the ambition to invade and occupy territory to extend its power. This cannot be compared with Germany's spirit of certain victory. The European War and the Greater East Asia War have different names, but in a word, these two operations are the common operations of Japan and Germany. Therefore, from Japan's perspective, the current invasion operation must be given the greatest attention. The German army will seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and, under a clever operational plan, will thoroughly annihilate the stubborn enemy. Not only the Japanese people are sincerely praying for this, but it is certain that all East Asian nations are doing the same."

Ambassador Horikiri's Speech

Xinjing, 8th (Central News Agency) – Former Ambassador to Italy Horikiri gave a speech here as follows: "The long-publicized invasion of Europe has finally begun on the European continent. The German army has completely fortified the area and is waiting for the enemy to land, and it is expected that they will crush the enemy's landing attempts. Moreover, due to the withdrawal of the Eastern Front, the front line has been shortened, and with the shortening of the Italian front, it will be easier to exert its flexibility in the future. Although I dare not predict how it will evolve in the future, the German army has absolute confidence that it will repeat the tragedy of Zheng Chenggong. I would like to pray here for the German army's soldiers on behalf of our allied nations."

Japan Researches and Develops Southern Resources

### Rice Profiteers Attempt to Exploit; Citizens Encouraged to Report; Japanese Embassy Authorities Express Cooperation

Recently, the food supply in Shanghai has been disrupted, leading to soaring prices, which has significantly impacted people's livelihoods. Thanks to the active efforts of the municipal authorities, rice prices have gradually stabilized. However, a small number of unscrupulous merchants and malicious individuals are attempting to profit excessively, daring to raise prices again or bully rice vendors, extorting them along the way, which is deeply regrettable. All parties are paying close attention to this. The municipal government has ordered its subordinates to conduct thorough investigations. Mayor Chen and Minister of Industry Chen Jun delivered separate speeches yesterday (the 8th), urging citizens to assist the authorities by reporting any time they see evidence of disrupting the grain policy or manipulating prices to stabilize people's livelihoods. At the same time, the Japanese Embassy authorities also expressed their willingness to cooperate. The speeches are recorded below:

Mayor Chen's Speech

Recently, the food supply in Shanghai has been disrupted, leading to soaring prices, which has significantly impacted people's livelihoods. The central government is deeply concerned and has ordered the Rice Control Committee and local governments to encourage procurement and improve the supply. Rice prices have gradually stabilized in recent days. However, it has been reported that a small number of unscrupulous merchants and malicious individuals are disregarding regulations, attempting to profit excessively, daring to raise prices again or bully rice vendors, extorting them along the way, which is deeply regrettable. The municipal government and military police authorities have been ordered to investigate and crack down on these activities within their respective jurisdictions. According to the Second Police Bureau, seven or eight suspects have been arrested in the past few days and are under intensive interrogation. The First Police Bureau has also obtained leads and is continuing its investigation. This shows that the rice market is still being manipulated. These criminals must be severely punished to deter others and ensure food security. I sincerely hope that the citizens of this city will assist the authorities by actively reporting such activities so that criminals have nowhere to hide, and rice prices can be stabilized. I have great expectations for this.

Minister Chen's Speech

Regarding improving the supply and ensuring sufficient food for the citizens of Shanghai, various concrete measures are being actively promoted by the relevant authorities. The food supply will improve in the future. However, according to various reports, there are malicious individuals disrupting the transportation and sale of rice. If these criminals are not punished, the future of the grain policy will be fraught with difficulties, and the harm to the people's food supply will be extreme. The municipal government has repeatedly issued orders prohibiting hoarding, manipulating prices, extorting money, adulterating rice, spreading rumors, and disrupting the grain policy to prevent others from imitating. Now, we are strictly enforcing these prohibitions to warn those who are stubborn. The general public should consider their own interests, assist the authorities, and report such activities at any time. I believe that with the cooperation of the government and the people, the current food problem can be solved smoothly.

### Speech by the Japanese Embassy Authorities

The Shanghai authorities, in light of the soaring rice prices at the beginning of this month, are exerting all their efforts to find countermeasures to stabilize the food supply for the people. At the same time, they are investigating and cracking down on the underground activities of unscrupulous individuals hoarding for excessive profits. The municipal government authorities have arrested and investigated several people suspected of manipulating rice prices and have stated that once it is determined that there are illegal activities, they will be severely punished and will continue to conduct thorough investigations. Mayor Chen's speech and the Ministry of Industry's speech to the same effect are well-known today. The Japanese authorities express their full agreement with the resolute actions of the Chinese officials, believing that cracking down on such illegal activities is crucial to the success or failure of food policy. Therefore, we are determined to assist to the end. We hope that the Chinese and Japanese people and other related parties must be sincere and must not engage in hoarding for excessive profits, which would worsen the food problem and lead to punishment.

### Japanese Consul General Yano Visits German Consul General

The Allied forces suddenly invaded the west coast of France on the 6th, and after the German forces bravely counterattacked, they are now about to be annihilated. Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Yano, visited German Consul General Fischer at the German Consulate in Shanghai at 2 PM on the 8th to express his respect for the German forces' powerful and courageous counterattack against the enemy. He also presented a congratulatory letter, wishing the German forces a final victory. At the same time, Consul General Fischer explained the strong German defenses in Europe and expressed his gratitude for Consul General Yano's congratulations.

### Vagrant Labor Camp Hosts Business and Industrial Leaders

The Ministry of Social Welfare and the municipal government authorities, recognizing that the number of vagrants, beggars, and gangsters in Shanghai is the highest in the country, which not only affects the city's appearance but also poses a significant threat to public security, have established a vagrant labor camp to accommodate large numbers of people, provide education and work. The camp is seeking cooperation between officials and the people, creating a model that is easy to follow. A board of directors has been jointly organized, and the board members have been appointed. The camp will hold a tea party at the Industry and Commerce Association this afternoon (the 9th) to invite representatives from the city's business and industrial sectors in order to actively prepare for operations.

### Today is the Sixth Air Defense Day; Various Training Exercises to be Conducted; Air Raid Lighting Drills Tonight

Today (the 9th) is the Sixth Air Defense Day. According to the person in charge of the Citizen Air Defense Headquarters, speaking to a Central News Agency reporter yesterday, "Since the implementation of 'Air Defense Day,' half a year has passed. We are gratified by the deep concern of the citizens and the daily progress in air defense technology. The air defense training held at the end of last month under the guidance of the Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters provided an excellent opportunity to reflect on the achievements of the past six months of training. The Headquarters sincerely hopes to review the results of these two days with the citizens, further improve and strive forward. This is what we hope for." The points to note for the Sixth Air Defense Day are listed below:

Lighting Control

The last training had the worst record in history. Tomorrow (June 9th), on the Sixth Air Defense Day, we must pay close attention to lighting control and implement it carefully according to the following points. We hope that the citizens will pay special attention and that the Baojia heads, police, and community groups will provide sincere guidance on the various changes in controls. (A) Time: From dusk to 9:00 PM, the current standard lighting control. From 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM, a one-hour air raid lighting drill. From 10:00 PM to 10:30 PM, a half-hour air raid lighting drill. After 10:30 PM, return to standard lighting control. (B) Sirens will not be sounded this time. Each air defense group will ring bells or gongs at the above times and shout loudly. (C) Special attention must be paid to skylights, dormer windows, and tall buildings. (D) Street lights will be turned on during the alert warning, but only for this Air Defense Day (they must still be turned off after the surprise attack alarm). (E) Lights that are to be kept on must be turned off during the surprise attack alarm drill but remain on during the alert warning drill.

General Training

Various individual training exercises are the basis for comprehensive training. The proper use of anti-high-altitude water spraying methods and triangular bandages must be practiced correctly.

Communication and Liaison

The results of the last training were very poor. During air defense, it is often impossible to achieve effective results by relying on the activities of only a small number of air defense groups. Therefore, mutual communication between neighboring air defense groups and communication with military and government agencies must be carried out swiftly. This is extremely important, and we hope you will pay close attention. The locations and city phone numbers of relevant military and government agencies must be memorized and not forgotten, and more trained liaison personnel should be prepared to respond when telephones cannot be used. Even if communication and liaison are repeated many times, they are not considered too frequent.

First Aid Training

Hemostasis must be practiced sufficiently. Every drop of blood in the human body is related to life. If one relies on superficial training, it will be difficult to save lives in dangerous situations. Therefore, each air defense group must be familiar with hemostasis and emergency measures. Stretchers are few in number and should only be used for seriously injured people. Lightly injured people should be made to walk or be transported by rickshaw. In general, injuries to the head, chest, and abdomen can be considered serious injuries. Although backups are always insufficient, they must be used in case of fractures. Finally, we would like to state that the inspection of air defense equipment such as ladders and stretchers, despite repeated requests from the Headquarters, has not been taken seriously by the public, which is regrettable. It should be noted that this equipment is of great help in preventing and responding to crises, and we urge citizens to conduct a thorough inspection before and after training.

Today is the city's Sixth Air Defense Day. The Air Defense Command of the Second Police Bureau has decided to conduct fire extinguishing, bomb disposal, and first aid training exercises in each district to promote a general understanding of air defense among the citizens of the districts. At the same time, traffic and lighting will also be strictly controlled.

### Finance Minister Zhou and Industry Minister Chen Discuss Control Policies

Short Commentary

### Today's Football Game

The seventh session of the Student Aid Fund of this newspaper has already begun. Given the current price situation, it is estimated that this session will require a larger amount of aid, and the goal is set at ten million yuan. We are appealing to all sectors to donate and are holding a charity football game today at 5:30 PM at the racecourse football field. We are very grateful to the Tung Wah and Overseas Chinese United football teams for their enthusiastic participation in the game, the Shanghai Football Association, the Shanghai Sports Association, and other relevant parties for their full support, and the racecourse for providing the venue, as well as to the gentlemen who generously donated by purchasing honorary tickets.

Secondly, we extend our most common and equally grateful thanks to all the spectators who will be attending today. With your fervent enthusiasm, hundreds of poor students will have the opportunity to continue their studies, indirectly cultivating talents for the country and society. We believe that if you can think from this perspective, you will surely feel at ease. However, today we would like to especially request that you absolutely maintain order at the entrance and avoid the chaotic situations of past football games. You may be enthusiastically rushing to be the first, but after the order is disrupted, accidents are unavoidable. If this causes material damage to the venue, the compensation will reduce the income of the student aid fund, which we believe is definitely not what you want. Therefore, we sincerely propose:

We request that all spectators maintain order at the entrance.

### The Battle of Supplies at Torokina

The ship soldiers, marking a new era in the 70-year history of the military, have been active in the bloody battles on the front lines of the South Seas since the beginning of last year. In order to annihilate the enemy forces at Torokina, they conducted supply operations through naval maneuvers under the barrage of enemy aircraft and attacks by torpedo boats, transporting large cannons, ammunition, and food to the front lines. The arduous struggles and valiant efforts of the "Army of the Sea," the ship soldiers, are truly beyond description. The following is the "Triumphal Song of the Sea," written in blood by the elite of the "Army of the Sea" amidst the raging waves of the South Seas.

Encounter Battle on the Return Journey

Two motorized boats and one armed small motorized boat, with Second Lieutenant Ōuchi as the commander of the boat squadron, were heading straight for Cape Mopinā. There was no bright moon in the sky, only twinkling stars, and the sea of Java Bay was calm. The fifty nautical miles from 〇〇 to 〇〇 and the further fifteen nautical miles from 〇〇 to 〇〇 had been navigated safely, and the transport mission had been completed. Now, they were hurrying back to base, but they still could not relax their heavy sense of tension.

The sound of the engines echoed on the waves, clear though faint, hindering the work of those listening for enemy ships and aircraft. At this time, the boat squadron composed of three motorized boats had slowly entered the waters frequented by enemy torpedo boats.

Suddenly, two long blasts of the whistle sounded. This was the alarm whistle indicating the appearance of torpedo boats. Sergeant Major Ōtsuka, the commander of the armed boat, had spotted enemy silhouettes about 600 meters ahead at 40 degrees to the right. One, two, three... there were a total of five torpedo boats, rushing towards them, so that even in the darkness, the white waves churned up by their bows could be seen clearly. How could they let this go? Charge forward, launching a preemptive strike against the enemy torpedo boats!

"Prepare for battle—blast!" Sergeant Major Ōtsuka's boat immediately made a sharp turn to the right. Petty Officer Hirano quietly fixed his gaze on the enemy's second boat. Charge, and charge again. "Fire!" With a command, the rapid-fire artillery shells streaked with red tails, directly assaulting the enemy's second boat. The kill-or-be-killed tactic of closing to within 300 meters proved effective. The first shell hit the hull of the enemy's second boat, causing flames to erupt, illuminating the sea. At this moment, the enemy's fourth boat emerged from the flames and smoke at full speed, foolishly seeking revenge for its comrade, spitting out a series of tracer bullets. On this side, Private First Class Fuchigami, the machine gunner on the boat, suddenly fell, hit by a bullet. "Let me do it!" Sergeant Takahashi grabbed the gun handle that Fuchigami was still holding. Rat-tat-tat, the bullets rained down, targeting the enemy's fourth boat.

Under our side's desperate preemptive strike, the enemy boats were completely subdued. The enemy's fourth boat, attempting a counterattack, was also hit by a single shot from Private First Class Nomura, who replaced the wounded Petty Officer Hirano, and sank 150 meters ahead.

Desperate Hand-to-Hand Combat

Having already sunk two enemy torpedo boats, the morale of Ōtsuka's boat was even higher. A glance revealed that one of the motorized boats, commanded by Second Lieutenant Ōuchi, had entrusted the battle to the armed boat and was speeding back to base. The armed boat could now complete its original mission without regret, launching a brave and fearless battle. On its right, there seemed to be an enemy command boat; on its left, the enemy's third boat charged straight at them through the intense gunfire. Boom, Ōtsuka's boat rocked violently. One, two, three shells opened two large holes in the stern on the right side and one large hole in the bow on the left side. Seawater gurgled in. But the "Army of the Sea" would not be intimidated by flooding. The crew members tried to stop the water from entering while pressing towards the enemy's fifth boat. At the critical moment, when the two boats were only fifteen meters apart, Boat Commander Ōtsuka's pistol suddenly roared, and the entire crew, like a piece of hot iron, prepared to jump onto the enemy's torpedo boat. Seeing this menacing stance, the enemy's fifth boat quickly turned around and fled. The remaining command boat and the third boat also could not withstand Ōtsuka's boat's frenzied assault, laying down a barrage of bullets and fleeing across the sea.

In the five-minute battle from 6:50 p.m. to 6:55 p.m., two enemy torpedo boats were sunk, but Ōtsuka's boat was also hit by three artillery shells and eight machine gun bullets. The incoming water increased rapidly, and Boat Commander Ōtsuka had no choice but to order "grounding and landing." Although the brave men on the boat were covered in blood, all the guns were intact. Eager to avenge themselves in the battle to come, Boat Commander Ōtsuka declared that they would unload all the guns onto the shore no matter what.

Just then, a rumble of enemy aircraft was heard overhead. Two flares were dropped, illuminating the surroundings as bright as day. In the inescapable brightness, Ōtsuka's boat was clearly visible on the sea. Then three bombs fell in succession. But fortunately, all three bombs landed in the water, merely creating three splashes. All the crew members cheered "Banzai!" Soon, all the guns were safely unloaded onto the shore.

A Record of the Midnight Bloodbath

The tragic battle of the "Army of the Sea" did not end there. Less than a week later, on February 25th, the unrepentant enemy again used fifteen or more torpedo boats and five or more aircraft to patrol the dark seas, intending to cut off the Japanese army's supply line. The battle that day began at 5:00 p.m. in Gazelle Bay.

Four motorized boats and one armed small motorized boat, with Second Lieutenant Kitasawa of the Kondō squad as the commander of the boat squadron, waited until dusk to depart secretly from the boat hideout at 〇〇 to 〇〇 in order to deliver supplies to 〇〇. On the armed boat were Sergeant Major Takeo Tomi, a seasoned veteran, and Boat Squadron Leader Second Lieutenant Kitauki, their eyes wide open, carefully watching. Behind them were Sergeant Nishizaki's Nishizaki boat, Sergeant Miyake's Miyake boat, Sergeant Nishi's Nishi boat, and Sergeant Nishi's Nishi boat. These ten brave men, full of spirit, began to sail under the command of the boat squadron leader.

Unexpectedly, shortly after departure, the engine of the Hotta boat suddenly malfunctioned. The Nishizaki boat immediately dropped a tow rope and began towing it while desperately trying to repair it. At this time, two enemy torpedo boats broke through the waves from afar and came to attack. "Damn it, reckless fools!" Boat Squadron Leader Kitasawa gritted his teeth and ordered the opening of fire. After about ten minutes of combat, the enemy boats retreated across the sea. But at 7:20 p.m., the enemy began a second attack. Two enemy torpedo boats challenged the armed small motorized boat, which was at this time towing the Hotta boat towards 〇〇. The armed boat quickly untied the tow rope and assumed a fighting stance. Believing that a preemptive strike was the key to victory, the "Army of the Sea" spat out fierce gunfire from the bow, engaging the enemy torpedo boats in close combat. Intimidated by this daring charge, the enemy boats had no intention of engaging and began to flee into the open sea, but a machine gun bullet accidentally hit the hull of the armed boat. Although the crew members worked hard to repair it in preparation for the next battle, the constant influx of seawater eventually rendered the engine inoperable. The entire crew had no choice but to jump naked into the sea, carrying the armed boat and swimming towards the shore. Relying on the infamous power of the waves, which could rise to more than three meters high, the armed boat ran aground. Boat Squadron Leader Kitasawa was forced to leave the armed boat and the Hotta boat there, leading the remaining three boats hurriedly towards 〇〇. Arriving at the destination, they saw that 〇〇 was burning fiercely under enemy fire, and with the raging waves surging, it was difficult to unload and land for a while.

Attack from Sea and Air

Turning the boats around, they unexpectedly encountered two enemy torpedo boats heading towards them, opening fire. Even more unfavorable, a Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber from the enemy forces was circling in the sky near the mouth of the 〇〇 River. Boat Squadron Leader Kitauki remained calm and arranged everything under the flare, waiting for the opportunity to annihilate the enemy. Under the light of the flares, as bright as day, they saw clearly that several torpedo boats were blocking their path. At this time, the Consolidated Liberator bomber began to drop bombs and strafe with machine guns. "Alright, shoot it down!" The first shot in the anti-aircraft battle was fired instantly. At the same time, they charged towards the three torpedo boats on the far right. The sea "bayonet charge" placed emphasis on the enemy's first boat. The intense concentrated fire did indeed destroy the first boat. Then they changed direction to attack the second boat, which immediately met the same fate as the first. The enemy's third boat, seeing this bold, self-sacrificing tactic, was frightened and quickly fled. But there was no time to breathe a sigh of relief, as two more large torpedo boats appeared. Under a desperate attack, one of them was immediately set on fire. However, the enemy's fighting spirit was also strong, especially with the assistance of the aircraft, their gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls. On the friendly number one boat, Sergeant Nishizaki's face and left thigh were wounded and covered in blood, but he continued to fight without retreating. On the number three boat, Private First Class Nishizawa and Privates First Class Shimada and Eguchi were also wounded. And Private First Class Fukada, fighting in the bloodbath, finally let out a cry and fell beside the gun.

After finally repelling the remaining large torpedo boats, three more torpedo boats blocked their path. What should they do? They neither fired artillery nor guns, they were simply silent. How strange, what were their intentions? Amidst the heavy clouds of suspicion, our boat squadron continued to advance regardless. The gloomy silence did not last long. Enemy aircraft arrived! At the same time, the enemy torpedo boat group opened fire.

At this time, misfortune befell our boat squadron. The artillery shells had been used up, and they had no choice but to respond with machine guns. Boat Squadron Leader Kitasawa continued to fire fiercely, engaging the enemy boats in close combat. The once-boiling fighting spirit would not be extinguished until the enemy forces were annihilated.

Mutual Damage

Such a difficult battle at sea continued from 11:30 p.m. on the 25th until 1:00 a.m. The fleeing enemy returned to challenge them again at 2:00 a.m. and 3:20 a.m. at dawn, engaging in a bloody showdown a total of five times. How tragic the situation of this naval battle was can be known from the following numbers. That is, our side's battle results were: one large torpedo boat caught fire and ran aground, two small torpedo boats caught fire and sank, one ran aground and caught fire, and one was damaged and caught fire (or had already sunk), for a total of six. On our side, two motorized boats sank, one ran aground, and another armed boat ran aground, and the remaining one motorized boat was damaged in eleven places, and two people were killed in action.

But the bloody battle of the "Army of the Sea" does not end there, this is what the people in the rear should know. The fierce struggles of the "Army of the Sea" will only intensify. It is feared that such tragic and intense battles will be repeated until all the American soldiers are killed. (Reporter from the 〇〇 News Team) (Translated from the May 17th "Asahi Shimbun")

### Map of the Situation on the Western Coast of France Map Explanation

The anti-Axis forces launched a European landing operation on the 6th of this month. The landing site was in the Normandy region of northwestern France. According to Churchill's announcement in the House of Commons, more than four thousand ships were used in this landing operation, with the first line consisting of 11,000 aircraft. In addition to fiercely bombing the Atlantic Fortress, the enemy also dispatched parachute troops. However, the German defense was exceptionally solid, and the anti-Axis forces were repelled everywhere except for establishing a bridgehead in the Calais area. Most of the paratroopers were also annihilated. The enemy is planning to send reinforcements to continue the attack. Below is a map of the situation in western France.

### Tears

— Sang Shen

I don't know since when, I learned to be melancholic. A sullen air, always tightly blocked in my heart, like a stone fortress, a heavy lead block pressing down, pressing down, never able to push it away... From this, I came to know loneliness, came to know tears... Those moist, cold, and never-ending tears. Just like that, flowing on my face. But I endure and dare not sob at all. How shameful and fragile it would seem for a man to shed tears! But I rely on them to vent the depression in my heart, surging like a waterfall, like waves. I am surprised that I still have so much strength!

A lonely lamp in a small room, sitting withered late at night, a silent universe, a silent me. At this time, the state of mind should be tranquil, but I am occupied by chaotic thoughts, rising and falling, restless. Not yet thirty, but I have already tasted all the troubles of the world. At this time, listening to the even breaths of my wife and children, looking at their comfortable, innocent sleeping faces, is the only bit of comfort. But behind the comfort—hides an infinite sense of desolation. In today's world of precious rice and expensive firewood, the salary income is only enough to maintain a few thin bowls of porridge, and what else can be provided to my wife and children for coveted enjoyment? Thinking of this, I cannot help but feel dejected.

When I graduated from university three years ago, the admonition of an old professor echoed in my ears again: "Your future is vast. I hope that each of you will be like a strong and healthy steed, galloping on a vast plain, roaring freely, living an ideal and successful life..." We young group listened attentively, encouraged by his exciting tone, holding our breath, not daring to breathe, each with a string of shining hopes in front of us, our faces full of smiles. But then the old professor said faintly in a somber tone: "But I warn you, the first thing, and only one thing; never get married too early... Alas, marriage is the most damaging thing to one's ambition, it is like a horse being hitched to a carriage, bound and restricted, reducing the speed of progress—then you will be seen to lag behind on the road of life... Haha, that's the most helpless thing, you know?" The old professor took a breath, and that sincere and aged attitude I still cannot forget, but at the time we all thought this was superfluous, a snake-like concern. Because what hung before us were piles of dazzling and impractical ideals!

But I left school, stepped into society, once ran around in panic from unemployment, then got married, then had children... In a hasty three years, I am already the father of two children, a family of four, struggling to live under the skyrocketing prices. The hardship is indescribable. And I, shouldering the heavy burden of life for four people, have tasted all the joys and sorrows of the world. I have to rush to write manuscripts at night in addition to my daytime work, but the result of working all day to make a living still feels like I can't make ends meet. Now, using me as an example of a horse pulling a cart is still not enough to describe it, it's simply a cow dragging a grinding stone. "Working like a horse and cow for children and grandchildren," my sigh does not contain resentment for being reduced to the hardship of a cow and horse. On the contrary, it is because I am so busy like a cow and horse, and still not enough to support my wife and children, that I really feel guilty inside. Usually, when I see their innocent smiles, their babbling cries, their naive little movements... these are interesting and pleasant materials for family life, but when I think of these things alone in a quiet place, I can't help but shed tears. What is the responsibility of a father? How can I make them more comfortable? These fruitless questions turn into countless small caterpillars, gnawing at my heart, and so I sob even more!

On a pitch-black night, sometimes I suddenly wake up from my bed, all sounds are silent, I only feel my tears, rolling like pearls, slipping on the pillow with a rustling sound. I wonder if there are so many tears; at this time, all worries are silent, and I feel the loneliness of the world, so I think of friends—why don't you have friends?

My wife often asks me with a reproachful tone, but behind the words, I have long guessed, blaming me for being reserved and not making a few rich friends, not willing to curry favor and follow worldly customs. In recent years, the opportunity to make a fortune has been as easy as turning one's hand, but I stubbornly refuse to speculate and hoard, and at the same time, I don't have the assistance of friends who can make connections, so that I am still a poor and shabby scholar. I am willing to silently endure my wife's ridicule. Since her intuitive concepts are already like this, it is futile to try to persuade her with empty words and lofty principles. And thinking of her hard work during the day for housework and caring for the children, venting her complaints to me is also out of a kind of helplessness. But because of this, I feel even more lonely on the road of life, even the person in the same bed is dreaming different dreams. How much more is it the case with strangers? And so my tears, one by one, drop by drop, flow, flow... At this time, the only comforter is these tears, right?

### Talking About How to Be a Person

— Hu Shengquan

××, what words are appropriate for me to say to you? When we are in almost the same situation, and cannot calm our minds. I feel that explaining myself to you, or using a letter as a talisman to heal your "ennui," are both difficult things to do. Think about it, you barged into my life, it doesn't seem like a short time. I dare boldly assert that many of your habits were developed under my influence; if we fussed over these things, wouldn't it be too foolish? But you have been away from me for almost half a year, and in this half year, I have been tormented by the hardships of life for the first time. This torment has changed my thoughts and temper, often making me angrily helpless. Especially when I receive your letters, full of despairing words, it makes me feel injustice! Where do you get so much hatred, so many tears, so much pity? You have to think about my situation, if you are not willing to think of the larger and broader group of people suffering in every corner of the world.

If my words cause your aversion, then I have to cry! Who else in this world understands me even a little bit? This is what you know, I've lived for more than twenty years. I only recognized poverty last year. At first, its ferocious appearance frightened me so much that I didn't have the courage to struggle on this rugged path of life anymore. I compared myself to a drowning man from a wrecked ship. In the turbulent sea, what could I rely on to get life again? Later, I pinned my future on another kind of hope. I grabbed a lifebuoy. I tied up my heart that had been hurt by worries, and since then, I didn't think about myself very much. I felt that I should blame my own confusion: trying to ride a broken ship and brave the wind and waves? I flicked away the tears and smiled: You know some of my actual situation, and someone as sensitive as you will completely pity me. Several times in restaurants I pressed my hand on my pocket and couldn't pay the bill; close your eyes and think, how did I force a smile, how did I stammer with my friends, watching them take out their money while my face flushed red... You know I am not a very stingy person, why would I become like this? This is worth my deep consideration, worth my descendants' deep consideration. In a word: A person who only plans for himself will one day perish, this world does not allow you to live comfortably and take care of yourself!

××, I sympathize with this saying, a person without a mother is forever living in a winter without sunshine. But why do you hate society so much? You say you are clear water, and can never mix with oil stains. I feel that you are not extreme enough, you still cannot scientifically grasp the social problems of the current stage. Why don't you go a step further and say: you are alcohol, washing the oil stains clean, isn't this more courageous and meaningful?

You now live in a small country town. Although leaving the house full of siblings makes you miss them, working in the store as a "young master" probably makes life quite comfortable. What else do you want? You should be satisfied, knowing that no one's life is perfect, especially in this time of suffering. This is your problem, and also my problem, indulging in our own ideals and hating the reality of the environment, resulting in endless troubles. These troubles do not help our actual shortcomings, but make our emotions very fragile, what is the point? Now we should earnestly be people, train ourselves and strengthen ourselves through the hardships of life...

### Traveler's Song

— Yu Huairui

Shouldering a heavy bag,

Stepping on the vast journey ahead.

Perilous and odd peaks soar into the clouds,

Thorns in the mustard field are like swords and blades.

Turbulent waves surpass mountain collapses,

Can the scorching sun and lake wind be forgiving?

Sometimes missing the lodgings,

The hand of darkness manipulates the dryness,

Torrential rain is as thick as giant ropes,

This situation is even more difficult.

However, a drop of water cannot compete with the ocean,

How can a bit of hardship stand up to endless joy?

Months accumulate into seasons, and seasons change into years,

I do not have a trace of hesitation or wandering.

A heavy bag cannot suppress the pounding of my heart,

How can a long road hinder my great ambitions!

In the journey of the past twenty-four years,

I have seen...

The majestic grandeur of the Himalayas,

The ever-changing state of the Pacific Ocean,

The Great Wall is as vast as a million warriors,

The wonder of the sunrise on Mount Tai is even more praised by everyone!

This is a heavenly book bestowed by nature,

More beautiful scenery is waiting to be discovered.

Look! The road keeps retreating under my feet,

How can I not sing with joy and elation!

### Puppet

— Zhiming

This exquisitely carved puppet, seemingly born of nature itself, stands on my desk, trying its best to look at me, looking... unmoving, gazing without blinking... its round, snow-white face is offering me a smile! The dimples on its cheeks that never quite fade are also fully revealed before me, ah! Its smile is charming, its bearing is full, beautiful, lovely, is...

It also has golden hair, a snow-white tender face, jet-black pupils, slightly red lips, a pink dress, light green socks, shiny leather shoes... truly a young woman of the new era.

It stares blankly at me, and I stare dazedly back at it, this meeting of eyes intertwining like an electric current! Ah! Its character, lofty aspirations, agile movements, profound thoughts: it is a good youth, a good citizen, a good national. Besides all this, it also has one strength, which is also its weakness, and that is—self-effacement. Self-effacement is indeed a desirable trait in a young person, but too much self-effacement is also a weakness for a young person.

"Cai, excessive self-effacement can cause wounds in friendship!" I often told him this.

Now it has left this world! Although its body still rests peacefully beneath the earth, its soul is separated from us!

It has been three years since we last met, a full three years! This living separation and death brings back memories, enough to cause pain! Then, since it is so painful, let's forget about it, let's not remember it anymore! But even though I say this, its image continues to appear in my mind, appearing...

Film Review

### "Mandarin Ducks After the Calamity"

— Gu Xin

...Zhang Jing, who played Li Shishi in "Yan Qing and Li Shishi," was unable to fully display her talents due to the limitations of the script; "Mandarin Ducks After the Calamity" gave Miao more opportunities to act. Tao Yinghua is a tragic woman, falling from the niece of a wealthy merchant to a prostitute, going through several stages in between. Zhang Jing's acting has achieved very good results. The most successful part is the inner performance. When Yinghua is at her wit's end and contemplates suicide on the bridge, the expression of despair and pain intertwined is truly moving, especially when the director uses fantastical sounds to depict her inner voice, just as she is about to jump into the water, a sudden thought flashes through her mind.

...Xu Ting, who played Yinghua's uncle, was not as successful as he was in "Blood Splattered Hibiscus," where he played the leader of the private soil traffickers. The personalities of these two characters are very different, one is insidious, while the other is merely fatuous and stern. Xu Cong's acting has more sternness than necessary, and not enough fatuity. Pu Ke's student looks a bit old in appearance. The stepmother is too artificial. There is also an unimportant fat maid who, besides being over the top, seems to know how to act.

...It is necessary to mention Zhang Yi. He was the male lead in "Yan Qing and Li Shishi," but here he plays a despicable vagrant. Although there are only a few scenes, his expression is realistic. Zhang Yi is more to be expected if he is nurtured by an excellent director.

...The story is indeed not worthy of high praise. The ending, which forces a reunion between father and son, is not only undesirable but simply destroys the mood and unity of the entire play. It is also too coincidental that so many misfortunes are concentrated on Yinghua alone. However, speaking in fragments, it does partially reflect a claw of the reality of society. Here, there is human selfishness and private gain, taking advantage of disasters, and the evil forces of various lines and doors are fully exposed. There is also the reason why all kinds of deputy people are heading towards "lowliness." - Although the playwright's portrayal is obviously not deep enough. If this film is still worth watching, this should be a very important point. The music is well-matched. The shots are not lively. The dubbing is still terrible!

### Our Newspaper's Scholarship Fundraiser, Charity Football Match Held Today, Overseas Chinese Team Invited to Fight Donghua, All Sectors of Society Enthusiastically Sponsor

— Mei Bixian

The charity football and basketball games for the scholarship fund for our newspaper's readers, after more than a month of planning and through President Chen's liaising with various parties, are now all in order. The football match will be held at 5:30 pm today at the racecourse on Huangpi Road.

All Sectors Enthusiastically Sponsor

For today's charity game, Mr. Zhou Jiaqi of the Football Federation is invited to be the commander-in-chief, and Shen Huichun assists in all matters. Furthermore, Mr. Shen Siliang, Pan Sanxing, Tan Jing, Tong Wenrui, and other gentlemen, as well as all related parties, have all made every effort to sponsor, enabling the smooth progress. Men and women from all walks of life have also enthusiastically purchased tickets and participated. Benefiting impoverished students, our newspaper expresses its infinite gratitude.

Celebrities Kick-Off and Award Prizes

The opposing teams for today are the ever-victorious Chinese Donghua team and the Overseas Chinese team, which has been transformed into a righteousness-espousing team. The latter took advantage of the opportunity before the Tianjin team returned north and temporarily invited four generals to help in the battle, greatly increasing its strength. It is expected that there will be a shocking battle. Today's game tickets cost 200 yuan for the public grandstand. The honor tickets in the venue are divided into three types: 2,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan. All enter the venue through the gate of the racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road. At that time, Mr. Lin Kanghou will be invited to perform the opening kick-off ceremony, and Miss Li Xiangguan, a star from Man Ying Film, will present the awards. Our newspaper has specially prepared two large silver shields to present to the two teams participating in the competition as souvenirs. All proceeds from today's ticket sales will be used to fund our newspaper's scholarship fund for readers, contributing every bit to the public good. All expenses will be paid separately by our newspaper. Therefore, this charity game is expected to merge football fans and movie fans into one event, and everyone will compete to be the first to attend, creating an unprecedented grand occasion. After all, one can both enjoy the ultimate football game and catch a glimpse of the real face of a movie star, and also contribute to helping impoverished students, achieving three gains in one fell swoop. Why wouldn't people be happy to go?

Donghua's Morale is High, Striving to Maintain Victory

Examining the recent situation of the Donghua team, it is felt that their offense has a path and their defense has a technique, getting better and better. The recent victory over the Tianjin team with a score of three to zero is even more brilliant. All the soldiers are at their peak. What is most worth mentioning is that the three veterans, Dai Linjing, Liang Shutang, and Zhuang Youren, once showed signs of aging, but recently, not only have they gradually recovered, but they also have the spirit of their past glory. According to what the reporter has learned, the team practices twice a week, and this phenomenon is by no means accidental. They will still use their best lineup to face today's battle, and they should have a winning situation. However, in military affairs, there must be no pride or laziness, so there will be no abnormal performance. Moreover, today the Overseas Chinese team is trying a new lineup, with generals helping in the battle both in the front and the back, creating a rather unpredictable style of play. Examining the lineup they have announced and exploring their intentions, nothing is beyond the following: Dare to offer humble opinions before Donghua.

Their defense abandons Mai Qidi and uses Tianjin's Jiang Dou and others, because Jiang is full of energy and can block Li Yao's activity and stick to Sun Jinshun to the death, and can also use his spare time to help the left guard's lack, so as to hold Han Longhai's fierce rushes. In the previous two wars, there were indeed successes. Therefore, in my humble opinion, Donghua should know this and find a way to break it. The only way is to still use Xiao Han's fierce rushes. However, Xiao Han's rush should focus on blocking and covering the opponent's defenders, so that A Dai, Jinshun, and Li Yao can all take the opportunity to contribute. The adjustment of their midfield line is not ideal. The most obvious is the use of Tianjin's general, Bonini, as the left midfielder, which is to curb the attack of Longhai and Youliang. However, with Youliang's skills and Xiao Han's run, it may not be poisoned by it. As for their forward line, reading the list and discussing their individual skills, they are all above the standard. However, it is impossible to speculate on how their contact is. In short, the two needles on the left and right, Bao Jie and Yatomari, can call forward and respond backward, serving as the blood vessels for the attack. The two wings are still reasonably ideal. The use of Otoniro as the main center forward is definitely intended to contain old Tan, or even come back to nail old Tan, intending to destroy Donghua's midfield line and seek a central breakthrough. Therefore, old Tan should know the enemy's plan, not be calculated by them, otherwise they will be in vain. If Donghua can maintain its normal state, then the ever-victorious army will sing a triumphant song steadily, what is there to fear?

The Overseas Chinese Team is Approaching to Help, Making People Fear

The Overseas Chinese team has been twice defeated by the Chinese team and is unwilling to give up. Just in time, our newspaper invited them to participate in the war, and we were also delighted to meet the good relationship of Tianjin's team staying in Shanghai, so we invited four righteous generals from Tianjin to join, aiming for a victory to express this accumulated resentment. The new lineup announced for today's war, especially the hardness of the front line, makes people fear. Center forward Otoniro, a veteran of the central defender, is quick on his feet and fierce on his head. Today, he will definitely try to launch a cold arrow, and Bang Lun should pay attention. The two forwards on his left flank belong to the same team in Tianjin and have good connections. They will definitely have a wonderful performance, which will pose a major threat to Donghua's Zhang Linggen and Zhuang Youren.

In short, Donghua may not be able to win easily in today's battle and must go through a bloody battle and work hard on strategy. Therefore, the excitement of the game can be predicted.

### Three Basketball Games Held on the 12th, 14th, and 16th

The charity basketball game has already contacted the Zhongqing to fight against the Xiqing, adopting a three-game two-win system. It is scheduled to be held on the 12th, 14th, and 16th of this month, at 7:30 pm at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA Gymnasium. According to Zhongqing, the elites of the Hualian, Yaoren, and Yushan teams are gathered together, and Zhang Yuixiang and Yu Xunshi are doing their best to train them. Their performance level is beyond the past, there can be no objection. The Xiqing is also a mixed army of the giant Monok, with many tricks and novel tactics. Therefore, the three dragon-tiger fights will definitely add a lot of brilliance to our newspaper's scholarship fund charity game. It is truly the only good show after the basketball season, and also the feast for the eyes of fans, and indirectly the good fortune of impoverished students.

### Tianjin Team's Strength, Defense is Far Better Than Offense, Mission Announced, All Will Soon Return North

The Tianjin team came to Shanghai for four battles and finished all of them yesterday after fighting the Shanghai West team. The first battle with the Shanghai United team, this magazine has reviewed its process in the last issue. Now, let's review the last three battles to send off the Tianjin team.

Second Battle: Lost to Donghua

In this battle, the Tianjin team passed the ever-victorious Donghua team. Although the inner guards tried their best to resist, they were finally rushed into the hinterland by Donghua with a small pass. In the second half, the iron leg's shot near the door, Tal Douka could not resist either. Therefore, the Tianjin team's failure in this battle, in terms of defense, can be said to have done its duty. As for the offensive aspect, the reason why it failed to break through Donghua's door is the following two reasons. This is a fact recognized by most people: 1. The Tianjin team's forward line is too scattered. When attacking, the two inner forwards are too behind, so the Donghua defense line rarely suffers threats. 2. The Tianjin team's personnel changes are too many, especially in the second half, most of the time is spent on the frequent mobilization of reserve members, which is amazing. Therefore, it is naturally difficult to seek a pure and sharp offensive.

As for the three goals lost in this battle by the Tianjin team, the first goal was that the wind helped Donghua to seize the lead, which greatly increased morale. The second goal, A Dai's one dial, and the third goal, Lao Sun's close-range shot, were both incurable. In this battle, Tianjin only had defense and no offense, and it was unlikely that it would not lose.

Third Battle: First Victory over Lianyi

In this battle, the Tianjin team took advantage of Lianyi's lack of endurance in the second half, with Bonini and Bo Tailitini each contributing a goal, and then achieved the first victory. But on the other hand, Lianyi's ball luck was extremely bad, coupled with Tal Douka's high catches and blocks, the Tianjin team's slight gain in face was entirely due to Lianyi's defeat. Some commentators said that if Lianyi did not withdraw from the Lianxiang and practiced more often, the Tianjin team might not be able to win.

As for Lyepan Bies's appearance in the second half, it made the Tianjin team's offensive stronger. If they still used the method of mobilizing the forwards in the previous two games, they could only draw at most. Therefore, under the two principles of the Tianjin team not adjusting personnel and the opponent not having endurance, slightly comforting the courage and spirit of the soldiers, they can use the victory of tactics.

Fourth Battle: Another Draw with the West Team

Yesterday, in the last battle with the West team, both sides were calm and the atmosphere in the stadium was very relaxed. As a result, the Tianjin team relied on A. Corasha's foul, and Yatomari penalized a twelve-yard ball, and then drew with the West team again with one goal each. The Tianjin team's offensive in this battle was still not as strong as the West team's. The reason for not losing is that the West team lacked tacit understanding and did not appear with an ideal lineup, so both sides came and went, and there was nothing worth seeing.

Looking at the Tianjin team's strength, defense is better than offense, which can be clearly seen in the four games. This time, the forward soul Qiao Xiang was not there, and the offensive was naturally greatly reduced. What is most impressive is the defensive line of the goalkeeper and the inner guards.

The Tianjin team will return north tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. This trip is still worthwhile. They defeated Lianyi but lost to Donghua, and drew with Shanghai and West, which is very average. This trip is gone, and I hope to come again in the future, with significant progress in tactics, so that fans here will have deep expectations.

### Simple Fitness Training Method (10) (9)

— Written by Tom, Translated by Yide

33. Forward and Backward Bending

Stand upright. Put your hands on your hips. Expand your chest. Contract your hips and abdomen backward, and slowly bend your body downward, the lower the better, until the muscles behind your calves are extremely tense. Do not lower your head to avoid excessive blood flow to the brain. Do not bend your knees.

Slowly raise your body back to its original position, then lean backward and bend your knees to avoid excessive tension and injury. Maintain your balance, even if your heels leave the ground.

After you are familiar with the above posture (just a few practice sessions are enough), you can raise your hands over your head instead of putting them on your hips, so that your chest and abdomen are raised. Swing your arms backward over your head, and your body also leans backward, with your knees slightly bent. Then lean forward, with your center of gravity on your feet, without bending your knees, and try to touch the ground with your fingertips. Note how far your fingers are from the ground at the beginning of practice, and gradually your fingertips can touch the ground.
