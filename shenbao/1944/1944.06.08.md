### Social Undertakings

Social undertakings differ from national undertakings. National undertakings are organized by the nation and use national public funds. Social undertakings differ from private undertakings. Private undertakings are managed by private individuals and use private money. The economic source of social undertakings comes purely from private donations in society, so they are not national undertakings. The organization and management of social undertakings are jointly cooperated by people in society, so they are not private undertakings either. Recently, a very strong atmosphere of advocating construction has emerged in Shanghai society. This is a manifestation of human mutual assistance and a beginning of Shanghai people caring about Shanghai local affairs. Since the war, all social undertakings in Shanghai have either been destroyed or stalled. We hope that from now on, we can revive those that have been destroyed, restart those that have been stalled, and, even more, create those that could not have been done in the past. Only in this way can Shanghai people be worthy of Shanghai, and only then can Shanghai be a model for the whole country.

The importance of social undertakings need not be emphasized. However, the main principle of social undertakings lies in permanent continuation. Society is a permanently continuing organism, and social undertakings should also provide continuous service to society. But to enable social undertakings to continue permanently, they need continuous assistance from people in society. To enable people in society to continuously assist, then social undertakings themselves must first demonstrate good results. We dare say that although there are many reasons why social undertakings in Shanghai could not be permanent in the past, most of them were due to poor results, which led to a lack of assistance from society. The reasons why social undertakings are not run well are nothing more than two points: one is organization, and the other is management. We advocate that current social undertakings should have a sound central organization and be managed by experts.

The center of any undertaking is in the highest organization. With a sound organization, strong power can be generated. Social undertakings completely rely on the enthusiasm of the public, so the highest organization is extremely important. The personality and morality of the organizers have always been noticed by the general public. The academic knowledge and talents of the organizers are even more proportional to the progress of the undertaking itself. We believe that the role of the central organization lies in legislation and supervision. Legislation requires knowledge, and supervision requires morality. Within this central organization, at least one or two people should concentrate and cooperate with all parties to study the direction of the social undertaking. Once the direction is set, it should not be changed again, and it should be entrusted to experts for execution and management. The central organization itself should stand in a supervisory position and pay attention at all times.

The specialization of undertakings has become a general principle. The nature of social undertakings is different, including relief, agricultural production, industrial and commercial production, and education. Different types of social undertakings require different experts to preside over them. Presiding over a social undertaking is a matter of business, not a matter of politics. It only requires doing things practically and realistically, without needing to deal with all aspects. In the past, the heads of general social undertakings often forgot their duties, perhaps because their duties were not defined. They often ran around in all directions, which delayed internal work. This is the most unacceptable thing. Social undertakings need expert management, full-time positions, not concurrent positions; they need to concentrate all their energy on doing things, not just superficially going through the motions. The results of the undertaking can guarantee the permanent existence of the undertaking. An undertaking without results cannot exist permanently and cannot obtain permanent support from people in society.

The above two points are the foundation for the progress of social undertakings. We hope that all gentlemen who are enthusiastic about social undertakings will pay attention and give guidance.

### The Japanese Army Launched a General Offensive on the West Bank of the Nu River; Paratroopers Landing at Monyin Have Been Annihilated

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese army base on the Nu River front reports that the Chongqing army attacking the Nu River west bank is currently relying solely on air transport to maintain its survival. In order to annihilate them, powerful Japanese units have launched a general offensive. Since the 5th, a part of the Japanese army has been rapidly pursuing the Chongqing 130th Division and is currently advancing towards Yahaosi and the 5186 highland. Another part is holding back Hongmushu and attacking Changpo to put heavy pressure on the Chongqing army. Before the general offensive, the Japanese army first inflicted heavy damage on the Chongqing army attacking the front of Lengshui Gou on the 3rd. In this battle, the Chongqing army abandoned 145 corpses, and many people, including a regimental commander, were wounded. Another Japanese unit also annihilated the Chongqing army near Zhangjiao. Therefore, the Chongqing army's plan to report back to northern Myanmar has been shattered. Under the fierce attack of the Japanese army, and with supply lines cut off, they have fallen into a dilemma.

They retreated to the northern forest area. The Reuters reporter explained the battle situation, saying that the paratroopers in that area, commanded by Brigadier General Lymington, consisted of Gurkha and British troops. They were surrounded and attacked by powerful Japanese units and were unable to resist. On the 27th, the Japanese infantry broke in at close quarters and occupied the airfield. As a result, the enemy's supply line was cut off, and they had to withdraw from their positions.

### Sinking an Enemy Submarine: Horie Talks About the Experience

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a Fukuoka dispatch, Japanese Sergeant Horie of the Army, who had previously been active in the southern theater, returned to Fukuoka Prefecture by plane on the afternoon of the 6th. He talked about his experience of sinking a submarine, saying that he went to the Menado area on a certain day in April to take on the task of escorting a convoy. While searching for enemy troops in that sea area, he suddenly saw an enemy shadow on the white sea surface. Upon closer inspection, it was an enemy American submarine. At that time, our convoy was sailing, and the enemy submarine was planning to carry out a torpedo attack. At this critical moment, he quickly changed direction and launched a fierce attack on the enemy submarine. In an instant, water splashed into the sky, forming two water columns. Two of the bombs hit the target, and the enemy submarine gradually sank to the bottom of the sea. He flew to a height of 500 meters to observe the sea surface and saw heavy oil covering the sea. He then knew that the enemy submarine had indeed been sunk. After completing the mission, he continued to protect the convoy forward.

### The Agricultural and Forestry Department Sends Personnel to Inspect Various Field Areas; Improvement Opinions Have Been Drafted

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - The field areas affiliated to the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in addition to the Pangshan Lake Experimental Farm jointly operated with the Ministry of Construction, include one cotton test field, one hemp test field, three cotton seed farms, two rice and wheat seed farms, one cultivated land crop seed propagation farm, twelve forestry and land reclamation demonstration farms, six seedling nurseries, one sericulture test field, two sericulture improvement experimental areas, and thirty-one agricultural improvement experimental areas. The purpose of their establishment is either to carry out experimental work and cultivate original seeds, or to propagate seedlings and serve as a demonstration for cultivation, and their mission to increase production is extremely important. In view of this year being a year of increased production, the department urgently needs to seek improvement in a timely manner, so it sent Deputy Director Guo Qianzhi, Director of the Agricultural Department Deng Zongwen, and others to inspect the various field areas separately. After the personnel departed and arrived at various places, in addition to providing timely instructions on the promotion of work, they have now returned to the department one after another and prepared reports. The comprehensive understanding of all improvement opinions is as follows: Enrich technical personnel. Expand necessary agricultural machinery and equipment. Apply excellent technology, propagate excellent seeds and seedlings as much as possible, and demonstrate cultivation. Train and guide nearby farmers, universally improve agriculture, and strive to increase production. Investigate the economic situation of rural areas to facilitate financial regulation. Guide the organization of production mutual aid societies, jointly operate, and promote the speed of increased production.

Adjustment of Experimental Areas

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - In order to understand the working conditions of the agricultural organs, and promote the implementation of production increase program, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will convene a meeting on the 9th of this month, comprised of all agricultural organs. In the morning of the 9th, all the areas will report on their progress, and in the afternoon they will hold discussions to address the increase in production. Further, after taking control over the Ministry of Food affiliated Agriculture Improvement Experimental Zone, besides the collaboration with Jiangning county, there are a total of (31) areas, and the provinces and cities also have locations where rice and wheat grow well. The organization of the Agricultural Improvement Experimental Zone is repetitive, and the scheme is inconsistent. With limitations to the personnel and the capital, the events are greatly restricted. In order to concentrate on resources, enhance the organizations, and strengthen their functionality, the original Agriculture Improvement Experimental Zones will be consolidated into 10 areas. The other areas that are difficult to reach due to poor transportation, security issues, and provinces that do not have an agricultural improvement zone will be shut down. This measure will come into effect immediately. The ones that will stay are: Yanshi Ji, Wuxi, Changshu, Jiangdu, Taixian, Jiaxing, Kangxian, Dangtu, Chuxian, Beiqiao, these ten areas. The ones that will be shut down are: Shangxinhe, Jiangningzhen, Longtan, Liuhe, Xiashu, Wuhu, Mingguang, Wuxian, Kunshan, Taicang, Songjiang, Jiading, Fengxian, Nanhui, Fengjing, Haining, Zhenjiang, Pinghu, Danyang, Wujin. Kunshan special seed plantation will also be shut down, and another area will be assigned for this task. For the collaboration zone in Jiangning county, the county will be in charge by itself starting from June, with no financial aid from the government.

### Vietnamese Overseas Chinese Cooperate in the Greater East Asia War

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - The National Government's Commercial Representative to Vietnam, Zhang Yongfu, returned to the country to report on his work. The reporter interviewed Mr. Zhang to understand the work of overseas Chinese affairs in Vietnam. Mr. Zhang replied as follows: How is the work of overseas Chinese affairs in various parts of Vietnam? How do overseas Chinese promote cooperation with the motherland and complete the Greater East Asia War together? (Answer) After the fall of Hong Kong, Allied forces entered Vietnam, and overseas Chinese still had strong old views on the Chongqing side. When I first arrived, I had to break this situation. Last year, I was appointed as the Commercial Representative to Vietnam. Overseas Chinese realized that resistance was not a plan, and their understanding of the peace movement deepened. The work of overseas Chinese affairs was able to be actively promoted. After the National Government declared war, support associations for the war were established in Cochinchina, Tonkin, Annam, and Dongpu Village in Vietnam. They contributed a lot to the Greater East Asia War. How is the education of overseas Chinese different from the education in the motherland? (Answer) Wherever overseas Chinese go, there are schools in villages with one or two hundred households. Slightly larger commercial ports have junior high schools and normal schools. In foreign language schools established by foreigners, the number of overseas Chinese who receive education also exceeds the number of foreigners. About eight out of ten people receive education. The education of overseas Chinese is very developed. There are more than 600,000 overseas Chinese in Vietnam and more than 600 overseas Chinese schools. Recently, the Allies have also established co-prosperity societies in various cities to run schools and cultural propaganda institutions, which greatly help the education of our overseas Chinese.

Attendees fully expressed their opinions on increasing supply and reducing demand. Finally, many important cases were decided, the most important of which were: Stipulating rice prices based on the purchase price in rural areas plus legal profits. Canceling restrictions, allowing free transportation within the borders of Wuxian County. The Provincial Government strictly orders its subordinates to prohibit the smuggling of rice out of the country. Strictly investigate and prohibit unscrupulous police from deliberately violating the ban, arbitrarily blocking and extorting money at the city gates and various transportation hubs, etc.

Hangzhou Rice Prices Gradually Decline

Hangzhou, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Preparatory Committee of the Hangzhou Area Rice Procurement Industry Association of the Rice Control Association, fearing a food shortage in Hangzhou, urgently needed relief. In accordance with the regulations of the Rice Control Association, it procured 5,000 shi of rice in Xiashi and transported it all to Hangzhou in late April, handing it over to the Zhejiang Provincial Government for distribution by the Food Bureau. According to the stipulated price of 1,150 yuan per shi, distribution began on May 9. A total of 1,400 shi of rice was distributed to civil servants and 3,600 shi to citizens, which has been completed and concluded. Therefore, rice prices in Hangzhou are gradually declining. It is now learned that the Provincial Government and the association are continuing to find ways to procure rice to resist [high prices].

### Recent Trade Between Hong Kong and Guangdong

Guangzhou, 7th (Central News Agency) - The economic situation in South China and Hong Kong, centered on Guangzhou, has become increasingly characterized by the integration of economy and politics since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and can also overcome various difficulties caused by the war and develop forward. The current situation in various places is introduced as follows: In Hong Kong, two and a half years after being occupied by the Japanese army, its economic dynamics have become active due to the development of trade and shipbuilding. Hong Kong's port terminals and warehouses have fully exerted their functions, taking on the trade of Central China, Guangdong, Xiamen, Shantou, Hainan Island, and the Philippines, as well as the exchange of materials between Japan, Taiwan, Syonan, Vietnam, Thailand, and other regions in Southeast Asia. Among them, trade with Guangdong is even more prosperous. Transportation, which has always been by sea, has also been completed by land after the full opening of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway on December 28 last year. In addition, the trade agreement between Guangdong and Hong Kong for this year, decided on March 25, has stipulated the mutual export amount between Hong Kong and Guangdong. The export amount of Guangdong is 6 million yuan, and the export amount of Hong Kong is 18 million yuan. In addition, coastal trade is carried out using sailing ships. Excellent shipyards in Hong Kong and Yangon continue to put mechanical sailing ships into the water, and recently, large wooden ships of thousands of tons have begun construction. At the same time, in order to cooperate with shipbuilding in various southern regions, the Hong Kong Governor's Office and the Southern Military Administration Department have also stipulated the supply of shipbuilding workers to various places. In addition to shipbuilding, other industries in Hong Kong, such as sugar, tobacco, Manila rope, cement, oxygen, manufacturing, seasonings, beer, soft drinks, dyes, etc., have also made considerable progress. The raw materials are imported from Guangdong, Myanmar, and other places, and then exported to various places after being manufactured. Therefore, Hong Kong can also be called a material supply base. In Guangdong, handicrafts account for the main part of the economy, and its exports mainly include mats, native cloth, bamboo and rattan, and delicate work. There is no production of mechanical industry. At present, the total number of factories in Guangdong is 4,610, of which 4,300 are operated by Chinese and 300 are operated by Japanese. However, due to the progress of the war, the shortage of ships, and changes in the export market, its operations are becoming increasingly unstable. In order to solve this situation, the Guangdong Provincial Government is also working hard to rectify Chinese factories in accordance with the Japanese policy of consolidation, merger, reorganization, and suspension of operations. Since the establishment of the Guangdong Branch of the National Commercial Control Federation on April 8, the Chinese economic community has gradually moved towards a controlled approach. In order to prepare for the implementation of the highest price system for important materials, and to further implement the investigation of the goods in stock in Guangzhou, a Materials Investigation Committee has been established, with the provincial governor serving as the chairman, in order to thoroughly promote the meeting. In addition, in terms of finance, the Japanese Bank has stipulated a savings withdrawal system for emergency periods and abolished the repeated taxation system for the export of materials by the Guangdong Customs, using a one-time system for transit taxes. On Hainan Island, the most noteworthy issues are the rich iron ore deposits, the equipment for transportation on the island, and the increase in food production. These problems have been solved due to the appropriate implementation of policies, and the security of the island is also improving day by day, so they are all worthy of attention.

### Dr. Goebbels Discusses the Invasion of Europe; Germany Awaits the Enemy's Tragic Results

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels stated on the 6th regarding the Allied landing operation on the north coast of France: We will immediately annihilate the thugs who kill German women. We Germans all have such determination. The result of this operation will shock the proud American and British people. In the end, the British and Americans will know the falsehood of their national propaganda and feel great terror. The enemy chose a distant date to start the war. Today is the day for them to relive the tragedy of Dunkirk four years ago. We are only waiting for the enemy's tragic results. Whether the enemy only intends to feign an attack or truly intends to carry out a large-scale invasion operation will be evaluated based on future developments.

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - A German Foreign Ministry spokesperson said: No one can know when the invasion of Europe launched last night will reach its climax, but its favorable outcome for Germany has long been a foregone conclusion. The Germans are satisfied that the British and Americans have finally begun their attempt to invade Europe. The Germans have been waiting for this for a long time, and now, under Stalin's pressure, the invasion has been realized. President Roosevelt also needs the success of the invasion to help his election campaign. The spokesperson pointed out the prelude to the invasion, saying that in the past few months, the nerve war against Germany and all of Europe and the terrorist attacks against Europe were attempts to defeat the morale of Europe, but the enemy failed to soften the Germans. The Germans are even more determined today to settle old scores with the enemy. At present, weapons come first, and diplomats and politicians should remain silent.

### The Ministry of Finance Decides to Strictly Supervise and Inspect Financial Institutions in Shanghai; Those with Improper Management Will Be Punished Separately

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the establishment of financial institutions, the reporter previously interviewed the authorities of the Ministry of Finance, who provided detailed information, which was published in various newspapers on June 1. Now, the supervision and inspection of existing financial institutions is related to the financial industry itself and the social economy, so I have visited again. The information I have been told is summarized as follows: The Ministry is responsible for supervising and guiding financial institutions. In order to promote convenience and thoroughness, it has entrusted the Central Reserve Bank to set up an Inspection Office for Financial Affairs, which specializes in inspecting the business of financial institutions. Since its establishment, the office has been diligent in its work and has achieved great results. Recently, fearing that financial institutions in Shanghai may be fueling hoarding, and wanting to understand their assets, liabilities, and business conditions, the Ministry ordered the office to conduct inspections. The office has now reported to the Ministry the inspections that ended from March 3 to April 25 this year. All financial institutions with improper management have been punished separately. Among them, the eight institutions that were fined for evading deposit reserve requirements with false statements are Baosheng Bank, Shende Qianzhuang, Lisheng Trust Company, Guangzhong Bank, China Cloth Industry Commercial Savings Bank, Xinkang Qianzhuang, and Zhengda Qianzhuang. The six institutions that were warned for excessive lending, failure to report deposits, poor business policies, and improper measures are Shende Qianzhuang, Daxia Bank, Minsheng Bank, Lisheng Trust Company, and Zhongmao Bank. The one institution that was suspended from business for unauthorized re-pledging of collateral, acting as a guarantor for customers out of personal interest, and dereliction of duty by the general manager and directors is China Cloth Industry Commercial Savings Bank. The one institution that was suspended from operating the savings and trust departments for investing capital in businesses other than finance is Guangzhong Bank. After these punishments, the financial institutions should be more vigilant in their business operations. If they still knowingly violate the regulations, they should be severely punished once the inspection has evidence.

### Landing Point on the West Coast of France; War Expanding; Bridgehead Established Near Caen

Berlin, July 7 (Central News Agency) – German authorities claim that as of the afternoon of the 6th, anti-Axis forces had only formed a bridgehead of one and a half kilometers near Caen.

Berlin, July 7 (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: Military authorities here revealed this morning that a full-scale fierce battle is underway on the northwest coast of France. Enemy forces between Carentan and Bayeux (the area protruding into the English Channel in northwestern France) have been forced to retreat. Enemy forces that have landed in the Orne River estuary war zone have been blocked, but under strong artillery fire cover, the enemy is receiving reinforcements.

Berlin, July 7 (Central News Agency) – The anti-Axis forces' European landing operation began on the 6th. It started as early as 9 PM on the 5th, when the British Broadcasting Corporation broadcast to France, requesting women and children within 35 kilometers of the coastline to evacuate immediately, followed by about 1,000 bombers carrying out

Concentrated Bombing

on European fortresses facing the Strait of Dover.

The bombing intensified further into the night, and the bombing area expanded from coastal fortresses to assembly points for German reserve forces in the rear. At 1:30 AM, anti-Axis paratroopers landed on the islands of Quessant and Yeu, west of the Normandy Peninsula, launching an attempted landing operation. Soon after, the British 166th Parachute Division landed near Ouistreham, west of the Orne River, and the American 82nd and 101st Parachute and Glider Divisions descended from the sky, launching operations to secure landing points.

Focus of Operations

After Barfleur, Caen, Courseulles, and Trouville, more paratroopers were dropped within five kilometers of the coast near these locations, launching operations to cover the landing of the seaborne army. At that time, ships and more than 4,000 landing craft from Britain, the United States, and France had already sailed from the sea near Calais to Île de Sein to gather, waiting for action in the English Channel. At 5:30 AM on the 7th, as the sky began to brighten, they began to advance towards the areas where the paratroopers had landed. At the same time, most of the small vessels began to shell the coastline, with six battleships and twenty destroyers

Providing Strong Naval

coverage for the shelling of the left and right flanks of Trouville and Barfleur, attempting to prevent the German-vaunted Atlantic Wall from displaying its prowess. Amidst the rumbling of artillery fire, countless landing craft of various sizes were released from the scattered 3,000-ton-class transport ships on the sea, breaking through the smoke screen and rushing to the shore. Especially at the mouths of the Orne and Vire rivers, flat-bottomed transport boats surged upstream, executing a daring tactic of landing behind the German fortress area. Against this kind of frontal attack, German minelayers were the first to sortie, disregarding the disparity in numbers and the intensity of the artillery fire, bravely plunging into the enemy fleet, using mines and

Intense Artillery Fire

Coastal artillery also concentrated its fire, striving to defend, but due to the more intense anti-Axis bombing until dawn, forty anti-Axis landing craft managed to approach and land successfully, and thirty-five heavy-laden vehicles drove onto the beach. At that time, German rear reserve forces had already been bombed by anti-Axis aircraft and began to assemble. An anti-Axis parachute regiment entered a German minefield, and its entire army was immediately shattered. By noon, the anti-Axis paratroopers in the Barfleur and Seine/Orne River areas had been completely annihilated by the German army. German motorized units launched a concentrated attack on the main British force of about seven or eight divisions landing from the sea, largely

Routing Them

and forcing them to retreat to where they came from. As of 7:00 PM on the 6th, only in an area one and a half kilometers deep and five to ten kilometers wide on the banks of the Orne River, a unit of anti-Axis forces was putting up a strong resistance, staging a one-man show of landing operations. German authorities stated that this could not be called a bridgehead, but merely a landing point, from which it can be seen that the anti-Axis landing operation has not achieved the expected results. It is even more evident that the anti-Axis forces will continue to launch a major offensive after the night of the 6th, according to a large-scale overall landing plan. The anti-Axis forces apparently intend to first seize the ports of Le Havre and Cherbourg, which can directly accommodate large ships, then land in the Saint-Malo area, and launch a decisive battle in northern France in one go. At present, success or failure is still difficult to predict.

Risky Landing Using Rope Ladders

Berlin, July 7 (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: It is learned that the main center of the anti-Axis landing seems to be between Saint-Vaast, west of the Seine estuary, and Ouistreham, ten miles north of Caen. Many landing ships and assault boats have docked here. At the same time, yesterday afternoon, 200 enemy ships sailed to the coast of Arromanches in the Cherbourg Peninsula (21 kilometers west-north of Caen). It is not yet known whether a landing has taken place. The anti-Axis forces are attempting to use rope ladders to climb the steep coast here. Yesterday, British and American tanks and vehicles also landed here. Multiple balloons were seen in the high altitude over the landing areas, seemingly containing artillery observers. British and American fighter planes constantly circled around the balloons.

Six Thousand Ships Cruising the Sea

Paris, July 7 (Central News Agency) – Radio Paris broadcasted today that the anti-Axis armada consists of more than 6,000 ships cruising near Cherbourg, exchanging fire with German shore batteries. This fleet includes battleships and various landing ships.

Berlin, July 7 (Central News Agency) – A German military spokesman announced today that anti-Axis forces again parachuted a large number of troops into the Seine area on the night of the 6th.

Paratroopers on Channel Islands Annihilated

Berlin, July 7 (Central News Agency) – German authorities announced on the 7th that German forces have completely annihilated the anti-Axis paratroopers who landed on the islands of Quessant and Yeu in the English Channel.

Berlin, July 7 (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: According to news from here this morning, the American forces who landed south of Cherbourg yesterday have all been annihilated. After several hours of fierce fighting, the German army completely eliminated the enemy army, leaving no one alive.

Composition of the Invasion Forces

Stockholm, Sweden, July 7 (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters, London, the afternoon of the 6th: The composition of the anti-Axis invasion forces is as follows: The naval forces participating in the invasion consist of the British and American fleets, the Canadian fleet, and the fleets of the Norwegian, Polish, Dutch, French, and Greek governments in exile. The ratio of the British and American fleets is approximately three to one. The land forces consist of American, British, and Canadian troops, with Montgomery as the commander-in-chief. The air force consists of fighters, light and heavy bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, and transport aircraft. The main force under the direct command of Eisenhower is composed of British, American, and Canadian troops.

British and American Strategic Diversionary Tactics

Berlin, July 7 (Central News Agency) – German authorities announced when meeting with a group of international reporters at noon on the 6th that since the anti-Axis forces launched the Western European landing operation, a considerable amount of time has passed, and therefore the situation on that front has gradually become clear. It has been determined that the anti-Axis forces are attempting to launch a so-called sea, land, and air offensive on a 120-kilometer front from the mouth of the Seine River to the mouth of the Vire River. This area is the closest to Paris in the coastal area of the Strait of Dover. However, the German army has long built a well-prepared defensive position there, which, in terms of thickness and armor, is the most solid location among the European fortresses. Therefore, the anti-Axis forces did not adopt the tactic of directly attacking the weak points, but used the most dangerous special tactics. This operation is a kind of diversionary tactic. Therefore, it is also possible that the anti-Axis forces will attempt to land at other locations.

### Pétain Encourages the People to Unite and Save the Nation

Paris, July 7 (Central News Agency) – French Head of State Marshal Pétain addressed the nation on the radio on the 6th, saying, "Fellow French citizens, the anti-Axis forces have begun the war on French territory. France has now been transformed into a battlefield. Civil servants, railway workers, and laborers, please do not leave your posts or act rashly, so as not to exacerbate our suffering. I hope that the entire nation will unite as one to save the motherland from danger and ruin."

### The War in Italy Enters a New Phase; US Fifth Army Crosses the Volturno River

US Troops Cross the Volturno River

Lisbon, July 7 (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Naples: After occupying Rome, the anti-Axis forces immediately crossed the Volturno River and advanced northeast towards the outskirts of Rome, currently engaging in fierce battles with the German army in that area. Furthermore, the anti-Axis forces announced on the 6th that the fighting in and around Rome would bypass Vatican City. Due to the anti-Axis forces' occupation of Rome, their offensive has entered a new phase. The US Fifth Army has now crossed the Volturno River at a new location, advancing to a point about five miles from the river.

Berlin, July 7 (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: Anti-Axis forces commander General Alexander continued his offensive on the 5th, with the focus on the western flank. General Alexander launched an attack west and northwest from Rome, but his tanks and motorized units were engaged in significant battles. On the evening of the 4th, the German army carried out a systematic withdrawal, so that the American army's fierce attack through Rome ultimately came to nothing.

Attitudes of Various Countries

Soviet Silence

Ankara, July 7 (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: Diplomatic circles here have learned that Moscow officials are still maintaining silence regarding the news of the European offensive. Of the three giants of the Tehran Conference, only Stalin has not yet made a statement. Apart from broadcasting the news of the European offensive, Moscow Radio has not made any commentary, and the same is true of Soviet newspapers.

Turkish Shock

Ankara, July 7 (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: The Turks are quite shocked by the news of the British and American launch of the European offensive, as if they were first hearing the news of the declaration of war five years ago. It is generally expected that British attention will be diverted as a result, so the state of tension in Turkish diplomacy is expected to diminish slightly.

### Anti-Communist Plan

— Jiang Kanghu

Respect Indigenous Culture

A nation in this world must have a reason for its existence. China is China, and the Chinese people are Chinese because they have their own unique historical, geographical, ethnic, and cultural characteristics. No matter what kind of ideology or policy, it must recognize this natural fact as a prerequisite for all words and actions. China's indigenous culture is the system passed down from Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, and the Duke of Zhou, compiled by Confucius and Mencius, and praised by the various schools of Lao-Zhuang, Yang-Mo, Legalists, etc. It is recorded in the Thirteen Classics and Twenty-Four Histories. All the exemplary words and deeds of past emperors, ministers, teachers, and mentors since the Qin and Han dynasties that have been shown to us belong to this. If we abandon all of this, then the nation will cease to be a nation, and the people will not be their people. Good laws and beautiful intentions will be of no use. Therefore, those who oppose communism must first know to respect our country's existing culture, enhance our self-esteem, and cultivate our self-confidence, ensuring that we have a central idea and that the content is substantial. Then, foreign heresies will have no way to enter. Even if there is incitement, we will not be shaken. We must know: Chinese culture inherently has value, which is unanimously praised by scholars from the East and West. This is one reason. Chinese culture is created by ourselves, and when used properly, it is the most suitable. This is the second reason. Chinese culture was transmitted to Japan, where it was preserved without loss, gradually leading to strength. This is the third reason. Moreover, belief is power. When we have faith in Chinese culture, we can rely on this power to be saved. This is the fourth reason. Chinese culture is not only the central thought of the Chinese people but can also serve as a common guide for the people of East Asia. It can also be harmonized and supplemented with Western culture to create a new culture for the future world. Communism is a stale fad, a shoddy imported product. What is there to discuss?

Transform the Economic System

Although we do not advocate the extreme materialist view of history, economic systems and living conditions are naturally capable of governing individuals and influencing society. Therefore, without economic improvement and stable living conditions, empty talk about opposing communism is of no use. The ideal world of communism is actually similar to the Great Harmony described in the Chinese Book of Rites. It is necessary to fundamentally transform the current economic system, ensuring that land and capital are owned by the public, production is managed by the public, all operations are centrally controlled, and distribution is equalized. The goal is universal education, employment for all, survival for all, enjoyment for all, everyone a capitalist, and everyone a laborer. The boundaries of class will not be established, and the state of struggle will not arise. All the benefits of communism will be achieved, and the harms of communism will have no way to occur. This is the best long-term strategy. As for short-term measures, wartime planned economy can also be adopted. Production is concentrated, distribution is concentrated, purchasing is cooperative, consumption is cooperative, hoarding of rice is confiscated, inflation is suppressed, goods are used as the standard, all miscellaneous taxes are abolished, and trade and transportation are encouraged. I firmly believe that if this is tried and implemented within one province for one year, the results will be visible. When all peaceful areas are places where people can live and work in peace, where men till the fields and women weave, and where there is abundant food and clothing, general life will be more leisurely than under the rule of the New Fourth Army and the Eighth Route Army. Even if there are communists, they will have no opportunity to use their skills.

Reform Administrative Agencies

Oppressive government is fiercer than a tiger. Those who drive the fish into the deep pool are the otters, those who drive the birds into the thicket are the hawks, and those who drive the people to the communists are the administrative officials of the provinces, cities, counties, and districts. Without reform of the administrative agencies, there is no way to reform the economic system. Today's problem is that there are too many officials, the power is too divided, the salaries are too low, the laws are too lenient, the qualifications are too mixed, appointments are too lax, responsibilities are not specific, and rewards and punishments are not enforced. They usually steal and embezzle. The existing agencies can be reduced by two-thirds, and the civil servants in each agency can also be reduced by two-thirds. They should be eliminated by examination. Those who are retained should have their salaries increased by at least one hundred times according to current prices, or they should be given an equal share of all necessities, plus cash for expenses. The lowest-ranking appointee should be able to support three people, the recommended appointee should be able to support five people, and those above the simplified appointment level should be able to support eight people, each according to their position as a standard of living. If there are still those who are corrupt and pervert the law, they may be sentenced to death by a special court law, so that one can truly be killed as a warning to a hundred. In a chaotic country, heavy penalties should be used, and although they may not be heavy, they must be enforced. Now the provincial administration has been simplified, and the county and district administrations and the central administration must also be simplified. Suppose a demonstration zone is set up as a model demonstration field. By comparison, the best and worst will be immediately apparent. Mencius said: "It is easy to feed the hungry, and easy to give drink to the thirsty. The people's return to benevolence is like water flowing downwards. What can the communists do about it?"

Implement Agrarian-Based Education

Chinese education has never had a definite direction. Twenty years ago, the author already had a sense of education leading to national destruction. After the incident, the standard of schools in the peaceful areas was even lower, and the customs of scholars were even worse. If, unfortunately, they are used by ambitious people, the abuses will be even more unspeakable. These cannot be reversed or remedied by patching up leaks or treating the head when the foot is sick. It is necessary to establish agrarianism as the guiding principle of education. First, China has always been an agricultural country, with farmers accounting for more than 80 percent of the population. Second, China's industry and commerce are not yet developed, but agriculture is the easiest to popularize, and there is a lot of wasteland in various provinces, so opening up resources is not difficult. Third, Chinese agriculture has declined in recent years, and production is insufficient, so it is urgent to increase it in order to achieve self-sufficiency. Fourth, commerce is the root. Fifth, the countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere must share the responsibilities they can bear. Japan should focus on heavy industry, while China should focus on agriculture and light industry at the current stage. Sixth, food is expensive during wartime, and agriculture can make a good profit. Seventh, agriculture is a movement to go to the people. Using this as the guiding principle of education can enable students to leave the city and move to the countryside. Eighth, agriculture is a simple and hardworking job. Using this as the guiding principle of education can enable students to tend towards diligence and thrift and to reject superficiality. Moreover, the communists specialize in inciting the peasant and worker classes. If agrarianism is established as the guiding principle of education, then the intellectual class and the working class will approach and harmonize, and all struggles will naturally disappear without a trace.

Unify Military Command

Those who oppose communism must never rely solely on military force, but sometimes military force must be used. The failure of Chinese military anti-communism over the years is precisely because the five items listed above have not been implemented. It is like using firewood to put out a fire or using boiling water to stop the boiling. Those who oppose communism are instead helping communism. If the five items listed above are carried out simultaneously, anti-communism will be like removing the firewood from under the pot. When necessary, military force can be used again, and the results will naturally be twice as effective with half the effort. However, military affairs are not easy to discuss. The current widespread miscellaneous armies are probably not enough to discuss this. In peacetime, they oppress the people and enrich themselves, creating opportunities for the communists. In wartime, they abandon their armor and drag their weapons, providing the communists with guns. As a result, the more they are suppressed, the more they grow. It is best to try conscription, selecting educated young people, rigorously training them, fully arming them, and forming model divisions, constantly conducting field exercises. Or carefully select excellent soldiers from each division, give them special training, and reorganize them, led by a senior officer, specifically for the purpose of fighting the communists, with unified orders and unified command. The senior officer in command of these troops should, within the designated area, preferably also have full authority over administration, economy, and education, so as to achieve effective command and avoid being constrained. After the communist disaster has been eradicated in the area, he may be transferred elsewhere except for security, and continue to advance and suppress the rebellion, in order to eradicate the root. This is what is meant by eliminating evil completely.

The situation is urgent! The enemy is deep! The Eighth Route Army has spread throughout North China, and the New Fourth Army has spread throughout the Jianghuai area. The Shanghai area is under threat. If we do not act now, it will be too late for regret. The return of the national government to the capital was originally under the slogan of anti-communism. The Axis alliance also has anti-communism as its goal. In the Greater East Asia War, China cannot send troops far away to fight side by side. In this important rear area, near the capital, if we do not rise up quickly and take the great plan of thorough anti-communism and comprehensive anti-communism, how can we face our allies? How can we face our people? May my countrymen, and may our allies, reflect early, wake up quickly, and jointly carry out this epoch-making mission! (Excerpt)

### Sixth Air Defense Day Tomorrow; Training to be Held in Different Areas; Air Raid Blackout Training at Night

The Shanghai Special Municipality Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters has issued a notice stating: It has been decided that June 9 will be the sixth Air Defense Day. This city will conduct blackout training according to the following procedures, but without sounding sirens. Air raid blackout training from 9 PM to 10 PM, and alert blackout training from 10 PM to 10:30 PM.

Tomorrow (the 9th) is the sixth Air Defense Day in this city. In order to raise public awareness of the significance of air defense and to enlighten the public about air defense knowledge, the Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters, in addition to still hanging cloth banners with eye-catching slogans at various transportation hubs, will also continue to conduct various air defense training exercises in different areas, such as firefighting, bomb disposal, rescue, and evacuation. Special protection groups of factories and large buildings will also be guided by personnel dispatched by the air defense authorities in various necessary measures of training, in order to achieve proficiency and cope with the occurrence of any unexpected events. According to the two-day civil air defense exercises held at the end of last month, the various measures were not yet satisfactory, and the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Department issued criticism. During the exercises held on that day, air defense personnel should also correct and improve. Furthermore, during the exercises in various districts, passersby stood by and watched, even clapping and shouting, or making no criticisms, which is not in line with the principles of civil air defense. In the future, citizens should automatically participate in the exercises and cooperate to complete the true meaning of civil air defense.

Furthermore, the Zhabei Sub-bureau has very strict regulations on blackout control. It has now been stipulated that the heads of each Baojia are responsible for patrolling the Baojia under their jurisdiction at any time. Regardless of whether it is a residential household or a store, if there is light leaking out, they should immediately warn and correct it. If they still ignore it, they should report to the sub-bureau for punishment by suspending the electricity supply. At the same time, other sub-bureaus also have the above strict measures. Therefore, residents should pay attention to light leaks, especially from dormer windows and skylights, which should be covered with black cloth curtains to prevent light from leaking out, leading to punishment.

### Industry Minister Chen Comes to Shanghai to Discuss Stabilizing Rice Prices; Meets with Chinese and Japanese Members of the Rice Control Committee

Wholesale Rice from the Suburbs Flows in Steadily

In recent days, the food supply for Shanghai citizens has gradually stabilized, and the price has also been constantly declining, which has made the minds of all citizens more and more calm. It is learned that the price of rice sold in the suburbs of Shanghai is almost the same as the price in the central area. Although retail rice vendors have disappeared, wholesale rice from the suburbs is flowing in steadily. It is expected that the price of rice will decline further within days. Rice merchants in Nanshi, Pudong, West Shanghai, and Zhabei are now actively preparing to form rice purchasing groups according to the instructions of the authorities, in order to purchase large quantities of rice from various inland areas and transport it to Shanghai.

Fire Department Requests Assistance in Preventing Theft of Public Fire Hydrants

Matters Concerning the Safety of Citizens' Lives and Property

The Fire Department of the First Police Bureau of this city, in order to prevent the theft of public fire hydrant parts on the streets, yesterday issued a statement saying: "Public fire hydrants on the streets are known to all as the most important and indispensable source of water for firefighting. Therefore, no matter how well-equipped a fire department is, it cannot fully exert its function without fire hydrants in the event of a fire. Fire hydrants are the weapons for protecting the lives and property of citizens during a fire. Recently, unscrupulous elements have been destroying fire hydrants or stealing their parts, which is not uncommon, causing fire hydrants to be in a state of disrepair. The authorities are making every effort to prevent this, but the area is vast, and the fire hydrants are scattered throughout. Preventing theft is very difficult, and it is particularly worrying in terms of the defense of the lives and property of Shanghai citizens. All residents of this city, if they witness such theft crimes, must not take a bystander attitude. For their own interests, they should immediately report to the police, or assist the villagers in arresting the criminals and sending them to the military police, or take other appropriate measures to cooperate in eliminating the public enemy that threatens the lives and property of citizens."

Readers' Scholarship News

### Explanation of Application Method

Since the announcement of the Shenbao Readers' Scholarship Fund's seventh student application method, we are grateful to people from all walks of life for expressing various opinions. The colleagues in the office are deeply grateful. For those who have questions about the new method, the following is a summary of several points for simple explanation: Some people think that although the new method is convenient for most students, a few exceptional students will have no way to apply and will lose the opportunity. According to this kind of exception. Hearing about new students from other places to Shanghai, or students who dropped out of school midway, or students whose original schools were closed, are very few. Even if they can explain the reasons and provide evidence, the office can directly issue the application form. These special cases must be accepted only after June 15. Some people think that the new method is too convenient for students, without the need to go back and forth, or wait in line, so the number of applicants will be so large that it will be difficult to cope with. The committee and the colleagues in the office have also responded to this point, but running around and waiting in line are not reasonable methods for identifying poor and excellent students. Therefore, we can only ask the school authorities to assist and cooperate, strictly review the applications, and do not recommend them lightly. And we hope that the number of recommendations per school does not exceed 5% of the number of students. The office will issue the application form as a standard, but schools with more recipients in this session can be accommodated appropriately. This restriction is really unavoidable, and we hope that the schools will understand this intention. Some people think that the school authorities must have a considerable understanding of the students' academic performance, family background, etc. If they can take advantage of the opportunity to disturb the process and have the office re-select, it will be more thorough than the office's independent selection. As for taking advantage of public office for personal gain and recommending mediocre and wealthy students, most school authorities will not do this. Moreover, the recommendation letter requires the signature and seal of two responsible persons from the school, and the applicant needs to be re-selected by the office. There are many eyes and ears in the school, if the opportunity for a truly poor and excellent student is taken away, someone will definitely be unhappy and report it. The reputation of the school authorities is at stake, so they should have some concerns.

### Tianjin United Football Team Plays Western United Today

Racecourse, 5:30 PM
