### On the Dismissal of Gu Baoheng and Zhou Naiwen

Yesterday's newspaper reported the National Government's order: "It has been found that Hou Dazhuang, Director of the Jiangsu Grain Bureau (Hou concurrently serves as the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters), and Hu Zheng, Director of the Grain Ministry's Aquatic Products Administration and concurrently Director of the Construction Ministry's Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, engaged in significant malfeasance in the procurement of military grain during the wartime period. They are hereby dismissed from their positions and handed over to a special court for strict investigation and punishment according to the law." Furthermore: "It has been found that Gu Baoheng, Minister of the Grain Ministry, and Zhou Naiwen, Vice Minister, are suspected of involvement in the Hou Dazhuang and Hu Zheng corruption case. They are hereby dismissed from their positions and handed over to a special court for impartial trial." Standing from the perspective of the people, upon reading these two orders, we immediately felt a sense of relief. At the same time, we believe that these two orders are the first wise measures taken by the National Government since returning to the capital, and the first sound of the recent political reforms and establishment of credibility by the National Government. This newspaper believes that there must be right and wrong, rewards and punishments, in order for politics to get on the right track. This is a very important turning point, and we hope that the government authorities will pay attention to it and seize it.

Analyzing the orders further, the former involves "corruption" leading to "dismissal" and "strict investigation," while the latter involves "suspicion" leading to "dismissal" and "impartial trial." There is clearly a distinction in severity. However, we are ashamed to say that we heard from the sidelines that the Hou and Hu case was reported by the Allied Suzhou Military Police. We believe that Gu Baoheng and Zhou Naiwen are the highest officials in charge of grain, and Hou Dazhuang and Hu Zheng have a close kinship relationship and are also Gu and Zhou's confidants and direct subordinates. Wouldn't the superiors be aware of the significant corruption committed by their trusted subordinates? Therefore, Hou and Hu's audacity was preceded by Gu and Zhou's protection. Undoubtedly, Gu, Zhou, Hou, and Hu are birds of a feather. Hou and Hu are the implementers of corruption, while Gu and Zhou are the behind-the-scenes supporters. In short, the four are one, colluding in corruption. Even if we take a step back, if subordinates have significant corruption and the superiors fail to detect and report it, the responsibility of condoning and neglecting is serious enough and cannot be shirked. Therefore, today we specifically use "On the Dismissal of Gu Baoheng and Zhou Naiwen" as the title, to emphasize the guilt that Gu and Zhou should bear, which is definitely not "suspicion" but is, in essence, more serious than the guilt of Hou and Hu. This is our opinion provided to the officials presiding over the special court.

Not long ago, Geng Jiaji, an important official of the municipal government in this city, committed suicide, which was rumored to be related to the Hou case. It was heard that Mr. Geng was deceived into corruption by those around him. As a result, the case was exposed, and he deeply understood the gravity of his responsibility and was unable to find a way out, eventually ending his life. Now, leaving aside Hou and Hu for the moment, let us ask Gu and Zhou to search their own hearts and ask themselves how they will handle this.

Regarding the Hou and Hu case, we have the following thoughts:

The Allied military police authorities, in this case, were able to report it impartially, without avoiding suspicion or resentment, and without considering the high rank of the officials involved. Our gratitude lies not only in the fact that this has made corrupt officials tremble, but also in promoting the beginning of the purification of officialdom in China. This is the most concrete and effective measure taken by the Allies to strengthen the National Government.

The integrity of personnel is still the core of political reform, especially in handling grain administration. Moral integrity, self-discipline, and public service should be the code of conduct for public officials. Superiors must especially examine their subordinates, and when corruption is discovered, they should not be swayed by personal feelings and should promptly report it. Moreover, people like Director Gu, whether from a political experience, reputation, or qualifications perspective, are not sufficient to take on important central tasks, especially the major grain administration matters that are related to people's livelihoods. This is a shortcoming of the government's imprudent use of personnel. Therefore, we hope that the government will take the strict investigation of the Hou case as a starting point, eradicate corruption, the supervisory authorities will exercise their impeachment duties, and the judicial authorities will exert their prosecutorial mission, assisting each other horizontally and vertically, and jointly advancing rapidly on the open road of purifying officialdom and reforming politics.

The military grain involved in the Hou and Hu corruption case is certainly important. However, the importance of institutions responsible for managing civilian food, such as the Rice and Grain Control Committee, is no less important. And rice and grain control affairs are most likely to cause those with unstable morals to engage in corruption. In the past, there have also been corruption facts among the staff of the Rice Control Committee, but we have yet to hear of thorough investigation and severe punishment, which is most regrettable. At the same time, whether it is military grain or civilian food, they are both major matters related to life. Those who handle "grain administration" must have a deep sense of caution and work diligently. We urge the authorities and personnel of the Grain Control Committee to take the Hou, Hu, Gu, and Zhou case as a profound lesson, work diligently and selflessly, and not be tempted by petty gains, lest they ruin their future.

### Japanese Troops Deploying Defensive Offensive in Creek Valley Area, Enemy Supply Routes Completely Severed

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a certain base on the Burmese front reports that Japanese troops are concentrating forces in the area of the Kin-kyu Ridge, holding firm positions in front of Fort White and in the mountainous area upstream of the Isalo River, attempting to resist. Furthermore, enemy troops have constructed circular fortifications on mountain peaks ranging from 5,000 to 8,000 feet in elevation, deploying various artillery pieces in front. These fortifications are all connected by supply roads to the rear. The terrain is steep and dangerous, completely severing lateral communication, so each mountain peak is in an isolated state. The elite Japanese troops are best at surprise attacks in dense forests, causing the enemy great intimidation. Now, the British-Indian troops are undergoing fierce attacks from the Japanese forces in the air and on the ground and will soon be wiped out.

Rangoon, 13th (Central News Agency) - A general overview of the Kin-kyu area on the Indian border: Currently, Japanese troops are fighting in the Kin-kyu Ridge area on the Indian border (the word "Kin" in Burmese means "uncivilized"). This area is a range of towering mountains, a mysterious place where culture is blocked. This area is located in the middle of the Arakan Mountains, the center of the Indian-Burmese border, and is truly a natural military stronghold. Peaks of 4,000 to 5,000 feet high rise and fall continuously, interspersed with creek valleys, and sometimes vast dense forests cover the mountains. Before the Greater East Asia War, this area was not valued because the terrain was dangerous and transportation was inconvenient, and there were few travelers. After the British-Indian troops retreated in the Burmese campaign, they built fortifications along the Indian-Burmese border, and thus the Kin-kyu Ridge area, a secret place in Asia, began to be known to the world. The climate in this area varies greatly. The dry season is from November to April of the following year. Autumn, winter, and spring pass in an instant, and the rest is a long summer. Winter is the coldest, with snow often seen everywhere. During the day, the heat rises to 130 to 140 degrees, and at night it drops to 0 degrees. The climate is extremely peculiar, so malaria, cholera, and plague are common. The Kin people living in this area number about 360,000, mostly along the Manipur River. They are short in stature and fierce in nature. Recently, Britain attempted to obtain the abundant forest resources of this area, trying to use Christianity to assimilate the Kin people, but only provoked resentment from the Kin people. Before the Greater East Asia War, Major Vasba, an Englishman who was a leader of the Kin people, suddenly disappeared when the war broke out, his life and death unknown, probably killed by Kin people eager for revenge. Moreover, a highway has been opened in this area, which is the crystallization of the Kin people's sacrificed sweat. The Kin people have a deep hatred for the inhumane British. This ethnic group in a secret place will also be liberated by the Japanese army from the shackles of the British.

### Japanese Troops in Bougainville Pressuring Enemy Positions, Completely Controlling Second and Third Airfields

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a Japanese base in the South Pacific reports that Japanese troops on Bougainville Island, after beginning their offensive on Torokina, are pressing toward enemy positions along several routes. On the 12th, Japanese troops moved south on the highway northwest of the enemy's Third Airfield, bypassing the barbed wire on a certain intersection, and breaking into enemy positions. They are now advancing south. Furthermore, the enemy launched several attacks with strong forces on a certain high ground northeast of the enemy's Third Airfield and another high ground since the 11th, but were all repelled by Japanese troops, suffering heavy casualties. Therefore, both positions are being secured by Japanese troops. Moreover, Japanese troops are preparing for an offensive. As a result, the enemy's Second and Third Airfields have been completely suppressed by Japanese troops, so it is impossible for enemy aircraft to take off or land at those two airfields. Only their First Airfield seems to still have a few enemy aircraft.

### Chongqing Army Prisoner Recounts Truth About Yunnan Expeditionary Force: Insufficient Food, Low Combat Power

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a certain base in Burma reports that when Chiang Kai-shek inspected the Yunnan Expeditionary Force, he declared that he would increase the monthly salaries of soldiers when the counter-offensive operation in Burma began, in order to boost the morale of the soldiers of the Yu army. Recently, according to a lieutenant colonel staff officer of the Yunnan Western Advance Column who was captured by the Japanese army, not only was the Yunnan Expeditionary Force unable to launch a counter-offensive in Burma, but they were trembling with fear and at a loss when they heard that the Japanese army was attacking Kunming. According to him, the situation of the expeditionary Yu army is as follows: Although the food ration for the expeditionary Yu army is slightly better than that of soldiers in other areas, the quantity is still quite insufficient. Therefore, they are not only unsatisfied during combat, but also during training. Furthermore, due to the lack of vegetables and vitamins, more than 28 percent suffer from night blindness. The combat power of the Yu army is declining daily, but Chiang Kai-shek, unaware of this situation, is merely exaggerating the power of the expeditionary force to the United States and Britain, and specially guiding British and American generals to inspect the front lines in Yunnan. However, seeing is believing. Chiang, seeing that the internal situation of his army has already been exposed, hurriedly returned to Chongqing. He also ordered the commanders of the expeditionary force to further increase the soldiers' food rations and implement temporary pay increases when the counter-offensive in Burma begins. However, the counter-offensive in Burma is merely Chiang Kai-shek's cry. No matter how well the expeditionary force fights, it will never be able to defeat the powerful Japanese army. Because the Burma Road has been cut off, the enemy cannot use automobiles to move troops. In fact, when it is necessary to use automobiles on the battlefield, the Military Commission also permits it. However, it is extremely difficult to obtain permission even after repeatedly requesting the military authorities, and even if permission is obtained, gasoline must be prepared, and most of the vehicles are broken and cannot be used for combat. The disastrous defeat in the Battle of Changde last year was due to this. The war-weariness of the Yu army soldiers and the people is also increasing. Due to repeated defeats, the residents in the anti-Japanese areas have become depressed. Especially the youth.

"Eternal Regret of the Spring River" Is Being Filmed

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Allied Japanese Film Company and the China Film United Company have decided to cooperate in producing films to promote cultural exchange between China and Japan and realize the ideals of East Asian cinema. It has been heard that the first film, titled "Eternal Regret of the Spring River," began filming in early February. The theme of the film is Sino-Japanese cooperation to destroy the United States and Britain, to thoroughly implement the determination of China and Japan to live and die together and coexist and prosper together. The film is currently being filmed and will be shown in various places as soon as it is completed.

### The United States and Britain Attempt to Realize the Dream of "Air Victory"

The United States and Britain are still hesitating to launch a frontal offensive against Germany's European fortress. At this moment, they are blindly relying on blind bombing tactics. As a result, indiscriminate bombing of major cities has occurred. Recently, Dr. Lenk, a clergyman member of the British Parliament, delivered a speech criticizing the British and American air forces for indiscriminate bombing of Germany. Neutral countries are paying close attention to this kind of speech in which the British themselves criticize their own government. At the same time, as a result of the counter-axis air force's indiscriminate bombing of various parts of France, thousands of French people have been killed or injured. The criticism from the North African French Committee of Liberation is also gradually intensifying. Therefore, the complaints about the British and American air forces have reached a noticeable level. Lord Cranborne, the representative of the British Dominions in the House of Lords, reluctantly defended Dr. Lenk's speech, saying that bombing tactics have recently been strengthened, changing from careful selection of targets to so-called indiscriminate blanket bombing. The British and American air forces regard indiscriminate bombing as legitimate.

Churchill's Strategy

Churchill's air offensive strategy is first to continue to carry out large-scale indiscriminate bombing of German submarine bases along the Atlantic coast, starting with cities such as Lübeck, Rostock, Bremen, and Augsburg, which has become active since the autumn of last year. Churchill once declared that he would completely destroy 50 major cities in Germany. Regarding this, a certain Swiss military expert estimated that at least 1,000 aircraft per day would be needed to bomb Germany's industrial centers, so it would be necessary to have 10,000 aircraft on standby and replenish 3,000 new aircraft each month. Regardless of this expert's estimate, in short, the counter-axis side's so-called obtaining "air victory" is actually the United States' abuse of a large number of air forces, but it has not yet reached the aforementioned level. However, judging from its large-scale continuous indiscriminate bombing of Hamburg, Berlin, etc. since the autumn of last year, it can be seen that the counter-axis side's air offensive is becoming increasingly fierce. Let us analyze the enemy's offensive during the month from January 10th of this year.

In this one month, the British and American air forces crossed the English Channel and intruded into the airspace of the continent for more than 20 days. During the remaining 10 days, they could not sortie due to bad weather or technical difficulties. During the period of suspension of intrusions into the continent, they still continued to carry out bombing everywhere. As for the number of aircraft participating in the air raids on the continent and the quantity of bombs dropped, it can be divided into three levels:

The largest air raids involved more than 500 aircraft, sometimes reaching more than 1,000. The total amount of bombs dropped by such aircraft formations is usually more than 1,000 tons, sometimes reaching 2,500 tons.

The second is sorties involving hundreds of aircraft, dropping 200 tons of bombs. The third is small-formation bombing aimed at military facilities, or reconnaissance warfare conducted by Mosquito light bombers. In this one month, Berlin was attacked the most times (ten times if counted from January 10th). Among these ten times, six were fierce air raids with hundreds of aircraft sortied together. The enemy propaganda claimed that each time they dropped 100 to 2,300 tons of bombs on the city of Berlin. Regarding this point, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels said: "The defensive battle of Berlin has now reached a historically important stage. We must strike down the enemy's attempt to subjugate Germany and include the intention of forging the German people's morale."

Berlin Suffers Blind Bombing

In this one month, the city that suffered the most intense air raids after Berlin was Frankfurt, which experienced air raids three times. Among them, 1,800 tons were dropped twice and 800 tons were dropped once. Brunswick also suffered the same degree of damage, suffering three large-scale air raids.

In the past month, the British and American air forces' large and small formations reached their destinations a total of 36 times. Among them, 15 air raids were on the German mainland, and the other 21 were bombing of the "Atlantic Wall" in northern France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and northwestern Germany. This area is the target of the counter-axis invasion of Europe, probing the German defense forces. Among them, five or six were large-scale bombings dropping more than 1,000 tons, and the others were bombing of military facilities. Another point worth noting is that among the six large air raids, three were concentrated in the Calais area, which is close to the British outposts. The northern coast of France, including the Calais area, was attacked 15 times out of 21 air raids.

German Air Defenses Strengthened

Judging from the above statistics, it is clear that the British and American air force's bombing campaign against the European continent is following Churchill's wishes, attempting to destroy all German cities, devastate the morale of the German people, and achieve the purpose of preparing for the invasion. However, the German air force now has a significant increase, and its courageous defense tactics will not allow the invading air force to jump over it. The second front, which is to be opened depending on the results of the air force's bombing, will naturally never be realized. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, February 28)

### Opening Ceremony of the Eighth Term of the Army Officers Training Corps Presided Over by Xiao Shuxuan on Behalf of Wang Jingwei, Concurrently Head of the Corps

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - After the graduation of the fifth term of the officer team and the seventh term of the cadre general team of the Central Army Officers Training Corps at the end of last month, in addition to intensifying training for students in the advanced military research class who are still receiving training, the corps is also actively preparing for the eighth term of the cadre general team. Various units are also enthusiastically selecting officers below the rank of lieutenant colonel to enter the corps for training. Registration began on the 5th of this month, and by the 10th, more than 230 people had arrived. After screening, they were divided into three teams, and training began. At 9:00 AM on the 13th, Mr. Xiao Shuxuan, the concurrently serving education director of the corps, presided over the opening ceremony on behalf of Wang Jingwei, the concurrently serving head of the corps. The ceremony was simple and solemn, and the concurrently serving education director's training speech stated: "At this moment when the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage, we should conserve manpower, material resources, and time as much as possible, and cooperate with the Allied powers to strive for the final victory. Although today's opening ceremony is simple, it is not perfunctory. Holding it in an extremely solemn atmosphere has profound significance. The training period for the eighth term of the cadre team is only three months. We hope that all students will receive rigorous training. Both educators and those being educated must invigorate their spirits and strive to achieve maximum results."

### Conflicts Between Chongqing and the Communists Have Recently Become Increasingly Acute; the Communist Party Has Determined the "1-2-7" Policy

Central News Agency Report - Reports about the internal strife and disputes between Chongqing and the Communists have been frequently seen in newspapers recently. Now, according to reliable sources, in order to deal with the Chongqing Chiang regime, the Chinese Communist Party has specifically determined the so-called "1-2-7 Forward New Policy." The content of the policy is to allocate one-tenth of their strength to advocate resistance against Japan, two-tenths of their strength to protect their own base areas, and seven-tenths of their strength to seek to expand their territory. Currently, Chongqing is also planning two measures to deal with this new policy of the Communist Party: to use political means to negotiate and to adopt an encirclement offensive. First, Chiang Ching-kuo, the eldest son of Chiang Kai-shek, went to Yan'an twice for negotiations. At the same time, he ordered the encirclement of the Eighteenth Group Army, the Eighth Route Army, and the New Fourth Army. In addition, news has come that the Chongqing army has been pressing the New Fourth Army from North China towards eastern Anhui. In order to cope with the Chongqing army's encirclement plan, the Sixth Division of the New Fourth Army has been stationed in Guangde, Langxi, and Xinchang, the Eighth Division has been stationed in Tianmashan, and the Seventh Division has begun to move towards Nanling.

Regarding the Chongqing side's measures to deal with the Eighth Route Army, the Chongqing side has dispatched Hu Zongnan, Ma Hongda, and Fu Zuoyi's troops to encircle Yan'an, totaling as many as 150,000 people. The Communist Party members who have been subjected to repression include He Long, Liu Bocheng, Lü Zhengcao, Nie Rongzhen, Xu Xiangqian, and Xiao Jinguang, with a total of more than 80,000 troops. A conflict occurred on December 14th of last year, and the total damage to both sides was that the special service brigade of Xiao Jinguang's communist army was completely annihilated, and a regiment of the 115th Division was killed or wounded. Lü Zhengcao and Xu Xiangqian's troops also suffered considerable damage, no less than 9,000 people. The Chongqing army lost two regiments of the 167th Division, one regiment of the 78th Division, and one battalion of the 28th Division, with a total of more than 7,000 killed or wounded. It is heard that Ma Hongda's troops have increased by two divisions, and they are now pressing the communist army on the Zhongtiao Mountain side, reducing the encirclement.

Most Indians Suspect British Promises to India

Guangzhou, 13th (Central News Agency) - Currently, Britain is asking India to cooperate in the war on the condition that it will allow India independence after the war. On February 26th, the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao published an article criticizing that Britain intends to use India as a base to launch a counter-offensive. The biggest reasons why it has not been realized are two: first, the British fleet cannot navigate to the Indian Ocean; second, the situation in India cannot improve before the counter-offensive base can be implemented, but is getting worse. Recent British news reported that Britain and India have a cooperation plan, but what is the tendency of the Indian people? Most Indians suspect that Britain will allow India independence after the war. The situation in India is getting worse, which is worrying. It is not within the power of the British to solve this difficult situation.

Italy Appoints New Army Chief of Staff

Rome, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency: General Piche has been appointed as the Chief of Staff of the Italian Army. The former Chief of Staff, General Gambara, has resigned. Mussolini sent a letter of thanks to Gambara for his contributions to the reorganization of the Italian Army.

### Soviet Influence in Xinjiang Grows Daily, Anglo-Soviet Relations in the Province Worsen

Central News Agency report: News from the Northwest indicates that according to the new agreement concluded last year between the Soviet Union and Sheng Shicai, Chairman of Xinjiang Province, the Soviet Union recently lent Sheng Shicai a large sum of money, amounting to tens of millions of rubles. It is said that Xinjiang will use the funds to develop hydroelectric power plants and coal mines. On the one hand, the Soviet Union is sending people to Xinjiang to purchase large quantities of sheepskin, cotton, beef, horses, etc., to be transported to the Soviet Union for exchange. They are also sending technicians to Xinjiang to assist in the development of hydroelectric power plants and coal mines, and agricultural specialists to northern Xinjiang to carry out agricultural improvement work. Furthermore, it is reported that there are now permanent Soviet military specialists stationed in Xinjiang, serving as professors in the province's military academies and training Sheng's troops. It is said that three divisions of Soviet-style troops have now been established. Yu Fang had previously sent Zhu Shaoliang to Xinjiang to prevent the expansion of Soviet influence and to discuss the issue of stationing Central Government troops in Xinjiang with Sheng. At that time, the British opposed this approach. Currently, Soviet influence has spread to Xinjiang, and Anglo-Soviet relations in Xinjiang, in particular, are deteriorating. Xinjiang has announced a halt to trade with India, and the Soviet Union has instigated Sheng to force Indian merchants to return home. Therefore, Anglo-Soviet relations in Xinjiang are worsening daily.

Sweden Holds Air Defense Drill

Stockholm, 13th (Central News Agency telegram): A German news agency reports that the Stockholm Home Guard and fire personnel held an air defense drill in the Souter district outside the city last night.

Afterwards, the Crown Prince and Princess reviewed the personnel who participated in the drill.

### Germany Commemorates Fallen Soldiers, Dönitz Delivers Speech, National Unity Will Certainly Overcome the Enemy

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency telegram): Grand Admiral Dönitz, Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy, said in a radio address on Sunday, Germany's Memorial Day for Unknown Heroes, "In this war, Germany is paying tribute to the fallen soldiers on all land, sea, and air fronts for the fifth time. We also commemorate the men, women, and children who were victims of the horrific air raids. We bow our heads in respect for their sacrifice and endure their passing with a cry of pride." Grand Admiral Dönitz emphasized that every German today knows that Germany is engaged in the most serious and ruthless battle. The various events in this war and the enemy's wild ambitions show the German people all the dangers of this war. He also said that this war was forced upon Germany by the enemy. "The enemy acted rashly and arrogantly, and with a false and hypocritical heart, pretended to protect the interests of the Polish people and wanted to prevent the unification of German brothers." Grand Admiral Dönitz solemnly declared that this ruthless and unavoidable war is a war related to the life and death of the German nation, but the German people know that in this great battle, they are fortunate to have a leader given to the German nation by God, and therefore they will be able to endure the trials. In the past few years, the enemy has used its enormous strength of manpower and material resources to try to break into the living space of Germany and its allies, but everywhere it has failed to break through a decisive gap. If the German leader had not reorganized the German armed forces ten years ago, then the German homeland today would be unimaginable. Only the German army can repel the enemy's fierce attacks, otherwise the Bolshevik torrent would have swept away our people and European culture." Grand Admiral Dönitz emphasized that "the German nation, due to the determination and unyielding strength of the domestic front, will overcome this battle. The great strength of the German nation lies in the unity of command of the internal and external fronts. Under this unified command, Germany has become an invincible country. Germany, with this unyielding attitude, will obtain the peace that a righteous country should enjoy. Therefore, the best way for us to thank the fallen heroes is to swear allegiance to the country and the leader and prepare to make the greatest sacrifices until victory comes."

U.S. Undersecretary of State May Visit Soviet Capital

### Soviet Forces on the Southern Sector of the Eastern Front Adopt Scythe and Hammer Tactics, German Retreat Proceeds Smoothly

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency telegram): According to the German News Agency, the resistance of the German forces on the southern sector of the Eastern Front against General Zhukov's large-scale offensive is gradually increasing. The planned German retreat is proceeding very smoothly. The threat of German forces being encircled and defeated has now been eliminated. General Zhukov's tactics are not new. The Soviet army is launching large-scale offensives at various points on the front in an attempt to encircle large areas. The Soviet army has been using these tactics for a long time. The Soviet side claims that the Soviet army is using the "scythe and hammer tactics" for the first time in the recent battles. The German side rejects this, saying that the Soviet army's "scythe-shaped action" on the southern sector of the Eastern Front and the "hammer action" on the top of the front have not achieved decisive success. As the German army retreated, some troops had already retreated to the Bug River. The Soviet army's attempt to cross the river upstream failed. The fighting in the eastern part of the battlefield is taking place in barren land. Air activity on the Crimean front became active again over the weekend. On the central sector of the Eastern Front, after the Soviet army stopped its offensive on the Smolensk-Orel highway and southeast of Vitebsk, the fighting has calmed down. Near Nevel, the Soviet army has transferred fresh troops to participate in the war, so fierce fighting is in progress. On the northern sector of the front, such as Ostrov, Pustoschka, and the Narva area, there are fierce battles, but they are not as important as the vehicles on the southern sector.

Anti-Axis Aircraft Blindly Bomb Italian and French Cities

Xianglin, 13th (Central News Agency telegram): On the 11th, anti-Axis aircraft bombed civilian residences and cultural monuments in the Italian cities of Padua and Florence, causing heavy damage. The 13th-century Church of the Eremitani was almost completely destroyed. Florence was bombed for three quarters of an hour. In order to preserve irreplaceable works of art, the German army did not station troops in Florence, but it could not avoid the invasion of British and American aircraft. German and Italian fighters encountered the bad weather and shot down 21 of them.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency telegram): According to a report from Toulon, on the 11th, anti-Axis bomber squadrons, under the cover of fighter planes, raided the port of Toulon and blindly bombed the bustling areas of the city, causing the collapse of post offices, guild halls, and many other buildings, as well as many civilian casualties.

U.S. to Impose Economic Pressure on Ireland, Britain Bans Travel Between Britain and Ireland

Geneva, 13th (Central News Agency telegram): According to a German news agency report from Washington published by the Exchange Telegraph, the diplomatic community in Washington expects the United States to implement unfavorable economic measures against Ireland.

Stockholm, 13th (Central News Agency telegram): After the Irish government refused to comply with the demands of the British and American governments to close down Axis agencies, the British government retaliated by banning travel between Britain and Ireland. According to a report from London, the British Home Office announced on the 12th that it would not issue travel permits to British nationals and the island of Ireland. Furthermore, the British government will no longer issue return certificates to Irish workers in Britain.

### Pope Issues Appeal Not to Destroy Rome and Expresses Deep Sympathy for Italian Refugees

Vatican City, 13th (Central News Agency telegram): Pope Pius XII yesterday issued a strong appeal to the belligerent parties, asking them not to destroy Rome with ruthless aerial warfare. Believers in Rome and refugees from southern Italy gathered in St. Peter's Square to listen to the Pope's speech. He said that bombing the Holy City is illegal from any point of view, so he asked the responsible parties on both sides of the war to do everything possible to avoid bombing this helpless city. In his twenty-minute speech, the Pope expressed deep sympathy for the Italian refugees, saying that he had tried to prevent the outbreak of war, but after failing, he immediately devoted himself to alleviating the suffering of war in various countries.

Observations on the Current Situation in the Pacific War from German and Neutral Countries

The American landing in the Marshalls, the attack on Truk, and the Japanese offensive in Burma have brought a new look to the military situation in East Asia. As a result, a portion of the Japanese cabinet was reorganized, and the command of the army and navy was also changed. These epoch-making facts have made the German people more concerned about Japan. Recently, U.S. Fleet Commander Nimitz said in a meeting with reporters:

1. It is impossible to conquer Japan from the sea alone. The United Kingdom and the United States must quickly transport land and air forces to China or land on its coast to promote the defeat of Japan.

The Deutsche Zeitung commented that Nimitz's words were tantamount to admitting the difficulty of his offensive against Japan. Its argument is as follows:

1. Although the U.S. military has recently advanced in the Solomon Islands and the Marshall Islands, it has paid an extremely high price. The U.S. military wants to continue its island-hopping operations against the original defense perimeter of Japan, such as Truk, Iwo Jima, Saipan, and the Mariana Islands. Japan is expected to launch a more fierce counter-offensive, and even if it succeeds, the U.S.'s massive military production capacity will not be able to bear the burden of continuing to invade Japan's inner defense line.

2. On the other hand, Mountbatten's campaign to recover Burma, although considered the most urgent, has been forced to retreat due to encountering a brave counter-offensive.

3. Therefore, try to land on the coast of the South China Sea. In the current situation, hoping for success is just a pipe dream.

The United Kingdom and the United States have too much expectation for Chongqing

4. Nimitz's statement is in line with what American military commentators Hanson and Baldwin said in the New York Times. Baldwin said: "The British and American authorities have too much expectation for the Chongqing army, which is a big mistake. The British and American armies should use their own land forces to land on the Chinese mainland to drive out the Japanese and make them surrender." Such shallow insights should be denied. Furthermore, it is a pipe dream to over-believe in the idea that "air power can win."

5. Speaking of strengthening air control over Japan, U.S. Air Force Commander Chennault recently said: "To attack Japan with air raids like today's attacks on Chongqing, it would be enough to send one-tenth of the air force that the United Kingdom and the United States are sending to Europe." He argued that the air force stationed in Chongqing was too weak in number, and said: "For the air force stationed in Chongqing to obtain the necessary replenishment, it must be based on the premise that the South China coast to the Yangtze River and the railways to North China are restored to the hands of the anti-Axis."

This fully illustrates the difficulty of the U.S. Air Force's operations in Chongqing.

6. In short, the U.S. military is overestimating the attack on Truk Island and promoting the imminent large-scale offensive against Japan, which is nothing more than an aid to the domestic Roosevelt's fourth election campaign.

Another part of the German people believe that the current American offensive against Japan is only a temporary attempt by the anti-Axis forces to extend their foothold for the offensive against Japan before the start of the large-scale offensive against Europe. On the contrary, some people observe that the United Kingdom and the United States, in view of the subtle relations between Europe and the Soviet Union, want to temporarily focus their main forces on the distant Pacific region.

The United Kingdom and the United States are forced to fight on two fronts

In short, the United Kingdom and the United States are dispersing their forces in Europe and the Pacific, and are forced to fight on two fronts. There is no doubt about this. As for the results of the American offensive against Japan, the aforementioned Deutsche Zeitung's discussion can represent the views of German intellectuals. Regarding the close coordination of Japan's military and political orders, the British and American sides arbitrarily speculate, while the German side believes that this was originally a pending issue for Japan, and that at this decisive stage, military actions need to be decided and implemented immediately, and military actions and the highest political system need to be integrated. All of this has been resolved in this measure. As a result, Japan's entire military operation can be used more rationally, and great expectations are placed on it. (Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi, March 1)

Regarding the increasingly fierce battles in the South Pacific, the Swiss Zurich Daily published an article entitled "The Anti-War Core Army's Offensive Against Japan," which reviewed the anti-Axis counter-offensive operations that began in the summer of 1942. From a neutral standpoint, it explained the significance of the anti-Axis offensive and predicted the future operational goals of the anti-Axis forces as follows:

"The anti-Axis army's attack on Japanese bases is to first launch a large-scale advance with aircraft carriers and base air forces, approach Japanese bases under their air supremacy, use naval gun fire, and then carry out landings with ground troops under their cover. If they can land, they will turn it into a naval and air base and carry out another operation using the same tactics. This is the so-called island-hopping operation." In this strategy of the anti-Axis army, what is noteworthy is that although the anti-Axis army dispatched a fleet to approach the central area of Japanese defense, it did not receive effective resistance from the Japanese fleet, which seems to be unfavorable to Japan. Of course, the Japanese fleet is still there, its battleships have great combat power, and the Japanese navy uses this fleet with extreme caution. Just thinking about the numerical superiority of the United Kingdom and the United States, the Japanese navy is of course taking this attitude in the current war.

Current Situation of the British and American Navies

So what is the current strength of the British and American navies? The exact number is unknown, but what has been reported before is as follows:

1. Five Montana-class battleships exceeding 60,000 tons, which began to be built from 1941, are expected to have been commissioned.

2. Five Iowa-class battleships over 50,000 tons, which began to be built from 1940 to 1941, have now been seen participating in Pacific operations.

3. Six Washington-class battleships over 40,000 tons have been commissioned in the past three years.

4. In addition, there seem to be battleships being built.

5. There are more than ten aircraft carriers in addition to those previously lost.

6. There are more than seventy small escort carriers.

7. The United Kingdom has at least several battleships that can be used in the anti-Japanese war in the Pacific. This is possible from the current strength of the surrendered fleets of France and Italy and the German fleet.

Japanese Fleet Awaits

The anti-Axis army has been able to take large-scale operational actions due to its numerical superiority in the naval and air forces, and Japanese bases are gradually being adversely affected. The most obvious operational goals of the anti-Axis forces are now Rabaul and Truk. Regarding the Battle of Rabaul, the anti-Axis forces are bombing the port itself and bombing ships that are replenishing ammunition and food. This operation must be started from a base far away from the Japanese position. This illustrates the difficulty of directly attacking a naval and air base with solid fortifications. Moreover, the goal of these operations of the anti-Axis forces is to obtain a U.S. Air Force offensive base in order to control the air over Japan. In short, Japan will not be confused by being subjected to partial blows, and is currently strengthening its best defense posture. In partial operations, the dispatch of the fleet will be extremely cautious. Recently, General Tojo and Admiral Shimada were appointed as the Chief of the General Staff and the Chief of the Naval General Staff. This shows Japan's determination to use its best efforts to defeat the anti-Axis offensive, and to establish new anti-offensive operations to cope with the anti-Axis offensive operations with material resources as the greatest weapon.

### Bailianjing Chinese Alcohol Factory Donated to Japanese Navy, Donation Ceremony Held at Naval Attaché's Residence Yesterday

Central News Agency report: Allied Japan is using the strength of the whole country to carry out the Greater East Asia War, striving for the liberation of the East Asian nations, and our people are providing all possible assistance in material and spirit to achieve this great goal. It has been learned that Dong Jiangquan, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Jianyuan Co., Ltd., a large entrepreneur in this city, had previously heard that the Japanese Navy was currently looking for an alcohol factory. On the 9th, the anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war, he explained to the Naval Attaché's Office that he was willing to donate the entire Chinese Alcohol Factory plant in Bailianjing, Pudong, to the Japanese Navy. The Japanese naval authorities were deeply grateful for accepting Dong's kindness and held a donation ceremony at the Naval Attaché's residence last night. Those present included Dong Jiangquan, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Jianyuan Co., Ltd., Tan Yinkang, Manager of the company, and representatives from other relevant parties. The Japanese side was represented by Rear Admiral Kondo, who gave a speech of thanks. According to reports, the factory was initially operated with a capital of 1.5 million yuan and was the most modern alcohol factory. It was once shut down due to the Sino-Japanese Incident and was later managed by the Japanese army and entrusted to Kamejiro Ohashi for operation. In October of the year before last, military management was lifted, and it was returned to our side and renamed the Mainland Alcohol Factory.

Attaché Kondo's speech: This time, the Chinese alcohol is necessary for our navy, and it has been donated automatically. This is an expression of Mr. Dong and all of you in your factory's cooperation in the Greater East Asia War. I am truly grateful. This Greater East Asia War is a great war unprecedented in history. To achieve its goal, it must go through many twists and turns, and the war will become more and more fierce, but the final victory will belong to us without any doubt. Today, the automatic donation of this Chinese alcohol factory often has an important mission in our naval operations, which is unnecessary to say. I would like to express my respect and gratitude to you on behalf of the Imperial Navy.

### Managing Directors and Supervisors of the National Chamber of Commerce Unified Association Continue to Hold Office, Executive Yuan Will Continue to Appoint

Central News Agency report: Since the establishment of the National Chamber of Commerce Unified Association under orders, it has been one year until the 15th of this month. In accordance with the wartime economic control policy guidelines promulgated by the National Government, the material control of major commodities is implemented, especially rice, wheat flour, edible oil, salt, and cotton. The unified collection and distribution has completed its steps. Recently, there have been strong rumors that the term of office of the managing directors and supervisors of the association has expired and will be re-elected. A reporter from the Central News Agency recently learned from the authorities of the Material Control Review Committee that the managing directors and supervisors of the Chamber of Commerce were originally assigned to take charge of the control work and were allowed to be responsible for handling it for one year. Although the articles of association of the Chamber of Commerce did not stipulate a fixed term of office for the managing directors and supervisors, they were to submit a request to the Executive Yuan to send someone else to be responsible for maintaining the control work and resign from their posts at the end of the one-year term. Although the current Executive Yuan authorities have not formally announced a decision, it is said that the managing directors and supervisors of the Chamber of Commerce are all well-known people in the city's financial and industrial circles. Since the establishment of the Chamber of Commerce, under the supervision of the highest authorities of the Executive Yuan and the Material Control Review Committee, they have been able to convey the ruling intentions of the National Government, so the administrative directors of the Chamber of Commerce The Executive Yuan will still appoint them to continue to serve and promote the control mission.

Nanshi to Install Alarm Bells Everywhere

Central News Agency Report: Since the iron gates in Nanshi, on the 1st and 7th of each month, have been opened separately, the traffic in the two districts is unobstructed, which is convenient for pedestrians.

In order to ensure the security and stability of the Yushi area, the Municipal Baojia Committee intends to follow the example of the first district and widely install alarm bells to eliminate crimes invisibly. It is reported that the association has ordered merchants to prepare quotations for approval.

### Nanshi People's Organizations Cooperate to Remove Garbage

The Cotton Control Committee has successively established public warehouses in Shanghai, Nanjing, Dongtai, and other places. Recently, the committee plans to expand the flower-receiving area. In view of the fact that the cotton production in Anhui Province is also quite abundant, in order to facilitate storage, a public warehouse has been added in Anqing, bringing the total number of public warehouses previously established to nine. Furthermore, the committee stipulates that all cotton merchants participating in flower receiving must be registered and licensed, and all cotton received must be stored in public warehouses.

### Songshima Press Officer Refutes Britain and America's Hypocritical Propaganda, Attempting to Conceal Defeats in Counteroffensive Operations

A Central News Agency dispatch reports that Colonel Songshima, the press officer of the Japanese Navy stationed in China, met with reporters yesterday (the 13th). He severely criticized the enemy, Britain and America, for their anxiety over repeated defeats in their Pacific counteroffensive operations and Burma operations, and for their recent major hypocritical propaganda, attempting to conceal the truth.

Britain and America's Operations Lack Goals

Colonel Songshima stated, "This war is called the Greater East Asia War by our Empire, and it has a constructive grand goal. On the contrary, the enemy, Britain and America, have no central goal, only attempting to fulfill their ambition to conquer the world." He added, "Comprehensive enemy propaganda over the past week reflects the failure of the United States in the central Pacific operations and the setbacks suffered by Britain in the Burma operations. Their strategic propaganda is not as boastful as it used to be, but their political propaganda is becoming more energetic." He said, "Their goal is to intimidate weak neutral countries. Regarding their strategic propaganda, the United States expressed dissatisfaction with Britain's Burma operations on the 6th, while the British Governor-General of India sent a telegram to encourage Mountbatten, which was a major satire on the United States, leaving the intermediary side between Britain and America in a dilemma. On the 7th, they frankly admitted the difficulty of the Burma operations."

Enemy Propaganda is Divided and Inconsistent

Following this, on the 8th, Britain announced that bombing Japan was indeed possible. British Naval Secretary Alexander strongly advocated strengthening operations against Japan in the House of Commons and made a judgment. "A number of British naval forces can be deployed in the Pacific." On the 9th, it was reported that the American Knox and Nimitz had met in Washington. The above search propaganda only revealed that Britain and America were shifting responsibility to each other and had no new meaning. As for their political propaganda, there are too many to list. For example, on the 6th, Britain and the United States disagreed fiercely over the Afghan oil issue. On the 7th, Britain withdrew its military envoys stationed in Turkey and stopped supplying Turkey with arms. On the 8th, Britain also took political offensive actions against Turkey, but British Eden avoided mentioning the Turkish issue in Parliament. One point is even more noteworthy: the British left-wing is very concerned about the Chinese Communist Party. On the 7th, the British Communist Party's organ newspaper, "Sunday Worker," extensively publicized the CCP. Also, regarding the Soviet-Finnish issue, Finland has not yet responded to the Soviet Union's peace proposal. As mentioned above, the enemy's propaganda is divided and inconsistent, but all kinds of propaganda are nothing more than a hollow attempt by Britain and America, who have repeatedly failed in direct attacks against Japan and Germany, using different means."

Deceptive Tactics Conceal Defeats

Finally, it is even more important to note that regarding the strategy of Britain toward the conquered areas, it is said that in early March, British and American envoys in Chongqing requested Chiang Kai-shek to allow British and American ground troops, in addition to the air force, to also enter mainland China, but this was ultimately opposed by Chongqing. Also, such as the American Congress saying: giving Chinese or Indians the right to enter the country, this point is not worth mentioning, because can Chinese and Indians still walk across the ocean to America during wartime? In the future, when the war is over and more Chinese people go to America, they will be met with closed doors, which is an expected thing. The United States is not only deceiving the Chinese, but any Asians who are slightly careless will fall into their trap. Britain and America, suffering major setbacks in this Pacific mobile operation and the Burma counteroffensive operation, rely solely on deceptive propaganda warfare, attempting to conceal their defeats, but the facts are obvious, how can they hide everything from the eyes and ears of the world?

### Economic Circles Comment on Clearing Out the Poison

The abandonment of poison by today's economic circles is more harmful to the country than the toxins of opium are to the human body. Therefore, the anti-poison movement in the economic circles is undoubtedly more important and urgent than any other anti-poison movement. The economic circles' anti-poison movement was launched and implemented once last year when collecting coarse cloth, but it was not thoroughly implemented, resulting in "catching small fish and letting go of big fish." The effect at that time was too small. Since then, speculators have become more aware of the inadequacy of national laws and have intensified their efforts, becoming unscrupulous, ultimately turning hoarding and speculation into official-supervised merchant operations, and the price problem has become extremely serious.

The core of the price problem lies in exerting political power. The government's published regulations on punishing hoarding are indeed stricter and more specific than in the past, but whether they have the effect of suppressing prices depends on the means and steps of implementation. This is the consistent opinion of our media circles for the past two years, so there is no need to reiterate it. This time, the National Government resolutely rectified official corruption, not hesitating to submit senior government officials to a special court for strict interrogation and punishment according to law. At the same time, the authorities not only strictly ordered merchants not to engage in illegal transactions, but also prohibited civil servants from engaging in commercial activities. If anyone dares to hoard major commodities, finished products, or raw materials, once found to be true, they will be sentenced to life imprisonment or imprisonment of 15 years or more according to the court. Such a fact and such a law cannot but be said to be a powerful measure for rectifying official corruption. It is hoped that the government authorities will, with this determination, diligently govern and persevere, so that the Chinese economic circles after clearing out the poison will have hope of recovery from now on.

### Rice and Grain Loan Syndicate Adopts Acceptance Bill System with an Annual Interest Rate of 8%, Limited to 700 Million Yuan

In order to promote the purchasing work and alleviate the difficulties of purchasing merchants, the Rice and Grain Control Committee borrowed a large sum of money from banks such as the Bank of China on December 18 last year and signed a general agreement to provide funds for purchasing rice and grain loans. However, the payment method adopted the acceptance bill system, which purchasing merchants requested the loan syndicate to discount. It is reported that this loan is guaranteed by the Ministry of Finance, and the Central Reserve Bank is willing to rediscount the acceptance bills.

Second Phase of Matches and Soap in Nanshi to Be Sold Soon

A Central News Agency dispatch reports that regarding daily necessities such as matches and soap, the Nanshi area has long been supervised by the city's Baojia Committee to implement distribution. The second phase will begin to be sold in the near future. The Nanshi Office of the Shanghai Cigarette, Match, Soap, and Candle Industry Association, in order to help strengthen the distribution mechanism and rectify the industry, yesterday specially sent letters to its affiliated shops, stating that henceforth, the sale of distributed goods should be in accordance with the original quality and quantity, and must not be ambiguous.

Nanshi People's Organizations Cooperate in Clearing Garbage

Garbage accumulation in the entire Nanshi area has not yet had a concrete solution for removal. The season of epidemics is approaching in an instant, which has a great impact on the health of citizens. The Nanshi Sanitation Office has had a request to increase funding due to financial difficulties, but the matter is too slow to address the urgent need. Therefore, the Shanghai Nanshi People's Welfare Association, in consideration of the health of the people in Nanshi, convened a meeting of Nanshi people's organizations at the association at 3 PM yesterday to jointly discuss a plan to cooperate in clearing garbage. It is reported that an agreement has been reached and will be implemented soon.

### Business Leaders Organize the China Industrial Association to Promote the Production Increase Movement and Will Establish It Soon

A Central News Agency dispatch reports that during this Greater East Asia War, increasing production and suppressing prices are important policies adopted by the National Government. However, in order for it to be effective, it cannot be done without the joint cooperation of the people. Business leaders in this city, including Wen Ruiting, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Fu _, and Zhang Deqin, believe that the business community has always lacked welcome and even fewer comprehensive plans. In order to strengthen the industrial structure and strive to increase production to adapt to the needs of the current environment, they have invited various industries to promote it. It is reported that the Ministry of Industry and the municipal authorities of this city deeply appreciate the business community's self-motivated efforts to promote production. The association has been actively preparing for several months, and the participants are all well-known people from all walks of life. It will be held soon

City Women's Association Prepares to Establish a Midwifery Fund Committee

The Shanghai Special City Women's Association, in order to promote the welfare of women in general and relieve the poor, has launched a plan to form a midwives from all walks of life. The conference was held on the fourth floor of 960 Da Shanghai Road (Avenue Edward VII) to discuss the progress. Qu Zhonglun, Chairman of the Association, took the chair and immediately passed the draft charter of the Midwifery Committee and the application method for the management of the Midwifery Fund and other important motions. And designated Qu Zhonglun, Feng Wenfeng. Wu Qinghu. Lin Meishu. Pan _ Dai. Wu Yingzhi. Yuan Huiyu. Fang Jinying. Liu Baizhi. Yu Yuxiu. Zhang Zhixue. Cheng Zhenxian. Zhang Bingyao and other thirteen people as members, and designated Qu Zhonglun as the chairman and Pan Liudai as the secretary. The association will continue to discuss the implementation strategy at the News Federation next week.

Land Procuratorate Detention Center to Be Disinfected Starting Today

Wang, the director of the Shanghai Local Procuratorate Detention Center, said that recently there have been many deaths of criminals due to illness. He said: Since the establishment of this center last year, the number of criminals has been increasing daily, reaching 1,500, but the funds are limited, and the internal supply is quite tight, so various sanitary facilities cannot be handled. Moreover, due to the lack of coal, the bathing habits of criminals when they enter the place and the daily regulations are suspended. Moreover, because 19 of the criminals are small thieves and pickpockets, they are ragged and dirty, causing a foul smell to spread. When they occasionally get sick, the infection spreads. Regarding this issue, I have consulted with the relevant authorities several times. A solution has been found for the coal issue. On the other hand, I have asked the Health Department of the First District Office to implement disinfection work starting tomorrow (the 14th) to prevent the spread of diseases and ensure the safety of prisoners' lives. At the same time, the Land Procuratorate will also grant bail based on the severity of the prisoners' cases to avoid overcrowding of prisoners.

### International Cup Football Tournament to Open This Saturday

One game on the weekend will be Portugal vs. Germany. Also, the league will have two Group C games on Saturday and one Group A game on the weekend, and seven Group C games. It is found that in the Russia vs. Northern Europe game, most of the Russian players are police leaders, so their strength is quite strong.

As for Portugal vs. Germany, Portugal's strength is well known. In the charity match, they defeated the Chinese team 4-3. Although the German team has veterans such as the former French business executive Parker, they are mediocre after all, and the outcome can be predicted.

### National Forum: Random Protection of the Chinese Stock Market

Nian Lin

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, taking Shanghai as an example, with the strengthening of the control facilities, open hoarding and speculative activities such as gold standard, foreign exchange, and coarse cloth have all been severely blocked. Therefore, the public's attention has shifted to Chinese stock trading. Since the resumption of the securities exchange's auction of _ stocks, _ stocks have had a formal market and public market price. In addition to people who usually engage in the buying and selling of goods, gold standard, foreign exchange, and coarse cloth shifting their attention to Chinese stocks, the general salary class who participate in buying _ Chinese stocks are increasing in number. Because the procedures are simple and it is easier to make profits, stock trading can be said to be popular among all levels of Shanghai. Most of these citizens do not have much surplus to invest. In fact, they are forced by the high cost of living, so they pawn and sell or operate in partnership in order to make a profit. However, since the malignant expansion of industrial securities in the second half of last year, this salary class has been greatly affected.

In terms of financial institutions, the total number of investments in industrial securities in recent years has not been formally counted, but based on general observations, the number is often not small. Since industrial securities have had a public market, mortgage loans using Chinese stocks as collateral are everywhere. Especially since the strict implementation of controlled economy, people are generally afraid that commodities will be subject to controlled purchase, while stocks can be freely circulated. Therefore, the collaterals received by the pawnshops are generally stocks. This spring, stock prices plummeted, causing borrowers to be unable to repay the loans, which affected the pawnshops' liquidity. The high interest rates for interbank lending were shocking. Financial institutions had to sell stocks at a loss in order to adjust their liquidity, only seeking to obtain liquidity and not hesitating to cut flesh to heal sores. As a result, stock prices became lower and lower, and the black market interest rates became higher and higher. Banks with solid foundations can still support it, but pawnshops with weaker strength may have been riddled with holes. Is this the blessing of the social economy? Moreover, even pawnshops with sufficient liquidity will regard investing in securities as a dangerous path in the future and shift their capital to direct domestic goods. As a result, stock prices will fall further, commodity prices will be higher, society will become more uneasy, and people's livelihood will become less peaceful.

The current depression in the Shanghai stock market has a great impact, as mentioned above. If the responsible authorities do not strive to provide relief, the repetition of the XinHai Revolution financial crisis may be possible. The impact will not only abandon the hard work of officials and merchants in maintaining the Chinese stock market in the past few years, but it will also be difficult to regain the trust of the general public in building an industrial securities market in the future.

What we now expect from the competent authorities and official leading banks is to not only make prior supervision in the active aspect for the securities market, but also make ex post facto remedy in the passive aspect. Because maintaining the securities market is to protect the interests of investors, and protecting the interests of investors is also to encourage the public's interest in investing in securities and increase the source of industrial capital. In this decline in Chinese stock prices, the competent authorities should urge official leading banks to carefully review the asset actual value of the listed stock companies. If the net assets exceed the total market value of the issued stocks, the official banks should release currency to buy stocks. In this way, on the one hand, the market price of securities can be maintained, the market's silver root will naturally loosen, and the lending interest can also be reduced. At the same time, it can also strengthen the government's control over industry. If the stock market price rises unreasonably in the future, the official leading banks can sell their stocks to contract the currency.

The above is a passive remedy. We hope even more that the competent authorities can prevent problems before they occur, which is to strengthen prior supervision. The competent authorities should conduct a detailed and appropriate investigation and public announcement of the operating conditions and asset and liability status of the Chinese stocks that are being raised, regardless of whether the issuer is a newly established company or an existing old company, in order to protect the interests of investors. For newly established companies, the funds should be verified and the accounts should be audited. In order to learn from the past, when a new company is established in the future, the funds should be handed over to an official bank first. After the official bank issues a certificate, it can be approved to hold an inaugural meeting and register. In this way, cunning people will not be able to collude with unsound financial institutions to falsely establish companies with insufficient content by stealing the sky and changing the sun to harm society. Secondly, the local economic and administrative authorities should strictly implement the regular supervision of enterprises, and review at ordinary times whether the business operations of each enterprise are consistent with the provisions of its articles of association and whether it engages in activities outside the scope of business, which affects the safety of investors' funds. If it is found that the person in charge of the enterprise has committed illegal or regulatory violations, it should be reported truthfully and punished according to law, so that the bad actors in the business community cannot stand and protect the interests of investors.

Again, the stock exchange authorities should recognize the function of the securities market to guide social funds to flow into productive business, and stocks issued by non-productive business and factories that have stopped work should not be allowed to circulate. Also, when stock prices rise and fall too much, the reasons for the rise should be investigated to determine whether someone is manipulating them in secret in order to seek illegal profits. Also, when stock prices suddenly fall, it should also be thoroughly investigated whether someone is taking the opportunity to sell short in an attempt to profit. It should be known that although the exchange is a business institution, it should also be responsible for protecting investors. Therefore, when illegal and opportunistic behavior is discovered in the market, the exchange authorities should first conduct an impartial investigation to avoid being held accountable for others. At the same time, when reviewing the stocks of listed companies, a stricter attitude should be taken, and it should not be too excessive. Not only should emphasis be placed on written reports, but also on the actual investigation. This investigation work can be carried out by exchange staff or entrusted to a credit agency to clarify whether its assets are sufficient and whether its operations are legal, as a standard for allowing its stock to be listed.

Finally, we hope that the central competent authorities will order all companies issuing stocks to publish their balance sheets and profit and loss statements every year, and order the local competent authorities to review and investigate them nearby, so that general investors can understand the financial situation of each company and will not suffer losses due to blind temptation when verifying investment objects.

### This Office Specifically Contracts with Various Hospitals to Provide Free Meningitis Vaccinations for the Poor

Recently, the incidence of meningitis has been increasing daily. This newspaper has repeatedly called on citizens to pay attention to hygiene, and has published preventative measures and treatments. However, in view of the fact that ordinary citizens are generally concerned about hygiene and prevention, but are unable to seek medical treatment once they contract the disease, their lives are at risk. Therefore, for the sake of widespread prevention, we have specifically contracted with the following hospitals to provide free meningitis vaccinations for ordinary poor citizens. Anyone who wishes to be vaccinated can go directly to the respective hospital to apply, without the need for a written introduction from this office. This matter concerns the safety of citizens themselves, so please pay attention. As for those who are already ill and wish to be treated, they can register with this office to apply for a certificate, and we will introduce them to hospitals for free diagnosis and treatment, and provide medication. The hospitals are:

Pingmin Women and Children's Hospital (995 Connaught Road)
Foguang Sanatorium (123 Masnan Road)
Tongren Hospital (Jiujiang Road)
Ximen Women and Children's Hospital (Xujiahui Road)
Hongren Hospital (Chengdu Road, Avenue Edward VII)
Youzhu Hospital (129 Rue des Soeurs)
Shanghai Health Association (Opposite Zhang Garden, Jing'an Temple Road)
China Hospital (32 Ward Road)
Boai Hospital (Penglai Road, Nanshi)
Hudong Hospital (Meizhou Road, Yangshupu)

Meningitis Treatment Certificate

Meningitis, in Chinese medicine, belongs to the category of typhoid fever, called spasm disease, and in children, it is called infantile convulsion. On March 11th, Mr. Zhang Ju published Mr. Dan Tieqiao's Annao Pills, which are an effective medicine for this disease. I have often heard of Mr. Dan's prescriptions, which include pueraria, antelope horn, , chrysanthemum, , Chuan Qiong and other flavors. Is this prescription also the method for treating meningitis? In the 29th year, when I was the director of the Suzhou National Medical Hospital, I encountered several cases of this disease. I imitated Mr. Dan's prescribed formula, and added bezoar, scorpion tail uncaria, and cicada slough, which were indeed very effective. Its medicinal properties have the functions of reducing inflammation, antipyretic, heart-invigorating, and spasmolytic, which is very reasonable when measured with new theories. As for Mr. Nie's method of smelling the nose, it is nothing more than using soap bean to stimulate the nasal mucosa, guiding the congested blood in the brain to relieve the pressure, which is not different from the Western medicine method of bloodletting to treat cerebral congestion. There are many places where Chinese medicine coincides with science, but no one has elaborated on it. What a pity! (Shu Er'an)

Editor's Note:

The Chinese remedy "Soap Bean" is suitable for places in remote rural areas where there are no local hospitals. It has been jointly manufactured by this office, Foci, and Tongren through pooled funds. The simplified treatment is printed and distributed by Lay Buddhist Rong Baiyun, and entrusted to Sanle Products Company on Nanjing Road for distribution.

Discrepancy in the Number of Vehicle License Receipt Amounts

After the Public Works Bureau issued an order to the city's bicycle owners to exchange for new licenses (for the first half of this year), the city's bicycle owners have successively gone to the traffic section of each administrative office to complete the exchange procedures, and many have already received the new hard and soft licenses. I also went to exchange for a new license for a friend a few days ago, but there is something I don't understand: the total amount of fees paid was 72 yuan, but the receipt I received only showed a total of 92 yuan. At that time, all those who exchanged for vehicle licenses were dissatisfied and asked the staff member in charge, but he pretended to be deaf and said nothing. Those who exchanged for vehicle licenses also had no objection. It has now become common practice. (Zhi Yicheng)

Master Kuqi Donates Baofu Method Again

The article "Baofu Method" is Master Sun Nie Yuntai's masterpiece during his illness, with profound implications. Three thousand copies are still sold at the cost price of two yuan per copy in the store, to support scholarships. In addition, Madam Zeng Jifen, Mr. Nie's mother, handwritten Duke Wenzheng's Family Instructions: "One person's advice makes the family healthy, diligence makes the family prosperous, diligence and frugality will never be poor." Lay Buddhist Rong Baiyun donated 300 small scrolls, each still sold for two yuan, all of which will be used to help the poor.

The Chinese Child Welfare Association's current fundraising campaign for the education and upbringing of orphans has received enthusiastic donations from all walks of life. As of yesterday, a total of 432,915 yuan has been raised, but it is still far from the target. In addition to the fact that the association's standing committee members Lin Kanghou and Zhao Puqing have sent letters to each committee member to continue fundraising, it is hoped that all sectors of society will continue to donate to benefit the orphans.

Dr. Cao Offers Preferential Treatment to the Poor and Sick

Dr. Cao Zhifang, a renowned Chinese medicine doctor, is a student of Lu Tu, an internist. He is currently offering preferential treatment to the poor and sick at his senior brother's Qingjie Clinic (No. 5, Bai Bo Fang, Luban Road). For poor primary school teachers introduced by this newspaper, the consultation fee is waived.

Lost and Found: A string of keys was found in front of the Central Market gate in Shiliupu, Nanshi. The owner is requested to come to the secretary's office of the Hualian Tongle Association at No. 194 Nanjing Road between 5:00 PM and 6:00 PM every day to claim it. A small package of gold jewelry was picked up in bus No. 2 the afternoon before yesterday. The owner is requested to go to the Continental Company on the 3rd floor of No. 27 Hu Qing Road between 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM every day (excluding Sundays and holidays) to claim it. (Wu Jiao)

Looking for Citizen's Certificate: I lost a leather bag at the intersection of Chengdu Road and Dagu Road on the evening of December. It contained Citizen's Certificate No. 72326. I hope that whoever finds it will return the citizen's certificate to me by mail, or send it to the social service department of this newspaper. (Zhu Jun)

Acknowledgement: Mr. Jia Yanqi, a director of the Shandong Fellow Villagers Association, donated ham, tea, and preserved eggs worth 1,200 yuan to be used as poverty relief funds. Thank you.

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

It was late October when the orange bridge turned green again, and Makoto's energy had completely recovered. After the land combat exercises in the village of Hara, he returned to the student hall full of energy. After returning, he began to train hard for the sumo wrestling competition.

On that day, he received the report of the fall of Miaohang Town and Dachang Town, and the students' faces showed a triumphant color.

"Tani, someone said there's an express letter for you. Go to the instructor's office to get it."

When Makoto heard these words from the corporal, he suddenly thought of Takao. Perhaps Takao had come to Kure and sent him a letter. His heart was pounding.

However, his expectation was completely the opposite. It was an express letter from his fourth older brother. The letter was scrawled, stating that he had received a notice from the original unit, saying that his brother, Shinichiro, had already died in battle on October 4th.

(Ten)

A good older brother, although the second son, had the prestige of the eldest son in the family. Among his brothers, he was not the most handsome, but he was the most cheerful and robust, and he was also a busybody. He had been the secretary of the Shimoharata Kenmeisha (Healthy Children's Society), and was the head of the cheering squad during his time at the Second Middle School - he was indeed a healthy and energetic brother. And he especially loved Makoto. His mother and brother both relied on him.

(What must his mother be feeling!)

Makoto reread the express letter with tearful eyes. His brother Shinichiro had died in battle in Luodian Town, a suburb of Shanghai. Makoto did not know what kind of place it was, or what kind of battle he had fought, but he could imagine that his brother would have fought a surprising battle, and his death would have been noble. His brother Shinichiro, with his dark face and big eyes, his head under the low iron helmet, charging into the enemy ranks with a rifle, flashed through Makoto's mind in an instant.

Although Makoto shed tears, he also felt a kind of awe-inspiring and strong impulse.

(I can't lose either!)

The shout that he had often shouted in his heart since his father's death, during his elementary school days, was an incomparably more fervent and passionate shout that shook his eardrums.

His year and a half of life in Etajima had made him shout like this. The military consciousness that had unconsciously developed had made him do so. Because Makoto could not help but think that Shinichiro was a private first class, a customs official in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Although his brother must also have been a loyal soldier, he did not make a living as a soldier. On the contrary, Makoto himself, although a student, was dedicating his life to the national army. His position was different from his brother's. Yet his brother had died in battle first. In the Tani family, if there were to be casualties in battle, the first one should be himself -

This was not out of a petty desire for fame because his brother had achieved a glorious death. Rather, it was clear proof that Makoto was already thinking about everything from a military perspective.

He bit his lower lip tightly. He felt sorry for his brother, ashamed of his brother, and felt infinite love and sorrow for his brother - such complex waves were moving in his chest.

In short, Shinichiro's death had a major impact on Makoto. It was as if his concepts of the nation, family, and himself were completely presented before him because of this. Although outsiders did not know it, Makoto's words and deeds changed greatly from this point on.
