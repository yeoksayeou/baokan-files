### On the European Situation

— Chen Binhe

Question: In the past few days, attention from all sectors has shifted from the Japanese cabinet reshuffle to the European situation. Furthermore, many people are extrapolating from the European situation to the East Asian situation. I wonder what your opinion is?

Answer: The current situation in Europe and the East Asian situation are completely separate matters and cannot be discussed together. As for engaging in unwarranted worries based on the European situation, it inevitably invites the criticism of being a busybody!

Question: What is the latest situation in Europe?

Answer: Regarding the European situation, the most notable thing seems to be the assassination attempt on German leader Hitler. Actually, this matter is already yesterday's news and there is no need for speculation. According to reports from various sources, as well as the broadcast speech by leader Hitler, it can be known that the perpetrators were just some non-active German officers, and had nothing to do with any German command. It had no impact on morale or public sentiment. Currently, the German government has appointed Goering as the supreme military representative and Himmler as the commander of the domestic defense forces, which can further strengthen national defense capabilities.

Question: Then what is the trend of the European war situation?

Answer: The future of the European war does not depend on internal German affairs. The key lies in the following two aspects: the Eastern Front, Northern France, and the Balkans. Regarding the battles on the Eastern Front, since the British and American invasion of Europe began, the Soviet Union seized the opportunity to launch a large-scale summer offensive, and the fighting has been fierce. However, on the Finnish-Soviet front in the north, the Soviet army has made no progress after capturing Vyborg. On the southern Ukrainian-Romanian front, the Red Army is also lingering at the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, at a loss. Only the three armies of the "Baltic Coast" in the center and the three armies of "Belarus" have made more progress. The northern route has approached the East Prussian border, and the southern route has also invaded old Poland, threatening Warsaw. However, the German forces in this area have followed their planned maneuvers, dealing blows to the Soviet forces and then calmly withdrawing. The Soviet plan to encircle and annihilate them has not been fully successful.

As for Northern France, although the US and British forces are numerous, the area they have occupied has not yet exceeded one hundred kilometers. The reason why they have failed to advance as rapidly as on the Eastern Front is due to the strong defensive capabilities and clever tactics of the German army, and the lack of fighting spirit of the British and American soldiers.

In addition, there is no significant progress on the Italian front for the anti-Axis forces. Even in the Balkans, which has long attracted attention, the overall situation still favors the Axis powers.

Question: What new developments are there in the relationship between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union?

Answer: From the perspective of the overall world war situation, Britain and the United States are still at a disadvantage, which is an obvious fact. Therefore, in terms of strategy, Britain and the United States have no choice but to be restrained by the Soviet Union. However, as the military and political influence of the Soviet Union in Europe and the Balkans increases, the suspicion and antipathy of Britain and the United States towards the Soviet Union are also increasing. This is also a fact that cannot be ignored. Therefore, we can infer that: the contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in their offensive strategy in Europe will inevitably become increasingly acute; the diplomatic battles between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union over various European exiled governments will become increasingly fierce; and conflicts between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, from strategy to political strategy, are still unavoidable.

Question: What are the anti-Axis powers doing in East Asia?

Answer: The contradictions between the anti-Axis powers in Europe have not yet been fully revealed due to the severity of the war situation. However, the contradictions in their policies towards East Asia are very public. Last year, the Soviet Union refused to participate in the Cairo Conference of Luo, Qiu, and Jiang because of the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact. This year, a new agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union was announced, which shows that the Soviet Union is determined not to be used by Britain and the United States as a pawn in East Asia. This fact has a great impact on the security of Japan's northern borders. At the same time, Britain and the United States are therefore isolated in East Asia. In addition, at this time when the European situation is becoming increasingly critical, Britain and the United States are both feeling exhausted from the European war. Their risky invasion of Saipan and Guam is a manifestation of their inner anxiety when they are exhausted.

### Japan Holds Regular Cabinet Meeting to Review Current War Situation and Decides on Budget Formulation Policy for Next Year

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – The regular cabinet meeting in Japan on the 25th was held at the Imperial Palace at 9:00 AM. Prime Minister Koiso and all cabinet members attended.

In addition, the new cabinet has been discussing ways to strengthen the domestic situation in response to the critical war situation for several days. At the regular cabinet meeting on the 25th, cabinet members exchanged views on measures to address the current war situation. More specific discussions will be held in the future.

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – The budget formulation policy for next year in Japan has been completed after discussions between Minister of Finance Ishiwata and officials from the Ministry of Finance. It was formally decided at the regular cabinet meeting on the 25th and officially announced by the Information Bureau at 3:00 PM on the 25th. The formulation of the new budget is based on the Koiso-Yonai cabinet's policy of total national strength for military purposes. The main points are as follows: The most important objective is to participate in the war with total national strength, utilizing all intelligence and ability, and practicing endurance and hard work to strengthen the system for certain victory and no defeat. In terms of budget formulation and implementation, a mobile formulation policy will be adopted to cope with the war situation, to deal with sudden changes, air raids, and other unforeseen events, and to meticulously review national funds, material mobilization, and labor mobilization plans. The budget will prioritize increased aircraft production and other emergency measures. Based on the above policy, new budgets from all ministries will not be approved, and only the established expenses will be implemented. Outside of the established expenses, provisional expenditures will be made with budget funds. Therefore, the budget control outline and itemized planning methods that have been followed for the past few years will be completely abolished. Matters that need to be implemented due to changes in the situation will be decided by the cabinet or by official meetings. This kind of mobile budget method is quite noteworthy.

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) – Since the Incident, rural areas have been extremely dilapidated, with almost no construction to speak of. Although there are many reasons for the decline, the main ones are: poor security for farmers, unsound local administration, and the inability to find reasonable solutions to issues such as the price and transportation of agricultural products. As a result, production has decreased, and the lives of farmers have fallen into hardship. The impact has caused social and economic unrest, and administrative power has been unable to be exerted. In order to address these ills and seek improvement, the National Economic Committee has specially drafted an outline for rural construction, which was revised and approved by the National Defense Conference, and plans to organize a Rural Construction Implementation Committee in the short term to be responsible for promoting the plan. All parties attach great importance to this, because the universal construction of rural areas is the foundation for the survival and development of our country, and the establishment of the plan outline is the initial work for rural construction. At the same time, during this decisive period, the phenomenon of material shortages can be addressed through the success of rural construction, which will increase production and streamline the supply of materials. This will not only stabilize people's livelihoods and ensure military needs but also contribute to the Greater East Asia War by sharing the major responsibility of building East Asia.

### Outline of the Rural Construction Plan

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) – The general outline of the rural construction plan: Purpose The focus of the policy of our National Government this year is "purifying thought, ensuring security, and increasing production." These three are mutually reinforcing and must be combined as a whole to advance simultaneously. In terms of the order of priority, emphasis should be placed on increasing production... The most prominent reasons are roughly the following six: poor security in rural areas; extortion of farmers by various armed groups; shortcomings in the price, purchasing methods, and marketing of agricultural products; many shortcomings in local administration; lack of thoroughness in farmers' education and lack of farmers' organization; and the lack of vitality and inadequacy of agricultural technology guidance agencies and economic assistance agencies. Now, in order to eliminate these reasons, it is necessary to start with rural construction. Only by engaging in rural construction can we strengthen rural organizations, establish general agricultural development, and further integrate the relationship between urban and rural areas, cultivate national social strength, and promote culture, thereby ensuring China's future leapfrog development. What China suffers most from at present is the soaring rise in prices, the insufficient production of food, the failure to thoroughly implement clean government, the failure to properly reform the tax system, and the failure to achieve peaceful reunification at an early date. How to make the existing army return to farming after demobilization must all wait for the universal expansion of rural construction before a fundamental solution with lasting nature can be obtained. In order to completely suppress prices and reduce the problem of insufficient food, production must be increased and the exchange of products must be ensured. Only then can a clean government be implemented, which greatly depends on the overall reform of local military forces and administrative power. Therefore, the reform of the tax system must first be determined by the consolidation of in-kind taxation and miscellaneous taxes. Therefore, promoting peaceful reunification relies on the implementation of good governance under the rule of our National Government to increase the trust of the people in other regions and their leaders in our National Government and to resolutely break away and return. In order to make the army return to farming after demobilization, rural security must be ensured. In short, all of the above-mentioned points must wait for the early success of rural construction before they can be gradually and concretely realized. Moreover, the administrative power of our National Government and its concept of participating in the war must also strive for rural construction before they can penetrate among the Chinese people. This is without a doubt. Key points of implementation According to the current situation and stage of economic development in our country, rural construction should take the county as the basic unit. The province and the central government are responsible for planning, coordination, guidance, supervision, and promotion, which are described below: First, select experimental counties. Before the experience and guidance capacity for rural construction are mature, one county should be selected in each of the three provinces and one municipality as an experimental county to concentrate the guidance capacity in all aspects here. Based on the results obtained from the experiment, gradually improve and gradually expand. Experimental county area, A, standard for selecting experimental counties. When selecting experimental counties, special attention should be paid to the following points: places with relatively good security; places where transportation is not particularly inconvenient; county magistrates who have a full understanding of and enthusiasm for rural construction and who must be honest; places where there is hope of obtaining farmhouses for training rural youth groups; and places where cooperatives have developed to a considerable extent within the possible scope. (B) Selection of experimental counties and appointment of county magistrates. The selection of experimental counties and the appointment of county magistrates of experimental counties shall be decided in advance by the provinces and the competent departments of the central government. Their term of office is three years. During the term of office, they shall not be dismissed unless there is a particularly serious fault, and those with outstanding achievements shall be eligible for reappointment or special awards. (C) Supervision and guidance of experimental counties. The first supervision and guidance of experimental counties shall be the responsibility of the provincial government. The central government may implement the supervision and guidance affairs in cooperation with the provincial government or in cooperation with the provincial government, and at the same time plan for the overall development of the automobile industry and allocate considerable subsidies to the provincial government for distribution to the experimental counties. (D) Preparation of experimental counties. Before the establishment of the experimental county, the county magistrates and executive staff of each county convened by the central government shall conduct training on rural construction and the concepts and methods of experimental county management.

### Japanese Planes Attack Lingling, Destroying More Than Ten Chongqing Planes, Hengyang Chongqing Troops in Isolation

A certain base on the China Front, 26th (Central News Agency) – A Japanese bomber squadron launched a surprise attack on Lingling Airfield in the late night of the 4th, destroying six Chongqing planes (in addition to two, and seven locations including airfield warehouses, were hit and caught fire. According to reports, on that day, the Japanese bomber squadron flew over Lingling in the dark night, and carried out daring dive bombing amidst the Chongqing army's fierce anti-aircraft fire.

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) – United Press special correspondent reported on the 25th regarding the Hunan war situation as follows: Japanese troops on the Hunan front have gradually compressed the encirclement of Hengyang. The Chongqing troops coming to rescue have not yet been able to break through the Japanese army's encirclement. Therefore, the battle of Hengyang, which has been going on for nearly a month, is gradually reaching its final stage. If the Japanese army captures Hengyang, the salient point of the Chongqing army in the southeast of the city will be removed, and then the attack on the 270-kilometer section of the Yuehan line still in the hands of the Chongqing army will inevitably begin. The correspondent also described the tragic battle of Hengyang as follows: According to front-line news, in the month since June 25, the Japanese army concentrated artillery fire to annihilate the encircled Chongqing army in Hengyang and broke into the New Street outside the old city and broke through the city wall twice to enter the old city. In one month, the Chongqing army only broke through the encirclement in the Ximen urban area twice, and at that time, it contacted the Western rescue troops. However, by July 10, it had been encircled by the Japanese army again. The Chongqing army in Hengyang has three months' worth of food, and other weapons, ammunition, and medical supplies are also supplied by aircraft.

### Ministry of Social Affairs Hosts Capital Reporter Group

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) – The Ministry of Social Affairs hosted capital Chinese and foreign reporters at the Nanjing Joint Recreation Club at 3:00 PM on the 26th, answering questions from reporters. The details are as follows: Regarding the preparation of the Shanghai vagrant labor camp, the current further work is to rectify the second step of preparation.

Currently, only 10 million yuan has been confirmed, and 20 million yuan is still lacking. It is planned to raise funds in Shanghai, so the start-up cost should not be a problem. It is now provisionally estimated that 1,000 vagrants will be accommodated, and the main labor work will be agriculture. Regarding the production work of the Huainan Coal Mine Company, due to the small number of workers, in order to adjust the number of workers in the company, it is planned to establish labor recruitment offices in the Jianghuai area to be responsible for recruiting workers. Regarding the status of labor service in Nanjing, the first task of Nanjing's national compulsory labor is to clear the garbage in the urban area to ensure the cleanliness of the city, which will be gradually promoted in the future. Since it started on June 15, it has been largely completed by July 15. These two areas can be fully completed around August 14.

### All Parties Urgently Hope to Crack Down on Black Market Train Tickets

Nanjing, Jiang, 16th (Central News Agency) – In the past, Huazhong Railway had a large number of passengers, and there were smugglers everywhere. However, the number of tickets sold daily was limited, resulting in a much larger gap between supply and actual transportation demand. As a result, unscrupulous people rushed to buy tickets and resold them on the black market, sometimes exceeding the ticket price by three or four times. This greatly affected the transportation of legitimate passengers. The authorities have issued a general ban, but this phenomenon has not yet been eradicated. In addition, a small number of unscrupulous employees within the Huazhong Railway Company take advantage of their positions to sell black tickets. This is not only a concern for the Huazhong Railway Company's authorities but will also affect the transportation of legitimate passengers. Therefore, it is hoped that the Huazhong Railway Company's authorities will quickly rectify the situation. At the same time, the Ministry of Construction authorities should also earnestly assume their supervisory responsibility to ensure that this undesirable phenomenon is completely eradicated.

### Mufti Ibrahim Calls for Muslim Unity and Struggle for Independence

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – Ibrahim, the Mufti here, in response to the May statement of Grand Mufti Fu Sen of the Islamic Church in Judea, which pointed out the direction for Muslims to advance during the world war, issued a statement on the 25th while bedridden, calling on Muslims to unite and strive for independence (Note: Mufti Ibrahim has been ill in bed since this spring and is currently being treated by Dr. Sakaguchi, Director of the Department of Internal Medicine at Tokyo University). The gist of his speech is as follows: The Islamic nation is now at a critical juncture of survival. At this time, all Muslims must pay attention to the following two points. The first is the long-term spiritual union between East Asia and Muslims. Muslims have always been subject to the aggression of Western European nations, such as the Crusades in ancient times and British imperialism in modern times, which are obvious examples. However, Islam and East Asia have always maintained friendly relations. Whether in China or India, Islam can be spread arbitrarily. In particular, Japan has given great sympathy and support to the independence of oppressed Islamic nations and Asian nations. Therefore, East Asian countries and Japan are all allies of Muslims. The second is that Muslims must always unite sincerely and strive for independence. Opportunities have now matured in various parts of West Asia. Britain fears the encroachment of the United States and is now buying the hearts of Muslims. We Muslims should take this opportunity to form an Arab Federation with the Arabs, unite as one, and prepare to counterattack the British and American forces. Therefore, we must cooperate with East Asia, which is now working hard to destroy Britain and the United States, in order to promote the revival of Muslims. I am determined to devote all my efforts to this path until this goal is achieved.

### Germany Strengthens Domestic Front, Exerts All Efforts to Overcome National Crisis, Goebbels Appointed as Commissioner General for Total Mobilization

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – The German official announcement states that the Head of State has appointed Goebbels as the Commissioner General for Total Mobilization. The following is the gist of the Head of State's order: The situation of the war is now actively demanding that all armed forces and military preparations be exhausted. Therefore, the following points are announced: Marshal Goering, Chairman of the German Defense Agreement Council, has proposed the appointment of a Commissioner General for Total Mobilization in order to adapt life to all the requirements of total war. This Commissioner General may adapt all public gatherings to the total war and ensure that armed forces and military preparations are not affected by human resources. In addition, it is planned to review railway, postal, and other public agencies and public construction sites again, seeking to save a large amount of personnel. Various activities that are not very necessary for the implementation of the war will be restricted, or blocked, or their organization and methods will be simplified, in order to supply the armed forces and military industry with the maximum amount of human resources. The Party Secretary-General shall, according to his own authority, make full use of the Party's power to enthusiastically support all the policies I have ordered.

### Goebbels' Broadcast

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - Houtong News Agency: Dr. Goebbels, the newly appointed Commissioner for Total Warfare, is scheduled to deliver a radio speech at 8:15 p.m. today (2:15 a.m. Shanghai Daylight Saving Time on Thursday), which will take about 45 minutes to complete.

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – Dr. Goebbels, the German Commissioner General for Total Mobilization, broadcast to the nation on the 26th, clarifying the specific program of emergency measures. After being granted extraordinary full powers by the Head of State, Dr. Goebbels expects the German people's public and private lives to be simplified, that is, commerce, transportation, public gatherings, cultural life, etc. will be reorganized. When Dr. Goebbels served as the Defense Commander of Berlin, he implemented all appropriate measures with a small number of subordinates and staff members under repeated bombing by the anti-Axis powers. After Dr. Goebbels takes office as the Commissioner General, he will surely carry out major tasks with a small number of elite doctrines. The German people also keenly feel that it is necessary to strengthen domestic affairs. Newspapers have also been emphasizing the necessity of total mobilization for days. After the announcement of the extraordinary policies of Head of State Hitler, the people of the whole country have the will to fight to the end and stand up to cooperate in overcoming the national crisis.

### Diplomatic Activities Backed by Military Force

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - Houtong News Agency: What measures will the German government take to strengthen military operations? This is the main question that people in Berlin are currently discussing. German newspaper commentary shows that Germany will establish a strong reserve army. A German official spokesman mentioned yesterday the internal mobilization of the German people to seek strict measures for victory. When asked whether German foreign policy will become more active after the recent developments, the answer was that German foreign policy has always been active. The international relations between Germany and its allies in Southeast Europe are particularly close. They often exchange opinions and adjust their steps. Germans firmly believe that military can win. It would be a misunderstanding to think that if military conditions are deemed unfavorable, politics must be placed above military affairs. When asked whether Germany's allies will also take measures to strengthen domestic activities, the answer was that Germany has always been the leader of its allies in terms of war steps. Facts will soon prove that Germany's new measures can encourage allies to rise up and follow suit.

### Ten Million New Soldiers in Training

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - Houtong News Agency, London report claims that according to German soldiers captured on the Normandy front, Germany currently has 10,000,000 new soldiers in training, who will be dispatched during the future decisive battle. The training they receive is the same as that received by the German soldiers before going to the front line.

### Front-Line Generals Express Loyalty

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - Marshal Moddiejian, commander of two German army corps on the Eastern Front, telegraphed Head of State Hitler on the 25th, saying that he was determined to be loyal to the country.

### Details of the German Conspiracy Case: Time Bomb Placed Under the Carpet, Meeting Room Almost Completely Destroyed

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - During the Munich talks, General Beck, Chief of Staff of the German Army, and a few other German generals, dissatisfied with the Nazi Party's guidance on the war, had the idea of assassinating Head of State Hitler. On the 20th of this month, Colonel Stauffenberg of the Army General Staff took the opportunity to visit the headquarters and placed a time bomb under the carpet of the conference room. The bomb exploded at about 1 p.m. on the 20th, but the Head of State suffered burns and injuries, which were not important. Mr. Berger, the Head of State's typist, died shortly after being seriously injured. General Koten, Chief of Staff of the German Air Force, and Major General Brandt, the former Chief of Staff of the German Army Operations Headquarters, died one after another on the 23rd after suffering serious injuries. Among the other staff members, Lieutenant General Schummert and Lieutenant Colonel Lukkmann of the Army were seriously injured, and General Jodl suffered minor head injuries. Generals Buer, Poleyciaz, Scherre, Horschka, Admiral Oetz, and Admiral Schittkamel suffered minor injuries. Despite the above unfortunate events, Head of State Hitler continued the talks with Marshal Mussolini at the scheduled time. Afterwards, according to photos published by a German newspaper, the exploded conference room was almost completely destroyed. All walls and pillars were destroyed, and chairs and tables were broken. Real household glass flew around. At the same time, the German Head of State's camp feared that some domestic communication agencies were occupied by the rebels, so four hours after the incident, at 5:40 p.m., the course of events was announced. At the same time, the reactionaries propagandized that Head of State Hitler had been bombed to death. In response to this, the Head of State personally broadcast to the nation late at night on the 20th, indicating that the Head of State was unharmed. Admiral Nitz also made a broadcast speech, severely criticizing the misconduct and expressing full central sincerity to the Head of State.

### US Special Envoy in Spain Conducts Secret Diplomatic Negotiations, Spellman Active in the Holy City

Vichy, 26th (Central News Agency) - Houtong News Agency, diplomatic circles here have learned that President Roosevelt's special envoy, Donovan, has been conducting secret talks in Madrid for several weeks. They are discussing Roosevelt's secret diplomatic activities as conversation material. It is reported that Donovan has now returned to Gibraltar. When he was in Madrid, he lived in the US Embassy. When Donovan was in Madrid, the White House kept the secret as to who was participating in the talks with Donovan at the same time. While Archbishop Spellman of New York was in the Vatican, Donovan began secret negotiations in Madrid. Donovan was the one who designed Roosevelt's invasion of Africa in 1940 and had long talks with General Weygand in Algiers. It is not yet known whether Donovan hopes to find a second Darlan in Madrid this time. Neutral parties believe that Donovan and Spellman were both ordered by Roosevelt to seek an advantage in his next talks with Churchill.

### German Troops Abandon Roblin After Fierce Fighting, Soviet Troops Advance Towards Vistula River

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - Houtong News Agency: The weak German defenders of Roblin fought to the last bullet before ceasing resistance. The city was besieged by Soviet troops for many days, and now Soviet troops have advanced towards the Rosla River.

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: On the Eastern Front, the war on the southern flank spread to the outposts of the Carpathian Mountains on Monday, where the Red Army resisted or contained the powerful Soviet offensive in the Stanislav district. The Limburg district was also the site of a major battle again, with German troops firmly holding their lines everywhere. The pressure from the enemy against the Yaroslav district and the north bank of the San River became increasingly intense. On Monday evening, after fierce fighting, the enemy established several small bridgeheads on the opposite bank of the river. The offensive operation launched by the German army in the center of the road northwest of Brest-Litovsk the day before went very smoothly. German mechanized units and armored units attacked the Bug River and swept away several enemy bridgeheads. Northeast of Kaunas, particularly fierce fighting occurred. After a fierce battle in the town of Vilkomir, the German army abandoned it. Repeated attempts by the enemy to break into or tear apart the German lines were thwarted.

### General Beck, the Chief Criminal

According to the second announcement on the night of the 20th, the mastermind of the conspiracy committed suicide after the plan failed. General Beck has been executed. This incident has been largely resolved. The despicable plan of the rebellious elements has ultimately come to naught. Dr. Schindammann, the German Minister of Information, announced the death of General Beck on the 21st. General Beck was one of Germany's outstanding staff officers and wrote many works on operations. Today, German military leaders such as General Halder were all influenced by the General. However, due to his opposition to the Anti-Comintern Pact, he resigned in August 1938 after Ribbentrop took office as Foreign Minister. Due to the above reasons, some people have widely publicized the background of this incident. However, due to the German government's lightning measures, Germany has remained extremely calm. On the contrary, it believes that the Head of State's escape from disaster was due to divine protection, so the will to fight has become stronger. In Berlin, troops were dispatched in the city center for about six hours on the evening of the 20th, and machine guns were set up at key locations in the city. It was prepared for German troops to block traffic, which was quite tense for a while. Occasionally, it seemed like searching people's homes, but pedestrians on the street were still talking and laughing freely with the security forces. Since the 21st, Germany has become peaceful.

### Bulgaria Strictly Maintains Neutrality Under Soviet Pressure, German Troops Withdraw from Bulgarian Territory

Budapest, 26th (Central News Agency) – With the understanding of the German government, the Bulgarian government is said to have established the following two policies: 1. Strictly maintain neutrality in the war between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union; 2. Adjust diplomatic relations with the Turkish government. Bulgaria's establishment of this policy is not a sign of breaking away from the Axis camp, but a shift in diplomatic policy based on the understanding of the German government. Due to the recent progress of the Eastern Front war, the Soviet Union's policy of oppression against Bulgaria has gradually intensified. Germany, based on the overall war situation, has had to transfer valuable troops to other fronts. At the same time, in order to alleviate Soviet oppression, it recognizes Bulgaria's policy of strict neutrality. Based on the change in the situation, the main defense forces of the ports of Varna and Burgas on the Black Sea coast have recently been handed over from German troops to Bulgarian troops, and the blackout control and security in the area have been lifted.

### Subtle Response to Soviet Demands

According to an Associated Press report from Ankara: The Soviet government threatened the Bulgarian government, demanding that German troops quickly withdraw from Bulgaria's naval and air bases, otherwise it would declare war on Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government was forced to acknowledge this in principle. A report from Sofia said that with the consent of the German government, the Bulgarian government gave a subtle response to the Soviet Union's request to set up consulates in Varna and Burgas, and requested the Soviet government as follows: 1. A considerable period of hesitation should be given to the conditions required by the Soviet government; 2. Communist propaganda should be stopped in Bulgaria. It is reported that the Soviet Embassy in Sofia has expressed a more favorable attitude towards this attitude.

### Growing Friendship Between Turkey and Bulgaria

Bulgaria's and Turkey's rapprochement is indeed based on the support of the German government, but on the one hand, it is also due to the Soviet Union's oppression of the Turkish government that makes it easier for Turkey and Bulgaria to approach each other. The establishment of the Turkish-Bulgarian trade agreement a few days before the US and British economic sanctions against Turkey can also be said to be one of the reasons for promoting the Turkish-Bulgarian rapprochement. In short, in reality, the Bulgarian government is using Turkey to prevent the invasion of the anti-Axis forces, while the Turkish government can strengthen the tendency of its own neutrality by cooperating with the neutralized Bulgarian government, in order to avoid and reject the demands of the Soviet, American, and British groups to participate in the war.

### Major Battle Unfolds on Normandy Front, Enemy's Combined Offensive Unceasing

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency, military report: On Tuesday morning, the British Second Army concentrated an unprecedented amount of material resources and launched a large-scale offensive on a small position south and southeast of Caen. The ferocity of the offensive increased on the same day. The German side had anticipated this offensive and made careful preparations, so the counterattack was very successful. The British army only formed a gap in one place in the German position, the deepest point of which was 3.5 kilometers (between Saint-Ainter and Pogab). Northeast of Height 88 south of Mezo Angoni, the British army was blocked by the counterattacking German army. The German army still secured the Caen-Falaise highway, which passes through the Ona River to the first US defense area. The British army has not been able to change its line. The US army's attack on the eastern wing of the Cotentin Peninsula has also developed into a large-scale offensive, but it has made very little progress in a narrow area. The German army is currently launching a major counterattack.

### German Rearguard Action South of Florence

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency, military report: On Tuesday, the Anglo-American forces in Italy launched an expected large-scale attack in the area south of Florence. The enemy army particularly emphasized attacking the highway from Bo Jie Bengxi and Monte Fajerton to Florence. The German rearguard units contained all the enemy's突击. After fierce fighting, they disengaged from the enemy and moved north according to plan.

### Soviet Union Declares Restoration of Relations with Poland

Stockholm, 26th (Central News Agency) - Houtong News Agency, Moscow Radio said: The Soviet Union and Poland have restored diplomatic relations. The broadcast did not indicate with which Polish government in which location diplomatic relations were restored, but it probably refers to the Polish Liberation Committee in Moscow.

### The Trends of Naval Strategy

— Ling Qiu

The American navy, which occupies Saipan Island, is boastfully exaggerating. They proclaim that it is as easy as turning one's hand to have the American navy land on the Chinese mainland and advance on the Japanese mainland. But comparing the places the British and Americans have lost since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War with the places they have now recovered, the current situation is merely like a single hair from nine oxen. Can we then exaggerate that naval operations are approaching victory? This is merely the reconstruction of a fragmented and incomplete fleet that suffered a preemptive strike from the Japanese navy at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War. There is nothing surprising. This situation was already known before the war began.

Islands or Warships?

The German war theorist Clausewitz once said that because war is a means of pursuing national policy, the purpose of armed combat, which is a part of war, "is to induce a state in which the enemy people consider making peace more advantageous than continuing the war." Therefore, the purpose of naval operations is to control the largest and widest communication route on Earth—the ocean; to manage and dominate traffic and communication on the ocean, to inflict fatal blows on the enemy's politics, military, economy, and ideology, and to destroy its function. Obtaining this control of the sea is the main purpose of naval operations.

Therefore, if someone believes the American navy's boast that occupying Saipan Island is a decisive victory in naval operations, it is truly a laughable misunderstanding. Occupying an island results in advancing the base of the fleet and aircraft. Therefore, no matter which island is occupied, it also gains control of the sea within two or three thousand kilometers of its vicinity. But if the Japanese fleet were to mobilize, drive out the American fleet, and recapture the island, this control of the sea would vanish like a bubble. Even Nimitz acknowledges: "The Japanese fleet is still completely intact." In this situation, how can the capture of Saipan Island be exaggerated as a victory in naval operations?

To gain control of the sea, there is no other way to grasp the necessary methods and means of controlling the sea other than to annihilate the enemy's main fleet.

Maneuvering or Decisive Battle?

Annihilating the enemy's main fleet, which is the main purpose of naval operations, is not easy. This was true not only in this war but also in the Russo-Japanese War. For example, in the famous battle of February 1904, various methods were used against the enemy's Far East Fleet's base, Port Arthur, including night raids, shelling, blockades, and mine attacks, followed by blocking the port, but these methods could not destroy the enemy fleet. Especially on August 10, the enemy's Far East Fleet, which had launched a major offensive, was intercepted and defeated on the ocean, resulting in the victory of the Battle of the Yellow Sea. However, victory in this auxiliary operation was not enough to ensure true control of the sea. Only after defeating the Russian main fleet, which had traveled a long distance from the Baltic Sea, could Japan secure victory.

In the meantime, Admiral Kamimura, commander of the Japanese Second Fleet, suffered from a stone-throwing incident at his countryside residence, troubled by the public's misunderstanding.

It is foolish to be easily worried or delighted by the trends of auxiliary operations in naval operations. If the enemy advances on Saipan Island, it is a good thing for Japan if it can take advantage of this opportunity to implement a gradual reduction operation of the fleet. Japan also calls this a bleeding tactic. If it can gradually cause the collapse of the enemy fleet, it can be said that it has fully accomplished the purpose of auxiliary operations.

A Decisive Battle?

Compared to the Russo-Japanese War, naval operations in the Greater East Asia War have significant differences in the following aspects:

First, the vastness of the battlefield. The main battlefield of naval operations in the Russo-Japanese War was limited to the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan. However, the Greater East Asia War takes place in the world's largest ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and a large part of the Indian Ocean. Strategic areas are scattered in all directions, and naval forces are also dispersed and deployed in all directions. As a result, it is very difficult to obtain an opportunity to concentrate both sides' forces to hold a decisive battle of the main fleets.

Second, due to the development of modern weapons such as aircraft, submarines, and radio detectors, the nature of maritime operations has changed. In the era of the Russo-Japanese War, naval battles only used surface ships, but now they have added aerial battles and underwater battles, becoming three-dimensional. As a result, because aircraft can use their speed to attack the enemy fleet before it enters the decisive battle, a true fleet decisive battle becomes difficult to achieve. Furthermore, due to the appearance of radio detectors, fleet movements can be detected from tens of thousands of miles away. Therefore, a fleet that knows the movements of the enemy fleet beyond the line of sight and is unfavorable for a decisive battle can avoid it in advance, making a fleet decisive battle even more impossible.

Third, the United States is different from Russia during the Russo-Japanese War. There is no fatal upheaval in politics, economy, or ideology, and there is no desire for an early decisive battle to save the rampant anti-war and war-weariness thoughts and the deepening of domestic unrest. Therefore, a fleet decisive battle cannot be realized quickly.

What is Maneuver Warfare?

However, what should be noted here is that the movements of the American navy have become apparent. That is the American navy's maneuver warfare since this spring. For example, why did the American navy dare to penetrate deep into the Japanese navy's inner line and carry out landing operations on Saipan Island and Omiya Island (Guam)? On the one hand, the American government authorities, because they wanted to give a good impression to the wavering American people in the upcoming elections, and seek a favorable development of the war situation, cannot hide their anxiety. On the other hand, we must think about the dream of Rear Admiral Mahan, who established the basic strategy of the American navy.

According to Mahan's tactics: "If you want to constantly hold control of the sea, you should maintain local superiority and always attack the enemy." By forming the Fifth-Eighth Mobile Force with more than ten battleships and more than twenty aircraft carriers, and advancing on the isolated island of Saipan, their intention is to pursue Mahan's dream. Mahan said: "To defeat the enemy fleet and ensure control of the sea, you should attack the place the enemy considers most urgent, so that the enemy fleet is forced into a state where it cannot avoid rescue, and intercept it on the ocean you desire."

The American fleet thought that Saipan Island was the most urgent place for Japan, and while urgently attacking it, on the other hand, they wanted to intercept the mobilization of the Japanese fleet, prepare the most desirable posture, and stand ready. In response, the Crystal Japanese Combined Fleet only sent a part of it to attack, launched a preemptive strike by aircraft, achieved great results, and made the gradual reduction operation successful, while at the same time, making Mahan's dream vanish like a bubble.

Of course, this is a misunderstanding by the American naval authorities, thinking that the isolated island of Saipan, which has no large airport or sufficient military port facilities, is an important place for Japan, leading to this situation. However, the excellence of the Japanese navy's strategy of cautiously advancing towards final victory cannot but be admired.

But what about Omiya Island? Regarding this question, it is planned to temporarily remain silent and leave it to the readers to consider.

What are the Conditions for a Decisive Battle?

Summarizing the above discussion, it can be summarized into two questions, namely, to what extent will the Japanese fleet tolerate the American mobile fleet's clumsy movements, and where will the decisive battle take place?

Here, it is impossible not to think that, as with army operations, terrain is also an important factor in naval operations.

Before World War I, when Germany was striving to build a strong fleet to promote its world policy, the British Naval Minister Churchill ridiculed: "Your naval fleet alone cannot be called naval power. Your world policy is like standing on clay." Indeed, in World War I, the German navy was prevented from launching an attack on the main battlefield, the Atlantic Ocean, and could only operate in the secondary battlefields of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. This was the result of Germany focusing solely on organizing the fleet and forgetting another element of naval power: strategic terrain. Terrain is so important in maritime operations.

What is the meaning of so-called strategic terrain in naval operations?

First, it has a connection to a suitable naval base. The reason why the American navy did not directly advance on Saipan Island from Hawaii, but spent a great deal of sacrifice occupying small islands such as Makin and Tarawa, can be said to be to obtain a naval base. Occupying Saipan Island can also be seen as building a naval base.

Second, we must be on the inner line, while the enemy is on the outer line. At necessary locations and at necessary times, we can always concentrate superior forces and make a preemptive strike, giving us a grasp of victory.

Moreover, inner-line operations have the advantage of being safe and rapid because the rear communication and transportation routes are short and convenient. The major reasons for the Japanese army's withdrawal from Guadalcanal Island and the German army's shortening of the front line from Moscow were also due to the overextended supply lines.

As mentioned above, which country's navy occupies the advantage of the inner line, and which country's navy is troubled by maintaining an overextended supply line, please open the map and study it. The American Fifth-Eighth Mobile Force claims that it can continue to operate away from its base for several weeks. However, studying the distances traveled across the Pacific Ocean reveals that there are great limitations in operations. But saying more would be a strategic secret. The fleet decisive battleground that determines the rise and fall of Japan and the United States, where it is advantageous to Japan, cannot be explicitly stated. This matter can even be said to concern the future of ten billion people in East Asia. Please imagine it yourself!

Especially today, with the development of aircraft, being able to have large aircraft with long flight times and carrying large amounts of bombs participate in naval battles from land bases is the best condition. Han sees this condition and cannot consider a fleet decisive battle. Regarding this point, the American military authorities will say that aircraft carriers have mobility and attack power and are excellent.

However, aircraft carriers can carry about a hundred large aircraft, and only a few dozen small ones. If they encounter the Japanese air force's divine-skill dive bombing, they will be sunk in an instant. Therefore, the American navy's words are nothing more than propaganda to justify the weak state of the American navy, whose ships have been occupied by Japan on many islands.

Where are they Coming?

American General Nimitz, who occupied Saipan Island, once claimed that because the Japanese fleet is still intact, he expects that there will still be several fierce battles in the future, but he still boasted that it would be as easy as turning one's hand for the American navy to advance north to the Japanese mainland or land west on the Chinese mainland. But in reality, they neither went north nor went west, but instead launched a landing operation on Miyako Island again from the 21st. From this, it is not difficult to imagine how small the strategic position of the Cold Class Island is beyond their expectations, and how difficult it is to operate outside the Mariana Islands. This illustrates the insecurity of the American military's extended supply line. However, what cannot be ignored here is that Japan, in the inner-line camp, although it is said to have a sea area where it firmly holds control of the sea, it cannot be asserted that it is impossible for the American navy to pass through in terms of time and space.

Control of the sea is not building an iron wall on the sea. It is also not setting a sphere of influence with a solid iron lock, preventing the enemy from approaching even one step. The battlefield is a vast and unlimited continent without mountains, valleys, rivers, or roads, and its sphere of influence is at most only to the extent that it does not allow free movement. Therefore, its effect is not absolutely fixed, but rather a relative thing that is inevitably somewhat fluctuating in time and space. This is similar to control of the air. The airspace over Shanghai is completely under Japan's control of the air, and it is absolutely impossible for enemy aircraft to fly freely. But to say that not even one aircraft is allowed to invade is impossible due to the nature of the sky and the performance of aircraft.

Therefore, even if the American military occupies Saipan Island, lands on Omiya Island, and bombs the Ogasawara Islands and Iwo Jima, retaliation is not absolutely impossible. As long as the Japanese navy is still completely intact, and the victory is believed to be about Japan, then the East Asian nation...

Where will the American military attack? When the American military attacks where, will the Japanese fleet mobilize to challenge the suckling? This is still unclear. Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Nation, once instructed in his lecture on Greater Asia: "If the nine hundred million residents of Asia unite and respond in unison, they will definitely not be defeated by the four hundred million minority of Europe."

### Consultative Committee Exchanges Opinions with Police Bureau on Improving Police Administration; Relevant Heads Answer Questions Separately

The Municipal Consultative Committee recently reported that various reports indicated that various problems in security need to be improved. In order to exchange opinions sincerely, the Committee held a symposium with the relevant department heads of the First Police Bureau at 4 p.m. on the 25th (previous day) at the First District Park. Those present included Wu Song, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Zhao Yaoqing, Lin Kanghou, Chen Bin, Xiang Kangyuan, Chen Riping, and Shen Siliang, standing members of the Consultative Committee, and Su Chengde, Deputy Director of the First Police Bureau, Sun Lifu, Chief Secretary, Li Shiyu, Director of the Judicial Department, Lu Qi, Director of the Virtue Administration Department, Gu Gangwu, Director of the Baojia Department, Goshima Shigeru, Director of the Special High Department and concurrently Director of the Economic Security Department, who was unable to attend due to illness, and Zhao Jinqing explained the purpose of the reception, and put forward suggestions for improving four issues. The responsible department heads answered each item separately as follows:

Measures to Improve Residence Permit Renewal

1.  Improve the procedure for renewing residence permits: Each Lianbao office should handle the process separately to avoid men, women, old, and young having to go to the police station to queue in shifts. For a portion of socially prestigious and high-status individuals, consider a method of affixing a necessary seal, without requiring complete fingerprinting, to suit our national customs.

Director Gu of the Baojia Department replied: The procedure for renewing residence permits is based on the revised Sino-Japanese Exchange of Notes of 1942 and 1943. The friendly army handed over the responsibility to the police station. The police station is not allowed to transfer the responsibility to the Baojia. This department referred to the central government's methods and formulated the "Notice on the Renewal of Residence Permits in Shanghai," which has been published in newspapers and stipulates very detailed regulations. There are also flexible measures for those who cannot go to the police station in person. Within the scope possible now, the procedures are simplified as much as possible, and personnel are sent to various bureaus to supervise improvements, in order to provide convenience to the people. As for the fingerprinting issue, it was originally only stipulated that officials above the rank of central government commissioner could be exempted from fingerprinting. In order to suit our national customs and habits, this department has forwarded a request to the central government to allow the use of seals instead of fingerprints. However, since it concerns laws and regulations, a clear order must be awaited. Incidentally, the Baojia fines have been stopped, and there will be unified regulations for Baojia fees.

Organize Self-Defense Corps in Factories

2.  Regarding the organization of special self-defense corps in factories: The police bureau and the factories should cooperate closely to ensure that production is not hindered. The attitude of police supervision should be improved to avoid difficulties for the factories.

Director Goshima of the Special Department and concurrently Director of the Economic Security Department replied: The purpose of organizing special self-defense corps in factories is to enable each factory to have adequate precautions in order to protect production operations. Men aged 16 to 50 do not need to be completely on guard duty, but should jointly assume the responsibility of guarding. The factories can divide the work and arrange for a small number of people to take turns on duty. If there are misunderstandings in police supervision, treating them as ordinary self-defense corps on guard duty, we are now assigning higher-ranking police chiefs and others to handle this, and have strictly ordered them to improve their attitude.

Matters Related to the Inspection of Weights and Measures

Director Lu of the Administrative Department: Regarding the use of weights and measures, if there are dishonest police officers who make things difficult for merchants transporting materials, taking advantage or cheating in the process, this bureau does not conduct inspections at will. Sometimes, we only go for inspection after receiving a report and having evidence. If a violation is found, we will send it to the prosecutor's office according to proper procedures. For minor offenses, we will impose fines. From now on, we will carefully investigate and supervise the handling of cases by various sub-bureaus.

Police Officers Making Things Difficult for Material Transport

3. Regarding the issue of police officers along the way creating difficulties in the transport of materials: Materials that are allowed to be transported freely according to regulations should not be restricted and should be facilitated. Traffic police should limit their duties and not interfere beyond their scope. If any police officer is found to be involved in such matters, they should be severely punished.

Director Goshima replied: Inspecting the transport of materials is the responsibility of the economic police. Except for illegal goods and controlled goods, other ordinary special goods do not require a certificate. They can be transported freely within the city without any restrictions. If ordinary police on the streets have overstepped their bounds, we will step up patrols.

Director Lu replied: Traffic police should not interfere with materials. We have issued repeated orders, but because there are too many, we cannot correct them immediately. We hope that people from all walks of life will assist in reporting so that we can take effective measures.

Director Yao of the Supervisory Department replied: If police officers have violated regulations, they will be severely punished without leniency. We hope that citizens will jointly monitor them and report the facts, time, location, and police number to the bureau in secret so that we can take disciplinary action.

Six Questions Regarding Police Administration

Subsequently, Chen Bin raised six questions: Do ordinary police receive training regularly? What is the current training situation for new police? Has the "tipster" system from the previous patrol room era been improved? Have the judicial procedures of the various sub-bureaus been improved compared to before? Are there regulations for fines on various roads? How is their use allocated? Has the Supervisory Department improved compared to the previous patrol room era? Deputy Director Su and the relevant department heads explained separately. Regarding the first and second questions, the police bureau currently has two police training centers, one on Yulin Road and one at Dapu Bridge. The original regulations and systems of the two places were different, but they have now been merged and unified. The training of new police and the re-education of old police are equally emphasized, and are divided into judicial, Baojia, special high, and administrative classes. The main points of the curriculum are divided into three categories: A. Spiritual training, B. Academic training, C. Technical training. As for the police on duty, general training is also implemented. Each day, the bureau issues training points for attention, which are explained by the bureau chiefs and police officers of each sub-bureau. Soon, after the merger of the first and second police bureaus in this city, more emphasis will be placed on the implementation of general education. At the same time, special attention will be paid to improving the lives of the police, advancing both spiritually and materially, and creating a new and good police force.

Regarding the improvement of the judicial procedures and the absence of the "tipster" system from the previous patrol room era, Director Li Shiyu of the Judicial Department explained: The judicial systems of the patrol rooms of the International Settlement and the French Concession have always been different. Since the merger of this bureau with the Third Police Bureau and the West Police Bureau, a unified judicial system has been established. A judicial department is set up in the headquarters, adopting a centralized duty and scattered deployment system. A judicial section is set up in each sub-bureau, subject to the command and supervision of the sub-bureau chief. The review and guidance of its work is managed by the judicial department. As for the lack of training for judicial police in the past, a judicial police training class has been established in the past six months. In addition to imparting legal knowledge, (tipsters) who have also received the above-mentioned training number more than sixty. Currently, there are plans to improve the level of detectives, and it is planned to recruit a number of university graduates to teach them relevant judicial police knowledge, so that the quality of detectives can be improved and the society can be made safe.

Regarding the police fines, Director Lu Qi of the Administrative Department explained that they are handled in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Interior. The police bureau notifies the person fined in writing, and the fine is submitted to the Finance Department of the First Public Office for verification and entry into the treasury.

Regarding the insufficient number of personnel in the Supervisory Department, the supervisory spirit has not been fully exerted, but the inspectors work day and night, striving to clarify the police atmosphere and benefit the society.

Finally, the standing members of the Municipal Consultative Committee explained in detail the various issues raised today, hoping that the authorities would earnestly improve them. Chen Bin expressed his deep admiration for the efforts of the officials of the police administration to promote improvements. He hoped that the police administration authorities would strictly monitor and report unqualified police officers, whether they are from this country or friendly countries, and that the police training aspect would focus on ideological training. The Committee will do its best to assist in improving the living conditions and treatment of the police. They exchanged opinions sincerely, lasting for three hours, and the meeting ended at seven o'clock.

### Advancing Operations on One Front, Actively Building on Another: Minister Izubuchi Discusses the Current Situation in Hunan

Allied Shanghai - Minister Izubuchi of the Car Reporting Department, who recently made a special trip to inspect the front lines in Hunan, beginning a few days ago, held the department's regular reporting conference at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 26th). Minister Izubuchi personally attended, along with Akahoshi [name obscured]. He met with Chinese news reporters from this city and, on the spot, Minister Izubuchi gave the following speech regarding his observations from his inspection of the Hunan front:

Situation in Hengyang

Minister Izubuchi first stated: This time, I went to the Hunan front to inspect the general conditions in the peaceful zones under the occupation of the Japanese army. Regarding Hengyang, a portion has been occupied by Japanese troops. Since the 15th of this month, even more vigorous and fierce attacks have been launched, and they have advanced along the banks of the Xiang River. The situation is quite favorable, and they have already reached Taizi Wharf, a corner of the city of Hengyang. On the morning of the 21st of this month, the Japanese army also launched a fierce attack on the Yu Xueyue's [Chinese commander] reinforcements sent to Hengyang. They intercepted them in the west of Hengyang from the south, and another Japanese army coming from the south also intercepted that army in the west of Hengyang. Therefore, the current Yu Xueyue's reinforcements are being attacked from both sides and are powerless in this situation. Also, around the 20th of this month, the Japanese 50th Army, which had advanced south from [obscured name], utterly annihilated the defeated troops. In addition, the Japanese army in the Chaling area has also annihilated the defeated troops of Yu's 37th Army, who fled into the western mountains, and on the 22nd, they advanced to Anren. In short, the defeated Yu troops around Hengyang have become [obscured text], unable to regroup and destined for annihilation. Their complete elimination is simply a matter of time.

People Returning

Minister Izubuchi continued: Regarding the highway from Yuezhou to Hengyang, and the highway from Yuezhou to Changsha, most of them were destroyed by the Yu troops when they fled. Especially the [obscured text] between Yuezhou and Changsha, it's quite difficult. However, the Japanese army, while advancing operations on one front, is also actively engaged in construction on the other. With rapid engineering, they have been gradually repairing them, gaining no small amount of help. The Japanese army has put considerable effort and painstaking care into restoring the transportation routes, and the villagers near each road under repair are contributing everything to the Japanese army and are willing to cooperate, thus gaining considerable help in the restoration work. Secondly, in [obscured text] near Changsha, local people have been returning one after another, reflecting the progress in security and construction, and the number of returning people is increasing daily, with a maximum of about 1,100 people per day. As for the situation in the city, although general big stores have not recovered, ordinary stores have gradually resumed business, and there are quite a few new shops set up by Japanese residents, so it is believed that the city will be bright and prosperous in the short term. When Changsha launched the operation, the residents of the area took refuge, but not far away, all taking refuge in nearby villages, living a relatively stable life. This time, when they returned to their hometowns, it was extremely simple, and the Japanese army there, in both its combat operations and construction activities, followed the instructions of the top commander, reassuring the local people deeply. They diligently read and copied the Japanese army's top commander's proclamation of peace, and told it to the general Chinese populace, so the people there trust the Japanese army deeply and cooperate sincerely.

Stable Life

Regarding the situation, farmers are planting rice with peace of mind, and the green fields in the suburbs are a sign of a bountiful year. Therefore, with the gradual restoration of construction and security, the original appearance has been largely restored, and it is believed that after this autumn, it will be even brighter, with a new posture of rebirth. At the same time, the price of rice there is very low, only 1,300 yuan, which is only a little more than one-tenth of the highest rice price in Shanghai. Since Hunan has been occupied by the Japanese army, each area has been transformed from "resistance" to a peaceful zone, and all facilities are more brilliant than in the past. The villagers are all delighted, and because of the continuous inhumane and barbaric behavior of the American air force in Chongqing, they constantly harass and scout, and even blindly bomb unimportant villages. Although there is not much damage, the innocent harm to civilians makes the local people despise them even more.

Smooth Supply

Finally, Izubuchi explained in detail that the shortening of the supply line and the opening of the extended battle line are of great value, and make the operation [obscured text]. Therefore, the communication of the supply line to shorten the distance is not only beneficial to the operation, but also more smooth and unobstructed. However, the enemy Americans in the South Pacific strategy [obscured text], we estimate that they [obscured text] in the overall war situation has been extremely unfavorable, its own in terms of terrain, such as the supply line [obscured text] drag on, its operations more difficult [obscured text].

### Flour and Wheat Control Association: Wheat Purchase Prices Determined, Funds Temporarily Advanced by Purchasing Merchants

After the reorganization and establishment of the Flour and Wheat Control Committee of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, it has now, in accordance with the immediately stipulated measures for the unified purchase and distribution of flour and wheat, designated purchasing merchants to [obscured text] Chinese and Japanese agents to launch wheat purchasing work in various regions within Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces and the two special municipalities of Beijing and [obscured text]. Before the issue of the association borrowing funds from the Sino-Japanese Bank is resolved, all funds for purchasing wheat will be temporarily advanced by the purchasing merchants and interest paid retroactively. As for the purchase price of wheat, it has now been fully determined, but the purchase price of wheat in each region is slightly different. The purchase price of wheat is determined according to the level of commodity prices and the ratio of farmers' lives in each wheat-producing area to determine a reasonable standard price. Therefore, it is expected that this purchase work will be smoother than in the past, and the purchase quantity and performance will exceed the quantity taken in last year, which will benefit the assistance of people's food [obscured text].

### Cotton Production Association Decides: To Develop Cotton Fields in Jiangbei, This Year's Output to Increase by 2.5 Million Dan

The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.

Brief Commentary

### Dance Halls and Electricity Saving

The power supply in this city will be universally restricted again starting next month. The operation of trams will also reduce vehicles and frequency. The reason for the power restriction is the shortage of coal supply, which is a problem of insufficient raw materials, and can also be said to be a passive and unavoidable measure. While we hope that the authorities will do their best to transport coal, we have no choice but to hope that electricity can be rationally adjusted again.

How to adjust it? Production should not be reduced or reduced as little as possible. Living consumption (such as telecommunications, electric irons, refrigerators, etc.) and entertainment venues, etc., should be reduced to a minimum or absolutely prohibited.

Dance halls are one of the entertainment venues, which should not exist at all in this time of war, and the fact that dance halls of all sizes are standing tall and still thriving is already incredible. Since the last power restriction, each dance hall was ordered not to prepare for business after 11 o'clock. However, it is heard that there are still several dance halls in the western district that are still open until 4 o'clock in the morning, which is a clear violation of the law. Why doesn't the Shanghai West Police Department crack down on them? If it is said that the dance hall has been specially approved to operate overtime, it is not known on what legal basis the competent authorities have granted it special approval.

In this repeated call for electricity saving, we hope that these unreasonable phenomena will be quickly eliminated and quickly [obscured].

### Sincere New Cabinet: National Thrust Arises, Minister Matsushima Pens Article Expressing Fighting Spirit

Director of the Japanese side [obscured text] Reporting Department, Colonel Matsushima [obscured name], published an article entitled "The Autumn of the Great East Asia's Total Rise." He expresses his heroic fighting spirit from the perspective of a naval officer. The main points of the original text are introduced as follows:

The enemy unexpectedly made a major issue of this change of the Japanese cabinet and proclaimed that the Pacific war situation was about to end. Their reasons included: [1] The Tojo Cabinet [obscured text] was responsible for the Pacific war situation, [2] Japan would lose the war [obscured text] and organize a new cabinet to begin peace work. However, there is still a part who say that the Japanese new cabinet's policy direction has not changed, and they are warned about the above statements.

Looking at the enemy's intentions, they are nothing more than using political and military strategies to launch a fierce attack on Japan, and especially emphasizing ideological warfare [obscured text]. We are against this covert operation, [obscured text] the achievements [obscured text] the essence [obscured text]. The character of this Japanese new cabinet is that it [obscured text] shares life and death, it is really the crystallization of the red war. Japan [obscured text] will therefore solidify [obscured text] the state of vigorous rise, and complete the [obscured text] situation since history, especially the spirit of cooperation between the army and navy, has been fully demonstrated. It is believed that no matter [obscured text] any difficulties, we will definitely move towards victory. Now that the Divine Land has reached the dawn, it is when we are about to enter the decisive battle scene. We must rise in certain death, and if we are in a dead place, there is nothing we cannot [obscured text]. In short, today is the time for us to suddenly move forward.

### Abolishing Police Offices: Unifying Municipal Police Administration, Scheduled to Take Effect August 1

In order to unify the municipal police administration, the authorities previously established the Shanghai Special Municipal Police Office, with Mayor Chen concurrently serving as the director, to handle all police matters. Now, the First and Second Police Bureaus have been ordered to merge and establish the Shanghai Special Municipal Police Bureau on August 1. Therefore, the existence of the former Police Office is no longer necessary. It will also be abolished on August 1. Hereafter, the city's police administration will be unified under the jurisdiction and management of the bureau, in order to achieve unification.

Two Training Centers Merge

In order to cultivate new police officers, the First Police Bureau of this city has established the Yulin Road Training Center and the Model Police Training Center. In order to unify the educational affairs, the two training centers have been merged to establish the First Police Bureau Training Center, specializing in police training and education. Hereafter, all police training such as judicial, special higher moral administration [obscured text] will be handled by the center. The position of director is still held concurrently by Deputy Director Su Chengde, and Hong Hanbao is appointed as deputy director. As for the heads of various sections, personnel have also been adjusted and have begun handling matters.

### Fourth District Household Flour Vouchers: Universal Sale Begins Yesterday

Regarding the 40th period of flour distribution based on household population in Nanshi, North Shanghai, West Shanghai, and Pudong districts, the Municipal Grain Bureau has approved that each person can purchase one *jin* of No. 2 flour with the flour voucher of that period, and at the same time, half a *jin* of corn flour will still be sold together, for a total price of [obscured text] 27 yuan. It is universally distributed by each district office from yesterday until the 31st of this month.

### Material Allocation for Teachers and Staff of Various Schools

The Municipal Education Bureau, in view of the meager allocations for teachers and staff of public and private schools and the difficulty of life, is planning to handle the allocation of rice and other special effects for high tide relief. It is learned that the Grain Bureau recently sent a letter to the Education Bureau copying the detailed roster of teachers and staff of public and private primary and secondary schools in the city, in order to facilitate the allocation. The bureau has now formally issued a notice to each school, requiring them to report the details of current employees in accordance with the format before August 5, for verification and processing. As it concerns the welfare of teachers and staff, each school is also deeply concerned and will pay close attention to handling it within the deadline.

### Government Employees Riding Vehicles: Purchase Tickets According to Regulations

Regarding government employees in this city riding public vehicles, they should purchase tickets according to the regulations, which has been issued by the authorities. However, it has been found [obscured text] that there are still incidents of refusing to purchase tickets, leading to repeated disputes, which is not right. [Obscured], another order is issued to the staff of all subordinate institutions, who should strictly abide by this in the future and must not refuse, so as not to be blamed.

Reader Scholarship News: Junior High and Elementary School Groups' Exams Completed, High School and University Groups' Exams to be Held Next Week

More than 2,500 students applying for the 7th Readers' Scholarship from this newspaper in the grades of Upper Elementary School 2, Lower Elementary School 2, Upper Junior High 2, and Lower Junior High 2, took the [obscured] special test at Datong University on Xinzha Road yesterday afternoon. They were seated in 23 classrooms, filled to the brim, with orderly arrangements. Although the weather was hot and they were sweating profusely, the students were able to concentrate and focus their minds, handing in their papers on time, which is commendable. The parents who sent their children to the exam were also no less than 500 or 600, waiting outside the door, enduring fatigue, their expectation for their children to [obscured] learn is extremely sincere. This exam was held in the entire school building of Datong University, a quiet and spacious examination room for thousands of Tsinghua students, for which we are deeply grateful. We are also grateful to the professors of Datong University, teachers of the affiliated high school, and students from various universities who have received assistance from this newspaper, who came to the examination hall to invigilate and gave enthusiastic and sincere guidance to the candidates, and will review the examination papers, which will be completed in three or four days. Their enthusiasm and perseverance are deeply admired by the staff of this newspaper. As for the examination date for all high school grades and university freshmen, it is decided to be held on Thursday afternoon, August 3. All details will be announced later.

Initiating the Transfer of Congratulatory Gifts to Help Education

A letter from the colleagues of Yongjia Money Shop says: "Respected editor, [obscured] the member of the Shanghai Money Industry Association, [obscured name] Money Shop, will open on August 3. The manager, Mr. Sun Jia [obscured name], is an advanced figure in the financial industry, has extensive social connections, and has strong financial resources. At that time, people from all walks of life will [obscured] send congratulatory gifts. In order to promote the transfer of congratulatory gifts to the scholarship fund, in order to represent the host of the bank's creation, our bank will send 3,000 yuan to your newspaper [obscured] for receipt, and request publication [obscured] each industry [obscured], then Tsinghua scholars [obscured], and the development of the bank's business can be predicted."

Benefiting From the Chart, Bearing Gratitude

A letter from Li [obscured name], a graduate of the Faculty of Law of the Shanghai French College of Commerce who received assistance from this newspaper, says: "Your newspaper's creation of the scholarship business benefits Tsinghua scholars and is commendable for the country's creation of talent. I have received the scholarship from your newspaper for the previous three semesters. I have completed the university program this semester. I am extremely grateful and remember my roots. At this time, when prices are rising daily and it is increasingly difficult to make a living, the number of parents who cannot afford their children's tuition will inevitably increase, then how many more will be lost to education? I have suffered from the pain of being unable to attend school in the past. Whenever I think of this, I am ashamed, but I am forced by economic conditions, and I can only sigh helplessly! Recently, I have repeatedly seen your newspaper publishing "Reader Scholarship News," which makes me [obscured]. Therefore, I will donate the 600 yuan I received during the period [obscured], along with [obscured] 1,000 yuan, as [obscured], and do my best to donate to express my gratitude. (Omitted below)"

Paper Industry Colleagues Generously Offer Benevolence

A letter from the paper industry colleagues' team says: "Annual living [obscured], the degree sees higher, the general people, running for food and clothing is not far away, how to calculate the education of children? Because of this, the [obscured] time is lost to education, and the talent is buried, which is really a pity [obscured]. Colleagues [obscured] think of this, [obscured] specially asked the colleagues in each paper shop to work hard to freeze a collection of 50,000 yuan, which will be used as a scholarship fund. Knowing that the contributions are small and cannot make up for the needs of the time, only because the financial resources are limited, a trickle is enough to do our best. Now we are sending 50,000 yuan in Central Savings Bonds with the letter, and we ask [obscured] to receive it."

### Large and Small Parks: Number of Evening Visitors Increases Sharply

As it is the hot season in this port, the number of visitors to the parks in the evening has increased sharply. However, the park staff has fixed office hours, so ticket sales stop after 8:30 PM every night, but visitors who entered before 8:30 PM are allowed to continue to cool off. Therefore, in recent days, each park has [obscured] hundreds of visitors staying there until around 11:00 PM every night.

### First Southern District Education Association: Principals' Meeting

National Forum

### Lack of Draft Cattle in Rural Areas: Difficulty in Irrigating

Before the war, in rural villages, out of every ten households, four households would own draft cattle, which they would hire out in turns, enough to maintain the work of drawing water. However, today, because they are forced by life, they have almost sold all the draft cattle they depend on. In our hometown of Pudong, because of the lack of draft cattle, each head of cattle has to cultivate more than 60 *mu*, which is really not enough to rotate. Therefore, 70% to 80% of the rice paddies cannot be irrigated, and the soil in the fields is cracked. If we do not seek salvation and let nature take its course, then the rice seedlings will wither and the autumn harvest will be hopeless. At that time, the losses suffered by the farmers are truly unimaginable. Not to mention anything else, just take soybean cake as an example. At present, each sheet costs 1,150 yuan, and other fertilizer and labor costs are not included. How will the farmers live? Therefore, we urge the authorities to quickly devise countermeasures to rescue the countryside, which is not only the luck of the farmers, but also the future of the people's food. (Chen [obscured] Chang)

### Suggestions to Prevent Embezzlement by Tram Ticket Sellers

Although the company authorities have repeatedly tried to improve and stop the problem of tram ticket sellers dipping their hands into the till. However, the practice of dipping hands has not decreased. The fundamental solution, of course, is to ask the company to increase the salary of ticket sellers as much as possible, at least so that they can maintain a minimum standard of living. If there are still embezzlement behaviors after the salary increase, the following countermeasures may be adopted:

Increase the fare. The first three classes are all 5 yuan, but the used first-class discarded tickets can be returned to the ticket office to get back 2 yuan in cash, and the third-class discarded tickets can get back 3 and a half yuan in cash (these discarded tickets can be exchanged for cash at major cigarette and paper shops.)

Regarding the problem of checking tickets on electric vehicles, the company can cooperate with the Baojia Committee, and the members of the self-defense corps near the station have the obligation to check their tickets when passengers get off the bus. Passengers who do not have tickets must purchase them. If a ticket seller is found to have embezzled, his number must be recorded and reported to the tram company for severe punishment. In this way, passengers must have tickets when they get off the bus. The ticket seller will, of course, have no way to use his skills.

Although the price of tickets can be the same, the color of the ticket surface must be different. And the name of the station where the passenger gets off must be indicated on the ticket for inspection and to prevent abuses. (Cai Liyong)

### Opinions on "Waste Voucher Sticking Flowers"

I read in the National Forum of July 25 that there is a suggestion to use waste voucher stickers to subsidize the education fund. I have a few opinions, which I would like to express as follows:

If damaged legal tender needs to be affixed with flowers, each store will inevitably be picky when accepting legal tender during transactions, and will not accept legal tender that is almost damaged but not yet damaged. What should be done? In the process of transferring payment of legal tender, it is invisibly damaged. If you are not careful, wouldn't you be accepting damage in vain? This is the reason held by the store, which is also correct.

Is the circulation of broken coupons after sticking flowers [obscured]? Both have difficulties. If they are still in circulation, what should be done if the paper quality of the attached printed flowers is damaged again? If it is not in circulation, if citizens have a small amount or a small number to exchange, the value obtained is not enough to cover the cost of transportation, and citizens would rather discard it, resulting in a double loss.

How much of the investigated coupons are received by the National Bank every day must be carefully investigated clearly, so as not to lose more than gain. If the tax rate is too high, citizens will lose more, and there will be more currency in circulation.

To implement waste coupon sticking flowers, the above-mentioned difficulties must be overcome. (Zhong Zuo Zhong Qi)

### Science and Technology Symposium

Bito: Yes. We are proceeding according to this method. If you look at the results of research in various fields, for example, the All-Japan Science and Technology Federation, you will know this when you hear the research results reported. They ask, how can we make our work practical? Anything that can be used is immediately adopted. Let me give you another example, which was decided a few days ago. A certain minister from the Navy, who is engaged in various aspects, said to me, the Navy is engaged in this kind of research, and it seems very useful. According to your opinion, can it be immediately applied to practical work? Since I received a notification ordering me to check whether it is applicable and to give a definite answer, I immediately checked and tested it, and the result was very applicable. Well then, let's adopt it immediately! Let's discuss it with the Ministry of Military Affairs and order the practitioners! This matter has already been in progress for two periods. At least it is a very effective study for enhancing combat power. Hearing that kind of result, we immediately moved it to the production organization within two weeks. In our opinion, at least the conclusions of the research do not require a lot of time and can reach the production organization. Naturally, we will immediately think of ways to contribute to strengthening our power. It is indeed proceeding according to wartime methods. This is the inevitable future for us in the specialized control association, while other enterprises focus on the main future, which is another matter. Generally speaking, modern entrepreneurs often conduct research according to national requirements, so they do not carefully calculate whether it is profitable before applying it to the enterprise. They obey orders, and if the research results are necessary and necessary for the country, then they will produce it, regardless of how much equipment and capital are needed. It is to be implemented after permission, so when specialists estimate that the results of this kind of research have a full possibility of practical application, they will not hesitate and immediately move it to the production organization.

Trial Research Orders and Production Research

Hanada: The simplest work for the Technology Institute is to accept inventions. After receiving them, some are immediately transferred to the military, while simpler ones are immediately ordered to be manufactured with money. For larger-scale projects, trial research orders are issued to start research. At the same time, due to the organizational reform that was eliminated, a new Production Technology Department was born, and production research has also spent a lot of money. Therefore, the object of trial research, or transferred to the hands of entrepreneurs, also needs to be developed and promoted, which is risky, because it may not be produced. All that is necessary for the country must be spent on considerable items for production. The Ministry of Military Affairs' Military Supply Company Bill grants such authority, the so-called pioneering factory, or venture factory, which entrepreneurs are unwilling to do, is constantly produced with government subsidies and assistance. Recently, it has become a controlled economy. It is not easy for an individual to invent something good and want to obtain materials for manufacturing. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible without the government's backing. Or entrepreneurs intend to do it, but the current environment also prevents them from doing so. At the same time, a system has now been established, or entrepreneurs are unwilling to do it, but if it is an important matter, they are forced to do it. We think this range should be like this. To be honest, researching this melodious matter is like sowing seeds and sprouting. Naturally, after sprouting, it will be transplanted to the mountains, but if you think the sprouts have come out and immediately transplant them to the mountains, many will die. All in all, it still needs to be cultivated in the nursery for a considerable period of time. This thing is cultivated in the nursery. Production research should be cultivated in the nursery for a considerable period of time, and only after the branches and leaves have grown strong can it be transplanted to the mountains. In addition, some are not cultivated in the nursery, but are directly cultivated in the mountains. There are still some difficulties in sowing, which are the difficulties for the government. Because it requires a budget and also needs to buy materials. For the larger projects we are researching, we immediately contact the Ministry of Military Affairs or the Army and Navy for trial production. Because everyone is very enthusiastic and the system is not chaotic, everything will definitely go smoothly.

: Regarding what was said just now, what we are researching in the control association, and then using the power of the control association to manufacture it, is insufficient. In addition, there are impossible problems for the control association to do with all its strength, so we have to hand it over to the Technology Institute, and then trial-produce our research, or make it possible to be produced. Generally, the work that technicians do does not ask whether it is for the control association or for the research group, but for the country, everyone should work together.

Inamura: Under such conditions, do the initial researchers have to follow all the way from trial production to final production? Or is it that production has nothing to do with the researchers?

Hanada: Both situations exist.

Inamura: I heard a story from a friend who works in a company that is too拘泥拘泥formalistic, and the research department, trial production department, and production organization have each become independent organizations, so a work is transferred to the trial production department, and then transferred from the trial production department to production. In this case, if the initial researcher follows all the way to the end, the efficiency is very high, and even the smallest details can be noticed. If it is done by someone else, they will not understand the initial researcher's motives and will often arbitrarily change them, resulting in the main point being mistaken, which delays trial production or misses the industrialization deadline, which is inevitable in reality.

Hanada: Recently, we are dealing with a problem, which is to produce resources that Japan does not have from Japanese resources. This is a work that a certain research institute is working hard on. Research began in the summer that was eliminated, and now an answer has already been obtained. This was accepted by the Research Mobilization Conference, and work began after the Research Mobilization Conference. However, this research institute does not have the conditions that a factory should have. Therefore, the previous research of this research institute, after passing the so-called slope, there is only one road left in front. In the industrial aspect, a certain amount of tolerance is required, so you can know that things that were previously biased to the right or left will also be out of line, and materials will also be changed, and production must be carried out according to this purpose. This kind of work is constantly being done in the research institute. Even so, with the people from the research institute as the center, other companies are ordered to carry out production, so all the existing equipment of the factory is used, and additional deficiencies are supplemented, and every moment is raced to move to production as soon as possible. There are still factory problems on this, which is certainly ridiculous, but there are still many unknowns. Then go and work with those who have various factory conditions. Then, with the people from the company as the center, the people from the research institute participate in this place, and at the same time, the company sends people to the research institute to work. The company no longer estimates whether it is profitable or not, and the government subsidizes materials or other items and engages in production. If the research results and items appear once, the Technology Institute will immediately hand them over to the Ministry of Military Affairs.

Ohashi: Now I want to say a few words that are slightly off topic. According to the National Mobilization Law, when the complete collection of trial research is promulgated, although the practitioners spend a huge amount of research funds, the government's rewards are very small, and only the operating expenses and personnel expenses are compensated according to the report submitted to the government. In addition, most factories do not have trial production factories, so they confuse trial products and production products, so that factories that trial-produce too many types will plummet, which is a considerable burden on the enterprise. Therefore, if an enterprise with national significance is not established, it may not be enthusiastic about engaging in trial research. My master believes that the country should have an independent trial production factory. In today's era of few excellent technicians, although trial research orders are issued to many factories, it is difficult to complete the factories, so the reception will be delayed again and again, so I think it is best to mobilize all the excellent technicians to the state's trial production factory. If this kind of trial production factory cannot be realized immediately, at least the excellent technicians from the practitioners should form an organization like a Patriotic Corps. They can help the factories that receive trial research orders at any time. I think this is also possible.

Hanada: During the trial research period, there are also general mobilization trial research orders, and there are also entrusted research that is not so tense. There are also extremely simple forms of entrustment. In addition, there is production research that is no different from a factory, no different from an enterprise. There are naturally various stages in between. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt appropriate placement according to the objective situation. This is an official position, so I think it is very convenient.

The Necessity and Encouragement of Local Improvement

Inamura: Will the Creative Department produce many great results?

Hanada: There have been quite meaningful things. Although I haven't heard everything, those with troublesome procedures haven't encountered resistance, and those who are interested will hand them over to the Army and Navy one by one.

Ohashi: In Germany, in order to organize specialized associations for inventors in cities, efforts are made to corporatize new practical plans. Regarding the issue of raw materials, the practitioners are also rotated to avoid disputes. If a dispute arises, it will be resolved by the arbitration of the association in absentia. The arbitration is composed of officials from the patent bureau, the president of the association, and a director from the same industry as the disputants, three people, so that it can be properly handled.

Inamura: It is enough to make efforts for general things and think that new things can happen. In actual production organizations, meaningful results often come from local improvement movements. In the production organization, the subtle improvements that were previously neglected are said to have achieved good results. Therefore, local improvement is also very meaningful.

Hanada: When local improvements appear, if the quality is good, local improvements can also be guided in a good direction through the bonus system.

Ohashi: The initial policy of rewarding local improvements in production organizations will sometimes grant scholarships to excellent improvements, allowing their children to enter university. Currently, when the fishing industry cannot encourage workers to work hard, the scholarship method is used to incite enthusiasm for the education of children in order to serve the country in the future, which is a good way to kill two birds with one stone.

Reporter: What specific methods does the control association take in such situations?

Bito: The control association is proceeding on a small scale. (To be continued) (Ji You Month April Issue Japan Review)

### The Trend of Japanese Drama Under the Decisive Battle Stage Oyama Isao

Full of Nationality

What needs to be said again is the phenomenon of injecting or maintaining nationality and commonality into drama. Originally, drama (of course, not limited to drama) contains nationality and commonality, which is a matter of course, but in the past capitalist or liberal era drama system, it was not like this at all. In fact, it was the opposite. They thought that money could be made, and any script could be performed, even if the script contained toxins to the national spirit. This is this kind of acting attitude, which does not take into account the interests of the country and the nation. The existence of this attitude should not be allowed, even in peacetime, let alone in today's increasingly fierce decisive battle stage, of course, there is no need for any redundant words.

It is this relationship, because the situation is tight, this attitude has gradually begun to be criticized and pointed out. Due to the active control and guidance of the electric bureau, and the self-consciousness of the actors, the past flaws have been gradually eliminated, especially after the implementation of emergency measures, this elimination movement has been strengthened. The establishment and activities of the wandering troupe mentioned earlier have completely changed their previous mistakes. In addition, not long ago, the amateur actor movement of the Welfare Troupe, which was very popular in local rural areas and weaving factories, can also be said to be moving forward in the right direction. Both of these movements deny the individuality and profitability in drama. The purpose of drama is to comfort the people, provide art and defense, promote national policies, and enlighten culture, etc. As for the above-mentioned nationality and commonality, of course, it is also the attitude that drama should have.

Professional Theater Troupes in Large Cities

Regarding this tendency of professional theater troupes in large cities, it has also been gradually strengthened due to control, but this direction is clearly pointed out in the emergency measures order, and they are forcibly required to comply. Today, after the emergency measures, among some people, there is a lot of talk about national management of drama, group management of drama, etc., as well as the establishment of drama strategy companies and drama corps, etc., which clearly proves that they want to take coercive measures.

This issue, especially from today's subjective and objective situation, only deeply feels subtle and difficult, and the related officials have not even issued any active instructions and explanations, but are hovering in a cautious attitude. However, this kind of performing art form is certainly not allowed to continue to exist today, and must be reformed.

National Drama Creation

Now let's talk about the innovation of drama at present. In the positive aspect, it is to create and establish national drama. In the negative aspect, it is to correct the city, Western European, decadent, suppressive, and consumer defects of modern drama. The former was advocated by a foresighted playwright as early as several years ago, and not long ago, Yao Yimingti has become the unanimous request of all playwrights and cultural figures. Now, the government offices centered on the Information Bureau, as well as the cultural organizations of other surrounding groups, have begun to try hard.

In other words, the Information Bureau takes out huge prizes every year to encourage all theater troupes to participate in the national drama competition, and to commend and reward outstanding works. The Japan Cultural Central League has held a prize competition among all groups called various popular dramas, and has also harvested considerable artistic value achievements. These two things comfort the national life and give it supreme spiritual power. The ideology is based on the Japanese worldview, and the art creates excellent dramas with the Japanese classical drama tradition. At the same time, we must also strive to handle political national dramas such as those launched by the Army, Navy, Military Protection Institute, and other government offices to directly improve fighting spirit and increase production.

Adjusting Show Times

The latter is a system in which the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Metropolitan Police Department implement script checks and performance checks. Therefore, it is to prohibit the performance of Western European and American style dramas, as well as to absolutely prohibit decadent dramas rich in cities, etc. For example, dramas with a boring life as the theme, or erotic dramas centered on women, or comedies that simply cater to low-level tastes, or light musical dramas that always imitate British and American techniques, all need to be oppressed and prohibited. Especially for girls' opera, it should be absolutely banned.

Also, after the emergency measures, the system of performing for two and a half hours is now being debated and argued endlessly, but in advocating shortening the time, it can be said that it is the unanimous request of ten families. In addition, the active control and guidance of the national tour theater troupes centered on the Japan Theater Association is also a noteworthy matter.

Playwrights' Loyalty to the Country

The above is the general trend of Japanese drama on the decisive battle stage, and this is also the undisputed attitude of today's drama. In order to achieve good results in this regard, the commander's government office absolutely needs to establish a powerful unified drama policy, and must implement the playwright's self-consciousness and the active subjective sponsorship promoted.

In recent years, these two aspects have gradually reached the orbit in proportion to the times. Drama is often trapped in a complex and subtle realm due to inheritance. This phenomenon full of mistakes cannot be said to be absolutely absent. Emergency measures are gradually facing a clear ultimate goal and are advancing by leaps and bounds.

According to today's situation, there are still various difficulties, and sufficient results have not been harvested. However, the active leadership of the related government offices, the establishment of the Japan Drama Association, etc., have already been broken through the previous obstacles and have become an effective driving force for creating drama on the decisive battle stage. The kind of "do not talk about national affairs" eccentricity that we often saw in playwrights in the past has disappeared, and now all playwrights are under the true national consciousness, preparing to do their best for their professional posts. The reorganization and adjustment of Japanese drama will surely achieve perfect results in the near future (End) (Translated by An from the Mainichi Shimbun on July 6)

Social Services

### A Summary of Various Undertakings Hosted by This Office: Dedicated to Alleviating Poverty and Sickness

This office organizes six social undertakings with the aim of relieving poverty and sickness, and showing compassion for the orphaned and destitute:

Poverty Relief Fund… To aid the hidden poor and those in abject poverty, as well as widowers, widows, and the helpless, sending them to homes for the elderly.

Orphan Assistance Fund… To educate and care for orphaned children, providing them with opportunities to learn skills and become useful members of society.

Elementary School Teacher Medical Assistance Fund… To subsidize medical expenses for elementary school teachers or introduce them to designated doctors and hospitals for free treatment.

Medical Assistance Fund… To introduce impoverished patients who are unable to afford medical treatment to free treatment or to provide appropriate financial aid for medical expenses.

Maternity Assistance Fund… To protect impoverished mothers, sending midwives for free assistance during childbirth. In cases of difficult labor, hospitalization will be provided, with all expenses borne by this office.

Small Loan Fund… Interest-free loans are provided to unemployed, capable individuals to start small, honest businesses.

This office accepts donations. A little contribution is welcome. We respectfully request that compassionate individuals generously contribute to benefit others and themselves, for which the merit will be immeasurable.

Benefiting the Poor and Sick

Since its commencement on July 1st, the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital at 25 Xizang Road has been providing free consultations, gold needle treatments, and medications for the epidemic section. Moreover, diagnosis and treatment are available day and night, earning it a great reputation. The poor and sick have benefited immensely. In recent days, due to the extreme heat, the number of outpatients at the hospital has surged, reaching over 500 per day, with the number of inpatients approaching 100, making the workload very intense. Furthermore, women and children often appear confused and panicked when seeking treatment, not understanding the procedures. The hospital has assigned dedicated staff to provide guidance and explanations in the waiting area to comfort patients. However, the hospital lacks a foundation fund, and the expenditure on medications is particularly high, with monthly expenses reaching two million yuan. Therefore, it urgently hopes that compassionate individuals from all walks of life will generously contribute and actively donate to ensure that this charitable work does not cease. Donations can be sent directly to the hospital or collected on its behalf by the social service department of this newspaper.

The Nantong Sleeping-Through-Teachings-on-Morality Society regularly promotes morality, influencing people's hearts, and is particularly praised by the world for its practical and realistic approach to various charitable undertakings. In addition to establishing a free smoking cessation clinic this year, it has recently organized tea distribution, setting up over a dozen tea urns at key locations on various roads. They have also hired National Physician Mr. Feng Daozeng to provide free medical consultations and medicine at the society every afternoon at 2 PM, greatly benefiting the poor and sick. However, due to the extraordinarily high prices of goods and financial constraints, they deeply hope that major philanthropists in Shanghai will generously contribute to ensure that the society's charitable endeavors can continue, which is truly a blessing for the impoverished people of society.

The Pude Society on Wenzhou Road is providing summer medical consultations and medicine. To facilitate the treatment of poor patients in western Shanghai and avoid overcrowding, a consultation branch has been established with the agreement of Xu Tianyi Chinese Medicine Store at 120 Jiaozhou Road, starting today. Doctors Xu Renlong and Xu Zichang have been hired to provide free medical consultations and medicine upon presentation of a voucher, without charging any fees.

Guanyu Middle School Offers Aid

Guanyu Middle School, located in the New Market at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Maoming Road, has consistently offered free tuition waivers to aid impoverished students. This summer, with the assistance of the third graduating class, they have raised funds through donations. Applicants for free or half-tuition for all grades of new students can immediately obtain application forms from the school and register. There is no limit to the number of students, and both male and female students are accepted.

He Duanrong Piano Recital

Pianist Ms. He Duanrong will hold a He Duanrong student piano recital at the Lyceum Theatre at 5:30 PM on the 31st of this month. The program includes masterpieces such as Beethoven's grand piano pieces, Chopin's nocturnes, and Mendelssohn's brilliant spinning song. Tickets are priced at thirty, fifty, and one hundred yuan. Sales will begin on the 29th at the Lyceum Theatre. Proceeds from ticket sales, after deducting expenses, will be donated to the Shanghai Conservatory of Music Poor Student Assistance Fund.

Rental Bookstore Seeks Staff Members, Initiated by Yuan Jun and Others: Recognizing the difficulty faced by impoverished students in purchasing books, and to provide assistance, a used book rental service has been launched to allow each impoverished student to borrow textbooks without spending money, thereby reducing their burden. At the same time, students from the middle class can also borrow books. However, due to the small number of staff members, they are unable to manage the operations. Therefore, they are publicly seeking volunteers. Those willing to serve are requested to send a letter as soon as possible to Dong Yuanjun at No. 5, Lane 166, Lingbao Road, Shanghai, indicating their name and contact address for scheduling purposes.

The China Youth Industrial Lecture: is scheduled for this Saturday (3 PM) in the auditorium of the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association. Mr. Shen Jichao will lecture on "The Management and Development of China's Paper Industry." All are welcome to attend.

Lost and Found Residence Permit: Yao Qianli, a candidate for the scholarship from this newspaper, found a residence permit No. 114052 belonging to Yan Wenxin, a child, on Xinzha Road yesterday after finishing the examination. It has been sent to this office for collection.

### Artist Yi Zhihua Founds Art School, Comes to Shanghai to Raise Funds

Dabao'en Temple, outside Zhonghua Gate in the capital, is the foremost ancient temple in Jiangnan (dating back to the third year of the Chiwu era of the Three Kingdoms). The skull of the Great Tang Sanzang Xuanzang is buried behind the temple, named the Sanzang Pagoda. A hall was rebuilt to commemorate him, named the Sanzang Hall. The temple was most prosperous during the Ming Dynasty, with thousands of monks who promoted Buddhism and spread its teachings throughout the country. The teaching was unparalleled. Throughout the dynasties, eminent monks emerged one after another. This special project involves establishing a Buddhist Art College within the temple, with the support of Chairman Wang, Acting Chairman Chen, President Wen, President Jiang, President Chu, Minister Ren, Minister Chen, Governor Chen, Governor Fu, Governor Gao, Military Commander Xu, Military Commander He, Gu Zhongchen, Wen Lanting, Zhu Hexiang, Xu Chongqin, Lin Kanghou, Liu Haisu, Xi Zicheng, Li Tailai, and other prominent figures in the capital.

The Master is proficient in Buddhism, calligraphy, painting and seal engraving. His figures, landscapes, ancient Buddhas, pine trees, and orchids are all elegant, fresh, and unrestrained. His calligraphy in various styles, including Zhong Ding inscriptions, seal script, regular script, cursive script, Wei stele, Han stele, and stone drum script, possesses an aura of overwhelming power. His accomplishments in calligraphy and painting can be considered profound.

Now, the Buddhist Art College is being established at Dabao'en Temple in Nanjing to promote culture, cultivate character, develop Eastern art, enrich monotonous lives, emphasize poetry and music, cultivate advanced specialized talents, expound national culture, train art education teachers, cultivate noble national character, research工艺美術 to promote social beautification. Both students and monks are accepted, regardless of gender. Tuition and board are planned to be completely free, allowing outstanding high school or junior high school graduates who are unable to pursue further education to have the opportunity to study art for free. In addition to the revenue from Dabao'en Temple's properties, the Mountain Master is raising funds from various provinces, cities, and counties. The purpose of establishing the Buddhist Art College is to express through paintings, calligraphy, and writings the deeds of ancient saints and sages from various religions that are sufficient to rectify people's hearts and promote moral education, in order to disseminate them widely in society, so that everyone can be influenced by religion and find spiritual sustenance.

Now coming to Shanghai to raise funds, and bring dozens of figures, landscapes, plum blossoms, orchids, pine trees and Buddhas paintings, all the master's proud works, living in the south courtyard of Guangfu Temple, Fangbang Road, Nanshi, all lovers of calligraphy and painting: do not miss this opportunity. Buddhist Art College is to cultivate talents for the country for free, hoping that enthusiastic social education patriotic gentlemen help, so that the accumulation of sand into a tower, gathering armpits into a fur coat, so that the school will soon be completed, then the religion is fortunate, the country is fortunate.

### Blood and Tears (5) Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Yang

Across the desk covered with blue flannel in the dean's office, the fat I Colonel revealed half of his body.

"It's really a good opportunity. Even though it's a starry night, I didn't leave the school because I had something to investigate..."

"You must be very busy!"

Longfu asked politely.

"No, I always have half an hour. I would like to show the painter who paints warships a submarine."

Although the voice was quite rough, it contained a smile. Ensign Nitta had gone to the city on business, so only Longfu and Jiren were sitting there.

"I have already seen the training ship. Everything is surprising."

Longfu expressed his gratitude.

"I have served on submarines for a long time... Captain Changjian, his hair is completely white. But this is not because of the hardship of living in the submarine. Enduring that kind of hardship is what a soldier should do. Maybe it's more appropriate to say it's a soldier's responsibility. There is no greater responsibility than that of a submarine captain."

"Ah!"

"Of course, it's not that the captain is the only one who works hard. If all the personnel are not nervous, a little carelessness by the helmsman and the water drainage hand can lead to a catastrophic disaster. So the breathing of all personnel must be consistent from top to bottom. At the same time, there is no warship in the world that has such a family feeling as a submarine. Perhaps this is because the lives of all the personnel are supported by the submarine, and everyone, from the captain and officers to the soldiers, eats the same good and bad food. This is not the case in other types of ships. In addition, the captain and officers are very concerned about the soldiers. The soldiers also trust the officers... I have also acted as a matchmaker for a soldier and helped them get married..."

On I Colonel's face, tanned by the sun, shone infinite smiles.

Longfu thought that the reason why such consistent feelings arose might be due to the past that had never been experienced. For example, a group of people fled behind the shady mountain, and practiced hardships and struggles unknown to people for a long time, so they produced unity and sincerity. Isn't this the same as the submarine crew? To be honest, today, when the Pacific turmoil is in full swing, everyone is gradually focusing their attention on magazines and newspapers. Who would talk about submarines? Perhaps submarines will only attract the attention of the world when they encounter difficulties. Jiangfu thought repeatedly in his heart.

"The death of Sergeant Chengqian last August is a concrete manifestation. It is natural to sacrifice oneself to save the flooded water, which is naturally due to the desire to protect the supreme imperial warship's heart, but I think another aspect is the expression of the greatest friendship for the trusted officers and beloved subordinates."

In I Colonel's tone, there was already a meaning of sorrow. (124)
