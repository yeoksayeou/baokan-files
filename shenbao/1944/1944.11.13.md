### The National Government Issues a Statement: Chairman Wang Passes Away in Japan; Decides to Inherit His Legacy and Implement His Hand-Drafted Platform

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - The National Government issued a statement: Chairman Wang went abroad in March of this year for medical treatment at Nagoya Hospital in Japan. His condition improved and worsened intermittently. Unfortunately, he passed away at 4:20 PM on November 10th of this year. All members of the National Government and our nation's soldiers and civilians are deeply saddened by this news. Throughout his life, the Chairman assisted Dr. Sun Yat-sen and later succeeded Dr. Sun in leading the people, dedicating himself to the revolution with the aim of achieving freedom and equality for China and independence and liberation for Asia. Since the return of the National Government to the capital, he has strived to adjust Sino-Japanese relations, promote peaceful unification, increase production, stabilize people's livelihoods, strengthen national defense, pacify local areas, train youth, and cooperate in completing the war, and he has been diligent and hardworking. He ultimately laid the foundation for domestic reconstruction and established alliances of equality and mutual assistance externally. Unfortunately, he passed away prematurely, carrying his ambitions with him to the grave. The National Government vows to lead the nation's soldiers and civilians in inheriting his legacy, overcoming difficulties, and continuing to work hard. We will implement the National Government's platform and basic policies personally drafted by the Chairman, uphold the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Declaration, and work together with allied and friendly nations to complete the war, striving for China's freedom and equality and Asia's independence and liberation.

Over the years, our ally Japan has provided full assistance to our country's independence and autonomy and to the progress of the National Government. The National Government is saddened by this great loss, but our original intention to save China and protect East Asia will not waver. We are willing to work together and move forward towards a bright future. This is a special statement.

A Glimpse of the Respectful Reception of the Coffin

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - After the news of the passing of the Supreme Leader Chairman Wang spread, the whole country mourned, and the entire world grieved. The Chairman's coffin was respectfully brought back to the capital from Japan at 5:30 PM on the 12th. Central Committee members and senior civil and military officials from various ministries and departments of the National Government, as well as military and political leaders from allied nations in China, diplomatic envoys from Germany, Italy, Manchukuo and other friendly nations, and more than a thousand of the Chairman's relatives, personally attended the airport to respectfully receive the coffin. At 5:20 PM, the special "Haiyan" plane flew over the capital, circled once, and then landed at 5:30 PM amidst the sound of national music. Senior civil and military officials from the army and navy formed two rows. Acting Chairman Chen then led Chu Minyi, Xu Sujia, Lin Baisheng, Chen Junxi, Li Ouyi, Chen Changzu, Chen Quan, He Bingxian, and other civil and military officials who were to carry the coffin, approached the plane, and bowed three times in the highest respect. Everyone entered the plane to pay their respects to the deceased. Led by Acting Chairman Chen, the officials carrying the coffin respectfully carried the coffin off the plane. At the same time, mournful music was played, and all those who were receiving the coffin stood solemnly at attention, expressing their deep grief. The atmosphere was extremely solemn. Accompanying the Chairman's coffin were Madam Chen Bijun, a member of the Central Committee, as well as sons, daughters, and Administrative Yuan Secretary-General Zhou Longxiang, and others. The coffin was draped in the national flag. After being respectfully carried off the plane amidst mournful music, it was immediately transferred to a hearse. The hearse was draped in white silk and flanked by national flags. It then departed in an atmosphere of extreme grief. The procession was led by a pilot car, followed by the Chairman's hearse. Acting Chairman Chen respectfully followed behind the hearse, followed by ceremonial guards, the vehicles of those who carried the coffin, and finally more than three hundred vehicles carrying Central Committee members, heads of various ministries and departments, and other officials from allied and friendly nations. The procession stretched for several miles. Along the way, civil servants, soldiers, police officers, students, and civilians wore black armbands and held national flags, lining up to respectfully receive the coffin. They bowed in respect as the hearse passed. The hearse entered the city through Guanghua Gate, passed Zhongshan East Road, Xinjiekou, Zhongshan North Road, Gulou, and Baotai Street, and arrived at the National Government building after more than an hour, around 7:00 PM. Led by Acting Chairman Chen, the coffin was carried out of the hearse by the same officials and into the National Government Auditorium. Inside the hall, a respectful reception ceremony was held. Everyone stood in solemn silence. National music was then played. Acting Chairman Chen, as the officiating officer, took his place and respectfully presented a wreath. Everyone bowed three times to the coffin in the highest respect and observed three minutes of silence in mourning. In an atmosphere of extreme grief, the ceremony was declared complete. Civil and military officials then withdrew in an orderly fashion. The envoys from Japan, Manchukuo, Germany, and Italy also paid their respects. It should be noted that yesterday was Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday. The people of the capital not only remembered Dr. Sun's arduous efforts in promoting the revolution and establishing the Republic, but also received the news of the passing of Chairman Wang, the only successor to Dr. Sun's legacy. This increased their grief and mourning even more. Therefore, all citizens lined up to respectfully receive the coffin. From Guanghua Gate to the National Government building, people stood shoulder to shoulder, blocking the road. The tension and solemnity of the atmosphere were unprecedented. This is because the Chinese people deeply know that Chairman Wang was a faithful follower of the Chinese National Revolution. In his early years, he followed Dr. Sun and traveled for the country. After Dr. Sun's death, he inherited his legacy and led his comrades to carry out the revolutionary cause. When the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred, he saw the difficulties of the time and resolutely issued the "Yan Telegram", advocating for peace. In May of the 29th year [of the Republic], he led the establishment of the government and the return to the capital, seeking peace and unification internally and fostering good neighborly relations externally. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, he led the masses with a determination to live and die together, participating in the war with unity and cooperation, and seeking the restoration of China and the liberation of East Asia, so as to realize Dr. Sun's legacy of Pan-Asianism. Therefore, the Chairman's death is not only a loss of a wise leader for our four hundred million Chinese compatriots, but also a great loss for the future of the liberation of Greater East Asia and even the prosperity of the world.

Chairman's Body Transported Back to the Motherland

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a telephone report from Nagoya: Since this morning, the 12th, the special room of the Nagoya Imperial University Hospital has been crowded with Japanese civil and military officials who came to see off Chairman Wang's coffin for its return to the country. At 7:20 AM, Ambassador Cai Pei first appeared in the room where the coffin was placed. At the same time, at 7:40 AM, Lieutenant Qi Rong of the aide-de-camp held a chrysanthemum necklace and led the way out of the room, followed by the Chairman's family and son-in-law He Wenjie. Lieutenant Qi Rong of the aide-de-camp and Li Fu, director of the Nanjing Central Hospital, and others rode in cars and quietly drove out of the hospital gate. At 8:07 AM, the lead car proceeded, and all general traffic was cut off at the time. This was followed by the Chairman's hearse, and behind it were Secretary-General Zhou's wife, Madam Liang Ruzhuo, Secretary-General Zhou Longxiang, aides-de-camp, and Ambassador Cai Pei. What was visible to everyone was the Chairman's coffin covered with the flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun. Madam Wang and other aides-de-camp attended, and the hearse moved to the hearse at precisely 8:00 a.m. Yasusho, Saito, Kakura, Takagi, Rikikawa, and the hospital personnel bowed their heads to send off. The Chairman's hearse was followed by Madam Wang, Wang Fangdi, Wang Wenxing, Wang Wenbin, and the vehicle of the officials following, then by Japanese Prime Minister Koiso, Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu, Finance Minister Ishiwatari, former East Asia Minister Aoki, former Prime Minister Konoe, General Tojo, Vice Minister of the Army Yuzuki, and various other local civil and military officials, as well as medical personnel in the vehicles following. At 8:50 AM, the hearse arrived at the airfield, at which time all those seeing him off stood in formation and paid their respects to the hearse. The coffin was then placed by representatives of the Japanese Army and Navy, embassy staff, comrades, Madam Wang, the filial sons Wang Wenxing and Wang Wenbin, and others in the "Haiyan" aircraft, the Chairman's favorite plane during his lifetime, under the solemn gaze of important figures from China and Japan. Before long, the engines of the Haiyan roared to life. As the Chairman's coffin was about to bid farewell to Japanese soil, Japanese Prime Minister Koiso resolutely gave a salute. Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu waved his top hat high, standing next to Finance Minister Ishiwatari. Former Prime Minister Konoe quietly lowered his head. General Tojo, with an expression of immeasurable generosity, gave an unmoving salute. Ambassador Cai and other members of the embassy gave the highest respect of more than 90 degrees. This East Asian giant has bid his final farewell and returned to the mountains and rivers of his homeland. Following the Haiyan aircraft, there were two escort aircraft that made a large circuit in the air and then flew to Fukuoka, Shanghai, and the capital, Nanjing, at 9:12 AM on the 12th.

Medical Treatment Overseas

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Propaganda Department issued a public announcement as follows: At 6:00 PM on November 12th, Chairman Wang of the National Government passed away in the afternoon hour on November 10th, 33rd year of the Republic, at the Nagoya Imperial University Hospital in Japan. He was born in the afternoon hour on May 4th, 29 years before the founding of the Republic, and lived for 62 years. The body was respectfully brought back to the country on November 12th to be prepared for encoffining. The national funeral will be held on a selected date, and the closing ceremony will be reverently handled by the Funeral Committee organized by the National Government and the Central Party Headquarters.

Chairman Wang was shot and injured by an assailant while attending the Sixth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee during his tenure as the President of the Executive Yuan in the 24th year of the Republic. He underwent medical treatment both domestically and abroad. Although his health recovered, the bullet left in his back was never removed due to his constant travels for national affairs. Since the start of the peace movement, he had been overly concerned and diligent, and often felt pain. Towards the end of August last year, he began to experience pain in his back, chest, and both sides. Afterwards, the pain gradually worsened, and he underwent surgery in Nanjing on December 19th to remove the bullet. The procedure went well at the time, and the wound was just recovering. However, he was unable to fully recuperate and had to handle numerous national affairs every day. In mid-January of this year, he relapsed with chills and fever, and the wound pain recurred, making it difficult to move. However, he still handled important matters while lying in bed and often summoned cadres and comrades to give instructions in person, working as hard as usual. His body became increasingly difficult to support, and he finally heeded medical advice to seek medical treatment in another location. On March 3rd, he went to Japan and entered the Nagoya Imperial University Hospital, where several of the highest authorities in the medical field were specially assigned to diagnose and treat him, using all possible modern medical methods. During this time, his condition improved and worsened intermittently. For about ten days from the end of September to the beginning of October, and for four days from October 20th, his temperature exceeded 37.5 degrees Celsius, with a slight fever. Otherwise, he remained stable with a good appetite. He maintained a daily intake of 1,500 calories, which was generally similar to before. However, special attention had to be paid to prevent pneumonia, acute heart failure, and other complications. Until 6:00 AM on the 10th of this month, his condition changed dramatically. His temperature rose to 40.6 degrees Celsius, his pulse increased to 128 beats per minute, his appetite was completely gone, and he had difficulty breathing, gradually entering a critical condition. After undergoing X-ray treatment of the spine and pelvic region seven times, the pain in his back and waist was relieved, and his appetite gradually increased. However, due to prolonged bed rest, his body became increasingly weak, and his pulse reached 90 to 110 beats per minute. His sleep was also affected by the pain in his back and waist and the cough. Since the beginning of September, he had been coughing up phlegm and feeling difficulty. Although he was injected with cardiotonics and inhaled oxygen, based on such a condition, he passed away at 4:20 PM on the same day. During his illness, he constantly worried that he would not be able to rise again. He always thought of achieving peace and unification and relieving the suffering of the people, and encouraged all members of the Kuomintang, all comrades of the peace movement, and all national citizens and youth to follow Dr. Sun's teachings internally and implement the Three Principles of the People, and to abide by the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Declaration externally, striving to obtain China's independence and freedom, and seeking the liberation of East Asia, and to cooperate with Greater East Asia to guarantee China's independence and freedom.

Chairman was born seventeen years after Dr. Sun and died nineteen years after Dr. Sun. He followed Dr. Sun and dedicated himself to the revolution for forty years. For the first twenty years, he assisted Dr. Sun, and for the next twenty years, he was Dr. Sun's successor. China's independence and Asia's liberation were Dr. Sun's unfinished ambitions, which Chairman Wang took up and completed. Just as the dawn of the century-old plan for East Asia was breaking, he abandoned his comrades and the people and passed away. All of us who are left behind should uphold his legacy to console Chairman's spirit in heaven.

Japanese Emperor Presents Chrysanthemum Collar Decoration

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a telephone report from Nagoya, after the news of the passing of Chairman Wang Jingwei of the National Government of the Republic of China was released, His Majesty the Japanese Emperor, upon hearing the news, was deeply grieved. When His Majesty the Emperor learned that Chairman Wang's condition was critical, he presented Chairman Wang with the highest honor, the Chrysanthemum Collar Decoration, with the highest courtesy for the head of an allied nation. At 9:30 AM on the 11th, in the VIP room of the Nagoya Imperial University Hospital, accompanied by Prime Minister Koiso, Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu respectfully handed the Chrysanthemum Collar Decoration and the eulogy presented by His Majesty the Emperor to Ambassador Cai Pei. Then, Ambassador Cai Pei held the gifts given by His Majesty the Emperor and respectfully placed them before the late Chairman Wang's coffin.

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - After learning of the passing of our country's Chairman Wang, everyone in Japan was deeply saddened. They all believe that the Chairman was not only the head of China but also a pioneer of East Asia. Since leading the peace movement, he has spared no effort for the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. At last year's Greater East Asia Conference, the Chairman's inspiring speech is still deeply imprinted in the minds of the Japanese people. During the Chairman's treatment in Japan, all parties paid special attention to the Chairman's condition and often silently prayed for the Chairman to recover soon. Now, upon suddenly hearing the sad news, some were so grieved that they wept, and unanimously expressed their deep sympathy for our country's loss of a great leader. They also firmly believe that our country will become even more united, continue the Chairman's legacy, and strive to fight. At the same time, they expressed that they will further cooperate with our country in the future, advance together, and seek the completion of the war and the liberation of East Asia.

Editorial

### Mourning Chairman Wang

Chairman Wang Jingwei of the National Government unfortunately passed away on the 10th of this month. When the sad news arrived, the whole country was shocked and mourned. At this time of decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, when the country's steps are difficult, the sudden loss of a leader is truly the greatest loss for our country.

Chairman Wang's lifelong words and deeds are too numerous to mention. Many special collections have already recorded them, which can be used for later generations to admire and learn from. The Chairman's loyalty to the country, his painstaking efforts, his diligence in governing, his courage to pursue justice, and his perseverance in difficult times are all enough to be taken as a model by those who serve the country in the future. In the past five years, he launched the peace movement with the spirit of "If I don't go to hell, who will go to hell," and without fear of danger, he was born into the world, never changing his mind in the face of adversity, and laying the foundation for the cause of peace. This spirit is especially worthy of respect.

Today, as we mourn the passing of Chairman Wang, at the same time, we should recognize the following points:

(1) Chairman Wang was the successor of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, not only promoting and carrying forward Dr. Sun's doctrines and theories, but also striving to realize Dr. Sun's legacy. Among Dr. Sun's legacies, the Pan-Asianism that concerns the fate of the entire China and even the entire Asia must be completed through cooperation between China and Japan. Dr. Sun once affirmed: "Without China, there is no Japan; without Japan, there is no China." Therefore, Chairman Wang was committed to Sino-Japanese cooperation and the realization of Pan-Asianism. Since the launch of the peace movement and China's participation in the Greater East Asia War, he has further concluded the Sino-Japanese Alliance and jointly issued the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. At this point, Dr. Sun's Pan-Asianism has gradually taken concrete shape and is being gradually realized. This is the most important thing that Chairman Wang has inherited from Dr. Sun's legacy.

(2) At the end of the 27th year of the Republic [1938], Chairman Wang issued the "Yan Telegram" suggesting peace, in which he said: "The purpose of China's resistance is to seek national survival and independence. After more than a year of resistance, the wounds are deep and painful. If the war can still be ended with a peace that is in accordance with justice, then the nation's survival and independence can be guaranteed, and the purpose of resistance will have been achieved...China and Japan are adjacent to each other, and good neighborliness and friendship are natural and necessary. Over the years, the reasons for the opposite direction must be deeply sought and each must) understand their responsibilities. In the future, China should adopt good neighborliness and friendship as its educational policy, and Japan should especially order its people to abandon their traditional ideas of aggression and humiliation towards China, and establish a pro-China policy in education, in order to lay the foundation for permanent peace between the two countries. This is the effort that we should make for the happiness of East Asia. At the same time, we must also work with all related countries to maintain and enhance their friendship and common interests for the sake of the tranquility and order of the Pacific and the peace and security of the world." Since then, the peace movement has adjusted relations between the two countries based on this. For more than five years, facts have proven the correctness of the peace policy, which has gradually evolved to promote the realization of Pan-Asianism. Now, although Chairman Wang has passed away, there is no doubt that Chairman Wang's legacy should continue to be practiced. Since Chairman Wang went abroad for medical treatment for more than half a year, the leaders of the National Government have been able to maintain the central government's politics. In the future, they should not only continue his legacy and strive for its realization, but also reform the officialdom and innovate politics, so that the Chairman's legacy can be further promoted. At the same time, Japan's policy towards China declares that it will remain unchanged. Therefore, the peace policy, the Sino-Japanese Alliance, and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration will only be further promoted in the future and will never be changed.

When Chairman Wang initiated the peace movement, perhaps most people could not understand it. However, now the United Kingdom and the United States have not abandoned their ambition of aggression and are trying to turn the Chinese mainland into a battlefield. On the other hand, China and Japan have concluded an alliance and are working towards a common goal. From this, it can be seen that the peace movement is indeed natural and necessary. Although the foundation for victory in the Greater East Asia War has been laid, there are still many difficulties ahead, which still require the joint cooperation of China and Japan to strive for the realization of the Chairman's legacy, so as to comfort Chairman's spirit in heaven.

### Japanese Government Issues Statement: Strengthening Ties Between the Two Countries, Advancing Towards the Realization of Common Ideals

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - After receiving the news of the death of Chairman Wang of the National Government, the Japanese Imperial Government issued a statement at 6:00 p.m. on the 12th, expressing sincere condolences for the great achievements of the Chairman during his lifetime. At the same time, it stated that the death of the Chairman would not change the relationship between China and Japan in any way. It would uphold the Chairman's will, strengthen the alliance, complete the Greater East Asia War, and realize common ideals, demonstrating an unwavering determination. The Imperial Government's statement said that Chairman Wang Jingwei of the National Government of the Republic of China came to Japan in March of this year for medical treatment. He had been concentrating on treatment in Nagoya, but unfortunately his condition suddenly deteriorated and he passed away. Chairman Wang had long cherished the great ambition of revitalizing China and building East Asia. Inheriting the National Father's testament, he devoted himself to peaceful nation-building and the revival of East Asia until today. His brilliant achievements will forever add glory to history. However, just as the revival of East Asia was halfway completed, heaven did not bless him, and a great star has fallen. The establishment of good-neighborly and friendly relations between China and Japan is based on the revival and defense of East Asia. At this time, when the two nations of China and Japan are more aware of their heavy responsibilities and are striving for even closer unity, China should strive to fulfill Chairman Wang's unfinished ambitions and cooperate even more closely for the future of East Asia. The Japanese government is determined to adhere to its established policy, further strengthen the alliance between China and Japan, and work together to complete the Greater East Asia War, so as to strive towards the realization of common ideals. This statement is hereby made.

Prime Minister Koiso Issues Statement

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Koiso issued a statement on the occasion of Chairman Wang's death, saying: "Chairman Wang of the National Government of the Republic of China came to Japan for medical treatment and passed away in Nagoya on November 10th. I deeply mourn his passing. Chairman Wang received the teachings of the National Father Sun Yat-sen from a young age and was a young revolutionary. He has repeatedly faced dangers and risked his life for the liberation and revival of China, which is well known to the world. In 1937, the unfortunate Sino-Japanese Incident broke out. The Japanese Imperial Government, in view of the century-long plan for China and Japan, was determined to resolve the situation on the spot, but the Chongqing side did not understand our intentions, and the incident expanded. However, Chairman Wang, with a view to the overall situation, responded to the Konoe Statement at the end of 1938, decisively broke away from Chongqing, and resolved to act jointly with the Japanese government for the liberation of East Asia. Chairman Wang eliminated all obstacles for the cooperation between the two countries and finally realized the return of the National Government to Nanjing. Externally, he forged friendly relations with the Empire, and internally, he abolished extraterritorial rights, recovered concessions, and consolidated the cornerstone of the new China's construction. He can truly be called a hero. During the Greater East Asia Conference, the Chairman's demeanor and passionate roar are still firmly remembered in our minds. Now, his sudden passing is deeply mourned and is a great loss to China. However, I believe that his great aspirations and legacy will surely be reflected in his old friends. Here, I offer my sincere praise for Chairman Wang's great aspirations and legacy. At the same time, I hope that the 400 million Chinese people will share Chairman Wang's will and strive for the future and prosperity of China and the development of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani, Speaks

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - After the sad news of the death of Chairman Wang, our highest leader, spread, the whole world mourned. The Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masayuki, specially issued the following condolence speech: "Upon receiving the sad news of Chairman Wang's death and today's welcoming of the remains in Nanjing, I am deeply saddened. I recall that my visit to Chairman Wang at the Nagoya Imperial Hospital on May 27th was our last meeting.

At that time, the Chairman said that in this critical situation, all comrades were working hard, but he (the Chairman referred to himself), due to illness, was unable to manage affairs, which he deeply regretted. The Chairman's words that night are still vivid in my mind. Although the Chairman was on his sickbed, he never forgot about state affairs, but he was deeply troubled by his inability to move freely.

The Chairman did not live to see the realization of the revival of China and the defense of East Asia, and passed away suddenly, which he must have regretted.

Mr. Zeng Zhongming, a comrade of the Chairman, was assassinated in Hanoi, and on his deathbed, he said that state affairs were in the hands of the Chairman. Now, the Chairman, who is responsible for these state affairs, has also passed away suddenly, which is a source of infinite grief. However, I remember that the National Father Sun Yat-sen also held the great ambition of uniting Asia, and although he died halfway, his spirit illuminates the bright future of China, which is known to everyone.

Since Chairman Wang led the peace movement, he has left great achievements in the construction of the new China. He successfully abolished unequal treaties in accordance with the National Father's will, laid the foundation for China's complete independence, and these achievements will be immortalized in history.

On October 30th last year, when the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was signed, I congratulated the Chairman. On the National Father's Birthday Commemoration Day last year, at the National Father's Mausoleum, a ceremony was held to report the realization of the National Father's will. When the Chairman solemnly reported the abolition of unequal treaties, I believed that the spirit of the National Father in heaven must have been overjoyed.

The Chairman's ideal was to complete China's independent autonomy, establish a permanent friendly relationship between China and Japan, and cooperate with each other to strive for the liberation and construction of Greater East Asia. His advocacy has been consistent since he broke away from Chongqing. The loftiness of his ideals and the correctness of his advocacy have been best demonstrated in the subsequent development of the Greater East Asia situation. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, he clarified the policy of sharing weal and woe, and on January 9th last year, he resolutely rose up and declared war on Britain and the United States. The wise decision born of this ideal was the path for China's progress, which was often clearly instructed by the Chairman. The issuance of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration on November 6th last year can also be said to be the result of the Chairman's efforts and the result of his lifelong advocacy. It is no coincidence that the Empire adopted an attitude of absolute support for the Chairman, because the ideals held by the Chairman and the goals pursued by the Empire are completely consistent. Now that the Chairman has passed away, I hope that the colleagues of the National Government can uphold the Chairman's will and make greater efforts to complete his great cause in the future. The Empire will continue to cooperate with you comrades to achieve the great cause you want to accomplish, so as to comfort his spirit in heaven. Although the Chairman is dead, the Chairman's spirit is immortal, and the Chairman's spirit will become more brilliant. I firmly believe that not only the entire Chinese nation and the nations of Greater East Asia will be inspired by his spirit, and will rise up even more to make their greatest efforts for the liberation of Greater East Asia. I heard that the Chairman often remembered the development of the situation and the situation in China before his death. Now, in the decisive battle between Japan and the United States in the Philippines, our side is constantly pressing the enemy. The colleagues of the National Government will also be able to uphold the Chairman's will, strengthen their efforts, and complete their trusted determination. The entire Chinese nation will also be able to recognize the situation, move towards a bright future together, and comfort the Chairman's spirit. Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency)

### Japanese Military Situation in the Pacific Over the Past Week

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - Greater East Asia Weekly War Situation: (1) In the Philippines, enemy American fleets and aircraft carrier groups have been constantly attacked by Japanese aircraft, suffering heavy losses. Currently, they are replenishing large aircraft such as B-24s from bases along the coast of New Guinea and are working hard to strengthen air strikes against Japanese bases in the central and southern Philippines, such as Cebu and Bacolod. On November 5th and 6th, the surviving reorganized mobile units approached the eastern sea of Luzon, and 500 to 600 carrier-based aircraft also raided Japanese bases in northern Philippines. The enemy's mobile unit combat tactics have been greatly changed due to the lessons learned from the fierce attacks by the Japanese army, navy, and air force, and kamikaze teams since mid-October. They are extremely cautious in defense. As for the battle on Leyte Island, the enemy's airfield is repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft and cannot be used arbitrarily. The enemy's rear supply base has also been destroyed, and major bases such as Morotai, northwestern New Guinea, and Admirality have suffered heavy damage. According to enemy American news, the Japanese army on the Philippine front is being continuously strengthened. Currently, the Japanese air force is making every effort to bomb the enemy American transport fleet in the sea. The trend of the Philippine war will shift with the consumption of large amounts of supplies. (2) In the Central Pacific, the enemy army at the southern end of the Palau Islands is trying to advance. Currently, they occupy the mountainous area and blindly attack Japanese positions. They were counterattacked by the Japanese army and forced to retreat. The Japanese army, navy, and air force in the area launched a fierce attack on the enemy American B-29 aircraft base in the Mariana Islands on the morning of the 3rd. On the 7th, they launched two surprise attacks and dropped many huge bombs, causing enemy aircraft and facilities parked on the ground to catch fire and burn down, causing heavy losses to the enemy.

Mr. Wang followed Lord Shengzhai to work as a staff member in the Lufeng County government office. He often practiced calligraphy in the courtyard. His mother, Madam Wu, would always watch him, making it a daily routine. In the evening, after returning from school, Lord Shengzhai would teach him books such as Wang Yangming's "Instructions for Practical Living" and sometimes ask him to silently recite the poems of Tao Yuanming and Lu Fangweng. He said that the foundation of his lifelong classical learning mostly benefited from family education. He also learned calligraphy from his fifth sister's husband, Yuan Yinbai. Yinbai taught him to suspend his wrist and try writing large characters. He initially studied Dong Xiangguang's style, and then referred to Yan Zhenqing's style.

The 20th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Renyi year (1892 AD, the eighteenth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was ten years old.

Mr. Wang was still in the provincial capital of Guangdong, studying with Hu Jiaoru (Jiaju). In this year, Sun Yat-sen and Lu Haodong went to Tianjin from Shanghai and submitted a letter to Li Hongzhang, severely criticizing the strategies for saving the country, with over 5,000 words, hitting the current malpractices. At the end of the letter, he said that agriculture is the foundation of the country and should be developed.

The 17th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Yiyi year (1895 AD, the twenty-first year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was thirteen years old. Mr. Wang went to school in the morning to study for the imperial examinations. After school, he would return home and take one or two books from Lord Shengzhai's collection, ascend to the roof tiles and sit down, reading in the light of the setting sun until dusk. Mr. Wang often said that the books he read at that time were far more interesting than the books for the imperial examinations. Wang Yangming's "Instructions for Practical Living" was his favorite. His mother, Madam Wu, passed away in the Guangdong provincial capital, in the Hao Shen Street residence, at the age of forty-four. On the 27th day of the first month, the Xingzhonghui cadres were officially established in Danton Street, Hong Kong, named Qianheng. In February, at a cadre meeting, they discussed military planning and the national flag with a blue sky and white sun. The design of the national flag was personally made by Lu Haodong. In September, the Guangzhou revolutionary organization was detected by the Qing court, and many people were arrested. Lu Haodong and others were executed. In October, Sun Yat-sen fled to Japan and established the Xingzhonghui in Yokohama.

The 16th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Bingshen year (1896 AD, the twenty-second year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was fourteen years old.

Mr. Wang lived with his eldest brother, Jingwu, given name Zhaoquan, in Lechang County, northern Guangdong. Mr. Wang had a poem about Xishi Cliff: "Laughing, I answer clear chants with distant echoes, leaves are on my leaning turban, wine is in my lap. The sky is light with clouds and the sun is bright, the forest is empty and solemn, even deeper. Touching the dogwood roots, I feel a sense of missing my relatives, inscriptions linger, evoking archaeological interest. The famous mountain is within reach, a dream for people, I happen to encounter a good festival and climb up." Mr. Wang began to write poetry from this time on. In this year, Sun Yat-sen lived in London and wrote "Kidnapped in London." He also wrote his autobiography. The Qing court signed a treaty with France, giving it priority in mining in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan.

The 14th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Wuxu year (1898 AD, the twenty-fourth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was sixteen years old. Mr. Wang still lived with his brother Jingwu in the Lechang County government office, devoting himself to literature and history. In the first month, Sun Yat-sen collected the politics, economy, human feelings and customs of various countries in London, learned from their strengths and made up for his weaknesses, and finalized the Three Principles of the People. In February, he went to Yokohama. In March, Miyazaki Torazo of the Japanese People's Party came to visit on the order of Inukai Tsuyoshi, the leader of the Progressive Party. Soon, he welcomed Sun Yat-sen to live in Tokyo.

The 13th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Jihai year (1899 AD, the twenty-fifth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was seventeen years old. Mr. Wang studied with Zhang Meixuan (Cong) of Panyu in Lechang, devoting himself to the study of literature, history, and statecraft. Zhang had studied with Chen Lantuan (Feng). Mr. Wang's third brother, Shuhe, given name Zhaojun, was his uncle. Mr. Wang wrote essays for the imperial examinations. At that time, Yun Fenghuan, the instructor of Lechang County, from Wenchang County, saw Mr. Wang's articles and said that his writing style was magnificent and unrestrained, predicting that he would be a great person who could turn the world around, praising him endlessly. In this year, Shuhe passed away at the age of twenty-two. Sun Yat-sen's effort to assist the independence of the Philippines failed, and Inukai Tsuyoshi, Hirayama Shu, and Nakamura Yaroku also participated in the matter. He also ordered Chen Shaobai to establish the China Daily in Hong Kong, which was the beginning of the Min Party's newspaper publishing.

The 12th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Gengzi year (1900 AD, the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was eighteen years old. Mr. Wang still lived in the Lechang County government office. At that time, there was the Boxer Rebellion in Beijing, and the Eight-Nation Alliance entered Beijing. Mr. Wang, with a sorrowful heart for the times, was determined to purify the world. Sun Yat-sen opened the Xingzhonghui Congress in Hong Kong, serving as the president. He assisted the independence of the Philippines again, but failed. In May, he planned the independence of Guangdong in Hong Kong. On September 6th, Shi Jianru planned to bomb the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi, destroying the governor's office. Shi was arrested and died.

The 11th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Xinchou year (1901 AD, the twenty-seventh year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was nineteen years old. Mr. Wang returned to the Guangdong provincial capital from Lechang County, living with his second brother, Zhongqi, given name Zhaoxuan. They both took the Panyu County examination. The county magistrate, Qian Puru (Suhao) of Taicang, reviewed his article and placed it first, with Zhongqi third. When he opened the examination papers, he knew they were brothers. At the end of the examination, they were switched with Zhongqi. The county had the Yushan Academy, which examined scholars with essays every month. Magistrate Qian obtained Mr. Wang's paper and always praised it greatly. He summoned him many times. At the prefectural examination, Gong Xianzhou (Xinzhan), the prefect of Guangzhou, placed Mr. Wang in the first place. (Jiangcai's note: When I compiled Mr. Wang's chronological biography, I asked Mr. Xie about the prefectural examination in Xinchou year. Mr. Xie's reply stated that regarding the matter of the Jingwei Mr.'s elder brother winning the Guangzhou prefectural examination in the 27th year of Guangxu, at that time, Jingwei Mr. and his brother named Zhao Xuan took the examination together. The examiner, admiring the writing, placed Jingwei Mr.'s brother first. The younger brother's writing was indeed superior to his difficult brother, and it was said that he should not be ranked second. The staff member said that the younger brother should not be ranked ahead of the elder brother. The younger brother said: "Using a jade ruler to measure talent only considers the writing, regardless of age. If you blindly follow the order, you would lose the original intention of measuring writing to seek talent." Therefore, Jingwei Mr. was made the champion, and his brother was placed second. This is the truth of that day.) Soon, he was appreciated by the educational commissioner, Zhu Zumo of Guian. Li Zhun, the admiral of the Guangdong navy, heard of Mr. Wang's name and hired him as a private tutor, teaching his sons to read. In this year, Zhongqi passed away at the age of twenty-four. Two widowed sisters-in-law and one orphaned nephew relied on Mr. Wang's income to live. Mr. Wang felt that the national situation was becoming increasingly dangerous and urgently wanted to save it. Therefore, he and Gu Yingfen, She Zhi, Zhu Dafu, Li Wenfan, Hu Yisheng, and his nephew Zu Zedao, organized the Zhiji Yixue Society at the Xian Street Xilan Academy in Guangzhou, studying practical learning and encouraging each other.

The 10th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Renyin year (1902 AD, the twenty-eighth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was twenty years old. Mr. Wang still lived in the provincial capital, teaching students and also taking the academy examinations. In the third month, Zhang Binglin held a China National Humiliation Memorial Meeting in Tokyo, which was obstructed by Cai Jun, the Qing government's ambassador. Sun Yat-sen was in Yokohama and led dozens of overseas Chinese to the scene. Seeing the situation, he knew it was impossible, so he returned to Yokohama and held the memorial ceremony. In this year, the Empress Dowager Cixi issued an edict for the Hundred Days' Reform.

The 9th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Guimao year (1903 AD, the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was twenty-one years old. Mr. Wang passed the examination to become a government-funded student in the Law and Politics Accelerated Course in Japan. At that time, the Governor-General of Liangguang was Cen Chunxuan, and the Director of Academic Affairs was Zhang Mingqi. Mr. Wang entered Nihon University to study law and politics. The president of the university, Ume Kenjiro, saw Mr. Wang's paper and was surprised. Therefore, he specially granted him an interview and praised him deeply. After Mr. Wang entered the university, he learned about the doctrine of civil rights, which merged with his existing nationalistic thoughts, resulting in a great change in his thinking. He engaged in translating books. The money he earned was used as tuition for specialized courses. His monthly income was sixty gold coins, which was enough to support his family and help his friends. He said that studying law and politics abroad allowed him to understand the concept of the state and the concept of sovereignty residing in the people. The so-called monarchy was abandoned like dung. His original nationalistic thoughts rose up, and merged with the newly acquired civil rights thoughts, and he decided on a revolutionary direction. In the winter of that year, Sun Yat-sen established the Revolutionary Military Academy in Tokyo.

The 8th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Jiachen year (1904 AD, the thirtieth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was twenty-two years old. Mr. Wang was still in Japan, living with his family in the Ryukoku-kan in Nakasarugaku-cho. In this year, he graduated from the accelerated course and re-entered the Faculty of Law, Nihon University. Sun Yat-sen went to Hawaii to reorganize the Tan Shan Xin Bao, personally writing editorials and debating with the Bao Huang Dang's (Protect the Emperor Party) Xin Zhongguo Bao. He also wrote "The True Solution to the Chinese Question," which was the first declaration to the outside world by the party members.

The 7th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Yisi year (1905 AD, the thirty-first year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was twenty-three years old. In July, Sun Yat-sen founded the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) in Tokyo, Japan, in the Kokuryukai (Black Dragon Society) in Hinokicho, Akasaka District. Mr. Wang went with Zhu Dafu to visit Sun Yat-sen at the Kindeikan in Kami-cho, and joined the Tongmenghui as a member. On the 30th, the Tongmenghui held a preparatory meeting and publicly elected Mr. Wang to draft the charter. On August 20th, the inaugural meeting was held at the residence of Itamoto Kanemi in Kasumigaseki, Akasaka District. Sun Yat-sen was publicly elected as the president, and Mr. Wang was a councilor. They discussed forming the Min Bao to promote revolutionary strategies. The Min Bao was published on October 21st. Mr. Wang, along with Hu Hanmin, Zhu Dafu, Zhang Binglin, Huang Kan, Liu Shipei, Wang Dong, Tang Zengbi, Tan Renfeng, Chen Tianhua, Hu Yanhong, and Zhu Jiaren, successively wrote editorials. Mr. Wang wrote articles advocating revolution, and the governor of Guangdong was shocked. He sent Zhu Shuqin (Zhiying) to Tokyo to persuade him, asking him not to discuss revolution, and tempting him with generous government funding for studying abroad and high official positions after graduation. Mr. Wang refused to see him. In this year, Mr. Wang's fifth sister, Yuan, passed away in Yangjiang, Guangdong.

The 6th year before the founding of the Republic of China, Bingwu year (1906 AD, the thirty-second year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Mr. Wang was twenty-four years old. Mr. Wang graduated from the Faculty of Law, Nihon University, and received a Bachelor of Laws degree. (He ranked second among more than 300 classmates at the time.) After graduation, he followed Sun Yat-sen to Nanyang to establish a branch of the Tongmenghui in Kuala Lumpur. He also went to Penang to establish a branch of the Tongmenghui. In Wu Shirong's Bilan Garden on Penang Island, he talked about revolution with Chen Jun and Xiangwu. They then went together to Singapore to introduce him to Sun Yat-sen and joined the Tongmenghui. In June, he returned to Japan from Nanyang. On December 2nd, the Min Bao held its anniversary celebration at the Kinkikan in Tokyo. (The following continues on page 4)

### Yesterday Was Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birthday: Citywide Grand Commemoration, People from All Walks of Life Hold Commemorative Meeting

Yesterday was the 79th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday. At 9:00 AM, people from all walks of life in the city held a grand commemorative meeting. Simultaneously, the City Party Headquarters, the City New Life Movement Branch, and the City Headquarters of the Youth Corps jointly organized ten mobile propaganda teams to carry out propaganda activities in various districts of the city. In the evening, Liu Yangshan, Chairman of the City Party Headquarters, broadcast to the national public on Shanghai Radio. The commemorative event throughout the city was extremely enthusiastic.

Meeting Circumstances

Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, people from all walks of life held a grand commemorative meeting at the Grand Theater. Attendees included bureau chiefs Liang Xiuyu, Su Chengde, Ye Xuesong, and Chen Qiushi from various municipal bureaus. Participants from all walks of life included over two thousand municipal civil servants, party members, military and police personnel, security personnel, youth corps members, and representatives from civic groups. The City Police Bureau band made a special appearance to play music, creating a very enthusiastic and uplifting atmosphere. The venue was decorated simply and solemnly, and the ceremony began on time. Yuan Ludeng and Liu Yangshan served as chairmen. After performing the ritual procedures, Yuan Ludeng delivered a speech: He briefly stated that today's meeting of all sectors to commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday is of great significance, which all of you present already deeply understand. Dr. Sun Yat-sen endured hardship and created the Republic of China, devoting himself for more than forty years, striving for the revolution until his death. Therefore, on this auspicious day commemorating Dr. Sun Yat-sen, we should practice Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, promote Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit, and at this time of the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, we should work even harder shoulder to shoulder with our ally Japan to overcome difficulties, develop a spirit of fearlessness, and achieve the true autonomy and independence of the Republic of China, and so on. Subsequently, Liu Yangshan, Chairman of the City Party Headquarters, and Chen Binhe, the President of this newspaper, delivered speeches one after another, offering many warnings. Then, Liang Xiuyu, representing the presidium, led everyone in shouting slogans: (1) Realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, (2) Implement revolutionary principles, (3) Overthrow England and America and defend East Asia, (4) Complete unification and revitalize China, (5) Long live the Three Principles of the People, (6) Long live the Republic of China. The ceremony concluded, and afterwards, the China Film Greater East Asia newsreel and the film "Kai Feng" were screened until noon when the meeting adjourned.

Chen Binhe's Speech

President Chen of this newspaper said in his speech: Today is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's 79th birthday. Although Dr. Sun Yat-sen has been dead for nearly twenty years, every year on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday, the people of the whole country remember and reminisce with the most enthusiastic feelings because Dr. Sun Yat-sen's achievements in leading the revolution and creating the Republic of China, as well as inspiring the direction we should take, are truly great. There are three points worth mentioning when we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday today: First, in November of the 13th year of the Republic (1924), Dr. Sun Yat-sen gave a lecture on Pan-Asianism in Kobe, Japan. In January of the 14th year of the Republic (1925), he declared in Beijing the abolition of unequal treaties. Even in his will before his death on March 12, he still remembered the abolition of unequal treaties because Dr. Sun Yat-sen believed that unequal treaties were shackles that bound the nation's freedom, and they must be abolished to achieve an independent and autonomous nation. After Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, domestic disputes continued, and unequal treaties still existed. It was not until the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, when China declared war on England and America, and Japan implemented its new policy towards China, that all concessions in China were returned by various countries and consular jurisdiction was abolished with Japan's sincere cooperation. By this time, the century-old shackles of unequal treaties were abolished, and the nation's independence and autonomy could be achieved. We believe that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven will surely be pleased and gratified for finally realizing the abolition of unequal treaties that he never forgot. Secondly, since China joined the Greater East Asia War, China and Japan have formed an alliance, forging a close relationship from sharing weal and woe to sharing life and death. Later, the allied nations initiated the Greater East Asia Nations Conference and issued the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, which further affirmed the mutual benefit, equality, coexistence, and co-prosperity of the nations of East Asia, and has now realized Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. We believe that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven must also be pleased and gratified.

Second, in the 13th year of the Republic (1924), when Dr. Sun Yat-sen returned to China from Japan, he said to Japanese journalists: "The people of China and Japan must unite and cooperate with one heart and one mind, combining into one force to succeed. If they are separated into two forces, they are bound to fail, and both will fail... However, the people of the two countries have their own hopes and their own difficulties, so they both want to unite but cannot implement it. Studying this to this point, the people of China and Japan must understand each other." Nearly twenty years ago, Dr. Sun Yat-sen had already pointed out the importance of mutual understanding and cooperation between the people of China and Japan. We have repeatedly advocated in recent years that government-to-government cooperation between China and Japan is necessary, and so is cooperation between the people of the two countries. In particular, the Japanese government should value the power of the Chinese people, and all policies must be suited to China's national conditions and popular sentiment. In this way, although there are different hopes and difficulties, they will surely be able to understand each other. Now we believe that the two countries are moving in this direction, and this is also something that can be reported to Dr. Sun Yat-sen.

Third, after Marshal Togo defeated the Russian navy in the Russo-Japanese War, this news caused great sorrow to Europeans. The British believed that it would ultimately not be a blessing for the white race. Soon after, Dr. Sun Yat-sen happened to be returning to Asia from Europe by ship and passed through the Suez Canal. Arab locals asked to see him and inquired about the news of Japan defeating the Russian navy, expressing great joy because the Arab locals saw that Dr. Sun Yat-sen was a yellow-skinned person. The victory of a yellow-skinned person evoked a kind of natural resonance. From then on, Dr. Sun Yat-sen felt even more strongly about the discrimination of white people against yellow people, and that yellow people should unite even more, so he became even more firm in his advocacy of Pan-Asianism. Now, since the Greater East Asia War, through the efforts of the allied nations, the forces of England and America have been driven out one after another, making Burma and the Philippines independent countries. India has established a provisional government, and the indigenous peoples of Southeast Asia have been given opportunities to participate in politics and freedom. This is also something that Dr. Sun Yat-sen extremely hoped for, and it has now been realized. Although our expectations for Dr. Sun Yat-sen can be gradually realized, we are still far from the ultimate goal. When we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday, we must not forget our efforts to seek further progress.

Liu Yangshan's Speech

Liu Yangshan, Chairman of the City Party Headquarters, said in his speech: Today is the commemoration of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday. Whenever we welcome this day, we all regret and worry about the fate of China, and we eagerly hope for the future of the country. For decades, we have been anxious and disappointed. In the past, we felt even more disappointed with any meeting because the fate of the country was at a critical juncture of life and death, but we hoped for a glimmer of light for the future of the country.

Everyone already knows that our country's fate was oppressed by England and America in the early years, wearing shackles. Looking back, our country would never have suffered this situation if there had been no internal and external troubles, especially suffering deeply from the remnants of the Qing dynasty. When the Xinhai Revolution succeeded in overthrowing the Qing dynasty, we fully hoped that the fate of the country could improve and a modern country could be built. Unfortunately, the leaders failed to recognize the situation and were not firm in their revolutionary beliefs, so they were infected by the remnants of the Qing dynasty, creating the expansion of the Northern Warlords and being increasingly squeezed by imperialists. By the 13th year of the Republic (1924), Dr. Sun Yat-sen died worrying about the country, and the Chinese Nationalist Party improved at that time, so the general public had a deep understanding of the country and tried their best to oppose imperialism. Finally, in the 16th year of the Republic (1927), they launched the Northern Expedition Revolution and completed the unification of the entire country, so the future of China should have improved and a country based on the Three Principles of the People could have been built. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party provoked discord from within, launching conspiracies to disrupt the country, and civil war broke out again in the 18th and 19th years of the Republic (1929-1930). By the 21st year of the Republic (1932), people with foresight saw the danger of the country's fate, so they needed to unite. At that time, domestic figures abandoned all prejudices and assisted the National Government, hoping that our country could follow the right path and turn the future into peace. Who knew that it would be deeply envied by the British and American empires, trying to undermine China's revival, instigating the Communist Party to revive from the ashes, alienating Sino-Japanese relations, and instigating war against Japan, unfortunately causing the July 7th Incident (Marco Polo Bridge Incident). Our Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated Pan-Asianism twenty years ago, promoting the alliance and unity of all ethnic groups in East Asia to lay the foundation for East Asia. At first, Dr. Sun Yat-sen saw that the countries of East Asia were deeply invaded by white people, hoping to plan to defeat them one by one, with the ambition to completely destroy East Asia and make East Asians slaves of white people. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen tried his best to promote Pan-Asianism, and the Sino-Japanese Incident was their greatest conspiracy. It was not until December 8th, when the Greater East Asia War was launched by our ally Japan, that Pan-Asianism was realized. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy pointed the right path and can definitely achieve the expected goal.

The purpose of the Chinese revolution is to seek China's freedom and equality, and to unite with the world's peoples to fight together on an equal footing. Therefore, we must overthrow the invading England and America. Now that Japan has abolished unequal treaties and returned concessions, we must closely link with Japan with sincerity and cooperation. Dr. Sun Yat-sen clearly pointed out that there are yellow, white, red, and black races in the world, and the red and black races have been enslaved by the white race. Today's Greater East Asia War is for the yellow race to demand survival and resist the white race. If the Greater East Asia War unfortunately fails, we yellow races will face the same fate. Our fates are closely related, and we will not rest until the war ends with final victory. Therefore, the Greater East Asia War is a war for survival. The challenge of the English and Americans is hegemony, mobilizing troops and causing trouble. Our resistance is a war for royal righteousness and justice, waiting for the opportune moment. In reviewing the past and present national fortunes, we are indeed confident that final victory can be achieved. We must not worry or be depressed at the present time, but work together to achieve our goals.

### After Chairman Wang's Death, The Entire City Mourns, City Government Agencies Will Still Work As Usual Today

After the news of Chairman Wang's death reached the city, the people of the entire city mourned unanimously. Today, the municipal government originally had a day off in commemoration of the Premier's birthday, but due to the above reasons, the municipal government specially ordered all agencies in the city to cancel the holiday and work temporarily today to show mourning.

Secretary-General Wu's Remarks

Secretary-General Wu Songfu issued the following statement regarding the death of Chairman Wang:

The Chairman was a great leader of China and an extraordinary figure in East Asia. The Chairman's death is not only a loss for the Republic of China but also a loss for East Asia and the world. In addition to our shock and grief, we should fulfill our duty of every citizen being responsible for the rise and fall of the nation, work diligently in our respective positions, bravely advance, inherit the Chairman's legacy, and complete the mission of the era. Then, the significance of the peace movement can be extended, and the victory of the Greater East Asia War can be expected. I hope all citizens will strive together.

Director Liang's Remarks

Since the news of Chairman Wang's death reached Shanghai, the people of the entire city have mourned endlessly. A reporter from the Central News Agency recently visited Director of Propaganda Liang Xiuyu, who made the following statement: The Chairman dedicated his entire life to the revolution and devoted himself to saving the country, not avoiding difficulties and not cherishing his life. With his consistent proposition and great sincerity, he inspired comrades and led the people of the country to wage continuous struggles against despotism, warlords, dictatorship, communism, and imperialism. His purpose was none other than to seek China's revival and East Asia's liberation. Although he did not see its completion and died carrying his aspirations, his spirit is immortal and his noble spirit will always exist. All of us citizens can only inherit his teachings, continue to work hard, and ensure that the motherland finally achieves autonomy and East Asia enjoys long-term co-prosperity, which is enough to comfort the Chairman's spirit in heaven. Although our National Government has experienced this major change, which is a loss not seen since the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, all arrangements have long been prepared, the unity is solid, and it will not be moved slightly. As for the friendly relations between our ally and us, it is an unshakable policy, and they will continue to provide strong support to assist the progress of our National Government. We can only focus our minds, follow the established national policy, increase production internally, ensure security, awaken the Chongqing side externally, defeat England and America to promote the realization of peace and unification, and the success of the Greater East Asia War.

Brief Commentary

### Naval Baojia Contribute Aircraft

Yesterday was the third anniversary of the establishment of the Naval Baojia, and the naming ceremony for the aircraft contributed by the Naval Baojia was held at the same time, with an enthusiastic atmosphere and an unprecedented grand occasion.

The aircraft contributed by the Naval Baojia can be said to be a concrete manifestation of the Chinese people's cooperation in the Greater East Asia War. From this, it can be further discerned that the Chinese people have recognized the essence of the Greater East Asia War and its close relationship with the interests of the country and themselves. Therefore, they have risen up and gathered their spiritual power to contribute aircraft to kill the enemy. This is a valuable event.

At the same time, this contribution of aircraft by the Naval Baojia represents the cooperative expression of a portion of the people. We believe that in the near future, it will further arouse the cooperation of the majority of the people, resulting in a larger number of contributed aircraft and a greater contribution of strength.

Finally, we sincerely hope that the allied nations will further recognize the Chinese people's attitude of voluntary cooperation, pay special attention to the way of mutual benefit and harmony in contact with the Chinese people, so that all Chinese people can understand the sincerity of the allied nations and more actively express their cooperation. Then, the cornerstone for the victory of the Greater East Asia War can be made even more solid.

### Commemorating Three Weeks of the Naval Baojia District: Yesterday's Aircraft Donation Ceremony; Allied Naval Minister's Representative General Kondo Presided Over Naming

To commemorate the third week since the establishment of the Baojia system in the Naval Garrison Area of this city, the aircraft donation and naming ceremony was solemnly held yesterday (the 12th) at 10:00 AM amidst air raid warnings. Tens of thousands of people, including officials from relevant Chinese and Japanese authorities and representatives of the Baojia citizenry, participated in the grand ceremony, their emotions running high. After the ceremony, the Allied naval aircraft performed aerial acrobatics, fully demonstrating their active combat prowess. Detailed accounts are as follows:

Officials and Guests

Officials and guests from both China and Japan present on the day included General Kondo, representing Naval Minister Yonai of the Allied Japan; Commander Katsuno Minoru of the Shanghai Naval Special Landing Force; Rear Admiral Minato, Naval Attaché of the Shanghai Garrison; Colonel Matsushima, Head of the Press Department of the China Fleet; Major General Kawamoto, Head of the Army Department; Director Kumagai of the Transportation Liaison Department; and Councilor Okazaki, representing Minister Usami of the Embassy Office. On the Chinese side were Secretary-General Wu, representing Mayor Chen; Deputy Director Du of the Police Bureau; Chief Xiong of the Security Office; and prominent figures from all sectors, including Wen LantIng, Chen Riping, and Chen Binhe.

Aircraft Donation and Naming

The ceremony began promptly at ten o'clock. The entire assembly saluted the national flags of China and Japan, followed by the singing of the national anthems of both countries. After the anthems, a moment of silence was observed for the fallen soldiers of the Greater East Asia War, with prayers for victory in the war. Following the formalities, Xie Youde, the chief representative of the donors, presented twenty-two military aircraft and delivered a speech. Subsequently, General Kondo, representing Naval Minister Yonai, named the aircraft "Shanghai Baojia Patriotic Aircraft Nos. 1 to 22" and delivered an address of gratitude.

After the flower presentation, Secretary-General Wu, representing Mayor Chen, and Minister Usami of the Japanese Embassy delivered congratulatory addresses. Rear Admiral Minato, Chairman of the Naming Ceremony Committee, then delivered a speech, and finally, Mr. Wen LantIng led the entire assembly in chanting "Long live China-Japan," concluding the ceremony. Mr. Kubo, Head of Naval Baojia Affairs, delivered a speech, followed by a speech on the current situation by Colonel Matsushima, Head of the Press Department of the Japanese Fleet in China. The event lasted three hours before dispersing.

Thank You Letter from the Allied Naval Minister

Today, the citizens of the Shanghai Naval Baojia, with a sincere desire to jointly destroy Britain and the United States, donated naval patriotic aircraft and held a grand naming ceremony. I, the Minister, am very pleased to be able to participate in this grand event. In modern warfare, aircraft can determine the victory or defeat of a war and play a great strategic role. The results of the naval and air battles in the waters of Taiwan and the Philippines have practically proven this. Enemy American warships and aircraft carriers, built with many years of effort, were sunk to the bottom of the sea in an instant by our elite air force. Therefore, the success or failure of future battles depends on the enrichment of air power. Now, the enemy's American air power has been greatly hit. In the future, they will rely on their productivity to devote all their energy to reconstruction work. Our Empire will also realize epoch-making upward expansion in the production of aircraft, warships, and weapons, both in quality and quantity, and will work harder to produce in response to the results of this battle to destroy the enemy. This autumn, the citizens of the Shanghai Naval Baojia District, taking the destiny of Greater East Asia as their own, ignited a sincere spirit of living and dying together, donating many excellent aircraft to strengthen the power of the Imperial Navy, for which I am extremely grateful. These aircraft, piloted by loyal and brave naval airmen, will be dispatched over the Pacific, and each aircraft will surely achieve glorious battle results to repay your sincerity. I express my heartfelt gratitude to the donors, and also express my thanks to all those who participated today.

Rear Admiral Minato's Speech

Rear Admiral Minato, Chairman of the Naming Ceremony Committee, said: "Today, the citizens of the Shanghai Naval Baojia District of the Allied Republic of China are holding a naming ceremony for the patriotic aircraft they have donated. At this time of decisive battle, its significance is extremely profound. As the Chairman of this committee, I am extremely grateful. Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, our air force has achieved remarkable results in the Pacific and the entire war zone on the mainland, establishing a foundation for victory. The key to success lies in the loyalty and bravery of the officers and soldiers on the front lines, and the excellent quality of our aircraft is also the main factor dominating the battle situation. It is clear that it is now an urgent task to transport a large number of elite aircraft to the front lines. The twenty-two patriotic aircraft donated today will surely establish a glorious feat in the skies of Greater East Asia. In the future, I hope that China and Japan will work hard to advance the spirit of living and dying together."

Katsuno Minoru's Speech

Commander Katsuno Minoru of the Japanese Shanghai Naval Special Landing Force gave a speech of instruction, briefly stating: "Today marks the third anniversary of the establishment of the Naval Baojia and the aircraft donation naming ceremony. I am deeply honored to be able to participate in this grand event and express my thoughts. This time, in commemoration of the third anniversary of its founding, the Navy has donated new sharp aircraft, adding great power to the Empire's combat strength. It is especially sufficient to prove that all members of the Baojia truly understand the great ideal of the China-Japan alliance to complete the Greater East Asia War, and are moving towards its realization. I feel deeply happy. Now is the time to destroy the arrogant enemy Britain and the United States. Reports of victory from the front lines are coming one after another, but we must not be optimistic in the slightest until the enemy's wild ambitions are completely shattered. Therefore, we should be more vigilant against the disturbances of unruly elements on the enemy side and the attacks of enemy aircraft in the future. I hope that all Baojia citizens, under a strong belief, will further strengthen the posture of autonomy and self-defense, and jointly move towards the glorious path of completing the construction of the Greater East Asia grand cause."

Mayor Chen's Speech

Mayor Chen said in his speech, "Today marks the third anniversary of the establishment of the Naval Baojia, and an aircraft donation ceremony is being held. I am extremely honored to be able to participate in this grand event. I am very impressed by the efforts of the Naval Baojia in the past. Today, donating aircraft to the Allied Naval authorities can truly demonstrate the enthusiasm of the Chinese and Japanese people in cooperating in the Greater East Asia War, and it is even more meaningful to celebrate the birthday of the Founding Father. Now that the Greater East Asia War is becoming more and more intense, I hope that the Baojia in the Naval Garrison Area will donate aircraft, and promote this to other regions and even the whole country."

Usami's Speech

Japanese Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to China, Usami Trhiko, said in his congratulatory speech, briefly stating: "It has been three years since the establishment of the Shanghai Naval Baojia, and today there is a move to donate 22 elite fighter planes to our Imperial Navy. I am inexplicably grateful for this. Our Empire has achieved unprecedented great victories in the waters east of Taiwan and the Philippines. Your donation of aircraft at this time is of great significance to the completion of the joint war. The purpose of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration of November 6 last year is to overthrow the aggressors of Asia. In the process of completing this goal, China and Japan are the axis of combat power, and also the center of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The relationship between China and Japan is most realistically expressed in Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Founding Father of China's, saying, "We must share life and death, safety and danger." Today, with the conclusion of the China-Japan Alliance Treaty, the two countries have established a permanent friendly relationship and are cooperating with each other based on the spirit of morality. I sincerely express my gratitude and respect to all members of the Naval Baojia, and at the same time hope that in the future, we will work harder to complete the war and build East Asia."

Kubodera's Speech

Kubodera Tokuji said, briefly stating: "Today, we are celebrating the birthday of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, as well as the third anniversary of the establishment of the Naval Baojia, and holding a naming ceremony for the aircraft donated by the sincere efforts of our 700,000 Baojia members. We are deeply grateful and feel infinitely honored to have the representative of the Naval Minister, the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Fleet, and many guests from China and Japan present, and to receive their earnest instruction. It has been more than three years since July 12, 1941, when the Baojia system, which Shanghai had previously considered impossible, was implemented in the Naval Garrison Area based on the order of the Chinese Fleet. During these three years, our Baojia colleagues, under the guidance of the Japanese Navy and with the cooperation and assistance of all parties, have overcome all difficulties and enabled this excellent system to be widely implemented in the whole of Shanghai, the whole of Central China, and the whole of China. Over the past three years, our Naval Baojia colleagues have further expanded the scope of their work in response to changes in the world situation and the needs of the social environment. In addition to achieving the expected goals of cooperating in maintaining public order, ensuring security, and clearing up society, they have also made considerable contributions to self-defense, air defense, youth training, and the distribution of goods. Moreover, the scope of their activities is expanding day by day. Depending on how they are guided and operated in the future, I am confident that there will be unlimited development in the future. The aircraft donation movement, which is holding a naming ceremony here today, was originally an expression of the current 700,000 residents in the district automatically rising up to defend their own sky. It lasted only one month, and as many as 22 aircraft were donated. As the person in charge of the Baojia, when I think of the full enthusiasm of the Baojia members, I cannot help but shed tears in admiration. On the one hand, this achievement should be attributed to the effective guidance of the Baojia colleagues. On the other hand, it can be said that the general Baojia members deeply understand the great righteousness of the China-Japan alliance and living and dying together. Therefore, they can work together and have a deep understanding of the common prosperity and shared decline of the two countries. This kind of sincere enthusiasm is enough to destroy the combat power of Britain and the United States, and is stronger than any weapon. This is something that is particularly exciting and gratifying.

(Another dispatch) Yesterday (the 12th) at 3:00 PM, Kubodera Tokuji, Head of Naval Baojia Affairs, again met with the Chinese newspaper reporters in this city at the Bund Water Club to announce the organization and development of the Naval Baojia, and answered various questions from reporters from various newspapers. The meeting adjourned after 5:00 PM.

### Mr. Wang Jingwei's Chronological Biography (Transferred from the Second Edition)

5th Year Before the Founding of the Republic of China, Dingwei Year (1907 AD, 33rd Year of the Guangxu Reign of the Qing Dynasty). Mr. Wang was 25 years old. On the 20th day of the first month, he accompanied the Father of the Nation to Singapore and then to Annam. Secretly established branches in Hanoi, managing military affairs in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. On July 12th, the Nanyang Zhongxing Daily was published, opposing the Bao Huang (Protect the Emperor) Party's Zonghui Report. Mr. Wang and Hu Hanmin successively held the editorial pen. In this year, he went to Hong Kong again, devoting himself to the cause of revolution.

4th Year Before the Founding of the Republic of China, Wushen Year (1908 AD, 34th Year of the Guangxu Reign of the Qing Dynasty). Mr. Wang was 26 years old. Mr. Wang accompanied the Father of the Nation to Nanyang and went with Wu Yingpei to Rangoon to prepare for the establishment of a Tongmenghui branch. He also established the Nanyang branch in Singapore. In July, the Min Bao was banned. In this year, the Qing Jing Emperor died. Puyi succeeded to the throne, with Zaifeng as regent.

3rd Year Before the Founding of the Republic of China, Jiyou Year (1909 AD, 1st Year of the Xuantong Reign of the Qing Dynasty). Mr. Wang was 27 years old. The Father of the Nation was in Singapore, and dispatched Mr. Wang and Deng Ziyu to places like the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia) to raise funds for support. However, at that time, many comrades who had failed in various places had fled to the British and Dutch colonies in Nanyang. They were quite dissatisfied with the measures taken by the Tongmenghui cadres. In addition, Zhang Binglin and Li Zhongzhu strongly advocated the Guangfuhui, harboring territorial prejudices. Mr. Wang was inevitably obstructed when he went to the Dutch East Indies. Mr. Wang was greatly angered and secretly went to Hong Kong, planning to assassinate an important Qing official to demonstrate the determination of the party members. Huang Xing knew about his plan after he left, and jointly sent a telegram with the Father of the Nation to dissuade him, but he did not listen. Mr. Wang then went to Japan and, with Huang Fusheng, Li Yongxi, Yu Peilun, Zeng Xing, Fang Junying, Chen Bijun, and others, organized a small assassination group. Fusheng and Peilun were well-versed in the manufacture of explosives. However, it was difficult to test them in Japan. Mr. Wang then went to Hong Kong with Zhongshi, Fusheng, Bijun, and Junying, and secretly set up a base in Wong Nai Chung Road. He arranged for Li Jitang to go to Deng Sanbo's farm in Tuen Mun to test various methods of throwing bombs and electrical, chemical, and clockwork detonation. Fusheng and Peilun heard that the Qing official Duanfang was taking the Beijing-Hankou Railway south. They went to Hankou ahead of time to lie in wait at the station to assassinate him, but were unsuccessful. Therefore, they entrusted Sun Wu with the bombs, iron casings, and ammunition they carried, and left. Mr. Wang spent more than a year planning the assassination, traveling back and forth between Japan and Hong Kong twice. In December, he finally decided to go to Beijing with Li Yongxi, Yu Peilun, Chen Bijun, and others, falsely setting up a Shou Yi Photography Studio to plot the assassination.

2nd Year Before the Founding of the Republic of China, Gengxu Year (1910 AD, 2nd Year of the Xuantong Reign of the Qing Dynasty). Mr. Wang was 28 years old. On March 7th, Mr. Wang plotted to bomb the Qing Regent Prince, Zai Feng, with explosives at Yin Ding Bridge outside Andingmen in Beijing. The plot was revealed, and he was arrested and imprisoned in the Ministry of Justice. Chen Yijun and Yu Peilun, among others, had gone to Japan to purchase explosives the day before, and therefore escaped danger. He was imprisoned for more than a year before being released. Not only books, but also all the manuscripts he had written in his life were lost. (For details, see "A True Record of Mr. Jingwei's Ordeal in the Gengxu Year" compiled by me.)

1st Year Before the Founding of the Republic of China, Xinhai Year (1911 AD, 3rd Year of the Xuantong Reign of the Qing Dynasty). Mr. Wang was 29 years old. On March 29th, Huang Xing, Zhu Dafu, Zhao Sheng, Lin Wen, and others launched an uprising in Guangzhou, besieging the Governor-General's office of Guangdong and Guangxi, with more than seventy deaths. This was the Huanghuagang Uprising, a great bloody battle for the nation. On September 16th, the Qing court released Mr. Wang from prison with a decree. Although the ban on parties had been relaxed, party members were all busy with their own affairs, concealing their whereabouts and unable to gather outside the prison gates to wait for him. Only his family went to meet him, and they went together to the Tai'an Inn in Luomashi. On August 19th, members of the Tongmenghui launched an uprising in Wuchang, overthrowing the Qing government and establishing the Republic of China. On November 25th, Mr. Wang accompanied the Father of the Nation to Shanghai. In that month, the Father of the Nation was elected as the Provisional President of the Republic of China.

1st Year of the Republic of China, Renzi Year (1912 AD). Mr. Wang was 30 years old. Mr. Wang was recommended as the head of the Northern Branch of the Tongmenghui. On January 1st, the Father of the Nation assumed the position of Provisional President. Mr. Wang served as a representative at the North-South Peace Conference in Shanghai to determine the location of the capital. He went north to negotiate with Yuan Shikai, and mediated the many disputes between the two sides. In this year, he married Chen Bijun, resigned from all political positions, and went to Guangzhou to visit his elder brothers and sisters-in-law. In August, he went to France. On the 25th, the Tongmenghui was reorganized into the Kuomintang.

2nd Year of the Republic of China, Guichou Year (1913 AD). Mr. Wang was 31 years old. Mr. Wang traveled extensively in Europe and the United States, studying politics and economics. On April 27th, Yuan Shikai took out a large loan from the Five-Power Bank, which actually started the civil unrest in the Republic of China. The Father of the Nation was the strongest in resisting it. On November 4th, Yuan Shikai forcibly disbanded the Kuomintang and removed Chinese Kuomintang members from the National Assembly and Provincial Assemblies. The Father of the Nation could not live peacefully in the country and revisited Japan.

3rd Year of the Republic of China, Jiayin Year (1914 AD). Mr. Wang was 32 years old. Mr. Wang traveled extensively in Europe and the United States, studying politics and economics. On July 8th, the Father of the Nation established the Chinese Revolutionary Party in Tokyo.

5th Year of the Republic of China, Bingchen Year (1916 AD). Mr. Wang was 34 years old. Mr. Wang traveled extensively in Europe and the United States, studying politics and economics. Huang Xing returned from the Americas and died of heart disease in Shanghai.

6th Year of the Republic of China, Ding Si Year (1917 AD). Mr. Wang was 35 years old. Mr. Wang traveled from France to England, then across the North Sea, passing through Norway, Sweden, and Finland to Petrograd, the Russian capital. Upon the summons of the Father of the Nation, he took the Trans-Siberian Railway back to China. The Father of the Nation lived in Shanghai, writing "The First Step of Civil Rights" and "The Question of China's Survival." In July, he went to Guangdong, declared the protection of the Constitution, and formed a military government.

7th Year of the Republic of China, Wuwu Year (1918 AD). Mr. Wang was 36 years old. Mr. Wang and Hu Hanmin formed the Guangdong Army. The officers and soldiers in the army were all appointed from party members. In August, the Father of the Nation was in Shanghai, sending telegrams to overseas comrades, drafting party regulations, and appointing Hu Hanmin as a representative to discuss peace.

8th Year of the Republic of China, Jiwei Year (1919 AD). Mr. Wang was 37 years old. Mr. Wang accompanied the Father of the Nation to Shanghai, founding the "Construction" magazine. Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Dafu, Dai Chuanxian, and others were with him. On October 10th, the Chinese Revolutionary Party was renamed the Kuomintang. In this year, the Father of the Nation wrote books such as "The Theory of Sun Wen" and "Industrial Plan."

9th Year of the Republic of China, Gengshen Year (1920 AD). Mr. Wang was 38 years old. In November, Mr. Wang returned to Guangzhou with the Father of the Nation and reopened the Political Affairs Conference. They sent telegrams across the country to restore the military government and issued a declaration to continue the revolutionary cause. In September, Zhu Dafu was killed in Humen.

10th Year of the Republic of China, Xinyou Year (1921 AD). Mr. Wang was 39 years old. On May 5th, the Father of the Nation took the position of Extraordinary President in Guangzhou. Mr. Wang always advocated the "Six No's" principle. To this end, he decided not to participate in politics and devoted himself wholeheartedly to party affairs. Furthermore, because Chen Jiongming was vying for power and acting despotically, he tried hard to dissuade him, which prevented a disaster. After the Father of the Nation obtained Pinggui, he led his army on a northern expedition.

11th Year of the Republic of China, Renxu Year (1922 AD). Mr. Wang was 40 years old. On June 16th, Chen Jiongming betrayed the country, and the Father of the Nation suffered hardship in the Presidential Palace. He escaped danger and went to Shanghai on August 13th. Mr. Wang followed him.

12th Year of the Republic of China, Guihai Year (1923 AD). Mr. Wang was 41 years old. On February 21st, the Father of the Nation returned to Guangzhou and exercised the authority of the Grand Marshal. Since military power was manipulated by warlords, there was a move to reorganize the Chinese Kuomintang. Mr. Wang was summoned back to China and, together with Liao Zhongkai and Hu Hanmin, jointly convened the First National Congress.

13th Year of the Republic of China, Jiazi Year (1924 AD). Mr. Wang was 42 years old. On January 1st, the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang was held in Guangzhou. All the declarations were drafted by Mr. Wang. Mr. Wang was elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee at the meeting, and also served as the Minister of Propaganda. In this year, the Whampoa Military Academy was established. Mr. Wang often went to give lectures, elaborating on the history and doctrines of the party. On November 31st, he went to Beijing with the Father of the Nation to discuss opening a National Assembly with the Executive Duan.

14th Year of the Republic of China, Yichou Year (1925 AD). Mr. Wang was 43 years old. Mr. Wang assisted the Father of the Nation in resisting Duan's proposal to convene a Post-Affairs Conference, firmly advocating the convening of a National Assembly. On March 12th, the Father of the Nation died of illness at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Mr. Wang attended him at his deathbed and was instructed to draft his will. After the Father of the Nation died, Mr. Wang also suffered from a serious illness, but still stayed in Beijing with effort, hoping to promote the convening of the National Assembly. Previously, Mr. Wang had four older sisters, who had married into the Wang family in Jianchang, Jiangxi, a long time ago. Mr. Wang had not heard from them for more than thirty years. Mr. Wang was devoted to his relatives, so he went to visit them alone in the summer of this year. At that time, the roads in Jiangxi were blocked, and Jianchang was located deep inland. There were no inns to stay in along the way. Mr. Wang walked alone, sleeping in dilapidated temples or under trees at night. After many hardships, he finally found the location of his fourth sister and escorted her to Guangzhou. At that time, his fourth sister was blind in both eyes. He quickly hired a doctor to perform surgery. Fortunately, one eye was restored to sight. She is still alive and healthy, and is over seventy years old. In June, he arrived in Guangzhou and was elected as the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Government Committee, and also served as the Chairman of the Military Affairs Committee. At that time, the struggle between the left and right factions was becoming increasingly fierce. The communists took the opportunity to stir up trouble. Liao Zhongkai was assassinated. Mr. Wang struggled to maintain the precarious situation, reorganizing the National Revolutionary Army. On November 3rd, Zou Lu and others of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Kuomintang held an illegal meeting in Xishan, Beiping, under the pretext of anti-communism, opposing Mr. Wang.

15th Year of the Republic of China, Bingyin Year (1926 AD). Mr. Wang was 44 years old. On January 1st, the Second National Congress was held in Guangzhou. Mr. Wang was elected as the chairman. On the 27th, he proposed the Northern Expedition to the Central Political Conference. Unfortunately, Chiang Kai-shek was surrounded by the Xishan Conference faction and the Communist Party, resulting in the March 20th Guangzhou coup. Mr. Wang did not want to cause division within the party, so he resolutely resigned. In May, he went to France. Afterwards, Chiang Kai-shek regretted it and telegraphed Mr. Wang to return to China to take charge of the government. He left France in December and returned quickly.

16th Year of the Republic of China, Dingmao Year (1927 AD). Mr. Wang was 45 years old. On April 1st, Mr. Wang returned to China via Marseilles and arrived in Shanghai. He met with Chiang Kai-shek, Wu Zhihui, and Zhang Jingjiang, and strongly argued that the expulsion of communists was too hasty. Disagreeing with their opinions, he returned to France from Shanghai.

In July, he welcomed Mr. Wang to the north and convened an enlarged meeting. Mr. Wang still advocated opening a National Assembly and implementing political tutelage.

20th Year of the Republic of China, Xinwei Year (1931 AD). Mr. Wang was 49 years old. Because Hu Hanmin was imprisoned by Chiang Kai-shek, the whole country was in turmoil and everyone rose up to condemn him. They all went to Guangzhou and appointed Mr. Wang as their leader. Not long after, the September 18th Incident occurred. Mr. Wang believed that the national crisis was urgent and that internal unity was essential. Therefore, he went to Shanghai to negotiate with the representatives of the Ning Faction and decided to abolish the Guangzhou Extraordinary Conference and launch the National Salvation Conference.

21st Year of the Republic of China, Renshen Year (1932 AD). Mr. Wang was 50 years old. Mr. Wang headed the Executive Yuan. Because the Japanese army in the Northeast continued to attack Jinzhou, followed by the Battle of Shanghai, he moved the capital to Luoyang. A ceasefire agreement was reached. In late October, he left the country, leaving behind a letter to bid farewell. He expressed his views on national affairs.

He strongly advocated conducting peace negotiations with Japan, but was obstructed by the Communist Party. In December of this year, the capital fell, and Mr. Wang's residence was reduced to ashes. Of all the writings he had done in the past thirty years, the only surviving drafts were the translations of Yangming and Zen.

27th Year of the Republic of China, Wuyin Year (1938 AD). Mr. Wang was 56 years old. The Kuomintang convened a National Provisional Congress in Chongqing. Mr. Wang and Chiang Kai-shek were both appointed as the Director-General and Deputy Director-General, respectively, and were given the authority to negotiate peace with Japan. However, the communist party dictatorship did not support it. Therefore, he fled from Chongqing to Hanoi and issued the "Yan Telegram" on December 29th, calling for a ceasefire and peace with the Japanese side.

### Mr. Wang Jingwei's Autobiography

My ancestral home is Shanyin, Zhejiang. The graves of my ancestors are all in Shanyin. My father was the first to move to Panyu, Guangdong. Although he could understand Cantonese, he could not speak it. He was still a native of Zhejiang. He first married Ms. Lu, who was also from Zhejiang. She bore one son and three daughters. My mother's surname was Wu, and she was a native of Guangdong. She bore three daughters and three sons. I am the fourth among the brothers, and the tenth counting the sisters. When I was born, my father was already sixty-two years old. I was thirteen years old when my mother died. I was fourteen years old when my father died. The time I spent with my parents was only this much. That included the time I was an infant and unaware of the world. All together, it was not more than ten years. I only remember my father as a diligent student. After the age of seventy-one, his eyes were affected by cataracts and he could not see small characters. He also had severe hearing loss. When I came home from school in the evening, my father would always make me read aloud two or three pages of Wang Yangming's "Instructions for Practical Living" and other books. He would listen intently. He would also make me write three or four-inch large characters on a white-painted wooden board, such as Tao Yuanming's poems or Lu You's poems. He would watch me slowly from behind until I could recite them by heart. He would not stop until I could. Whenever I had a composition, he would make me write it down. My father contracted cholera in the middle of the night on the seventh day of the ninth month and died at noon on the eighth day. The homework was not interrupted the night before he died. For myself, the benefit I received from this seemed to be greater than in school. When I think of my mother, I am truly saddened. I feel that her entire life was immersed in worry and hardship. The difficulties of making a living, the trivial matters of household affairs, and the unreasonable anger she suffered within the family still appear vividly before my eyes. I have a scroll of "Autumn Garden Morning Lesson Picture" and a preface that briefly describes my mother's life and my childhood. When my father was alive, the family's finances were already meager. My father had to earn money to support the family until he was seventy years old. He finally retired at the age of seventy-one. After my father died, there was no inheritance. My expenses for food and clothing were all supported by my elder brother. At the age of seventeen, I went out to become a "Master Ziyue" (private tutor), earning ten yuan a month. I also went to various academies to take exams, often achieving excellent results, earning an average of about twenty yuan per month. At the age of eighteen, my third elder brother died. At the age of nineteen, my second elder brother died. I relied on this income to support two widowed sisters-in-law and an orphaned nephew. In a word, my childhood life was poor and miserable. As for my studies, because I only received education from a "Master Ziyue," subjects like foreign languages, arithmetic, and physical education were out of the question. After the age of sixteen, when I became a "Master Ziyue" myself, not only were they out of the question, but because of time and economic constraints, I could not even dream of them. Therefore, my life lacks general knowledge. Even my physical movements are stiff and awkward. This is something I am ashamed of when I think about it. Fortunately, in addition to receiving education from a "Master Ziyue," I also received some home education. My uncle was very learned and had a collection of tens of thousands of books. Therefore, I also glimpsed something of the classics, history, philosophy, and literary collections. But what does this count for?

When I turned twenty, I actually got the opportunity to be admitted as a government-sponsored student to study law at the Japanese Political Science Accelerated Course. After graduating from the accelerated course in Tokyo, I entered a specialized course at my own expense. The money for my own expenses came from translating books. However, at that time, translating books was only for money. Such as "Complete Collection of Laws and Regulations" and other things, purely a hired kind of work. When I was a government-sponsored student, I only got thirty yuan a month. When I was paying my own way, my monthly income was actually fifty or sixty yuan. In addition to using it myself, I could also help friends.

When I was studying history in China, I inevitably felt indignation towards the Liao, Jin, and Yuan dynasties for their encroachment on China. Naturally, I felt the same towards the Qing. But I was bound by what they call the righteousness between ruler and subject. When I came to study law and political science, I got a sense of national mission and the concept that sovereignty rests with the people. What I used to call the righteousness between ruler and subject was thrown to the four winds. My inherent ethnic ideology rose up and combined with the newly acquired democratic ideology, which determined my revolutionary direction. In the Yisi year, when I was twenty-two years old, Mr. Sun came to Tokyo. I and Zhu Zhixin and a few others went to meet him and join the Chinese Tongmenghui. This was the beginning of my dedication to the revolution. At that time, the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi was Cen Chunxuan. My eldest brother was in his office, working with a Mr. Liu Zifan. The two of them were friends. My eldest brother had arranged for me to be engaged to one of his younger sisters. This kind of thing cannot be done now. But at that time, it was considered the essence of reason and human feeling. The eldest brother thought that if he did not get a wife for his brother after his father died, he would be gossiped about. So he did it this way. Not only did he not need my consent, he did not even need to notify me. This went on for several years. Suddenly, I heard that I had become a revolutionary. They could not help but be alarmed. The more articles I wrote in the Min Bao, the tighter the rumors became. One day, Cen Chunxuan got drunk and insisted that my eldest brother hand me over. Otherwise, he would be sorry for my eldest brother. In a panic, I wrote a final family letter, signing myself as the "Sinner of the Family." I still remember this letter today. I write it below: "The matter has been discovered. I hereby sever myself from the family to avoid implicating you. There are many children in the family. Why begrudge this one person? I hope you will let him shed blood for the country to fulfill his ambition. Death is imperishable. However, I hope you will treat my widowed sister-in-law and orphaned nephew well. Otherwise, I will not rest in peace in death. Moreover, this is not what the sinner should declare. I had a marriage agreement with Ms. Liu. But since the sinner has severed ties with the family, then this relationship should also be severed with it. Please dissolve the engagement from today." After receiving this letter, my eldest brother posted a notice at Panyu county, banishing the rebellious younger brother from the household permanently. He conferred with Liu Zifan, returned the betrothal gifts to the Liu family and burned the marriage contract, completing the matter. Later, I heard that Ms. Liu was against them doing this. Until the first year of the Republic, when I had already married, I returned to Guangzhou and revisited my family. I heard that she had not yet married. I felt as the ancients said, “Although I did not kill Boren, Boren died because of me.” I could not help but feel uneasy. Until I heard that she had married a Mr. Chen, I was relieved. I joined the Tongmenghui at the age of twenty-two. This year, I am fifty-one years old. In these thirty years, I do not want to say much about what I have been through. Because as for before the Republic, starting from the Yisi year, my opinions and discussions were all published in the Min Bao. After the Dingwei year, I was ordered by Mr. Sun to travel to Nanyang, organizing more than a hundred Tongmenghui branches. At that time, all the speeches and discussions were published in the Zhongxing Daily. After the Yiyou year, I sneaked into Beijing and was captured and placed in prison. I also had a poem expressing my feelings, which was published in the "Small Rest Collection." My prison life was also recorded in "Nanshe Poetry Talks". These can all be considered my autobiography. I remember that on the seventh day of the third month of the Gengxu year, I was arrested by the police in Beijing. In my jacket, they found "Revolutionary Tendency", "Revolutionary Determination", and "Farewell to Comrades". They asked me why I kept these articles on my body. I replied that there was no other reason. However, I felt that using ink to write was not enough. I wanted to write with blood. So I kept it on my body, prepared for when I died, so that some blood would be on them. Therefore, I feel that taking my lifelong speeches and discussions as my autobiography is the most authentic. There is no need to write another autobiography. This is also the case after the Republic. However, the matters after the Republic are much more complicated than before the Republic. My revolutionary determination has certainly never changed. But my attitude towards people and things is inevitably subject to change. But I have always reasoned out the reasons for the changes. As for whether the reasons are right or wrong, I am willing to accept the comments of people now and in the future. (Recorded from the Baiyuantang Bookstore)
