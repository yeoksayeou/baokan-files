### Efforts of Female Citizens

On August 23rd, the Japanese government promulgated three imperial edicts: one for official mobilization, one for student labor, and one for female labor, all effective from the date of promulgation. As the global war situation enters a decisive phase, in order to rapidly increase combat power to confront the enemy and deliver the greatest final blow to annihilate them, a thorough transformation of the domestic situation is necessary. The decree for women to step forward for labor has transformed the nature of past guidance and encouragement into law, further boosting the courage of female citizens and strengthening the overall war effort. For example, the airplane work teams organized by Japanese housewives demonstrate the contribution of female citizens to combat power. (Translation from today's Japanese newspaper)

Human group life begins with the family. Within the family, women occupy a more important position than men. Their thoughts and actions have the greatest impact on current members and future generations. In Chinese history, Lady Jing Jiang's assistance to her husband in governing the state and Mencius's mother's education of her son to achieve fame best exemplify the spirit of a virtuous wife and wise mother. Other similar historical examples of women, and the related touching stories of mothers, sons, and couples, are deeply ingrained in people's hearts and can influence the entire national character. In this respect, Japan shares the same Eastern national spirit with us. Lectures on feminine virtue, training for virtuous wives and wise mothers, and the establishment of a central idea of [struggling and sacrificing for the country] among female citizens are paramount. Subsequently, all their actions will follow this direction. Therefore, even working at home is actually doing a crucial part of the work for the country. As for female citizens who do not work in the home, a policy to strengthen the women's volunteer corps system was decided on March 18th of this year, and now an imperial edict has been promulgated to implement it immediately, actively engaging female citizens in suitable work. After this, there will be no idle women in the country. We dare to assert that if this proactive spirit is used to build a great nation, there is no reason why nation-building will not be successful.

In contrast, the traditional spirit of our country for thousands of years has been almost completely destroyed by the free thought of England and America in the past hundred years, especially in Shanghai and its surrounding cities, where most female citizens have almost detached themselves from China and become purely anglicized. Too many female citizens know how to use the latest cosmetics, wear the most fashionable clothes, and lead a decadent life of dancing, watching plays, and playing cards. The hairstyle and attire of permed hair and red fingernails are truly ubiquitous. This toxin wastes countless manpower and resources, and causes countless people with no fixed opinions or knowledge to follow and fall. When it comes to assisting their husbands and teaching their children, this group can't even begin to discuss it. Moreover, because of the vanity and extravagance of wives, their husbands may unknowingly lose their will, go astray, and suffer the destruction of their families, harming the country and the nation, something that conscientious people are unwilling to talk about.

We believe that after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the elimination of British and American forces, patriotic female citizens should step forward and lead women in working hard for the cause of revitalization. Knowing the importance of women's status, we can understand the greatness of the impact of women's work. The efforts of women can encourage the struggles of men, and the efforts of women can train the minds and bodies of the next generation of children. Because the relationship between women and the country and nation is so great, female citizens across the country should regard it as their divine duty and strive forward. At home, you all love your husbands and your children. How should you love them? Only through work, only through hard work. In society, you all love your groups and your country. How should you love them? Only through work, only through hard work. Everyone should be hardworking citizens in order to be worthy of the nation in this great era.

### Japanese Troops in New Guinea Still Holding Their Ground

South Pacific Base, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - In New Guinea, the Japanese army units that retreated from the Madang area in late April encountered and repelled superior enemy forces in the area between Madang and Aitape and continued westward. Subsequently, a small force engaged in a major offensive against a division of landing enemy forces from the right bank of the Lalla River, 30 kilometers east of Aitape, to the coast of the villages around Aitape, starting in early July. As a result, the enemy suffered heavy losses and the battle results were significant. In addition to monitoring enemy movements, the Japanese troops who severely attacked the enemy around Aitape are also consolidating the forces between Wewak and Aitape, awaiting opportunities. Later, the enemy gradually invaded Sarmi, Balinu, Huoer Island, and other places, advancing into western New Guinea in an attempt to cut off the rear of the Japanese troops in New Guinea. In response, the Japanese army has overcome all obstacles between Wewak and Aitape, built a self-sufficient position in the difficult environment of mountainous forests and wetlands, and continues to hold its ground. Since the Japanese army began retreating from Madang in late April, the battle results up to early August are as follows: 2,079 enemy bodies confirmed, 2,650 enemy casualties, 48 aircraft shot down, 45 destroyed, 8 torpedo boats sunk, 9 destroyed, 4 large boats sunk, 1 destroyed, 15 tanks captured and destroyed, 2 armored vehicles, 44 trucks, 34 cannons of various types, and a large number of other weapons and ammunition.

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - In view of the fact that the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage, the National Government authorities, in order to strengthen cooperation and seize the final victory, have planned to strengthen local military and political organizations to achieve unity, close cooperation, and exert full force to advance administration and complete the local decisive battle posture during this extraordinary period. Modern warfare is a comprehensive total war involving military, political, economic, and propaganda aspects. It is necessary to gather the strength of the entire country, strengthen cooperation, and make the war beneficial to our side in order to overcome strong enemies. The current war situation is on the verge of life and death, and the enemy United States attempts to use the Chinese mainland as a battlefield, calling for a counteroffensive. Therefore, strengthening our local decisive battle system to adapt to the new situation is of utmost concern to our people across the country. The Supreme National Defense Council, at its meeting on the 14th, approved several major cases on the adjustment of local military and political organizations and personnel under the expectations of all parties. Among them, the most noteworthy are the addition of the Offices of the Resident Pacification Commissioners of Bengbu and Hangzhou, which will be concurrently held by the governors of Anhui and Zhejiang provinces, respectively. In the wartime system, this is a wise and appropriate measure in terms of unified local military and political operations. From this perspective, the fact that the Resident Pacification Commissioner of Wuhan is concurrently held by the Governor of Hubei Province and the Resident Pacification Commissioner of Xuzhou is concurrently held by the Governor of Huaihai Province indicates that a unified operational system has been fully completed in local military and political policies. The advancement of local administration can be smoother and more successful, and since local administrative officials also concurrently serve as local military commanders, military and political cooperation will inevitably be closer and more powerful. The past estrangement between local stationed troops and local governments will also be eliminated. As for Sun Liangcheng's transfer to the post of Resident Pacification Commissioner of Northern Jiangsu and the appointment of Pang Bingxun as Resident Pacification Commissioner of Kaifeng, based on their past experiences, both are renowned and outstanding military figures. It is expected that the security of northern Jiangsu and central Henan will become more consolidated in the future. Finally, it should be specially mentioned that Chuan Shi Shuo, Governor of Zhejiang Province, has been transferred to the post of Minister of Construction. At this time of urgent wartime production increase, Chuan, with a doctorate in engineering, is very suitable for heading the Ministry of Construction. It is deeply expected that he will realize his ambitions and contribute to promoting production and construction in the future.

### Japanese Troops Launch Fierce Attack in Guangxi Province

American Planes Shot Down in Hunan Air Battle

Japanese Front Line, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Powerful Japanese troops, at one stroke, broke through the road along the cliff of the Xiangjiang River in Beiliu, crossed the provincial border on the afternoon of the 9th, and advanced into Guangxi. They advanced 30 kilometers into the north of the province and also broke into Dajie (the vanguard of Quanxian County).

A Certain Base on the Chinese Front Line, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese air units have been very active in recent days to destroy the Chongqing-American air force. On the 12th, when a part of the Japanese aircraft was patrolling the airspace over Hunan, it discovered eight Chongqing-American aircraft (P-40 type fighters) invading. The Japanese aircraft took advantage of their imminent escape and engaged in a fierce air battle with them, shooting down three and destroying four, achieving remarkable results. In this battle, one Japanese aircraft was also sacrificed.

### Chongqing Extremely Panicked by Japanese Attack on Guangxi

Central News Agency report - In order to recapture Hengyang and gain the trust of the United States, the Chongqing military authorities are preventing the Japanese army from attacking Guangxi. 20 divisions of the army are massing in Baoqing, Qiyang, Changning, and other places, hoping to encircle Hengyang and prepare to launch a so-called offensive defense. According to a Chongqing telegram received locally today, the Japanese army has broken through the Hunan-Guangxi provincial border and has arrived at Quanxian County (a key point on the Xiang-Gui Railway), posing a great threat to the Chongqing military authorities and the American air force in Chongqing. Since the Japanese army launched its offensive at the end of August, it quickly defeated the Chongqing army and advanced at an astonishing speed of 15 kilometers per day on average. By the 4th, it had occupied Changning (the central stronghold of the Chongqing new defense line), on the 5th it occupied Qiyang, on the 7th it captured Lingling, and by the 8th it had occupied Dong'an, Xinning, and other places, advancing all the way to the Hunan-Guangxi provincial border. As a result, the false propaganda of the Chongqing authorities and the facts of the disastrous defeat have been completely exposed and avoided publishing. Reuters Chongqing on the 10th pointed out that the United States attaches the greatest importance to the war situation along the Xiang-Gui Railway, stating that Guilin is the largest air force base in southwestern China. According to a United Press Chongqing dispatch on the 10th, the Stilwell Command announced that the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing bombed the crossing point in Quanxian County, a key point on the Xiang-Gui Railway, and covered the Chongqing army operating in that area. It can be seen that the Japanese army has already arrived at Quanxian. According to reports, Quanxian is only 104 kilometers away from Guilin. In addition, the Chongqing Military Commission recently announced that the position of the Japanese army is in Dong'an, from which it can be seen that the Japanese army has advanced 40 kilometers from Dong'an. Although Chongqing telegrams have not announced the arrival of the Japanese army, in short, the Japanese attack on Guangxi has caused abnormal anxiety in the Chongqing anti-Japanese camp, and its future movements are worth watching.

Guangdong, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The elite Japanese troops, who had broken through the Hunan-Guangxi provincial border, continued their attack into Guangxi Province and have reached Quanxian County, a key defense point. The Chongqing army is in a very difficult situation. Bai Chongxi, Chief of Staff of the Chongqing Army, is the highest responsible person for the defense of Guilin. He has been extremely anxious about the severity of the war situation and the imminent crisis in recent days and is discussing the armed plan for the entire Guangxi Province with Li Jishen, a military advisor to the Guangxi faction. American officers stationed in Guilin have been evacuated to the interior. In addition, all the wounded soldiers of the Chongqing army received in Quanxian were transferred to Guizhou before the Japanese army's attack.

### Japanese Troops Launch Fierce Attack in Longling Area

Burma Front Line, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese troops on the Nu River continue to pressure the Chongqing army in the Longling area.

### General Matsui Issues Statement on East Indies

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - General Iwane Matsui, the head of the Japan-Asia Headquarters, issued a statement on the 13th to the people of the East Indies, the content of which is as follows: At the beginning of this Japanese parliament, it was stated that the independence of the East Indies would be allowed. For 340 years, the people of the East Indies have suffered under Dutch tyrannical rule, which is a pain and indignation shared by the Japanese people. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Dutch forces were eliminated, which is a good opportunity for the liberation of the East Indies. When the Netherlands surrendered, the Japanese government stated that it would make Indonesia a place for Indonesians to live in peace. In June of last year, the Japanese government declared that it would allow them to participate in politics, and soon the Central Advisory Council and special municipal councils of each state were established. This is the first step in the independence of the East Indies. Previously, Java launched a mass mobilization movement to concentrate its overall strength. In April of this year, the Java Service Association, with 50 million people, rose up to cooperate with Japan in completing the Greater East Asia War, striving to build a strong new Java, increasing production, and strengthening combat power, which has achieved great results. Those who hinder the independence of the East Indies are the three countries of England, America, and the Netherlands, but we have already defeated the enemy, and the foundation is becoming more and more solid. At the same time, we sincerely expect to move towards a strong and glorious independence.

### Soviet Troops Break Through Southeast of Warsaw

The war there is even more tense on the north bank of the Mieresch River, where the German-Hungarian army has established a favorable mountainous position from which to carry out a successful defense.

### Contents of the Armistice Agreement Between England, America, Russia, and Romania

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Moscow dispatch, the armistice agreement between the Romanian government and England, America, and Russia has been signed by Romanian representative Patrascinou and Marshal Malinovsky, commander of the Second Ukrainian Front of the Soviet Army, representing the anti-Axis powers.

Stockholm, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to the German News Agency, the armistice conditions of England, America, and Russia for Romania, including 20 articles, have been announced by Moscow Radio, the main points of which are as follows: Romania voluntarily recognizes itself as a defeated country and provides 10 infantry divisions to the Supreme Command of the Soviet Army to fight against Germany and its allies. Romania also undertakes to disarm and detain German troops within Romanian territory. The Romanian government is responsible for transporting anti-Axis forces within Romania and bears the costs of supplies and medical care. In addition, the Romanian government must release all prisoners of war and take care of their return home. Another condition is that all property of Germans within Romania must be confiscated. At the same time, Romania must bear the losses suffered by the Soviet Union due to the war, up to 300 million US dollars.

### Japanese Housewives' Airplane Work Team Demonstrates the Power of Increased Airplane Production

Tachikawa, in the capital, is a city of airplanes. The air is buzzing every day. People walking on the streets see signs everywhere that say [Tachikawa Airplane Work Team X Company X Platoon Workshop]. This airplane work team is the bustling group of home workshops in Tachikawa City that has grown with the development of airplanes. Just thinking about how this work team is the main force of the factory allows us to imagine the production efficiency of airplanes. Housewives who sew clothes and cook meals at home are able to exert such great power in the airplane sector, which determines a country's survival, which is enough to prove that women across the country should value their own greatness. Here, we introduce the battle posture of the [Tachikawa Airplane Work Team] as a reference for other [neighborhood associations] to participate in combat production.

### Birth and Organization

The headquarters of the work team is located in Akebonocho, Tachikawa City. Under the headquarters are five companies (organized by town) and forty platoons (organized by workshop). Although the work of each platoon involves about 20 people, the total number of team members is more than 750, 95% of whom are housewives, and the rest are men over 50 or 60 years old.

The products made by this large unit are piled up like a mountain the next day. How was such a huge organization formed? It was the result of Mr. Doi Tomeji, chairman of the Takamatsucho Town Association in Tachikawa City, who repeatedly worked hard to promote savings last October. At that time, he thought, how can we help the military demand? So he came up with such a great plan, and after consulting with Vice-Chairman Sato, he consulted with Mr. Sugiyama, head of the Tachikawa Aircraft Industrial Affairs Section, and after obtaining approval, he immediately began preparations. First, 25 of the most reliable women who had more time in each town were selected to begin discussions. This group is the company commander. This group of company commanders was summoned to one place, and they began to learn the technology for one month starting in November. The site of a closed restaurant was used, and the tools were provided free of charge by the factory.

Thus, starting on December 8th, three workshops were opened in January, and thirteen were opened in February. The number was steadily increasing. The service time is from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM. Currently, there are more than 40 places engaged in production. Therefore, the large factory in the airplane company with ○○ skilled workers specializing in the production of parts has been completely replaced by housewives. Recently, it has also been possible to allow work team members to engage in the production of more important parts. Workplaces do not make use of closed restaurants and coffee shops. At the same time, many enthusiastic families have given up their front halls and living rooms for use as workplaces, gradually achieving satisfactory results. Now, there are almost no unqualified products, which proves the unique enthusiasm and caution of women.

### Concerns About Empty Houses

All the workers here are housewives who take care of the house. They need to take care of their children and also prepare meals for their husbands to be sent to the service agencies. In addition, there are trivial matters such as receiving household rice and allocating oil. They are busy from morning to night. Everyone feels that this has become the daily work of Japanese women in wartime. If these problems cannot be solved, they cannot serve. Therefore, the members of each squad, organized by the town association, take turns to receive and distribute goods and send guards to protect the house from theft. Even small matters are carefully planned to ensure that they can work with peace of mind. This point is still fairly satisfactory, but due to insufficient allocation and the difficulty of obtaining food today, there are often many absentees, which naturally causes great difficulties in increasing production. The allocation problem is indeed a headache.

### Assistance from the Authorities

The city government, the police station, and the mobilization office all understand the situation, so they are very helpful. Therefore, service personnel receive extra rations, and service personnel who are qualified for the volunteer corps are also relieved of their duties. The registration of service personnel will be implemented soon in order to provide special preferential treatment.

### Enthusiasm of Team Members

Since the beginning of service, major events have occurred in the Pacific, such as the heroic sacrifice of all Japanese soldiers on Kwajalein and Roi-Namur Islands. Stimulated by this, the female members became more enthusiastic, so women as far away as Koganei Town also eagerly participated. Okubo Misao (53 years old), the branch director of the Japan Women's Association in Koganei, her daughter, Kinko (31 years old, widow of Lieutenant Atsuro Hirosawa of the Army), and Yoshie (30 years old, widow of Lieutenant Colonel Katsumi Fukuda of the Naval Aviation Technology Corps), both have fatherless orphans, and they surprisingly moved people by applying to join the Tachikawa workshop, so the Koganei branch was established. The old mother transformed her storage room into a workshop and officially started work on March 10th. There are about ten people in this branch.

Not long after the Koganei branch was established, a widow in Hoya Village, seven miles away, Mrs. Nakayama (21 years old), whose husband died for the country, immediately came to participate upon hearing the news. Since joining, she has been riding her bicycle to work every day without interruption.

### Words of Captain Doi

The headquarters has many data warehouses, and we hope more people will participate. Currently, among the 750 team members, the absenteeism rate has recently reached 40%, which seems to be a negative phenomenon. This is because housewives are busy standing in line every day to receive rice and oil, spending the whole day. Therefore, as long as the distribution doesn't cause problems, there will be improvement one day. Using clocks and winches is a specialty of women. The rigorous inspection by the product inspection office results in almost no unqualified products. The fact that Tachikawa has an airplane company is different from other areas. If the relevant authorities, as well as the [Japanese Women] and [Neighborhood Group] organizations, show enthusiasm, there will surely be greater achievements. Therefore, there is only one thing: don't let the team members worry about no one guarding their homes. If this can be achieved, I dare say that the power of home factories can stand against fairly large factories. I think, in this critical period, Tachikawa City will gradually become more developed.

### Air Defense Headquarters Urges Pedestrians to Obey Traffic Rules

To Avoid Unfortunate Accidents
The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters issued a statement on September 14, urging pedestrians to strictly abide by traffic rules, walk on sidewalks whenever possible, and if there are no sidewalks, to walk as close as possible to the left side of the road. The traffic regulations stipulate in detail that pedestrians should walk along the left-hand sidewalk, but under the current circumstances, the streetlights at night have been reduced to a minimum to meet air defense needs, and the headlights of motorcycles have also been dimmed, making it difficult for drivers to see people walking on the road, or even in the middle of the road. If the lights are turned off, it is even more difficult for drivers to see pedestrians in the middle of the road. When facing oncoming vehicles, drivers must concentrate on avoiding collisions with oncoming vehicles due to the darkness. If there are pedestrians in the middle of the road at this time, there is a risk that they may not be seen in time, leading to accidents. In view of the above points, the Air Defense Headquarters feels it is necessary to urgently remind the public of the importance of strictly observing the above-mentioned traffic rules. At the same time, the Air Defense Headquarters also advises rickshaw drivers, tricycle drivers, and cyclists, for their own safety and the safety of their passengers, not to drive in the middle of the road, and to advise passengers to encourage drivers to drive as close as possible to the left side of the road to avoid unfortunate accidents.

### The Materials Distribution Office Strictly Prevents Rice Shops from Switching Household Rice

In order to prevent rice merchants from privately switching household rice and taking advantage of the situation, the Materials Distribution Office has ordered all its public rice selling offices and retail rice selling points to follow the example of oil merchants selling household oil, sealing samples of household rice for each period in bottles and displaying them in the store counters. If citizens find that the rice sample does not match when purchasing household rice and have any doubts, they can bring the purchased rice to the Second Section of the office at any time to request an investigation. Once it is verified that the rice merchant has privately switched the rice or even deducted the quantity, the office will severely punish them.

### Correct Use of Air Defense Streetlights

Must Remain On During Alert Warnings
The Municipal Police Defense Division, in view of the importance of streetlights during air defense, has had the air defense authorities improve the streetlight equipment, adding air defense equipment, reducing the number of lights, and reducing the brightness. At the same time, air defense streetlights have been installed at various traffic intersections, stipulating that they may still be used during alert warnings. However, some secretarial personnel often do not pay attention, fail to repair damaged air defense streetlights, or turn off the air defense streetlights as soon as an alert sounds. This has a significant impact on urban cultural security and transportation issues. Therefore, each branch bureau has been ordered to instruct each Baojia self-defense group to pay close attention, assign personnel to manage the air defense streetlights, and notify the electric light company to repair any damage. At the same time, the opening and closing methods are also being corrected. During alert warnings, the air defense streetlights will remain on, and all air defense streetlights must be turned off after an air raid warning is issued.

### The Crime Prevention Section Investigates Various Special Businesses

The Crime Prevention Section of the Judicial Department of the Municipal Police Bureau is actively promoting crime prevention work.

Therefore, an investigation has been conducted on the above-mentioned industries, and investigation forms have been prepared, instructing each industry to truthfully and detailedly fill out the forms and maintain constant contact with the section. If there is suspicion of receiving stolen goods or if guests in special business establishments have suspicious behavior, the section should be reported for thorough investigation. Otherwise, once it is found that stolen goods have been received or that a guest is a criminal and the matter is not reported, strict punishment will be imposed according to the law.

Otherwise, if the investigation is verified, it will be reported to the competent authorities for severe punishment].
