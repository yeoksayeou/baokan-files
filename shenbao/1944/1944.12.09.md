They attacked the enemy garrison and damaged enemy aircraft and airfield facilities. On that day, the northeast wind was extremely strong over Leyte, making the attack extremely difficult. According to reports from specially equipped transport personnel who returned to a certain base that day, all units reached their designated locations. At the same time, reports sent to the base by the parachute units indicated that the attacks were successful.

### Japanese Aircraft Attack Saipan Island; Conduct Low-Altitude Bombing; Enemy Airfield on Morotai Heavily Damaged

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) On the 3rd of this month, when enemy aircraft launched their fourth attack on Tokyo, 22 were shot down and several others were damaged. Subsequently, with the opening of the war memorial day on the 8th, the enemy concentrated B-29 aircraft at Aslito Airfield on Saipan Island and bases in the Mariana Islands to make a demonstration. In order to take preemptive action, the Japanese Air Force launched a surprise attack on the enemy airfield at Aslito on the morning of the 7th, carrying out ultra-low-altitude bombing, destroying over a dozen enemy B-29 aircraft, demolishing more than ten of their facilities, and setting them on fire.

There were multiple B-29 aircraft neatly lined up inside Aslito Airfield, perhaps in preparation for an air raid on Tokyo. The attack unit immediately targeted them, suddenly descending and launching a surprise attack. Subsequently, the B-29 aircraft were engulfed in flames. At this time, local artillery fire began to fire, so the combat results were extremely great. Furthermore, this type of attack will continue to be carried out before the recapture of the Mariana Islands.

### Prime Minister's Address

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) Japanese Prime Minister Koiso delivered a speech at a reception held at the Imperial Hotel for envoys from various countries stationed in Japan on the 8th, forcefully stating the purpose of Japan's war and comparing and contrasting the enemy's (British and American) ambition to dominate the world with Japan's war aim of liberating East Asia. The gist is as follows:

Eliminating Aggressive Forces Completely At this crucial moment when the world's new destiny is being decided, I would like to explain in detail to the world the nature of this war and the purpose of our operations. This operation seeks to liberate the homelands of the East Asian peoples from the oppression of the British and Americans, to forcefully eliminate the British and American aggressors, and to defend East Asia. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese military has fought bravely, expelling the enemy's aggressive forces from East Asia, laying the foundation for the restoration and prosperity of East Asia. Among your home countries, there are also many patriots who are cooperating with Japan, responding to the Japanese military's operations, and rising up one after another, jointly dedicating themselves to the holy war to restore East Asia. Now that British and American forces in China have been completely swept away, Burma and the Philippines have achieved their long-held aspirations and achieved independence, and the Republic of China, which has reclaimed concessions and abolished extraterritoriality, has now become a completely autonomous and independent great power, and is cooperating with Japan to move towards establishing lasting peace in East Asia. The construction of a new East Asia based on morality is progressing vigorously day by day. Thus, the collective ideal of the construction of East Asia by various countries and nations crystallized into the Greater East Asia Declaration, that is, our East Asian countries will liberate East Asia from British and American aggression and exploitation in order to seek its restoration.

Economic Reciprocity and Open Resources At the same time, it seeks to realize cooperation, friendship, and a peaceful order with all countries in the world on the principle of mutual equality in the political sphere, without coercion or aggression. In the economic sphere, it seeks to ensure morality, freedom, and the realization of the ideal of opening up a common market for resources based on the principle of reciprocity. Conversely, the British and Americans are stubbornly attempting to permanently place the entire world under their absolute authority, to monopolize world resources, and to satisfy their plundering desires. They are manipulating their strategic offensives, disrupting the alliance of the Axis powers, and oppressing neutral countries, attempting to lure them into their sphere of influence. They are even deludedly believing that they will win, and are talking grandly about post-war management, feigning sincerity towards international peace. However, their so-called world peace is nothing more than the domination of the world by Britain and the United States, placing Asia under their control. They are manipulating their cruel means in everything, including military, economic, political, and cultural matters, in order to maintain and strengthen their exploitative and aggressive mechanisms, with the intention of making the world submit to their own power. There is no doubt that their unbridled ambition has been revealed by the announcement of the Atlantic Charter.

Fighting Together with European Allies In response to this ambition to dominate the world, the countries of East Asia are becoming increasingly indignant, vowing to defend East Asia to the death, and are cooperating with European allies to destroy the fierce enemy in order to establish lasting peace in the world. We are now enthusiastically participating in the decisive battle. Our unity is becoming ever closer, and our determination is becoming ever more firm. The war situation is now urgent. The decisive battle for the fate of Greater East Asia and Europe is becoming increasingly severe. Although the enemy has abundant material resources, in order to conceal their ambiguous war aims and maintain their easily disrupted unity, they are eager for a short-term ceasefire. Therefore, the key to turning the tide of the war lies in this intense stage of decisive battle. At present, we must seize the opportunity with an unyielding spirit and a strong sense of courage, fight resolutely, and without a doubt, final victory will belong to us because we are on the side of justice.

### Mr. Iguchi, Director of the Information Bureau, Discusses the Current Stage of the War

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) Mr. Iguchi, Director of the Third Department of the Information Bureau, gave a speech on the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, explaining the current stage of the war, Japan's war aims, and the enemy's aggressive policies, and denouncing the enemy, Britain and the United States, as those responsible for the war. The original text is as follows: This unprecedented war in history is still continuing, causing human civilization to stagnate or even regress. Not only are countless precious cultural achievements reduced to ashes by war, but also many promising young people who will bear the fate of the world in the future are losing their lives. However, if we consider the root cause of this human tragedy, we should attribute it to the aggressive policies of Britain and the United States, which hinder peace, seek to dominate the world politically and economically, and only pursue their own national interests. This becomes even clearer when we look at the course of the outbreak of the war. Japan and the countries of Greater East Asia are united, single-mindedly pursuing their common war aims, and will continue to wage a brave struggle to destroy their war potential until they lose their will to fight. During the First World War, Britain and the United States repeatedly called for a war to end all wars, but the result of the First World War became the cause of even greater wars. The greatest responsibility for this lies with the victorious powers of the time, Britain and the United States, who pursued a policy of dominating the world, monopolizing prosperity, following the strong, and being exclusivist and selfish. Especially in East Asia, Britain and the United States not only strengthened their exploitation of the colonies, but also incited the Chongqing regime to wage war against Japan, in order to divide China and pit East Asia against each other. The leaders of the great war in Britain and the United States, by employing this kind of policy, caused the world to fall into the scourge of war again, and at the same time, caused the sons and daughters of their countries to sacrifice themselves in wars that had nothing to do with their own lives, and to continue to sacrifice themselves. On the contrary, Japan's war aims have been specifically stated in the Greater East Asia Declaration last year, and the explanation given by Foreign Minister Shigemitsu recently is also very clear. They originate from the self-defense and liberation of the East Asian peoples, and aim to lay a new foundation for world peace through the sovereignty and equality of all countries, economic reciprocity, and cultural exchange. Therefore, the organization of British and American despotism and the ideology of exercising military force are fundamentally different from those of Japan. At the current stage of the war, the fundamental opposition between the war aims of the two sides has become extremely clear, and everyone in the world can recognize those responsible for this war. At this time, the Greater East Asia War is becoming increasingly favorable to Japan. In the important areas supporting the war, the enemy is gradually being suppressed. The morale of the Japanese front and rear is becoming increasingly high, and they are increasingly able to grasp the belief in a just war and march straight towards victory.

### A Righteous Army Will Surely Prevail in the End

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) Mr. Mishina, Director of the Press Department of the China Expeditionary Army, gave a recorded broadcast from the Tokyo Central Broadcasting Station on the evening of the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, entitled "The China Expeditionary Army Conducting the Greater East Asia War on the Chinese Mainland." The gist is as follows:

British Prime Minister Churchill once made the preposterous statement that justice does not necessarily prevail in any world, meaning that no matter how clear the cause, war does not necessarily lead to victory, and there may even be times when one is defeated. Can the great cause of war be simply a matter of wrestling between philosophical forces? Indeed, if we look at history, both East and West, ancient and modern, the righteous do not necessarily win, and there are times when they fail. However, in such situations, the righteous may appear to have failed, but they have not actually been crushed. In other words, in such situations, defeat is only a superficial phenomenon, and is not affected in essence. If we look at the changes in world history, justice is the ultimate victor, and this has become the driving force for the development of human society. Therefore, that which absolutely determines victory in war is the cause of righteousness. All other factors can be said to be relative. Therefore, without a great cause, it is extremely difficult to win a war. Even if victory is achieved, it is only a temporary phenomenon. The iron law of history has proclaimed to us that the unrighteous will surely fail, without a doubt. Consider Napoleon, who once dominated all of Europe and acted as he pleased. But how long did it last before he died a prisoner on St. Helena? This Greater East Asia War is a war of great cause, unprecedented in history. Its purpose is to overthrow the Anglo-Saxon imperialism that has oppressed East Asia for centuries, and to create a purely East Asian Pan-Asian society in the Greater East Asia region in order to contribute to the establishment of world peace. This great ideal is a great cause that is unchanging throughout ancient and modern times, and throughout the world. Now that the Greater East Asia War has reached its third anniversary, although there have been many superficial changes, the belief in certain victory among every Japanese citizen is becoming stronger. This is because the entire nation has grasped the historical iron law that "justice never fails" and has made it a national faith.

If China and Japan cannot cooperate forever, then the name of the Greater East Asia War will always be an empty word. The cooperation between China and Japan that I am talking about now is based on the great cause of the Greater East Asia War. This is not something that can be achieved through hegemony or cunning tactics, but can only be ensured by walking the path of benevolence, righteousness, and the right way. On this third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, I hereby express that the soldiers of the China Expeditionary Army will uphold the great way that the benevolent are invincible and righteousness will never perish, strengthen their belief in certain victory, and advance shoulder to shoulder with our comrades fighting in the Pacific and Southeast Asia towards the path of victory.

### The Situation of the Greater East Asia War after Three Years: Broadcast Address by Director of Information Kishi

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) (Continued from yesterday) What we should know is the Americans are uncertain about their own destiny. An article published in the magazine *American Business* in June pointed out that "Japan has won in the political war." At the start of the Greater East Asia War, they boasted that "victory will be achieved within three months," but three years later, they have fallen into a crisis. They boast about abundant resources, but the rubber parts of the B-29 aircraft shot down in Northern Kyushu were made of crude rubber. To put it plainly, if we suffer, they will suffer too. Today is the opportune moment to thoroughly crush the arrogant enemy, Britain and the United States, and strive for victory. Because the closer the enemy gets to the Japanese mainland, the longer their supply lines become, and the more advantageous the terrain becomes for Japan. Japan's war preparations are now foolproof. However, those who are careless can make great mistakes. We cannot underestimate the enemy's resources, but war intention is the key to victory or defeat. The spirit of the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force is unmatched by the material power of Britain and the United States. (End)

### Japan Will Surely Retaliate Against American Aircraft Bombing: Prime Minister Koiso Explains Determination Yesterday

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) On the morning of the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War on the 8th, Japanese Prime Minister Koiso, in a broadcast speech, expressed the determination of 100 million people regarding the bombing of Tokyo by American aircraft as follows: We, the Japanese people, who have a firm resolution to fight to the end and a belief in certain victory, are not afraid of this bombing by the enemy Americans. The more the enemy bombs, the more we will strengthen our unwavering determination with the increase in their bombs. If the enemy Americans dare to harm the central region we revere in the future, the Japanese people vow to inflict harsh retaliatory measures on the American people.

Editorial

### Further Understanding of the Greater East Asia War: Speeches at the "Citizens' Celebration Rally" and "Shanghai Radio Broadcast" in Shanghai

— Chen Binhe

Today marks the third anniversary of our commemoration of the Greater East Asia War. However, this commemoration is particularly significant as it falls during a decisive moment in the war. Over the past three years, we have held the Allied Japanese military and civilians in the Greater East Asia War in utmost respect for their achievements. China is an important member of the Greater East Asia War. We have spoken extensively about our responsibilities in the war and how to cooperate to ultimately achieve victory. Today, I want to discuss the further understanding that people within the peace zone and those under the rule of Chongqing should have.

In the Pacific, the enemy Americans have repeatedly suffered heavy blows. Recently, the enemy American naval and air forces invading the Philippines, under the heroic counterattack of the Allied forces, have reached the end of their strength. The enemy British on the borders of India and Burma have consistently been restrained by the Allied forces. As for mainland China, the Allied forces are making steady progress and have now broken into Guizhou Province, further exacerbating Chongqing's predicament. These glorious victories and favorable situations are entirely the price paid by the Allied military and civilians, who have shouldered the heavy burden of the Greater East Asia War, through their united and arduous struggle. Although our contributions to the Greater East Asia War in terms of manpower and resources over the past three years have not been insignificant, we are truly ashamed when compared to the Allied military and civilians! We have full confidence in the victory of the Greater East Asia War. However, we should understand that our enemies, Britain and America, are not so fragile and can still make a final struggle; at the same time, they are further coercing and driving Chongqing to be our enemy and sacrifice itself for them. This increases our difficulties and makes our responsibilities heavier. Most compatriots within the peace zone can recognize this future and devote themselves to the cause of national liberation, but there are also some compatriots who neglect the awareness of how to be a dutiful citizen, and there is a need to awaken them in this regard.

This war is a war for the liberation of the East Asian nations, a war that will determine whether the Chinese nation will be masters or slaves. All Chinese people cannot stand outside the war; they must live in the war. Of course, the government should urgently seek ways to strive in this regard. However, each of our citizens should further recognize that national liberation requires the entire nation to have an independent sense of self-respect and an independent demand. Only then can there be the liberation of the entire nation. Historical development is a continuous struggle. Struggle cannot be separated from reality or take a break, waiting until it suits one's own interests to work hard again. Know that the evolution of history is not linear but curved. If we adopt an attitude of "prudent self-preservation" or a mentality of "fishing in troubled waters" at any time, then, from an individual perspective, we may escape temporary difficulties or ascend to heaven in one step, but directly or indirectly, we weaken or lose the vitality of the nation. If we do not first seek national independence and freedom, then individual temporary comfort and wealth are not only castles in the sand, but conversely, due to our disloyalty and lack of effort to the nation, we increase the responsibilities and difficulties of the next generation. When the war reaches a difficult and decisive moment, when the entire nation rises up together, I hope that compatriots from all walks of life in the peace zone will take the interests of the nation as their own and devote themselves to the great cause of national liberation, that is, to cooperate in the successful completion and victory of the Greater East Asia War.

All Chinese people should stand together and strive. This is the hope for the compatriots in the peace zone; however, for the compatriots under the rule of Chongqing, I now have even greater expectations. I sympathize with your distress of not being able to freely develop your ambitions. We believe that many of you must have understood the true meaning of comprehensive peace and are willing to run to our side. Now you are only restricted by the environment and cannot express it. However, I believe that this distress will eventually be relieved for you, as long as you can be firm, hold more of your desire for comprehensive peace, find ways to influence others, and jointly urge the Chongqing authorities to become aware, complete peace, and establish a truly independent country.

However, although there must be many people who understand the true meaning of comprehensive peace, I am afraid that there are still many people who are currently confused by Chongqing's reckless dragging on the war. For these people, I sincerely ask you to wake up soon. Japan has long signed equal treaties with China and has already practically abandoned the various privileges left in China by Britain and America, and has returned the concessions. Within the peace zone, except for the combat troops, we have gained complete autonomy. Conversely, Chongqing is now clearly controlled by Britain and America, especially the United States. Dragging on the war only serves as a tool for Britain and America, dragging on the war only expands the power of the Communist Party, and the common people suffer more and more, and the more the country drags on the more its vitality is lost. At the same time, the facts are very clearly in front of our eyes. The Chongqing army is retreating steadily, and the Japanese army has now reached the border of Guizhou Province. The "War of Resistance" that you have hoped for from Chongqing for more than eight years for national independence and liberation can now prove to be a complete failure, dragging you into a colonial position that is even worse than before. The Japanese side has stated that it does not consider the people of Chongqing as enemies. In Hunan, Guangxi, and now Guizhou, the sincerity of the Japanese side is clearer to you than to me in Shanghai, right? Whether Chongqing can achieve victory, in this defeat, you understand it better than me in Shanghai, right? With these many facts placed before you, you should face reality and not be blinded by the one-sided propaganda of Britain and America. You should wake up soon, join hands with those who have already awakened, and urge the Chongqing authorities to make a decision quickly, stop dragging on the war, and help achieve comprehensive peace. Chongqing relies on you, the common people, to be its pillar for it to exist. As long as you can all wake up, then, if the pillar is lost, the elements dragging on the war will inevitably be powerless. People in the peace zone and under the rule of Chongqing, please unite together!

### Encouraging All East Asian Nations to Continue Advancing the Total War: Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government Delivered a Broadcast Speech Yesterday

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - For the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Acting Chairman Chen of the National Government, at 9:20 PM on the 8th, gave a broadcast speech to the national citizens and all East Asian comrades via the Central Radio Station, encouraging them to strive forward. The original text is as follows:

The outbreak of the Greater East Asia War has now been exactly three years. In the past three years, the nations and peoples of East Asia have risen up together, gathered their total strength, and formed a unified front and rear. Under the common goal of defending and building East Asia, they have actively advanced. This is the greatest struggle launched by the Asian nations for common survival and development since Asia has had history.

For over a century, countless wars have occurred in Asian countries. Those wars were either the imperialists attacking us separately or jointly, and the Asian nations only rose up to resist in a piecemeal fashion, eventually being bullied and trampled upon, or they were provoked and alienated by the imperialists, leading to the tragedy of mutual slaughter. This allowed the imperialists to take advantage of the situation, seize our land, plunder our resources, and enslave our compatriots. Only this time, all Asian nations and peoples, with a common goal and for a common action, have risen up together to fight to eliminate aggression, for common defense, and for common survival.

From a passive perspective, the Greater East Asia War is to expel the common enemy of East Asia for over a century, the Anglo-American aggressors, to strive for the liberation of all East Asian nations. From a positive perspective, it is also to combine the inherent moral righteousness of the East Asian nations to build a new world where East Asia can permanently coexist and prosper. Therefore, this large-scale unprecedented decisive battle is of great significance.

Building an Independent and Autonomous Nation - Since the Opium War, China has gradually become a semi-colony of Anglo-American aggressors. Coastal ports were almost completely occupied by them, becoming bridgeheads for Anglo-American economic aggression. Many other cities were also opened up as concessions, building bases for their political and cultural aggression. Material resources were also mostly enslaved and exploited. Compatriots throughout the country have endured humiliation and carried grievances, living a subhuman life of slavery under the shackles of unequal treaties. It was not until Sun Yat-sen advocated the National Revolution that the continuous struggle for national independence against aggression began. The purpose of the National Revolution was to seek freedom and equality for China, and at the same time to seek independence and liberation for Asian countries. To achieve this goal, it was necessary to awaken the masses and unite with the nations in the world that treat us equally, and to struggle together. Only in this way can we overthrow the remaining feudal forces internally and overthrow the aggressive forces of the imperialists externally. Only in this way can we develop the national strength and link up with friendly countries with shared interests and common destiny to win back the position of master and establish an independent and autonomous modern nation, and establish a group of nations that support each other. The blood and sweat sacrificed by compatriots throughout the country for this purpose cannot be said to be few, and the struggles engaged in for this purpose cannot be said to be not fierce. In the past fifty or sixty years, the reason why the nation has been able to avoid the misfortune of being partitioned and jointly administered, and the reason why it has been able to strive for increased international status amid all kinds of difficulties, is all due to the continuous struggles, continuous sacrifices, and continuous bloodshed of compatriots throughout the country. However, the strength of a united country is not strong enough, and when internal unity is not yet consolidated, the imperialists will instigate and manipulate, leading to differences of opinion and internal strife. Furthermore, because the diplomatic policy is indecisive and it is impossible to establish alliances with other countries, causing fragmentation and confusion, and with foreign troubles pressing, the cunning Anglo-American imperialists are able to exert various conspiracies of coercion, temptation, and division. The National Revolution has risen and fallen, suffering setbacks, and the unfortunate Sino-Japanese Incident was also triggered by these internal and external contradictions. This is the old story that we cannot help but recall today as the Greater East Asia War has developed to this point.

East Asia is One Family, Sharing Life and Death - The means by which imperialists practice aggression are: first, the oppression of force, making people afraid to resist; and second, insidious manipulation, making people unable to resist. This is true for India, for Burma, for various parts of Southeast Asia, for China, and for the entire East Asia. Therefore, the strategy of anti-aggression lies not only in defending against the aggressor's force, but especially in preventing the aggressor's insidious and cunning tactics. Only in this way can we amass all the necessary and possible forces to engage in a struggle that is bound to win and not lose. As far as China is concerned, this principle must be achieved by ensuring that the Party cannot be divided and the country must be unified, and then China's freedom and equality can be ensured. As far as East Asia is concerned, it must also be ensured that East Asia is one family, sharing life and death, and then the victory of the decisive battle can be expected, and the construction of common prosperity can be achieved.

For six years, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, we have been committed to the movement of establishing a nation with peace and harmony. Its basic concept lies in a unified party, a unified country, seeking unified peace, that is, in first restoring Sino-Japanese relations, and then closely cooperating to jointly respond to world changes, contributing to world peace by stabilizing East Asia. Although time has passed and unification has not been achieved, and peace has not been established, our wishes have remained the same. Our efforts have not been relaxed in the slightest. When the Greater East Asia War came, thanks to the Allied Japan rising up, on the one hand, taking on the role of the vanguard in defending East Asia, and on the other hand, igniting the unity of the East Asian nations, the Sino-Japanese Incident was transformed into a war to defend East Asia, and the original face of the National Revolution could be completed, and the basic concept of the peace movement became even clearer. Our wishes therefore had the opportunity to be realized, and our efforts were therefore able to get started. Therefore, shortly after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government resolutely declared war. We deeply knew that seeking China's freedom and equality was a once-in-a-millennium key, and we had to strive to be strong and not lag behind others. We also knew that the stability of East Asia, the survival of each East Asian nation, and their common survival were all tied to this battle. A good opportunity could not be missed, so there was no hesitation, and no one hesitated. In these three years, the Allied Japan, with all its elite troops and strength, took on the role of the vanguard of the struggle, engaging the enemy on the battlefield, and has already achieved brilliant results. Other friendly nations in East Asia have also risen up to fight without fail, offering all their manpower and material resources, either advancing wave upon wave, engaging the brutal enemy in close combat, or cooperating with the Allies, fulfilling the heavy responsibilities of the rear. Therefore, as the Greater East Asia War progresses to the current stage of its climax, the fighting spirit of all East Asian nations is becoming more and more vigorous, and the axis of defending East Asia is also expanding and strengthening day by day.

Final Victory Will Surely Belong to Us - Since the Greater East Asia War is a war for the liberation of all East Asian nations, we can only make the determination of a revolution, coordinate with close actions, and use all our total strength, producing non-stop, to make a vow-to-die decisive battle. Only with the determination of a revolution can we strengthen the belief of certain victory, and only with close actions can we eliminate all difficulties. All of East Asia has a billion-strong fighting force, with unparalleled huge material resources, solid maritime fortresses, and vast continental bases. Applying them to the determination and action of revolution, then the final victory will surely belong to us, without a doubt. The war situation may still extend with ups and downs, but the more the war situation extends, the more intense our struggle will be, and therefore our victory will be closer, more certain, and more assured.

Under such circumstances, what is the future of China? I once said, "No matter what country, if it wants to survive and wants to revive, the most reliable way is to rely on itself. There are many ways to work hard by oneself, and the most important point is that as a participating country, it has the responsibilities of a participating country, and at the same time, it should fulfill the obligations of a participating country. Whether we can seek freedom and equality from the Greater East Asia War and ensure freedom and equality depends first on how much responsibility we bear for the Greater East Asia War and how many obligations we fulfill."

Promoting Peace and Rescuing Chongqing - In terms of the current situation, consolidating the rear, supplying the front, and crushing the enemy's remaining forces, so that they abandon their ambition to re-invade East Asia, is the first important task. Promoting peaceful unification and rescuing Chongqing, so that it gets rid of the shackles of Britain and America, is another important task. How can we consolidate the rear? Chairman Wang instructed: (1) To rectify thought, (2) To establish security, (3) To stabilize people's livelihood. How can we supply the front? (1) To increase production, (2) To conserve consumption. We have made continuous efforts in this regard in the past, and we should make even greater efforts in the future. As for peaceful unification and rescuing Chongqing, what are the obstacles to peace, what are the difficulties in unification, and what is the distress of Chongqing? These are all things that we should deeply consider and jointly seek to break through.

On the day when the fourth year of the Greater East Asia War begins, as we look forward to the brightness of the future, we cannot help but think of the constant teachings that Chairman Wang gave us during his lifetime. We firmly believe that Chairman Wang's prescient instructions and the appeal of his great personality will surely make all our compatriots never forget. We vow to inherit his legacy, to implement the original intention of the peace movement, and to complete the Greater East Asia War and the mission of revitalizing China and protecting Asia. Compatriots throughout China, comrades throughout Asia, the light is before us, let us move forward!

### Ambassador Gu Departs from Nanjing for Japan

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to China Gu, in order to consult with his home government on important matters, departed from Nanjing for Japan by plane on the morning of the 8th, accompanied by military attaches Imai and Maeda, and Secretary Qingshui.

### Enhebatu Dies, National Government Issues Order of Commendation

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - After Enhebatu, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee of the National Government, passed away at his residence in Nanjing on the 6th due to illness, the National Government issued an order of commendation on the 8th, and granted 100,000 yuan for funeral expenses.

### Japanese Army Captures Longzhou, Opens Up Border Between Guangxi and Vietnam, Main Artery Across the Continent to be Completed Soon

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - After capturing Nanning on November 24, the Japanese army continued to advance and has now approached the border of Vietnam. On the other hand, the Japanese army in Vietnam also began to attack within Guangxi Province at the end of November. Its right-wing troops captured Mingjiang on the 30th, and its left-wing troops captured Longzhou (a key fortress between Nanning and the Vietnamese border) on December 3rd. As a result, the Chongqing army's border defense posture was completely disrupted. When the Japanese army attacked the Guilin-Liuzhou area, the Chongqing military authorities stated that they would dispatch the border garrison to the Guilin-Liuzhou battlefield to fight, so the area was left empty. As a result, the Japanese army took advantage of the emptiness and entered after breaking through the border line, further penetrating into Guangxi Province to meet up with the Japanese army moving south. The Chongqing camp, regarding this offensive, while the Battle of Hengyang was in full swing, once said that "the Japanese army's operational intention is to connect Beijing to Guangzhou via Hankou, achieving its 2,000-kilometer-long Great Wall line that bisects the continent," but this time, due to the imminent meeting of the Japanese Southern Army and the Japanese Army in Vietnam, the Japanese strategic artery, which runs from Busan, Fengtian, Beijing, Hankou, Changsha, Hengyang, Guilin, Nanning, and then to Hanoi, through Bangkok to Syonan, a total length of 5,000 kilometers, is about to be completed.

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the progress of the Japanese Southern Army and the Japanese Army in Vietnam in the operation to bisect the Chinese mainland, it is expected that the two armies will be able to meet in the near future, and the continental bisecting railway will also gradually reach the stage of realization. For the opening of the continental bisecting railway, the Japanese Diet explained it last year in Railway Minister Hatta's plan, and the realization problem still requires considerable time. However, after investigation, it is known that it can also be realized in a very short period. Once the Japanese army opens up the mainland, construction can begin. The main line of the continental bisecting railway starts from Tokyo, passes through Busan, Fengtian, Beijing, and then reaches Hankou via the Beijing-Hankou Line, connects to the Guangdong-Hankou Line, passes through Zhuzhou, Hengyang, to Liuzhou, Nanning, and enters Vietnam from Zhennanguan to Hanoi, and then passes through Tanap and Bangkok, to reach the terminal Syonan. The second line is from Tokyo to Nagasaki, reaching Shanghai by sea, passing through Jinhua, Nanchang, Zhuzhou, and connecting with the first line. The distance between Tokyo and Syonan on the first line is 10,870 kilometers, requiring 9 days and 13 hours. The distance between Shanghai and Syonan on the second line is 5,200 kilometers, requiring 4 days and 23 hours, and 6 days and 23 hours from Tokyo. The parts that have not yet been completed are 640 kilometers between Liuzhou and Zhennanguan in China, and 200 kilometers between Tanap and Tatakek in Vietnam, totaling only 840 kilometers. From a topographical point of view, there are no problems in construction on the Chinese side. Although the Annam Mountains obstruct the Vietnamese border, there are no difficulties. If tunnel construction begins, it can be completed at the latest within a year. After this road is completed, the enemy's air guerrilla warfare will lose its power, and the transportation between Japan and the southern regions will be smooth, and transportation can be strengthened, so it is indeed a great undertaking to complete the Greater East Asia War.

### Ambassador Aizawa Returns Home, Issues Statement

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Former Japanese Special Envoy to Vietnam Aizawa, having completed his three-year term, returned home on the 5th. On the 7th, he met with reporters at the Greater East Asia Ministry and issued the following statement: French Vietnam is a region with differences in rulers and the ruled, and in race. The 23 million residents there are placed under the rule of white people, so Japan adopts an extremely solemn attitude in this state. The Vietnamese Governor-General's Office also cooperates with Japan in a difficult and complex environment. In the past, during economic warfare negotiations, there were some frictions, but after General Governor Decoux made a thorough judgment on the overall situation, he was able to accept Japan's opinions. In addition, I further expect that it will continue to proceed smoothly in the future according to the previous policy. Furthermore, the U.S. military has begun to attack the Philippines and has publicly stated that it will establish air bases on the Chinese mainland, but the facts show us that the victory of the Battle of Leyte Island will undoubtedly belong to Japan. At the same time, the large-scale operations of the Japanese army on the Chinese mainland have resulted in the longitudinal railway from Peiping to Guangzhou falling into the hands of the Japanese army, so the U.S. military's wild hopes have failed.

### Soviet Tank Brigade 30 Miles from Hongdu, Establishes Bridgehead on the Danube

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency reports that a German military spokesman pointed out that the Soviet tank brigade that broke through the German-Hungarian defense line east of Hatvan and penetrated deeply has now reached 30 kilometers north of Hongdu. The army initially advanced northwest towards the Danube bend north of Hongdu, but when it reached 30 kilometers from the river bend, it suddenly turned south. Currently, the German army is fiercely fighting the Soviet tank force. South of Hongdu, the German defense line extends eastward from the northern end of Lake Platten to the Danube. On the 5th, the Soviet army established six bridgeheads on this front line. On the 6th, the German army counterattacked and destroyed four of them, and the remaining two were merged into one bridgehead, with the widest point being two kilometers.

### Japan's Asian Cooperation Council Holds Second Day of Meetings

Milan, 8th (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency reports, citing news from Rome: Bonomi told the press last night that we have reached the end of the road, and I will now take over as the head of the government. This statement proves that the crisis of the government has been temporarily eliminated. Fammostai will serve as Foreign Minister, and Communist Togliatti and Christian Democratic leader Gasparri will be appointed as Deputy Prime Ministers.

### Record of Su Kunyu's Inspection of Rice Producing Areas (3)

Two, Collection of Land Tax in Kind

Since ancient times until the Ming Dynasty, China's land tax was collected in kind. For example, during the Han Dynasty, one-fifteenth of farmers' income was taken as tax. During the Tang Dynasty, the Zuyongdiao system was implemented, which collected rice (Zu), silk, damask, paintings (Diao), and corvée labor, or the commutation of Han silk (Yong). It was not until the third year of Ming Yingzong (507 years ago) that an order was given to commute the tax to silver, and later it was changed to gold, silver, legal tender, and other currencies for the payment of land tax.

The Jiangsu Provincial Government, due to the extremely drastic changes in commodity prices this year, changed the land tax to collection in kind for two reasons: First, to maintain the financial expenditure of the provincial government. Second, to maintain the rice supply for the provincial military and police. The planned amount of land tax to be collected this year is 660,000 shi (unit of dry volume, approx. 100 liters), which is based on the conversion of last year's cash payment of land tax into in-kind collection. This planned amount accounts for 40% of the total land tax calculated based on the total cultivated area of Jiangsu Province. It is planned that one-third of the collected rice will be used for the provincial military and police, to be distributed by the provincial government. The other two-thirds will in principle be sold to the Rice Control Association, hoping to stabilize the livelihood of the people in the four major cities in the province through rice rationing.

The amount of land tax collected averages one dou (unit of dry volume, approx. 10 liters) per mu (unit of area, approx. 0.16 acres) in Changshu. For farmers paying on behalf of landowners, farmers pay rice for land tax at the sub-collection office and receive a temporary receipt. The amount corresponding to the land rent is deducted from the amount used to pay the land tax, and then the temporary receipt and the land rent amount are handed over together to exchange for an official receipt.

In Changshu, a unified measure of land tax, land rent, and rice purchase is implemented. The method has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for filing. The main points and steps are: First, the average purchase quantity for farmers is four dou per mu. Second, farmers pay one dou per mu for land tax. Third, the receipt and rent amount (deducting the price of land tax rice) are handed over to the landowner. The collected land tax is sold to the Rice Control Association, with half going to the county government for disposal and the other half remitted to the province.

The biggest key to the in-kind collection of land tax is whether there are malpractices such as excessive collection, delayed payment, embezzlement, and corruption between the farmers' delivery to the provincial government. The journalist group asked the provincial government about this issue. According to the representative of the provincial government, "The authorities will do their best to prevent it, and use a joint form 'one original and three copies' as proof, with the county governments directly responsible. At the same time, strict supervision will be exercised to prevent the generation of malpractices."

Based on the inspection, the following three points are summarized to inform the authorities:

First, it is said that the sub-collection office of land tax uses large scales (24-liang scale) during in-kind collection, so that farmers actually need to pay one dou and five sheng (unit of dry volume, approx. 1 liter) to pay one dou of land tax, resulting in a large loss for farmers.

Second, the fines stipulated by the Jiangsu authorities, such as "late payment fees," mean that farmers who pay land tax after the specified time are required to pay fines, with the amount reaching one-tenth of the land tax. Farmers are quite distressed about this. It is hoped that the "late payment fee" method will be abolished and replaced with an incentive method to encourage farmers to complete grain payment as soon as possible.

Third, in the cotton-producing areas of Changshu, the land tax paid is also calculated at one dou of rice, or the black market price of one dou of rice is paid to the land tax sub-collection office, which then purchases rice on their behalf to pay the grain tax. (The reporter asked County Chief Wang of Changshu about this issue, and he denied it, but according to the deputy director of the land tax sub-collection office in Meili Town, it has indeed been implemented.) The cotton harvested by farmers is sold at the official price, but to pay the land tax, they need to purchase rice at the black market price or pay according to this price, which is somewhat unfair.

Since the relevant authorities claim that rice and grain are no longer commodities and are listed as important resources in the rear during the war, then farmers are soldiers engaged in production. Farmers hand over purchased rice for military and civilian needs on the one hand, and pay land tax to maintain the rationed rice for military, police, and officials on the other hand. In principle, farmers should be treated with respect and love. In reality, the heavy burden of miscellaneous taxes and levies borne by farmers is shocking. It is hoped that the authorities will think more about farmers in the future and not just take land tax from farmers while being indifferent to the living conditions of farmers. At the same time, the lower-level institutions of the current local politics, as well as the Baojia administrative officials who come into contact with farmers, should be eliminated and thoroughly reformed, so as not to betray the farmers' earnest expectations.

Three, Land Rent Issues

According to the authorities' report, landlords in the Suzhou area own 70% of the total land, while self-cultivating farmers only account for 30%. From this, it can be seen that land rent is no less important than buying rice in terms of people's livelihood.

In Changshu, the rent agreed upon by farmers and landlords is usually between eight dou and one shi per mu. This year, due to the slightly poorer harvest, it is determined by converting it to the black market price of rice. At that time, the conversion was about 3,000 to 4,000 yuan per mu. As for the original land and original landlord payment, it is now paid by the farmer on behalf due to the in-kind collection. For example, if the rent agreed upon by the farmer and the landlord is 4,000 yuan per mu, and the farmer pays one dou of land tax per year, calculated at the black market price, if the black market price of rice is 10,000 yuan per shi, and one dou is 1,000 yuan, then the farmer pays the landlord 3,000 yuan in rent with the temporary receipt for land tax.

On the landlord's side, when public security was not yet established in the past, there was no land rent to collect at all. This time, they have considerable land rent income, and they are very satisfied.

The landowners in Changshu have organized the Landowners' Association, which is on the same front as the purchasing merchants, assisting in the work of purchasing rice. In principle, this is very good, but secretly there may inevitably be a danger of exploiting farmers.

In the past, the burdens borne by farmers were simply land tax and land rent. At present, they are also directly shouldering the heavy responsibility of military and civilian needs under the wartime system. Therefore, the rights of the landowners, who depend on the land as parasites, should be strictly limited. If necessary, the amount of land rent should be stipulated, or the land rent burden borne by farmers should be waived due to poor harvests.

Four, This Year's Rice Harvest

According to the Jiangsu Office's investigation and publication, this year's rice harvest: "The summer harvest in the Suzhou area this year is estimated to be very abundant, but since May, there has been continuous rain, and in autumn, there has been damage from rice stem borers, resulting in a slight loss in the harvest, but overall, it is still better than last year."

In terms of Suzhou, Kunshan, and Yushan, Suzhou is still good, Changshu is inevitably affected by rice stem borers, causing a slight impact, the harvest in the first and second districts of Kunshan is poor, while the third, eighth, tenth, and eleventh districts are better. The harvest of early and late rice in the Jiangsu area is still good, while the middle rice inevitably suffers considerable damage.

As for the harm of rice stem borers, it is entirely due to the fact that last winter was not cold enough, and farmers did not turn over the soil, so the larvae were not exterminated, and in the autumn, they bred into adults, lurking in the base of the rice plants, absorbing nutrients, making it difficult for the rice to bear fruit.

Because this year's rice harvest is not consistent in various places, there are three points worth noting:

First, the current purchase of rice is calculated per mu, with a fixed amount, but there are also several places with poor harvests. The purchase quantity in areas with poor harvests should be considered and discounted, otherwise, this one-size-fits-all apportionment system is not very suitable in practice.

Second, this year is the year of increased production led by the late Chairman Wang, but the only ones who can truly practice this increased production movement are the cooperatives. Other institutions are not doing so, and even remain silent and indifferent to rural production, which is very regrettable. There are several places with poor harvests this year. Natural disasters and insect pests are certainly unavoidable, but in some places, the poor local political situation affects production, which should be a cause for alarm for the authorities.

Third, Kunshan has been designated as one of the rural construction experimental zones by the Rural Construction Implementation Committee since September 1 this year. It happened that rice stem borers were flying in the sky. While the officials in the court were talking about building the countryside and singing the slogan of construction, during the period of planning increased production on paper, the farmers were fighting with the rice stem borers in the fields. Only the cooperative personnel provided leadership, but it failed to prevent it universally, and the effect was reduced, causing Kunshan to suffer more severely. How can the officials in the court treat the farmers who returned defeated after a bitter battle, and be able to ask themselves without shame?

### Various Groups Held a Citizens' Celebration Meeting Yesterday to Celebrate the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War

The City News Federation, the City Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, and the China Film Company, six major civil groups, held a citizens' celebration meeting at the Grand Theater at 5:30 pm yesterday (8th) to celebrate the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. The Propaganda Department of this city and the three authorities of the Allied Powers in Shanghai, the Army, Navy, and Air Force, provided support. Chen Binsu, a member of the Municipal Government Advisory Committee, and Japanese political commentator Yosida Toyu were invited to give speeches. The attendees included Uchibuchi, the director of the Public Relations Department of the Japanese Army, Matsudaira, the director of the Information Department of the Embassy, Lieutenant Commander Shioda of the Fleet Public Relations Department, and the presidium: Tatsichiro Funatsu, Nagamasa Kawakita, Yoichi Osaka, Takashi Moriyama, Lantong Wen, Lvdeng Yuan, Kanghou Lin, Jiebai Jin, Jie Feng, Liqiu Xu, Riping Chen, Jingsu Huang, Feng Lu, Secretary-General Yunpeng Ren, and no less than several thousand people from all walks of life in this city. The ceremony began on time. The entire audience paid the highest respect to the flags of China and Japan. Then, Takashi Moriyama of the Continental News, the monthly director of the association, gave a closing speech. Following this, Yosida Toyu and Chen Binhe gave speeches one after another (Chen's speech is on the first page). Finally, "Spring River Regret" was screened, and the meeting adjourned at about 8 o'clock.

Yosida Toyu's Speech at the Citizens' Celebration Meeting

The full text of Yosida Toyu's speech at the Citizens' Celebration Meeting Commemorating the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War is as follows:

Why Celebrate?

Today is the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, and I am honored to participate in the Shanghai citizens' celebration meeting held here. However, I would like to venture to ask everyone, why are we celebrating the Greater East Asia War today? On such an occasion, I raise such a seemingly inappropriate question, and of course I know that it is very impolite, but I have my reasons. Because I guess that among those present, there must be people who think, do we Chinese want to celebrate the Greater East Asia War? What have we gained in the three years of the Greater East Asia War? Before the start of the Greater East Asia War, the price of rice in Shanghai was only about 1,000 yuan, but today, the price of rice has risen to 30,000 yuan. Three years ago, there were corrupt officials, but they were not as rampant as they are today. Now, let alone large-scale corrupt officials, we can see small-scale corrupt officials everywhere on the streets of Shanghai. Three years ago, there was a "black market" for prices, but it was not as common as it is now. Now there are black market tickets for watching movies, black market tickets for taking the train, and black market tickets for taking the plane. Of course, there is black market rice. To be honest, now you can't buy anything at all without paying the black market price. The "black market" is now the only market where we can buy things. Such phenomena are all the result of the Greater East Asia War. In fact, the Shanghai Special Municipality itself has become a "big black market."

A certain German war theorist said, "War is the continuation of politics." If this sentence is correct, and if the current politics are to be extended when the Greater East Asia War is won, then we will be in even more trouble! Should we still celebrate the Greater East Asia War? This kind of thinking is quite reasonable and very justified. But I say that we still have to celebrate the Greater East Asia War, how can this be? On what grounds? Please allow me to explain.

Japanese Awareness

Some people say that war is inherently a special kind of digestion, and economic problems in society during wartime are unavoidable. So don't talk about simple economic difficulties, I also admit this statement, but the economic chaos caused by political incompetence is a big problem. During wartime, the people should suffer hardship, whether they suffer hardship or not is not a problem. When the majority of the people are on the verge of starvation, a small number of people are living an extremely lavish life, not doing any work, going in and out in cars, and eating fancy food every day. This kind of phenomenon is not right. If there is a very serious contradiction in the country, the people cannot fight as one, and as a result, that country will certainly not be able to win the war. So since the start of the Greater East Asia War, has there been such a phenomenon in China and Japan? Yes, there definitely is. A group of Chinese scoundrels colluded with rogue elements in Japan. Under very close Sino-Japanese collaboration, quite a few people have made a fortune from the national crisis. I don't need to talk much about this, because everyone knows it. But for those of you here, there is something you may not know or rarely know, and that is another aspect of the development of the Greater East Asia War, another new development. What is it? Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, many Japanese have realized that "if we want to defeat the British and Americans, we must eliminate this phenomenon." If we let this phenomenon slide, there is absolutely no talk of victory in the Greater East Asia War. We can't win the Greater East Asia War, which is by no means an easy war, if we don't want to imitate political reform. Japanese conscious elements and Chinese conscious elements must unite to solve the contradictory phenomena in society, and defeat the bad Sino-Japanese cooperation, then there is a way to win the Greater East Asia War.

Sincere Sino-Japanese Cooperation

Perhaps the number of Japanese who think this way is increasing day by day. Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese way of thinking has indeed changed in this way. Therefore, the fundamental Japanese way of thinking about China is completely different from before. In the past, most Japanese people almost couldn't see the Chinese, but now many Japanese have realized that without the sincere cooperation of the Chinese people, the Greater East Asia War will never have a good result. If we want to get the sincere cooperation of the Chinese people, the Japanese should truly respect China's independence and freedom. This kind of awareness on the Japanese side will certainly have a reaction in the minds of the Chinese. In the past, Chinese people who had no interest in the issue of Sino-Japanese cooperation are now showing considerable enthusiasm for Sino-Japanese cooperation and for overall peace. They think that if there are indeed more and more Japanese people who think this way since the start of the Greater East Asia War, then Sino-Japanese cooperation is hopeful, and we Chinese should change our view of the Japanese. Recently, I have seen a new development in the minds of both Chinese and Japanese people, and this new development is very valuable, because I believe that this new spiritual development is the basis for sincere Sino-Japanese cooperation in the future. I believe that in the course of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese awareness of this will become more and more profound. Then the Chinese understanding of the Japanese will become more progressive and more changed, and the views of the two countries will gradually converge. If this continues, on the last day of this war, I believe that sincere Sino-Japanese cooperation can be achieved. If sincere Sino-Japanese cooperation is successful, then defeating British and American imperialism is no problem at all. If British and American imperialism are defeated, then the liberation of all the peoples of Greater East Asia is no problem at all, and China's independence and freedom are also no problem at all. Therefore, the day the Greater East Asia War began was the day that such a major change in world history began. Therefore, no matter how great our current difficulties are, I cannot but advocate that we should still celebrate.

### The Youth League Held a General Uprising Meeting Yesterday and Held a Dawn General Mobilization

The Shanghai China Youth League launched a city-wide Youth League Dawn General Mobilization yesterday morning at 7:00 AM to implement the China Youth League and the Asia General Uprising Movement. A total of 60 units participated in this campaign. At 9:00 AM, a grand Youth League General Uprising Movement Conference was held in the Grand Theater. The atmosphere was exciting and the mood was enthusiastic. The details are recorded as follows:

The presidium of the conference included Liu Yangshan, Deputy Director of the Youth League, Xi Peiwen, Deputy Commander, Liang Xiuyu, Director of the Propaganda Department, Su Chengde, Deputy Director of the Police Bureau, Sun Lifu of the Air Defense Headquarters, Liu Sufeng of the Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Youth Center, Ren Yunpeng of the News Federation, and more than a dozen other people. The conference began at 9:00 AM. Everyone stood in silence to play the music, sang the league song, paid the highest respect to the national flag and the portrait of the Founding Father, respectfully read the will, and observed a moment of silence. Then, Deputy Director Liu gave a speech, followed by Xi Peiwen reading the declaration of the General Uprising Movement Conference, and sending a telegram of tribute to Chairman Chen, the highest authority, and a telegram to the National Youth League. Finally, everyone sang the Youth League song together and shouted "Long live the nation" under the leadership of Deputy Director Liu. It did not end until 10:00 AM. Then, everyone lined up and gathered to hold a city-wide Youth League parade.

### Indian Leader Bose Leaves Shanghai After Completing His Visit

Chairman Jiang Tela Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India came to Shanghai at the beginning of the month to inspect the Indian community in Shanghai and review the Indian National Army. He has been warmly welcomed by all parties, and the Chinese and Japanese authorities have warmly received him. It is now known that Chairman Bose has left Shanghai a few days ago after completing his official visit.

### Police Bureau Forbids Street Children

The Shanghai Police Bureau believes that children in the urban area driving three-wheeled roller skates and playing in the streets not only hinder traffic but also endanger the lives of children. Therefore, it has issued orders to its subordinate sub-bureaus to strictly prohibit this.

### Zhabei District Branch of the Baojia Committee Holds its First Committee Meeting

The Zhabei District Branch of the Municipal Baojia Committee held its first committee meeting on November 28. Because Zhabei is a newly merged area, Director Gu of the Baojia Office is very concerned about the progress of the Baojia work in the district and rushed to participate at the time, giving a speech on the spot. This was followed by a speech by Chairman Wang Binyan of the committee, and then the agenda items were discussed. The main items were the request to open the Xinzha Bridge, the plan to revitalize Zhabei, and the collection of police defense fees.

### Cotton Increase Association Holds Board Meeting

The 10th Committee Meeting of the Cotton Increase Council and the 8th Board Meeting of the Cotton Development Council in the Jiangbei Salt Reclamation Area were held simultaneously at the Cotton Industry Building yesterday (8th) afternoon at 3:00 PM. Deputy Chairman Wen of the association presided over the meeting, reporting on past work and the progress of cotton development in the Jiangbei Salt Reclamation Area, and there were important discussions.

### Various Industries Suggest Building a Bronze Statue of the Late Chairman Wang

More than 200 units of industry associations in this city believe that the late Chairman Wang devoted himself to the party. After discussion by the secretariat of the industry association懇談conference, it was decided to suggest that the authorities choose a suitable location in this city to build a bronze statue of the late Chairman Wang. It is also heard that a detailed outline of concrete measures will be proposed for discussion at the dinner party of the industry associations on the 15th of this month. It is generally expected that the funds will be raised by the industry associations in this city, and donations from all walks of life will be solicited.

### Air Defense Day Today: Training Held as Usual, Thorough Implementation of Sheltering Training

Today (9th) is the 12th Air Defense Day. The citizens' Air Defense Headquarters will implement various air defense training. The time for the alarm training has been published in detail in various newspapers and announcements of the headquarters on the 4th. Citizens should refer to it and pay close attention. During the first air raid alarm training from 9:00 AM to 9:15 AM, sheltering training will be thoroughly implemented. There will be a simulated enemy aircraft taking off and engaging in air combat in the air. Citizens should quickly go to shelters or appropriate places to take refuge. Police and Baojia air defense personnel should guide citizens to take refuge. Whether on streets or in alleys, there should be no people. Observation posts should also implement reporting work. At the same time, comprehensive air defense training for various key items will be implemented separately in each district. The entire urban area should participate, assisting Baojia air defense personnel in implementing fire extinguishing, rescue, firefighting, sheltering, and other air defense work.

Dao Yi Bao Charity Exhibition Helps Students

The owner of Xu's Dao Yi Studio has been fond of collecting classics and newspapers since childhood. After adulthood, he became even more fond of famous calligraphy, inscriptions, and cultural relics. He aspired to be ancient and did not indulge in vulgarity. In his collections, he only sought the old without flaws, and only liked the charm without disliking the cold. He is different from other enthusiasts. Over the years, twenty years have passed. During this period, he has experienced many times of chaos, and in recent years, he has experienced world changes. The studio owner has been frugal and frugal, not commenting, but he is deeply concerned about the suffering and has the heart to help disaster relief, but he lacks the power to contribute. Therefore, he has decided to take out a part of his cherished collections, leaving some for his own enjoyment, and publicly auctioning the rest. After deducting the necessary expenses, he will donate the money to the scholarship funds of Shen Xin Liang Bao (two newspapers) and various public welfare charities they run. He also hopes that the great collectors will promote kindness, and be inspired by the news.

### The Greater East Asia General Mobilization Rally Solemnly Held Yesterday; Representatives From Various Countries Attended and Delivered Speeches

The Shanghai New Citizen Movement Branch, the East Asia League Branch, the Anti-British and Anti-American Association of the Chinese Nation, the Chinese Anti-Communist League, the Asia Newspaper Congress, the Chinese Hongmen General Association, the Chinese Construction Youth Team, the Anqing Association, the Vocational Youth Welfare Association, the Production Savings Group, the Indian Independence League Branch, the Philippine Association, and other Greater East Asian organizations in Shanghai, held the "Greater East Asia Ethnic United Front General Mobilization Rally" at the Grand Guangming Theater yesterday (the 8th) at 1:00 PM. More than two thousand people attended. The rally began with an opening address by Chairman Li Fang, followed by Zhu reading the rally declaration. Subsequently, representatives from China, Liu Yangshan; Japan, Takenouchi Fumio; Manchukuo, Liu Gui; India, Nanak Jiangte; and the Philippines, Casiano, delivered speeches. The rally concluded with the reading of a tribute telegram and the presentation of letters of gratitude, which were received by Lieutenant Colonel Izubuchi, representing General Yasuji Okamura, and Colonel Matsushima, representing General Nobutake Kondō. Afterwards, the Allied Fleet Music Corps performed famous pieces, and finally, a performance of Chinese opera was held, ending at 5:00 PM.

Speech by the Chinese Representative

"Today is December 8th. On this day three years ago, Japan resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States, launching the Greater East Asia War. The liberation movement of the Greater East Asian nations entered a new era. From then on, the nations of Greater East Asia rose up one by one to eliminate the oppression of Britain and the United States. Today, every nation in Greater East Asia has taken on the mission of war to achieve final victory. In the recent great naval and air battles in Taiwan and the Philippines, and the landing operation on Leyte Island, the enemy Americans sacrificed countless naval and air force soldiers and generals. The only price they obtained was Roosevelt's fourth election. However, the Philippines has a large area and is heavily defended. The enemy Americans are taking a risk in making this attempt, which creates an opportunity for their own destruction. Although the enemy is stubborn, they will hardly escape this predetermined doom. Today, we are holding this Greater East Asia Ethnic United Front General Mobilization Movement to seek victory in the Greater East Asia War. All ethnic groups, individuals, and organizations in Greater East Asia should use their utmost strength to promote it. The survival of the East Asian nations depends on this battle today. We cannot allow ourselves to steal life or fear death. We hope that our East Asian compatriots will work together and move forward."

Speech by the Japanese Representative

"Three years have passed since the holy war to liberate East Asia began. This Greater East Asia War, along with the European War, has spread to the entire world. It is a holy war to eliminate the common enemies of the world, Britain and the United States, and to liberate East Asia from their clutches. The profound will of heaven and the inevitability of history are helping us to defeat Britain and the United States and liberate East Asia. Looking back at the changes in the situation in the three years since the Greater East Asia War began, we have a sense of immense change. Not only have we recovered the territories and colonies of Britain and the United States, but independent countries that have been waiting for three hundred years have continued to be established in these regions. At the time when the Greater East Asia War broke out, there were only the independent countries of China, Japan, Manchukuo, and Thailand. But today, three years later, we have the Philippines and Burma, as well as the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India, and the Dutch East Indies will soon be independent. Who could have foreseen these great achievements three years ago today? The outbreak of the Greater East Asia War was a passive move for Japan from beginning to end. It was a last resort, a desperate struggle for the rise and fall of the nation. Therefore, the past three years of war can be described as a considerable and tortuous hard fight. Now is the time to join forces with the Western European War to destroy Britain and the United States. In the Pacific, the Japanese army has repeatedly achieved great feats, and morale is increasing. Production is also gradually increasing. We can say that both the material and spiritual aspects are completely in a state of decisive battle. This point has been sufficiently proven by the recent naval and air battle in Taiwan and the great results on Leyte Island. At the same time, the war situation in Europe is also turning in favor of Germany. In other words, the victory of East Asia is just around the corner. The system for East Asian victory has been successfully established. For the sake of victory and the construction of a moral world, let us all rise up together! Now is the time for the one hundred million people of East Asia to rise up. Let us rise up!"

Speech by the Manchukuo Representative

"The Greater East Asia War is not just a war between our ally Japan and Britain and the United States. It is a war in which all the nations of Greater East Asia rise up together to annihilate our long-time enemies, the United States and Britain. The army, navy, and air force of our new ally Japan are fighting day and night on the front lines. Recently, the white-blade battle of the Sea Tiger Special Attack Force in Leyte Gulf was brave and divine, leading by example, which is truly touching to the East Asian nations behind the guns. The foundation for the final victory has been laid. The East Asian peoples should unite more closely, unite together, consolidate the total strength behind the guns, supply the government and people to cooperate with a strong belief in victory, and ensure war resources. The day when comprehensive peace in East Asia and the co-existence and co-prosperity and peaceful life in Greater East Asia can be realized is in the near future."

The celebratory football match commemorating the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, sponsored by the Shanghai News Zheng Quanhui, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens Welfare Association, the Industry and Commerce Friendship Association, and the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, and supported by the Shanghai Football Association, was held yesterday at 3:00 PM at the Yiyi Stadium on Xianyang Road. Jilin played against the Three Provinces Jifeng team. As tickets were not sold, the audience was quite crowded. In order to strengthen their strength, the Jilin team temporarily invited Japanese players who had recently come to Shanghai from North China to help. Yesterday's performance was more delicate and exciting than before. Although the Three Provinces team was brave, they could not avoid defeat. The match was kicked off by Chen Riping, a member of the Municipal Advisory Committee. The Three Provinces team launched the first attack, with Xiao Ziwen dribbling the ball and attacking vigorously. Jilin's Songgang waited patiently and cleared the ball with one kick. Afterwards, the offensive was controlled by Jilin. After about 30 minutes, Ye Jingqi of the Three Provinces team was replaced by Zhang Fenggang. Jilin became even more rampant. Songgang Wuichi made a successful attack on the sideline, and Jinjing scored in the middle, giving Jilin a one-goal lead in the first half. After the change of sides, the Three Provinces team tried to counterattack and made some progress. Jin Lusheng made several wonderful constructions, but they were all blocked. Before long, the Three Provinces team came back again, with Meng Yiliang passing to the front. Jin Shengsheng passed to Gu Dirong, and Jilin was unable to defend. Gu made a clever sweep, and Jilin's center forward Fukui passed to Yamamoto. The Three Provinces team rushed to save the situation, but Jilin's Tokuyama slipped through an opening. Huang Renjie was caught off guard, and the ball went into the net. Shortly after, time ran out, and the Three Provinces team lost to Jilin by one to two.

### A Record of the Second Year of the Greater East Asia War

— Wanzi (Continued from yesterday)

Six Major Battles on Bougainville Island

Bougainville Island is the largest island in the Solomon Islands and serves as a barrier to Japan's southern naval base in Rabaul. The six naval and air battles that took place in the area from late October to early December were truly the fiercest battles of the year. The Americans were well-prepared for this battle, having transferred their Mediterranean fleet to the area, creating a massive force. On October 20th, the Americans first launched an air raid, followed by a landing on Mono Island, posing a significant threat to the fortress at the southern end of Bougainville Island. From the end of October, the Japanese side made every effort to respond with strong bombing.

Battles in the Bismarck Archipelago

The Bismarck Archipelago is located northwest of the Solomon Islands and contains two large islands: New Britain and New Ireland. The Americans initially launched continuous air raids on Rabaul, in the northwest corner of New Britain, after October. On December 15th, they landed at Cape Gloucester, and on the 25th, they attacked New Ireland.

Battles in New Guinea

On June 30th, American troops landed at Nassau Bay. The Japanese fought back with a small force, and the Americans suffered more than 5,600 casualties. On September 4th, American troops again attacked with the cooperation of the Australian army at Hollandia, employing mobile tactics and inflicting heavy damage. The two sides also engaged in fierce air battles over New Guinea.

(II) The Central Pacific Front

Naval and Air Warfare in the Gilbert Islands

In late November, American troops launched a large-scale offensive against the Gilbert Islands, resulting in four consecutive naval and air battles. The American force was centered around an aircraft carrier group. The American side suffered heavy casualties, with more than 3,700 killed and wounded, and seven aircraft carriers, one destroyer, and two cruisers sunk. The Japanese garrison and military personnel on Makin and Tarawa islands in the Gilbert Islands, totaling 4,500, all died in action.

Air Battles Over the Marshall Islands

On December 5th, aircraft from an American mobile force attacked Japanese positions in the Marshall Islands, and twenty aircraft were shot down. That evening, the Japanese surrounded and annihilated the mobile force. On the 21st, American aircraft attacked again and retreated after suffering losses.

(III) The North Pacific Front

The United States attached great importance to the invasion route in the North Pacific. In 1942, they completed the Alaska Highway and the Trans-Canada Highway, and increased the strength of various bases in the North Pacific, such as Dutch Harbor and Sitka, in an attempt to advance on the Japanese mainland from there. The Japanese military was unwilling to lag behind, so they occupied Kiska and Attu Island in mid-June of that year in order to contain the United States.

In 1943, the United States actively increased its troops in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands and repeatedly launched naval and air attacks to cut off the Japanese supply line. The Japanese forces held their positions on Kiska and Attu islands.

On May 12th, the United States landed on Attu Island. After inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese garrison, the isolated troops fought bitterly for thirty days. The Yamazaki unit then all died in action.

The United States then exerted great effort to bomb Kiska Island in mid-June. In early July, the Japanese military completed the construction projects in the northern region, such as the Kuril Islands, and safely withdrew from the island. In mid-August, the United States launched an air raid on the northernmost part of the Kuril Islands, with little success. On October 14th, the Japanese launched a surprise attack on Attu Island, destroying its military facilities.

(IV) The Burma Front

Burma is the barrier to Southwest China and the buffer zone to India. It is essential to the British and Americans, otherwise, losing Burma would open up India, and the aid to Chongqing would be insufficient. In 1942, the Japanese gave the British-Indian army a great counter-attack, and then advanced to the Salween River, establishing strong positions. Then on August 1st, the liberation of Burma was carried out, making it an independent country.

On May 13th, the Japanese army repelled 20,000 British troops at the border between India and Burma and secured their positions. They also crossed steep mountains and occupied Tengyue and Lameng on the border of Yunnan, China. The British army had no choice but to focus on defending India, while the Chongqing army arduously engaged in the struggle for the Yunnan-Burma Road.

In late December, the British-Indian army repeatedly attacked Akyab with superior forces, but the Japanese army defeated them. The Japanese army also circled around the Arakan Mountains for a surprise attack. The British-Indian army retreated, exhausted, and suffered heavy losses. The Japanese army air force also launched fierce bombing raids on eastern India in response. In the Battle of Arakan, the British-Indian army suffered 4,200 casualties.

After the Japanese army defeated the main force of the British-Indian army on the India-Burma border, they occupied Buthidaung and Maungdaw.

After the Quebec Conference in August, there was a strong call to "recover Burma." In order to strike first, the Japanese army entered the Ledge Water Gorge on October 15th and completed a large encirclement battle against the Salween (Nu) River bridgehead on the 17th. Chongqing sent 350,000 expeditionary troops to Yunnan and airlifted 50,000 elite troops to eastern India to strengthen the British-American defense line. The Japanese army started from Myitkyina, used mobile warfare to attack the front and flanks of the British-Chongqing army, forming a large encirclement.

By the end of 1943, the British-Indian army had also taken some action in the Buthidaung area, but they were all defeated.

(V) The China Front

After suffering defeats in the Greater East Asia War, Britain and the United States were eager to use the Chinese mainland to contain the Japanese army and serve as a base for a general counter-offensive. The following are some of the important battles on the Chinese mainland:

1. On the morning of February 16th, the Japanese army landed on the Leizhou Peninsula, Leizhou.

2. In late February, the Japanese army fought on Hainan Island.

3. In February and March, battles were fought north of Dongting Lake in Hubei and in the Su-Huai region of Jiangsu.

4. From April onwards, battles were fought in the three provinces of Rehe, Chahar, and Hebei. Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying, commanders of the 24th Group Army of Chongqing, participated in the movement.

5. From March to late May, battles were fought to develop the Yichang Yangtze River route.

6. After early May, battles were fought in the western area of Dongting Lake.

7. From early July, battles were fought in the Taihang Mountains of Shanxi Province: after September, communist suppression operations were carried out throughout North China.

8. From October to December, battles were fought to occupy Changde. (The End)

### Written for the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War

— Wang Shengjian

The history of the Yan and Huang peoples has seen many dangers. The nation is in trouble. The enemy's anger is shared by all people. The two words "peace" are known to all. Every commoner has a responsibility. All members of the same race must not doubt. Strengthen our borders with firm walls. Success is assured in no time.

### Commemorating the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War

— Zheng Lansun

The righteous army deserves its name. The yellow race within the world forms a strong city. Early on, the retreat of three houses was taught. The accomplishment of great feats will be seen in the Eight Bǎs. The Milky Way will not tolerate the sound of cranes chirping. Let the sea try to expose running whales. The divine wind sweeps away leaves. It is easy to capture the Silver River before arming.

### Commemorating the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War with a Song of Congratulations

— Dongguang Jia

The Han Dynasty became strong after defeating the Xiongnu. The Jin Dynasty perished after accepting the Five Barbarians. If Zhuge Liang had not pacified the southern barbarians, how could the five armies have emerged from Qishan? Since ancient times, internal stability has come before external resistance. Foreign races will ultimately harm the nation. The late Qing emperors were ignorant of the situation. The blue-eyed and yellow-bearded barbarians acted as they pleased. They have been tyrannical for over a hundred years. They were the culprits in the past and are the leaders of the invaders today. Warships open fire on the Pacific Ocean. Surging waves of terror approach. Relying on their power, they hoped to win. How could they know that warmongering would lead to disaster? Our East Asian allied nations stand for justice. Vowing to live and die with our race. Alliance with India to resist England, alliance with the Philippines to resist America. Three years of bloody fighting have destroyed the enemy's fortresses. Supporting the culture of five thousand years. Sweeping away the stench for forty thousand miles. Preserving East Asia relies on this. Alas. Completing the war is not accidental. It depends on the firm belief of our race. As long as the organization is sound. Grand victory is within sight. A billion people are mobilized. Vowing to face the stubborn enemy. Left hand holding a whip, right hand discarding a key. Breaking through the rain of bullets and smoke. The precious sword shines with fresh blood. Stabilizing the interior and resisting the exterior, following the example of our predecessors. East Asia will see the light again. May the flowers of freedom be good for ten thousand years.

### Commemorating the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War

— Dong Weijian

The power of European winds and American rains is overwhelming. Trampling on China for over a hundred years. How much hatred for ceding land and paying indemnities. The blood debt is still fresh today.

It is not just China that has been robbed. The weak in Asia have been abused. The people of India, Burma, and Siam are all remnants after the scourge.

The combined strength of a billion hearts is not to be deceived. Our allied nations stand for justice and take the lead. We must firmly believe in the idea of living and dying together. This is the time to avenge our shame and seek survival.

Three sweeps are nearing completion. The annihilation of the enemy is now within your grasp. The army, navy, and air force all report victory. Asia will be returned to its masters.

### Encouraging the Generals and Soldiers on the Front Lines and Pre-Wishing Victory on the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War

— Jiang Zhibin

The blade has not been idle for many years. Hundreds of tigers crossed the ocean, their fur stained with blood. The head does not betray the ambition of a man. The heart always holds heaven and earth. The strength of the masses can solidify new walls. Who does not love a good country? Surely, the day when divine martial arts will achieve success will come. Everywhere, a victory song will be played.

### The Third Year of the Greater East Asia War

— Zheng Chuan Nian

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, a full three years have passed. Japan's past war records include the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, the naval battle of Malaya, the capture of Hong Kong, the naval battle of the Philippines, the naval battle of Borneo, the capture of Singapore, the India-Burma campaign, the three naval battles of the Solomon Islands, the Battle of the Coral Sea, the raid on Midway Island, the six air and sea battles of Bougainville, and the four air and sea battles of the Gilbert Islands... Each campaign has been crowned with glorious victories, establishing an invincible position and dealing heavy blows to Britain and the United States. In the past, Britain and the United States also adopted a strategy of avoiding the strong and attacking the weak, advancing steadily. However, now, due to their shortcomings in military, political, and other aspects, they have revealed the most anxious state. The United States' strategic emphasis on "East Asia surpassing Europe" has risen sharply, and they are hastily preparing for a total counter-offensive in the Pacific. They often proclaim that "there is more than one road to Tokyo," but Japan is well-prepared and ready to strike back in all areas.

Their roads to total counter-offensive: the first is the northern route from the Aleutian Islands. Due to terrain and climate, this route is impassable. The second is the route of the Soviet Union attacking Japan. Japan and the Soviet Union have maintained friendly relations all along, and the diplomatic situation remains unchanged, so this is merely wishful thinking. The third is the counter-offensive route to Sumatra, Malaya, and all the way to Vietnam, which is long and circuitous, and thus very unfavorable. The fourth is launching from India and Burma, which is tantamount to an isolated army breaking through encirclement, contrary to their wishes. The fifth is the counter-offensive line towards Java and Borneo. The sixth is the route from Australia, New Guinea, and on to the Philippines and Taiwan, directly landing on the southern mainland of China. Another is the seventh offensive line from the Marshall Islands, echoing the Mariana Islands and the Philippines and Taiwan. The latter two are the most suitable. Under the leadership of MacArthur and Nimitz, fierce battles involving the main fleet are underway, while also bombing the Japanese mainland to enhance the effect.

In the past year, the United States has been driving forward recklessly. In mid-June, they crudely used their mobile units to land and fight on Saipan, Guam, Tinian, and Palau Islands. Although they were fortunate enough to succeed, they suffered heavy casualties, incurring a loss outweighs the gain. In these campaigns, the United States suffered a total loss of more than 60,000 personnel. The Japanese army fought bravely, inflicting heavy attacks. The Saipan operation lasted for forty days, while Guam and Tinian were extended to seventy days, eventually resulting in the complete sacrifice of all personnel, giving the Greater East Asian countries great inspiration and admiration. For strategic reasons, the Japanese main force maintained a very prudent attitude, waiting for an opportunity to act and not acting rashly. However, the United States underestimated Japan's military strength, and became increasingly aggressive, acting foolishly in the western Pacific. After the beginning of October, the United States even assembled all its forces in the Pacific, including Halsey's Third Fleet, Spruance's Fifth Fleet, Kinkaid's Seventh Fleet, and other MacArthur units, all coveting Taiwan and the Philippines. Japan suddenly launched two powerful annihilation battles in the waters off Taiwan and the eastern Philippines, almost completely destroying the main force of the American fleet. Although the Americans have landed more than ten divisions on Leyte Island in the Philippines, the American defense lines have been cut off due to the brave fighting of the Japanese army, and the situation is becoming increasingly hopeless.

The following is a summary of the major battles of the Greater East Asia War in 1944:

Pacific Theater

In the second half of 1943, after the United States established its system, it actively prepared for a counter-offensive, starting from Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. Afterwards, it advanced towards the Gilbert Islands, and devoted itself to the fierce battles in the Marshall Islands. The situation of a decisive battle in the Pacific became increasingly clear.

Japanese Soldiers on Kwajalein and Roi Islands Sacrificed Their Lives

In January, starting in the morning, powerful American mobile units continuously attacked Kwajalein, Roi-Namur, and the entire Marshall Islands. On February 1, they landed on Kwajalein and Roi. The Japanese naval and land forces jointly defended, inflicting great damage on the enemy. With a small force, they faithfully performed their duties. On February 6, a total of 6,500 army and navy troops and military personnel on the two islands heroically sacrificed their lives. The fiery speech of Japanese Navy Minister Shimada resonated deeply.

Bougainville Campaign

The Japanese army on Bougainville Island launched attacks on the enemy forces holding the defensive line near Torokina from the beginning of March. The enemy abandoned 4,000 bodies, and 37 cannons and other military supplies were captured. The Japanese army suffered about 30 casualties. The garrison forces defended the island tenaciously, and the fighting gradually intensified since the end of July. On August 10, the Japanese army ambushed the landing enemy in the Kapo River area.

Air and Sea Battle of the Mariana Islands

In mid-June, most of the enemy American Pacific Fleet appeared near the Mariana Islands. The Japanese air force attacked them, and by the 20th, they had sunk one enemy battleship and one destroyer, two cruisers; destroyed more than four aircraft carriers, two battleships, four cruisers, and shot down more than 300 aircraft. To support the fierce fighting of the Saipan garrison, they continued to fight bravely. By the 30th, the results were significant. In addition to sinking one enemy battleship, two cruisers and destroyers, and destroying two aircraft carriers and destroyers, they also shot down 211 enemy aircraft. A part of the Japanese Combined Fleet, in order to preemptively strike, surrounded the enemy mobile unit on the other side of the Mariana Islands on the 19th. By the evening of the 20th, they had sunk five aircraft carriers (including the new Bunker Hill), one battleship, and shot down more than 100 enemy aircraft.

Battle of Saipan

In early June, the American mobile force appeared east of the Mariana Islands. 190 carrier-based aircraft bombed Saipan. On the 12th, the island was attacked again. On the 14th, the Americans, with more than ten aircraft carriers, eight battleships, and more than seventy transport ships, loaded with soldiers, carried out a landing. The Japanese garrison fought fiercely to repel the invaders. On the afternoon of the 15th, a part of the American army occupied the area near Aslito airfield, gradually expanding the area. The Japanese army engaged in close combat, destroying more than ten tanks. On the 17th, the Japanese army retreated again due to intense artillery fire. On the 23rd, the island's water source was completely destroyed. On the 25th, the Japanese army charged into the enemy lines with artillery shells, stunning the Americans. The next night, the island's highest point, Mount Tapochau, was captured, and the situation became unfavorable for the Japanese army. On the 28th, the Japanese artillery fire was completely destroyed. On the morning of July 7, the Japanese army, with naval, land, and air forces united as one, launched a final, fierce attack, and finally the entire army was killed in battle. The enemy American forces considered this battle the most difficult in the Pacific campaign. The American army suffered more than 15,000 casualties. However, after that, there were still surviving Japanese soldiers on the island who carried out guerrilla warfare in difficult circumstances and died heroically. Afterwards, the Japanese army continuously bombed the enemy airfield on the island.

Fierce Battles on Guam and Tinian Islands

In mid-June, naval, land, and air battles between the two sides around Saipan, such as Guam, Tinian, and Rota, also gradually intensified. Due to the small number of Japanese troops, they were finally forced to allow the enemy to land. In mid-July, the enemy forces on Guam suffered heavy damage in the central area of Akashi Street and Showa Street after landing. In the northern district of Tinian, since the enemy landed, the Japanese army fought bravely to prevent the powerful enemy forces from advancing southward, inflicting heavy losses on them. By mid-July, the enemy had suffered 4,900 casualties. By the end of July, the enemy forces broke into the last defensive line of the Japanese army in the southern part of the island, and the battle lines became intricate. From July 21 to September 27, for a total of seventy days, the Japanese army fought alone, endured hardships, and faced extreme adversity. In the end, all the garrison forces heroically died in battle.

Battle of the Palau Islands

Enemy fleets and aircraft groups had repeatedly raided the Caroline Islands. In mid-July, 750 aircraft arrived, and a total of 110 were shot down or destroyed. In early September, more than 100 enemy land-based aircraft raided Palau and Yap Islands. On September 15, the enemy MacArthur landed on Peleliu Island in the Palau Islands. The Japanese army successively launched fierce attacks on the enemy, and the artillery battles between the two sides were extremely fierce. On the morning of the 17th, under the cover of artillery fire from the enemy mobile force, they began to land again. The Japanese garrison on Palau fought bravely, annihilating many enemies, and firmly defended the central highlands and the northern cape. The enemy suffered about 50,000 casualties, and more than 60 ships were sunk. On the 18th, the Japanese army launched a clever night attack, sinking more than 50 ships and 15 tanks. Afterwards, the enemy suffered additional casualties of more than 20,000. The Japanese army, with a small number of troops, stubbornly resisted, continuing to engage in fierce close combat, causing great fear to the American army. The landing and seizure battle on this island truly broke the previous records of battles in the Pacific.

After landing on Angaur, the Americans suffered heavy losses, while the Japanese shortened the battle line to repel the enemy. The Americans were repeatedly repulsed fiercely. In early September, the Japanese army even used close combat attacks, causing the enemy to suffer heavy casualties and retreat in shock.

New Guinea Campaign

In late April, the Japanese army withdrew from the Madang area, defeating the superior enemy. Afterwards, they fought a major battle with about one division of the enemy that had landed, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. The Japanese had overcome obstacles between Wewak and Aitape. On July 13, the Japanese army began attacking the enemy positions on the banks of the Lupu River in New Guinea. The enemy forces near Sarmi were deployed near Wakde Island in mid-August. From April to August, the Japanese battle results were: 2,079 enemy bodies abandoned, 2,650 casualties, 48 aircraft shot down, 45 destroyed, and a large number of other military supplies captured.

Biak Island Area

In late May, the American mobile force raided Biak Island, northwest of New Guinea. First, they bombarded it with heavy artillery, and then landed with a division of troops. The Japanese army launched fierce counter-attacks day and night, defeating them. Later, the enemy's troops were reinforced to two divisions. After acquiring bases such as Makassar and Hollandia, they were in an advantageous position, but the Japanese army frequently and cleverly bombed them, causing the enemy to suffer considerable losses. However, the Japanese army ultimately defended against the enemy with a small number of troops, and the Japanese army completed its mission in the Biak area by July 2.

Halmahera Island Campaign

Regarding Morotai Island in the Moluccas, after about one division of enemy troops landed in mid-September, the Japanese ground forces on the island immediately counter-attacked. Using close combat and self-sacrificing tactics, they suppressed the expansion of the enemy forces, killing and wounding more than 1,000 enemy troops by the end of October. Starting in November, the Japanese air force launched a more fierce attack on the enemy positions on the island, achieving great results.

Naval Battle East of Taiwan

The enemy Americans were ignorant of current events, and kept thinking that they could win inch by inch in island hopping operations. Underestimating Japan's strength, they pressed close to Japan's inner defense line, simply being arrogant and unbridled. In early October, they even coveted Taiwan, bombing it with more than a thousand aircraft for a hundred days. The enemy American fleet was the Third Fleet of the Pacific, commanded by Halsey, the most elite mobile unit. A fierce naval battle broke out on the night of the 12th. The Japanese army quickly won victories in all battles. The Japanese General Headquarters announced the battle results on the 16th as follows: ten aircraft carriers, two battleships, three cruisers, and one destroyer sunk; three aircraft carriers, one battleship, four cruisers, and eleven unidentified ships damaged. This was truly an unprecedented achievement, comparable to the Russo-Japanese War. After this crushing defeat, Nimitz bombed Manila on the 15th in order to salvage the situation and cover the safe retreat, but the Japanese army continued to attack them, sinking one aircraft carrier in the waters east of Manila, and shooting down 30 aircraft.

Landing Battle of the Philippines

Although the enemy Americans suffered a miserable defeat in Taiwan, they were still ferocious and unyielding. Not hesitating to adopt the "reverse warfare method", on October 18, they used the remaining enemy air force's fleet supplemented by transport convoys to invade Leyte Island in the southern Philippines.

The military force they sent consisted of the remnants of the Third Fleet led by Halsey, the Fifth Fleet led by Spruance, the Seventh Fleet led by Kinkaid, and the Australian fleet combined. They originally planned to land and occupy the Philippine Islands in one fell swoop. Little did they know that they would encounter fierce attacks by the Japanese navy in Leyte Gulf. The enemy landing forces and fleet were repeatedly defeated. As of October 27, the battle results that had been determined included the sinking of more than 130 enemy ships, including 39 aircraft carriers, 10 battleships, and 17 cruisers.

Leyte Island Landing Situation: On the 18th, the American side carried out air raids on the Visayas region and Luzon Island, etc., and began naval gun bombardment in the afternoon. On the 19th, a part of the American army landed on Cabalian in the southern part of Leyte Island, and under the cover of artillery fire, they planned to land near Tacloban, but were repelled by the Japanese army. On the 20th, the enemy army landed again successfully, but most of the boats and ships were sunk in the sea. After the 21st, the American bridgehead on Leyte was extremely small, and the three divisions of troops that had landed fought desperately, suffering heavy casualties. Afterwards, the force increased to five divisions to ten divisions, and the supply was extremely difficult. The Japanese Kamikaze Corps attacked the enemy convoys on the island with "crashing tactics", achieving remarkable results. The key areas of the island were protected by two lines of defense: one from Alangalang to Binolhoan, and one from Carigara to Nuro, surrounding the highlands. The two sides are engaged in fierce bayonet fighting.

In early November, the Japanese Kamikaze attack force fiercely attacked the enemy forces on the sea east of northern Luzon Island in the Philippines, sinking five enemy ships. The Japanese submarines responded by sinking three aircraft carriers and one destroyer. The Japanese Eighth Flying Group launched a fierce attack on Leyte Gulf on the 27th, sinking and destroying more than ten enemy ships.

Burma Theater

The Japanese army in Burma took the initiative, and since the invasion, has been victorious in every battle. Moreover, the Indian National Army cooperated and shouted the slogan of marching into the motherland and driving out Britain and the United States, adding a unique color to the Greater East Asia War. On January 8 of this year, the Free India Government moved from Singapore to Burma. Its mission will surely be completed on schedule. The following is a description of the India-Burma war situation:

Advancing into India

According to the announcement by the Japanese General Headquarters: On March 8, the Japanese powerful forces in Burma, together with the Indian National Army, attacked the British Indian army near the Chin Hills. Another unit, together with the Indian National Army, crossed the Chindwin River near Homalin on March 15. On March 23, the Japanese army attacked the British Indian 17th Division near Tonzang, and supported the Indian National Army. In mid-March, they entered India. The enemy had invaded northern Burma with airborne troops, and the Japanese army pursued and suppressed them. In the northwest of Myitkyina, they ambushed the Chinese army and the British and American allied forces that had invaded Shangfukung. The Japanese army retreated from the Myitkyina area in mid-August. Starting in early November, they launched a counter-offensive in the Myitkyina area, inflicting heavy losses. The water of the Irrawaddy River turned completely red.

Imphal Campaign

The Japanese army on the central India-Burma border launched an offensive towards the Imphal Plain with its main force in late March. At a point about 40 kilometers north of the plain, they had cut off the enemy's important supply line, the Palel-Kohima road. On the morning of April 6, they occupied Kohima, a key point on the Imphal-Dimapur road. On May 11, the Japanese air force's large formations destroyed the Imphal airfield and city streets. At the same time, in order to open up the supply route to the area, the Allied forces fought a major bloody battle around Kohima, and continuously transferred troops in Chittagong and Shillong. After the rainy season, their renewed activities suffered heavy losses, with 40,000 dead and more than 230,000 wounded.

Japanese Garrison on the Yunnan Border Sacrificed Their Lives

The battle in Yunnan became extremely fierce, for two reasons: First, the anti-Axis forces were urgently carrying out construction in the eastern border of India, thereby containing the Japanese army. Second, they attempted to open up the Ledo Road and reopen the Yunnan-Burma Road. The Japanese garrison forces in Ramu and Tengyue inflicted heavy losses on the Chinese army in Yunnan, making a significant strategic contribution. After completing their mission, the two garrisons finally heroically sacrificed their lives, and their great deeds were announced by the Ministry of the Army on September 20.

Battle on the Nu River Front

Since the Chinese army crossed the Nu River in mid-July, it has been determined to recapture the key points, suffering huge losses, and the supply of supplies has been extremely difficult. By early August, the Chinese army had abandoned 2,148 bodies.

Battle of Longling

The Chinese army launched fierce attacks on Tengyue, Ramu, and Longling with more than ten divisions in the rainy season, but were repelled. In mid-October, the Chinese army transferred its most elite unit, the 200th Division of the Fifth Army, to the vicinity of Longling to launch a counter-offensive, but was repelled by the Japanese army. Also, when the 200th Division attacked Mabai, it was ambushed and raided by 16 Japanese soldiers, and achieved considerable results.

China Theater

Britain and the United States are shouting themselves hoarse in the Greater East Asia War, engaging in a counter-offensive with trepidation. In order to contain the Japanese army, they are using the power of Chongqing on the Chinese mainland to fight against the Japanese army, so that they can catch a breath. Under the strategy of the Greater East Asia, the Japanese army had no choice but to advance step by step in order to destroy the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States.

Japanese Army Hands Over Guangzhou Bay

On February 16 of last year, the elite forces of the Japanese army in southern China landed on the Leizhou Peninsula in a surprise attack. On the 21st, they entered Guangzhou Bay, concluded a Japan-Vietnam defense agreement, and smoothly promoted the military and political affairs in the area, thereby ensuring security. On March 1 of this year, the Japanese army in southern China declared the removal of military and political affairs in the Guangzhou Bay area, incorporating it under the jurisdiction of the Guangdong Provincial Government, officially making it a peace zone. Chen Yaozu, the head of Guangdong Province, signed an agreement with the commander of the Japanese army, Huisinan, transferring it to the jurisdiction of the National Government. The Japanese army now only bears the mission of preparing for combat.

Japanese Army Opens Up the Pinghan Railway

The Japanese army crossed the Yellow River and launched an offensive on April 18. Within three weeks, they captured Zhengzhou, Xuchang, Yancheng, Suiping, Queshan, and the Pinghan Railway was connected from north to south. The Japanese army then pointed its troops westward, capturing Yiyang, Xiangcheng, Yuxian, Dengfeng, Rongyang, Zhishi and other places, and attacked Luoyang from the north and south. The Chinese and American air forces gradually became active, and the Japanese army shot down several P-40 type aircraft.

Henan-Hunan-Guangxi Campaign

On May 24, the Japanese army launched a general offensive on Luoyang and occupied it the next day. The Japanese army in Hunan captured Changsha and Liling on the 18th, which was the third time they had fallen. Then they advanced southward and attacked Hengyang. By July 26, the two sides had fought fiercely for 29 days. The Chongqing authorities announced on the 24th that the Japanese army had entered Hengyang city; a new fierce battle was launched in the northern part of the city. The Japanese headquarters announced that it had completely occupied the city on August 8. Fang Xianjue, the commander of the 10th Army of the Chinese army, and others surrendered to peace.

Guangxi Campaign

After the Japanese army captured Hengyang, they advanced southwest along the Xiang-Gui Railway. On October 9, they entered Guangxi Province, occupied Daoxian on the 13th, and Quanzhou the next day. On the 24th, they reached Guanyang, eighty kilometers northeast of Guilin, and from there launched an offensive to the southwest. They captured Guilin on November 10 and then entered Liuzhou. The aviation fortress in the southwest was thus completely destroyed. The southeast half and several southwestern provinces were isolated from Chongqing. They occupied Huaiyuan on November 22; and Nanning on the 24th.

The Japanese army, along the Qian-Gui Railway, attacked Jinchengjiang and Sachih on November 20, and captured Nandan on the 28th. Together with the troops that broke through Liming Pass and entered Guizhou Province, they continued to advance. On December 2, the Central News Agency reported: The headquarters of the 14th Air Force stationed in Chongqing believed that the Japanese army had the potential to attack Guiyang, the provincial capital.

Currently, the Chongqing authorities, because Guizhou Province has reported a critical situation, in order to actively rescue it, have specially deployed two divisions of the 76th Army and two divisions of the 79th Army in the provincial border area, and deployed the 196th Division of the 76th Army and a part of the 90th Army near Nanzong, occupying the dangerous mountains and resisting fiercely and arduously.

Southern Zhejiang Campaign

On August 27, the elite Japanese army stormed into Lishui County. Lishui is a transportation hub and the forefront of the supply route for air raids on Japan. The Japanese army occupied Wenzhou's important military base along the line and attempted to use it as a base for obstructing the route. Unexpectedly, the American side planned to...

Fuzhou Landing Campaign

On September 27, the Japanese army and navy cooperated with each other and launched the Fuzhou campaign again, carrying out a landing. This important coastal hub in the southeast fell into the hands of the Japanese army again. It is recorded that Fuzhou was once captured in April 1941.
