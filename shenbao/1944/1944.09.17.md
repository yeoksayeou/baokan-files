### Sunday Commentary: A Respectful Admonition to Chinese and Japanese Patriots

— Zhang Shaochang

The fate of East Asian nations has reached its most critical stage. While both possess unwavering faith in their ultimate victory, the question remains whether they have made sufficient preparations for it. Moreover, even with faith and preparation, can they confidently assert that their path is the safest? This demands careful consideration. At this critical juncture of survival, hesitation is no longer an option. We need not blame the authorities, but neither can we relinquish our national responsibility entirely to the government. Each and every one of us must rise up and dedicate all our strength to the nation. Japanese citizens need not solely worry about China, nor should Chinese citizens worry solely about Japan. We should worry more about ourselves. I believe that if everyone could worry about themselves, our problems could be solved.

Because I feel the situation is becoming more pressing day by day, and although most of the people in both China and Japan have become aware, there is still no solution. However, there can no longer be any strategy or misunderstanding between China and Japan. For the future of both countries, I venture to offer my humble opinion with utmost sincerity, hoping to exchange ideas with everyone.

The following is presented in a question-and-answer format:

○……○……○

Question: Do both China and Japan have the sincerity and determination for peace?

Answer: When we hear friends from both sides questioning each other's sincerity and determination, we always feel that such questioning is overly optimistic. If we say that neither side has it, then the purpose of war is peace, not war itself. If we say that both sides have it, then why are they still at war? Such questions cannot be answered through simple confrontation but require sharp eyes to see through, and thorough understanding to judge.

Question: Why can't the China-Japan issue be resolved, and what is the reason?

Answer: The reason why the China-Japan issue cannot be resolved can be summarized in one word: "Trust". It is due to the lack of "Trust". Analyzing it in detail, there are several reasons: ○ Neglecting the will and power of the people. ○ Among the peace activists from both sides of China and Japan since the incident, there are indeed many who are conscientious, love their own country, and also love East Asia. However, there are also many who forget the nation and seek personal gain. Even if there are good plans, the effects are only beneficial to individuals. ○ The declarations made by the Japanese government regarding China have not been fully realized.

Question: How can the China-Japan issue be resolved?

Answer: To thoroughly resolve the China-Japan issue, both long-term and urgent measures are needed, and these two measures must be carried out simultaneously. Long-term measures involve good neighborly relations. This is necessary to demonstrate sincerity and deepen mutual trust, and detailed explanations are unnecessary. If everyone wants to be on good terms, there will naturally be ways to achieve it. As for urgent measures, they are more important, and also more complex and difficult. However, no matter how difficult the problem is, as long as there is courage and knowledge, it can be solved with one word: "Sincerity". In detail, it needs to be divided into two points: [What China and Japan should work together on] and [What China and Japan should work on separately].

What should China and Japan work together on? ○ Both sides should avoid further provocation and burden. ○ Separately, each side should put its own house in order. The most important efforts should be to awaken the people's correct understanding of the current situation, and to eliminate emotional factors, using calm reason to study Sino-Japanese relations from each other's perspective. ○ Respect national opinion. ○ Eliminate those obstructive elements who seek personal gain through peace.

What should China and Japan work on separately? (A) What China should work on: China is still struggling on the line of survival. It should not be complacent and idle, nor should it assume that Japan's complete failure would necessarily be beneficial to China. Compatriots in the peace zones should understand the will and circumstances of the resistance zones, and understand their responsibility to leverage their advantageous position for action. Without hesitation, they should quickly seek a path for China's self-reliance. Compatriots in the resistance zones should observe the current situation and China's future with calm reason. Being too pessimistic is not acceptable, but being too optimistic is also dangerous. They should deeply understand the nation's difficulties, appreciate the government's predicament, and quickly seek a path for China's self-reliance. (B) What Japan should work on: ○ The most effective way is to win the trust of the Chinese people with facts. This is a tired cliché, but there is no better strategy. China's policy towards Japan, whether it is peace or war, is definitely not determined by the views of one or two leaders. If the people want war but the leaders advocate peace, it will not succeed. Conversely, if the people want peace but the leaders advocate war, it will not succeed. ○ Improving its attitude towards China and thoroughly understanding China. Gradual improvements have been made, but some people have not fully improved, which has a significant impact on the Sino-Japanese issue. Because Japan is the victorious nation, if Japan does not first improve its attitude towards China, China's confidence in Japan cannot increase. As for the point of understanding China, many have a thorough understanding, but there are also many who do not have a thorough understanding but believe they do. Therefore, although they treat people and things with sincerity, they often ruin important matters due to misunderstanding, even to the point of backfiring. Neither the old view of China nor the new view of China can be applied alone, because China is a struggling person wearing new clothes. It must be understood through a combination of the old and new perspectives.

A few days ago, because I was staying in a place without connection, I watched a Japanese movie called "Full City in Storm." I was deeply moved by the part where Katsu Kaishu disregarded his life and the opposition of the pro-war faction, and went to meet Saigō Takamori alone, saving the million-plus residents of Edo Castle with the patriotic sincerity of Katsu and Saigō. Although the plot is different from the Sino-Japanese issue, at least the Sino-Japanese issue cannot be resolved without such great men and such spirit.

This is the reason that prompted me to write these words, and I also wish to offer them for everyone's reference.

He recently traveled to Shanghai and published this article, which is particularly valuable for the reference of Chinese and Japanese people. – Editor’s note)

### 95 Kilometers from Guilin

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing military authorities announced that Japanese forces are advancing along the Xiang-Gui Railway, attacking the central forces.

### Twelve Chongqing-American Aircraft Shot Down

A Chinese front-line base, 16th (Central News Agency) - A Chongqing-American P-38 aircraft reconnoitered the battlefield in southern China at around 6 PM on the 14th, followed by 16 P-51 aircraft attacking the area near Sanshui, bombing the opposite bank of the Beijiang River.

### Japanese Minister Iguchi Discusses Washington Talks

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Iguchi Sadao, Director of the Third Bureau of the Japanese Intelligence Agency, recently published an article in the Tokyo Shimbun, discussing the Washington talks, the gist of which is as follows: If Chongqing hopes that Japan will become a weak and small country, what will happen to the Asian countries? This is tantamount to removing the barrier that prevents the United States and Britain from invading Asia, destroying the light of all Asia, and making the Asian peoples forever oppressed under the iron chains of the United States and Britain. The first to become the prey of the United States and Britain will be the Chinese mainland. Chongqing relies on the assistance of the United States and Britain to continue the war of resistance. Today, Chongqing's actual situation is as reported by the Associated Press from Chongqing on July 7th: The Chongqing side is exhausted from fighting Japan. If the aid route to Chongqing is not opened, it will not be a major factor in this war. The true peace and security of Asia must be based on the strong neighborly unity and mutual assistance of the great Asian nations centered on a strong Japan and a strong China. Only when the Anglo-Saxon scourge is eliminated from the great Asian land can it be realized. We must reflect on this.

### Several Sections of the Siegfried Line Outer Perimeter Have Been Breached

American Forces Intensify Siege of Aachen Fortress

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Western Front is advancing with a focus on the outer defenses of the Siegfried Line. German troops, believing that the fate of the country rests on this battle, are trying to prevent the enemy from breaking through the territory of France. After fierce fighting, German troops have withdrawn from the city of Maastricht.

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to front-line reports: The American First Army on the Belgian-German border has reached the northern area of Aachen. Aachen is a key outer point of the Siegfried Line and a transportation hub. Therefore, the outcome of the Aachen defense battle may determine the American advance line to Cologne.

### Eden Goes to Quebec to Deliver Important News

Stockholm, Sweden, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Hai Tong News Agency reports that British Broadcasting stated that Foreign Secretary Eden's trip to Quebec was to transmit important news, which could not be transmitted through normal means. After arriving in Quebec, Eden will focus on discussing the relationship between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Poland. According to a special reporter for the Canadian Press Association, the Soviet Union is unwilling to compromise on Poland, and the Soviet Union has not discussed current war goals. Therefore, serious foreign-related issues have arisen. Since Soviet representatives did not participate in the Quebec Conference, it is feared that negotiations on these issues will be very difficult. Roosevelt and Churchill have formed ideas about the Polish issue, but they still need to talk with Eden.

### Content of Soviet Conditions for Finland

The Soviet Union will control the Finnish army, and the Finnish army and the anti-Axis forces will jointly fight against Germany. Finland will pay US$600 million in reparations, the Aland Islands will be designated as a demilitarized zone, and the Soviet Union will establish consulates on the islands.

### The Focus of the Eastern Front Shifts North; Soviet Forces Launch an Offensive Toward the Gulf of Riga

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Hai Tong News Agency reports: The focus of the Eastern Front has shifted to the north. Soviet forces have concentrated a large number of fresh troops in the rear, attempting to advance towards the Gulf of Riga. German aircraft detected this action by the enemy long ago. After a week of shelling, the Soviet forces attempted to establish a bridgehead on the other side of the Imbach River, but failed. On Thursday morning, the entire Latvian front, from Busk to Pskov, was indeed attacked by a huge offensive of approximately 40 Soviet divisions and several tank battalions. The artillery and aircraft assisting in the battle were numerous. The focus of the battle was on both sides of Busk, Modon, and the Varga River, but the Soviet forces failed to break through the German defense line. The German forces were prepared and concentrated fresh troops there, repelling the enemy's offensive with counterattacks at any time. The northern and eastern borders of East Prussia were very quiet, and only the Narief area on the southeastern border was still in action. The German forces east of Warsaw abandoned Praga after the Soviet forces broke into the east of the Vistula. German forces at the southern end of the Vistula River encircled and annihilated nearly two Soviet divisions near the Soviet bridgehead near Sandomierz. The battle at the Baski Pass in the Carpathian Mountains has not developed, and Soviet forces have not yet reached the summit of the pass.

### German Troops in Northern Finland Refuse to Surrender

### Decisive Battle Living Day in Beijing

— Wu Gong

When this reporter arrived in Beijing, it happened to coincide with the monthly Greater East Asia War Memorial Day and our country's War Participation Memorial Day. In North China, these two days are designated as Decisive Battle Living Days. This month's Decisive Battle Living Day in Beijing started on the first day at 10:00 AM, when all members of the city's civil defense corps mobilized to key locations throughout the city to inspect citizens' clothing. It turns out that during the Decisive Battle Living Day period, ordinary citizens should wear air raid protection clothing, and neither men nor women are allowed to wear long gowns. Therefore, it is necessary for the civil defense corps to dispatch instructors to the streets for inspection. The so-called civil defense corps is similar to the self-defense corps in Shanghai, but the members of the civil defense corps here all wear uniforms, which of course makes them look neater than in Shanghai. At 11:59 AM, the siren on Jing Shan Mountain sounded a long blast, and pedestrians and vehicles on the streets stopped immediately, each praying for the victory of the Greater East Asia War in their respective locations. At the same time, various civil defense sub-corps also sounded sirens, undertaking guidance work on the streets and inspecting various protection groups in each district to see if their organizations, facilities, and training were appropriate, until the training was completed around 12:00 noon. The second day was our country's War Participation Memorial Day, and in addition to various agencies holding commemorative ceremonies, air raid drills were also held. During these two days of Decisive Battle Living Day, all citizens of the city obeyed the authorities' regulations prohibiting alcohol, tobacco, and public banquets. Citizens uniformly wore air raid protection clothing, and all pedestrians and vehicles on the streets had to comply with traffic rules. All public places also vigorously promoted the so-called "one-line practice." Youth League members of the New People's Society in various districts worked tirelessly, either directing pedestrians on the streets or engaging in diligent public service work. As a result, it is indeed possible to make the general public more aware of the decisive battle here. Currently, air raid shelters have been dug on all the streets of Beijing, and after an air raid alarm is issued, pedestrians on the streets should lie down in the shelters. During these two days, this reporter personally went to the streets to inspect the results of the air raid drill implementation and felt that it was more orderly than in Shanghai. This is probably because the civil defense corps here is better trained!

### Air Defense Headquarters Excavates Fire-Fighting Pools

Preventing Water Supply Interruption During Air Raids

The Shanghai Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters, in order to prevent the interruption of the water supply in Shanghai in the event of an attack, which would greatly affect fire-fighting water, is excavating more than 20 fire-fighting pools in the central locations of various districts of the city as a precautionary measure. Each pool can hold tens of thousands of gallons of water and is not allowed to be used at ordinary times, only for fire trucks in case of emergency. The construction of these fire-fighting pools has already begun. In addition to the Suzhou River, where workers are being sent by the Public Works Bureau to excavate, the naval baojia districts are having self-defense corps members take turns working voluntarily. Efforts are also being made to beautify the surroundings of the pools, so the project is vast. It is hoped that the baojia self-defense corps in various districts will continue to voluntarily select suitable locations and excavate smaller pools in order to cope with any emergencies.

### Special Tax Office of the Finance Bureau Officially Established Yesterday

The Director Encourages Staff to Practice Integrity

The Special Tax Office of the Shanghai Special Municipal Finance Bureau was officially established yesterday (the 16th). Director Chen Junde arrived at the office to take up his duties at 9:00 AM that morning, and summoned his staff at 5:00 PM to give a speech, which was full of encouragement. An excerpt of his speech is as follows: "I have been ordered to preside over this office, and I am deeply ashamed of my shallow talent and lack of ability to fulfill this task. However, since I have been entrusted with the responsibility by my superiors and I have received the full assistance of everyone, I am filled with excitement and gratitude amidst trepidation. Today, taking advantage of the opportunity for everyone to gather together, I will briefly report on the principles that should be followed in handling matters in the future: ○ Practice integrity. All new and old staff members of this office must maintain their integrity, be diligent and thrifty in serving the public, and those who work in the field must be especially clean and self-respecting, and must not act recklessly. When dealing with merchants, they must be kind and amiable, and persuade them well, so that they do not evade taxes and be punished. As for the reasonable living of colleagues, I am absolutely responsible for guaranteeing it. In terms of employing people, I have always held the principle of talent-based, and I will never use private individuals. Everyone can work with peace of mind, and do not harbor doubts or disturb each other. ○ Eliminate malpractices. The special tax is one of the important tax sources of the country. In the future, investigators and tax collectors must handle matters in accordance with the regulations. In addition to the prescribed tax amount to be collected, there must be no extra demands. As for illegal shops, the severity of the circumstances should also be distinguished in order to determine the standard of punishment. All of you have considerable knowledge and experience in handling tax affairs. I hope that you can all provide as much advice as possible based on your experience, so that the inspection and collection system will become more perfect day by day, and the tax revenue will improve day by day. This is what I hope for deeply. ○ Improve the treatment of staff members and implement a reward and punishment system. Special tax is an important source of tax revenue for this city, so the treatment of staff members should be improved as much as possible so that they can maintain a decent life and focus on the collection work. I have also been ordered to formulate regulations on rewards and punishments for staff members. I hope that all staff members of this office can understand the importance of special tax work, and do not covet temporary small profits and bring trouble to themselves. This is what I earnestly hope for." The important personnel appointments within the Special Tax Management Office of the Municipal Finance Bureau have recently been decided as follows: The position of Section Chief of the Management Section will be temporarily held concurrently by Director Chen Junde. The Section Chief of the Investigation Section is Shi Hua, the Section Chief of the Audit Section is Li Wenda, the Section Chief of the Collection Section is Zhang Naixiang, and the Secretary is Sun Mingqu.

### Registration for Poultry Market

The unified management organization of the market has been selected at Xiaodongmenkou on Zhonghua Road, and construction is being rushed to open the market soon. The office at 175 Guangdong Road has begun to handle registration procedures. Anyone in the city who is engaged in the business of chickens, ducks, and wild game and meets the qualifications of the market's business rules can register and enter the market according to their grade number.

### Residents of the Nanshi District Receive Ration Certificates

The household rationing matters in the Nanshi District (i.e., the former 7th District) were re-registered in April by the Food Bureau. Now, the Rationing Office, in order to make the rationing policy more smooth and meticulous, has specially printed a type of application certificate for residents of the Nanshi District to receive rationed goods. From September 11th to the 20th, it will be issued to each household by fangbao separately as proof for future periodical receipt of purchase certificates for various rationed goods from the office. All residents of households residing in the Nanshi District who have registered their households with the former Food Bureau should have their head of household bring their residence certificate chop, the five-part yellow household registration form from the fang office, and the household registration certificate from the police station, and pay a printing fee of ten yuan, and submit them to the Nanshi Certificate Issuing Preparatory Office (the original site of the former Food Bureau) in accordance with the regulations to receive the certificate.

### All Stores Must Mark Prices on Goods for Sale

All commercial firms in the city should, in accordance with the approved prices, add labels to each item for sale, indicating the price, and post or hang the approved price list in a conspicuous place so that customers can clearly understand the actual price and the authorities can easily check. The Municipal Economic Bureau has repeatedly issued orders to all trade associations to instruct their members to comply. Recently, it has been found that many commercial firms in the city are complying in name only and not in reality, and have not yet complied. In order to suppress prices and implement spot checks, the Municipal Economic Bureau has strictly ordered all trade associations in the city to instruct their members to comply by a deadline. If they continue to violate the order, once it is discovered or reported, they will be severely punished.

### Industry Department Explains the Powers of Inspection of Weights and Measures

The Shanghai Special Municipal Weights and Measures Testing Institute believes that the inspection of weights and measures in various commercial firms by the Administrative Division of the First Police Bureau of the city and the administrative sections of its subordinate branches conflicts with the powers of the institute's enforcers. The institute has successively submitted reports to the Economic Bureau and the National Weights and Measures Bureau of the Industry Department, which have been forwarded to the Industry Department for review and instruction. Now, the Industry Department has issued instructions, stating that the inspection and enforcement of weights and measures are governed by laws and regulations, which do not allow for confusion. The request is to request the municipal government to forward the request to rectify the situation and to ensure that the inspection is carried out in accordance with the law in the future.

### Municipal Education Bureau Plans to Improve the Treatment of Municipal Elementary School Teachers

It has been found that the treatment of teachers and staff in municipal elementary schools is meager, and their lives are difficult. The Municipal Education Bureau, as the responsible education administrative agency, should give special consideration to improving their treatment so that they can teach with peace of mind. It has recently been heard that the bureau has been working hard to plan and prepare a budget to be submitted to higher authorities for review and approval. It is also reported that educational laws and regulations are in urgent need of reorganization, so a Committee for the Reorganization of Educational Administrative Regulations has been specially formed, with Secretary Dai Yuheng appointed as the chairman, and the section chiefs and chief supervisors of each section as members. They have been working hard to reorganize the regulations.

### French Tramway Raises Prices Without Authorization; Authorities Strictly Order to Stop

Restore Original Prices and Await Review and Approval

Recently, the authorities have been trying to suppress prices. However, the French tramway and electric light company has, on the pretext of increased costs, increased the fares of trams and trolleybuses. The increase standard is surprising, reaching over 150 percent, with the minimum first-class fare being eight yuan and the maximum being twenty yuan. Trams are the most economical means of transportation for citizens. Now that the prices have suddenly risen sharply, the impact on people's livelihood is significant. According to this reporter's investigation, the Public Utilities Bureau did not receive instructions from the municipal government authorities regarding the French tramway company's price increase. Therefore, the company's unauthorized price increase was not approved by the Public Utilities Bureau, which is illegal. The company has now been strictly ordered to restore the original prices and await review and approval by the authorities.

### Municipal Health Bureau Prevents Autumn Epidemics

Now that it is autumn, the most common epidemics in the city are typhoid fever, dysentery, and a type of fever called "Shanghai fever." It is found that the causes are largely due to drinking unclean beverages or eating cut-open fruits, which allow typhoid fever or dysentery bacteria to invade the stomach and intestines, causing illness. The Municipal Health Bureau, in order to prevent the epidemic of typhoid fever and dysentery from intensifying, has, in addition to strictly cracking down on unclean food, ordered all affiliated hospitals and health branches to intensify free typhoid fever vaccinations for the public. It is also hoped that the public will be cautious about their diet, and especially pay attention to unboiled drinking water, such as uninspected local wells, to prevent transmission. The cause of "Shanghai fever" is generally due to being bitten by mosquitoes. After being infected with this disease, there is often a period of fever for several days. Although the mortality rate is not very high, it is very easy to spread or cause other complications. It is hoped that the public will take more precautions against mosquitoes, and especially avoid going to public places, to prevent infection. As for the Health Bureau, it has stepped up its mosquito eradication efforts. It is reported that there is a shortage of raw materials for the mosquito eradication potion, and they are currently working hard to purchase them.

### Buddhist Association Holds Memorial Service and Preaching Yesterday

It is also heard that the association has been dispatching preachers to various prisons every week to explain Buddhist scriptures in rotation in recent years. This preaching was an unprecedented expansion movement.

### Letter

After the publication of an article titled "[Legal Question Doubt]" by Mr. Wei Yi in the social services column of the newspaper on the 14th of this month, the Shanghai District Court Clerk's Office sent a letter yesterday stating the following: "To the Editor of the Shen Bao: We have read a question raised about a legal matter in your newspaper’s social service column on September 14th. The description of the events surrounding the eviction case of the China Vocational Building Leasing Office and the East Asia Sports School is inconsistent with the facts. The Civil Court's handling of civil enforcement cases always requires an audit after an order or disposition is issued. Only after the case is approved for cancellation and filed can it be reported as closed. In this case, the creditor, China Vocational Building Leasing Office, requested the cancellation of the case with a written guarantee, but it has not been approved. At the same time, the third party, East Asia Middle School, stated that it had a lease relationship with the creditor before the lawsuit was filed. The court believes that it is necessary to investigate whether its statement is true, so the enforcement procedure has not been finalized and is being reviewed carefully. There is no doubt about this under the law. I hope your publication will publish this letter in the letter column to clarify the facts. Sincerely, Shanghai District Court Clerk’s Office, September 15, 1944." Yesterday's dispatch time was 6:50 p.m.

### Municipal Elementary Schools Offer After-School Tutoring; Education Bureau Formulates Management Measures

### A Destroyer Bloodbath off Cape Kawieng

Under the Southern Cross, well-trained sailors of the Imperial Japanese Navy, dripping with sweat and blood, fight bravely and doggedly upon a vast and tempestuous sea for their country, and for a greater East Asia, combating an enemy with superior numbers and singing a bloodstained paean of victory. What follows is the first-hand account of a bloodbath, experienced by a Chief Petty Officer of a Japanese Destroyer Fleet. The grim and tragic fighting in the South Pacific may be imagined from it. While continually subject to enemy aerial attack, only three days after the New Year, this was no New Year for us. On this afternoon, we completed preparations at our base for an attack in the service of a great mission. Our ships left the green of the base, and cleaved the waves of the South Pacific, making way towards the war zone.

### Changing into Battle Dress

[Changing into Battle Dress!] The whistle shrieked, and the order transmitted like lightning. I quickly changed into new shorts and a new undershirt, covered with a white military uniform, and ran to the bridge. On the bridge, the sharp eyes of officers and watchmen glared at the ocean and the azure sky. The ship swayed forward, rolling left and right within a forty-degree angle from both sides. Night gradually spread over the sea, and our warship unknowingly reached the combat zone. This area was within the enemy's air control range, and we had to quickly complete our mission under the cover of darkness. [Aircraft attack, at ninety degrees!] the port watchman suddenly shouted. The stark white beam of a searchlight from the land began to move across the sky. Soon, in the focus of the intersecting beams, the silhouette of a PB2Y was clearly outlined. Luxurious firework-like phosphorescence clearly illuminated the contours of the island ahead through the darkness. The PB2Y, caught by the searchlight, frantically dropped three flares. Before long, deafening explosions followed one after another, and high columns of water erupted around the warship. While carrying out its mission, our warship skillfully dodged the enemy aircraft's bombs, and the machine guns and main guns fired in unison, finally repelling it.

### Man Your Stations

When we headed back after completing the mission, it was already the early morning of the next day (the 4th). Suddenly, a mournful bugle call sounded. It was the order to [Man Your Stations]. I immediately went to the bridge. [What's happening?] I asked the signalman. [Urgent telegram, a powerful enemy task force has appeared.] he replied. In less than five minutes, the port watchman shouted: [One hundred and sixty-five degrees to port, a large enemy formation!] The atmosphere on the bridge suddenly became even more tense, and the air raid alarm blared throughout the ship. The watchmen peered through their binoculars, motionless like statues. Then, a series of reports came in rapid succession: [Large enemy formation, combined torpedo and bomber attack, ten planes, twenty planes, thirty planes... too many to count, about a hundred planes!] At this moment, black specks resembling sesame seeds could be seen with the naked eye on the horizon. The commander, nodding incessantly, stared intently at the large enemy formation, and then ordered [Second battle speed!] [Third battle speed!] increasing the speed, intending to pass through the strait and engage them on the open ocean. The commander, the captain, and all the officers standing on the bridge fixed their eyes intently on the enemy aircraft. [The large enemy formation is heading towards our ship!] the watchman shouted again. The aircraft were fast, and everyone strongly felt that this outcome was inevitable.

### Anti-Aircraft Battle

[Maximum battle speed!] the commander ordered again. Then the captain's order for [Anti-Aircraft Battle Stations!] came down. All-out combat began. [One hundred and twenty degrees to starboard, enemy formation appearing!] Looking up at the sky to starboard, sure enough, there were about forty large enemy aircraft in a group, leisurely advancing in the same direction as our ship against the white clouds. As soon as the firing order was given, the ship's machine guns immediately opened fire in unison. Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh... tracer bullets blocked the path of the enemy aircraft formation. At that moment, the enemy aircraft on the left wing dipped downwards, began to turn left, and started diving steeply towards our ship. They were TBFs. The first four aircraft that charged in suddenly opened their large bellies and released large, chrome-colored, fountain pen-like aerial torpedoes. [Hard right rudder!] A deep voice like a cracked bell rang out. The ship tilted to port and then rapidly turned to starboard. The four torpedoes, trailing white wakes, passed about two meters from the starboard side, speeding towards the coral reefs near the stern with a thunderous roar, sending up large pillars of water like walls. The next instant, enemy aircraft attacking from port again launched four torpedoes. [Hard left rudder!] The unchanging, watchful voice sounded again on the bridge, and the ship immediately turned to port. The torpedoes passed like white threads less than one meter from the port side. Then, three more torpedoes missed. Thus, whether it was divine protection or the enemy aircraft's poor skill, none of the torpedoes hit our warship, only causing geyser-like water columns to erupt around it. When we could finally see the green coral reefs on both shores, the enemy aircraft began strafing with machine guns. It was as if a swarm of locusts was descending on a sturdy ear of grain. More than eighty enemy aircraft attacked all at once. The roar of the aircraft, combined with the rapid-fire staccato of the machine guns, was deafening. The enemy aircraft circled over the bridge, flying back and forth, so low that the faces of the crew could be clearly seen.

### Downing Enemy Aircraft

[Shoot them down!] At the command of the commander, who stood solemnly on the bridge, enemy aircraft were shot down one after another. At two o'clock, the young lieutenant above me was shot and killed. In addition, many comrades fell while carrying out orders, and many soldiers were also killed by bullets. The captain's thigh was also broken by an enemy bullet, held together only by a piece of skin. The doctor said that he needed to amputate the leg, but the captain let the blood flow freely from his leg, gripping the handrail of the bridge tightly with both hands, and continued to direct his subordinates in battle. Seeing his fearless appearance, the soldiers, though suffering mortal wounds, gripped their hot guns and cannons tightly and continued to shoot at the enemy aircraft. The enemy air force, relying on their numerical superiority, seemed to be afraid of this spirit and retreated like a receding tide. The victory song was ours! In order to prepare a report on the war dead and wounded, I went down from the bridge. The deck was slippery under my feet, and there was a fishy smell in the air. I looked closely and realized that the deck was covered in blood. Every time the ship rocked from side to side, the blood on the deck flowed to the left and then to the right. This scene made me shudder all over. Could this really have happened in just twenty minutes? It was like a dream! I looked at the waves of blood, stunned. Our warship, carrying the bodies of our comrades, returned to the green base. What greeted us was the same island as before our departure, the green coconut grove, still unchanged, but our warship had changed. The hull was riddled with bullet holes, like a honeycomb, and the bodies of comrades wrapped in white coarse cloth lay on the deck. After landing, the bodies were cremated at the foot of the mountain. The next day at dusk, the ashes were placed in white wooden boxes, and our comrades had returned. The remains were placed on an altar decorated with the warship's flag in a corner of the officers' room. I recited the Kannon Sutra, praying for the souls of my comrades. Before long, the commander-in-chief issued a commendation for this battle, and we immediately placed it before the spirits of our comrades. On the sixth day, the Imperial Headquarters announced: [On the morning of January 4th, the Imperial destroyer intercepted and shot down twelve enemy aircraft attacking Kavieng...] Hearing the announcement of this victory, we couldn't help but shed tears. (翔: Translated from the August 18th Asahi Shimbun)

### Spring Dream

— Ren Shufang

Dong Danan and Li Huanqing have been married for nine years and have three children, but they have never had a serious argument. The couple is often envied and praised. Although Danan is not very handsome, he is imposing, good at making money, and became the manager of two companies in his early thirties. His private life is extremely disciplined, he doesn't smoke, drink, or gamble. He is also not one to have affairs. Even so, he is not a man without tenderness, and he always laughs and chats with his wife. Both Huanqing and Danan are university graduates. Huanqing used to be a very popular campus beauty at school. Now she is Danan's capable wife. Just looking at how elegantly and cleanly their home is decorated, one can tell that the mistress of this house is quite refined. What she is most proud of is her three children, and they are all three boys, all fair and chubby, and as adorable as the children painted on calendars. Huanqing is usually very frugal and doesn't spend money recklessly. This is what Danan finds most commendable. Given his wealth, he could easily hire several "amahs" and stewards. However, Huanqing believes that she can handle all the big and small matters herself, so she only employs an old maid to cook, do laundry, and help take care of the children when she has time. Although Danan feels that Huanqing is working too hard, Huanqing refuses to hire more people. Saving money is something that everyone appreciates. As time went on, Huanqing actually managed the family affairs very well. Although the wrinkles on her forehead are gradually deepening, her husband is considerate, her children are adorable, and her private savings are increasing day by day, all of which allow her to forget her fatigue and aging. Danan is satisfied with everything about his wife, except that she seems to love money a little too much. Fortunately, he can still earn enough, so he pretends not to notice this. Also, with so many children, Huanqing often neglects her husband because she is busy taking care of them, which makes Danan somewhat unhappy, but he always ends up forgiving her. In his spare time, Danan often enjoys reading academic books. Magazines! Monthly journals! Many, many. When he is particularly interested, he sometimes drags Huanqing along to study with him. When they were about to get married, the two of them often enthusiastically discussed a question, even arguing over it for an entire afternoon. But now, Huanqing is only interested in expressing her children's philosophies, and she is not interested in anything else. Especially when it comes to English, it's even worse. She always avoids it, saying, [Don't ask me! I'm about to forget even the twenty-six letters of the alphabet!] Hearing this, Danan always sighs and says, [Alas! What's the use of women studying!] Although there are some areas where the couple doesn't get along, they are still happy, living together, and are still envied and praised. XX…XX…XX Recently, Danan suddenly wanted to learn Japanese. He felt that Japanese was very useful at the moment, so he discussed it with Huanqing. She was making clothes for the youngest child, her eyes half-closed, wanting to doze off. She said, [Whatever you want. It's always good to know more!] So Danan decided to place an advertisement in the newspaper to hire a Japanese tutor. The next afternoon, someone came to apply. Unexpectedly, it was a young lady. Her attire was not particularly fashionable. Her clothes were loose-fitting and long-sleeved, but the way she walked gave people a sense of lightness. Her hair was styled high, like an ancient hairstyle. In every way, she was very special. Danan politely inquired about her resume and learned that she was a mixed-race girl named Beizi. Her father was Chinese, and he married a Japanese woman while studying in Japan. She grew up in Japan and only returned to China at the age of twelve. For more than twenty years, she received education in both China and Japan. Now, her father has passed away, and her mother originally planned to return to Japan, but after living in China for more than ten years, she has become accustomed to everything. There are many things that make her nostalgic, so she still lives in China to this day. Danan was very satisfied with this well-educated female teacher. He decided to hire her. Huanqing was also very fond of her, saying that she was full of Eastern classical beauty, and that her eyes were even more charming than the blue eyes with long eyelashes of Westerners. Danan was not without this feeling. However, after Huanqing mentioned it, it seemed even more vivid. After that, Miss Beizi came every afternoon to teach Japanese for an hour. She taught very well, and Danan was also very diligent in learning. Somehow, Danan's mind gradually became uneasy, and he couldn't say what the reason was. He seemed to remember feeling this way ten years ago when he was pursuing Huanqing. Every afternoon, he was always in a daze. He knew very well that it was very dangerous to continue like this, so he hid it from Huanqing and bought a bottle of brandy, wanting to use alcohol to dispel his sinful thoughts. However, the result was that it only increased that burning sensation. A month passed, and Danan learned the simplest Japanese. At first, he made rapid progress, but later he couldn't. He often couldn't pronounce the newly taught words. Beizi didn't like to talk much, and often used a smile at the corner of her mouth to replace many words. And Danan felt that her beauty was expressed in this silence. He often stole glances at her beauty. Beizi liked to wear light makeup. She applied very little powder. Danan felt that this added to her natural beauty. Huanqing was busy with the children and housework all day long, and didn't notice her husband's abnormality at all. Huanqing used to be beautiful, but now she was too lazy to comb her hair properly. Danan sometimes silently compared Huanqing and Beizi, and he felt that Huanqing was far inferior. One day during the Mid-Autumn Festival, Huanqing prepared many dishes and invited Beizi to have dinner. Danan was much happier than usual. During the meal, Beizi was very polite and didn't pick much food. Most of the time, Danan picked food for her. Huanqing, on the other hand, was holding the youngest child in her arms, with the two older children sitting next to her. The youngest child was moving around in her mother's arms, making it impossible for Huanqing to eat peacefully. In addition, the two older children were fighting over a piece of meat, spilling rice all over the table. Huanqing had to hand the child in her arms to Danan and clean up the rice on the table. This time, the older children cried, and the younger child also cried, causing an uproar. Originally, this kind of thing was common. Danan didn't used to feel anything, but now he felt very unhappy. He thought that there was really no happiness to be had with such crying. After dinner, Beizi didn't say much, and Huanqing didn't have time to keep her company. Only Danan chatted with her intermittently. Soon, she said goodbye. Danan paced around the courtyard in disappointment, sighing deeply at the exceptionally bright autumn moon in the middle of the sky. Then he returned to his room, lay down on the bed, and thought about this and that. He couldn't fall asleep for a while. At this time, he remembered the movie "Tears of Fragrant Stationery" and felt that his situation was very similar. Huanqing took care of the children and put them to bed, then came to the courtyard. Last year, Danan and she admired the moon together. This year, Danan went to bed so early. Huanqing was also somewhat unhappy, but she was not someone who had time to think too much. Soon, she was distracted by other thoughts. The next day, Huanqing took two children back to her parents' house. The oldest child did not go because he had to go to school. When Danan returned from work, he heard the old maid say that the mistress had returned to her parents' house. He didn't say much, told the old maid to buy a pack of cigarettes, and sat on the sofa, smoking idly. Suddenly, he thought that Huanqing's absence was a good opportunity to express his feelings to Beizi. Thinking about it, his face turned red. He took a few deep puffs of the cigarette. Huanqing returned after dinner. As soon as she entered the house, she saw the big child's shining eyes, as if he had something important to tell her. Before she could speak, the child told her in a low, unclear voice, [Today, Dad and the teacher fought... Dad went to pull her hand, and the teacher was so scared that she stood up. Dad went to grab her again, and she slapped Dad twice, turned around, and left. Now Dad is still angry and sleeping in bed! Mom, I saw this when I was playing with blocks on the stairs. Even the old maid doesn't know!] Huanqing was stunned for a moment after hearing the child's words, because it was a child's words, she was still doubtful. Although she said so, she felt a pang of sadness in her heart, and tears fell down. That night, Danan and Huanqing broke their nine-year record and had a big fight. The next day, Beizi sent a letter of resignation, which further confirmed the child's words. The two had another fight. X...X...X Danan's shattered spring dream was unknown to outsiders. They were still considered the most perfect and happiest couple in the world. Although Danan and Huanqing reconciled, a scar had been drawn in both of their hearts, like a bowl that had been glued together. Even if it wasn't broken, a crack that couldn't be erased had been left behind.

### A Bee

— Jiang Weiqun

On the gauze window, a bee, from who knows where, blindly bumped its head against the gauze, buzzing loudly. The louder it buzzed, the more violently it bumped its head. However, how could it not know that this was simply too foolish? It sought light, but did not know the path. It pursued with temporary enthusiasm, and thus, even until death, it would still be inside the gauze window, unable to reach the realm of light. In society, there are many foolish people just like it, blindly pursuing the light—without using reason to think and consider. As a result, they finally fall into a bottomless abyss. One must know that robbers, thieves, and evil people… are not born with a marked type of thief, robber, or evil person... They also pursue light, but take a wrong step. In the end, they act blindly on their own will, finally falling into a path from which they cannot extricate themselves. I ask, of the people living in the world, who does not hope for light? The sound of [Buzz!...] has gradually weakened, but it still bumps its head, tottering. I subconsciously hurried to open the gauze window. At this moment, it was blown by a breeze, as if it had taken a dose of stimulant, and flew into the embrace of nature, regaining its former agility.

### Night Alley

— Qiu Yu

In the long harbor of night, a dim street lamp, like the sorrowful gaze of a delicate woman; silent, the alley is like a dying python. X……X……X A sharp hawking sound, mixed with the broken, hoarse sound of a huqin, trembled in the evening breeze; closer, closer; shattering the silence of the deep alley. X……X……X Two blurred black shadows slowly moved on the ground; driven by the whip of life, the voice is hoarse, the strength is exhausted; still singing, singing; X……X……X The hawker walked far away, and the singing sound also moved far away, the back disappeared into the depths of the alley; the long alley became more quiet, more quiet.

### Mosquito

— Qiu Yu

A pusher of infectious diseases, a thief of blood; playfully disturbing people's good dreams, buzzing… leisurely flying. X……X……X It cunningly gives people a generous gift, – germs, but exchanges them for precious blood. X……X……X Fiercely, [smack!] A sound, the person being bitten retaliates: in the palm of the hand, a little red blood stain is added. The bloodsucker is so worthless to hit.

### The Referee's Bias Was Not the Fault of the Panda Team's Efforts, They Placed Third, and the Nation Should Pay Attention to Softball in the Future

— Miaoshan

This year's Shanghai Softball Open League, since the addition of our Chinese team, Panda, has seen unprecedented enthusiasm. Moreover, the competition of our Chinese team has improved the level of the game, which should be recognized by everyone. The addition of the Chinese team was intended to seize the championship that had been monopolized by Westerners, and to promote softball, which is commendable. Now the Panda team has finished all its battles, and in the match against Xiqing on September 14, it unfortunately suffered a crushing defeat, placing third. The record of the match and my thoughts are recorded below:

### The Record is Still Satisfactory, and We Should Strive for Progress in the Future

The Panda team fought seven times, with five wins and two losses. Among them, the victory over the Philippine team was the most outstanding performance. As for the two defeats, apart from the first defeat to the Portuguese Red team, which was indeed due to inferior skills, the defeat to Xiqing was due to various reasons, and the Panda team was forced to fail. This was obvious to everyone, and it was not due to inferior skills. Although defeated, they were still glorious.

### The Referee Was Intentionally Biased, and Xiqing's Actions Were Crude

In any sports competition hosted by Westerners, the Chinese team is always at a disadvantage, so the softball game is no exception. In the match against Xiqing, the referee, Herrera, was intentionally biased, which is not an exaggeration, but a fact that everyone witnessed. The referees on the field, Mr. Le Xiurong and Li Ning, Sun Jinshun and others, also felt injustice for the Chinese team and argued with reason, but it was ineffective. The Chinese team was stimulated by this, and its morale plummeted. Moreover, the Xiqing players acted rudely. For example, when Funike reached first base, he deliberately bumped into the baseman, Wang Nianzu, causing Wang to drop the ball after catching it. The referee still ruled a hit (Save). Another example is when the Japanese player of Xiqing, Mr. Zhidao, was returning to base. The catcher, Wang Qingrui, had already touched his body after catching the ball before Mr. Zhidao stepped on the base, but the referee still ruled a safe run. This bias was even more obvious. The Chinese team players had no heart to continue fighting, causing them to lose a total of seven points in the third, fourth, and fifth innings. After this, there were a total of five biased incidents.

### The Panda Team Lacks Hitting Skills, but Their Fielding is the Best in Shanghai

The Panda team's participation in the league has opened the eyes of Westerners. Although they could not win the championship, the Panda team's fielding has been unanimously recognized as the best in Shanghai. However, their hitting skills were not good. The Panda team could not win, half of the reason was due to this. Looking at the match against Xiqing, in the second inning, there was a full base, with three players on base. If Wang Xiushan, who is good at hitting, could hit at this time, he could at least let two people return to base and win the first victory. Unfortunately, Mr. Wang is a comparative law student at Soochow University, and he is about to graduate, so he does not have time to play. Thus, the only chance of victory was lost at once, which is a pity. I deeply hope that the Panda team players will work hard in the future and look forward to drinking victory next year. Today, Sunday morning at 10:00 a.m., Xiqing and Portuguese Red will compete for this year's championship at Jiaozhou Park.

### The Fuhua Cup Finals Today, the Four Strong Teams Will Be Out in Full Force, with Ample Strength, and It Will Definitely Be Wonderful

— Xian Bimei

This publication has repeatedly recorded the vigor of this year's mini-football. Looking back at the most grand of all the cup competitions, it should be the first mini-football league that just ended last week, and the most exciting one is the Fuhua Cup held at Yiyuan at 10:00 a.m. today (the 17th). It is investigated that the Fuhua Cup is hosted by the Fuhua Tobacco Company, presided over by Cheng Bo'an, and Jia Youliang and Xu Zhihao are responsible for all the general affairs, all of whom are veterans, so the results have been remarkable. The most valuable thing is that the teams they invite are all first-class football players in Shanghai, and the company is purely for promoting interest in sports, so every game is open to spectators, and fans are happy to go, which is rare in mini-football competitions. It is heard that the game is scheduled to hold the finals today. There will be a final between Baima and Hequn, and another exhibition match will be added, in which Qiaolian will face Huanan, which will inevitably be an unprecedented grand occasion. The authorities, on the one hand, in order to show a slight restriction, specially sell tickets, each for 100 yuan. However, all income will not be deducted for expenses, and all will be donated to charity organizations. And all the expenses will be borne by the Fuhua Tobacco Company. It is also heard that the authorities will also invite the famous actor Zhou Xinfang to auction charity balls, and the movie star Bai Guang to give awards.

### Baima

Is the entire team of Donghua soldiers, with the addition of the famous Hong Kong defender Yan Shixin to join the war, adding luster to the brocade, and impeccable, and the connection between the three fronts is both desirable, and the shots all have foot heads, and Dai Linjing is also seeing the magic, allowing him to be one of the best performers in mini-football. The gold team's front is delicate, and the rear is broad, applying both softness and rigidity. Today's opponent is the Hequn team that has risen from the beginning, and the newborn is not afraid of tigers, but based on the achievements of Baima's elders, it should still be the horse's footprint.

### Cohesion Group

The Cohesion Group is a rising team under the training of Dai Linjing. Mr. Dai's efforts have yielded considerable results. This year, the Cohesion Group has shown great promise in small-sided football, making people look at them with new eyes. However, today's performance is like showing off one's skills in front of Lu Ban (a master craftsman), requiring much thought. Mr. Dai may not be willing to criticize them excessively. Observing the Cohesion Group's efforts, Dong Jincai's goalkeeping can be described as top-notch. The two defenders are slightly weaker, and the forward Lu Qingxiang is energetic but lacks shooting power. Xiao Ziwen's footwork is good, but he lacks stamina, and Lei Shuping lacks experience. Therefore, although their coordination is considered tacit, due to the above shortcomings, they will inevitably be defeated. However, after a struggle, they will certainly not let White Horse win easily.

### South China

Organized by Xu Dongming, the team consists of Guangdong athletes and the northern athlete Xin Fuzhen. In terms of talent, they can be considered extremely strong. Figures like Liu Xianhan, Li Tiansheng, Xin Fuzhen, Sun Jinshun, Zheng Yingquan, and Liang Shutang are all well-known. Unfortunately, they have a very obvious weakness! That is, the forwards rarely score. Except for Sun Jinshun, the other generals, Zheng, Liang, Zhuang, etc., are not used to this. Otherwise, their achievements would be more than this. Today's performance against the Overseas Chinese Athletic Association (OCAA), with fierce clashes, may bring unexpected satisfaction.

### Overseas Chinese Athletic Association (OCAA)

The team's small-sided football performance last week against White Horse was highly praised, especially Mai Nidi's goalkeeping, which was lighter and faster than traditional football goalkeeping. He leaped like flying, and his quick saves made it seem like the ball was attracted to him by a magnet, which was most admirable. Now, the lineup has been adjusted again. Bao Jie has recovered from his illness and resolutely joins the team, adding another scoring talent to the forwards, and the performance should be even better. In conclusion, White Horse is more likely to win today's final, while the outcome of the exhibition match between South China and OCAA is difficult to predict.

### Genius Female Player of the Affinity Team, Wang Weizhen

After the women's basketball and volleyball league is over, it has once again become quiet. In the two leagues, I think Wang Weizhen of the Affinity Team is definitely the most successful one. Wang Miss should be credited most for the Affinity Team's championship wins. Miss Wang's strengths can be introduced during the passing season to prepare for next season. She plays as a defender in basketball, and her quick sprints and steady interceptions make it difficult for the opposing forwards to fly. In fact, Wang is not only a great defender, but if she were to try being a forward, her chest-out posture under the basket would not only be excellent but also exceptionally prepared. Unfortunately, the Affinity Team has many forwards but few defenders, which prevents her from fully displaying her talents.

In volleyball, Wang plays the most important position in the second row, both offensively and defensively. She can certainly do her best, not avoiding any situation when saving the ball, and not caring about falling or diving. Her measured ball reception is especially commendable. Her mind is clear in battle, and in extremely frightening situations, she can sometimes deliver a surprise attack.

Miss Wang works at the Asia Bank, and her conscientiousness has earned her a promotion to team leader, which shows her thoroughness in handling matters. Her skills are like her service spirit, and her humble attitude after victory is loved by fans.

Wang is simple and honest, a true genius female player and model female player. Miss Wang will surely have an even more wonderful performance in the next competition. This article is to praise her, and we will wait and see in the future. (Jing Duan)
