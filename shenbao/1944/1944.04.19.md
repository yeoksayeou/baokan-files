### Establishing a Civil Service System

We advocate for clearing up official corruption, propose examinations and personnel assessments, and further advocate for establishing a civil service system. To many, these may seem like overly critical views and impractical theories. However, these are things that should have been done long ago. Because they weren't done in peacetime, they have greatly impacted wartime efforts. If we are still complacent and not moving forward to implement these measures during wartime, then victory in the war is unattainable. This is the fundamental reason why we repeatedly, without fear of verbose language or taboo, offer candid and direct advice.

The civil service system is the merit system, the best crystallization of modern politics. Civil servants are the most fundamental part of the entire political system. All daily administrative affairs are executed by civil servants. After political leaders decide on major policies, they need not consult further and can entrust all execution to civil servants. Therefore, civil servants are the ones directly implementing government affairs, and they may be even more important to the people than political officials. The establishment of a civil service system aims to select outstanding talent to execute affairs, ensure their livelihood security, and solidify their positions. The key points are threefold: Civil service appointments must be based on examinations. Civil servants' livelihoods must be secure. Civil servants' tenure should not be affected by political tides. Requiring civil servants to pass examinations prevents anyone from using personal connections or placing their own party members in positions. Open competitive examinations can further select virtuous and talented individuals, giving those with ability and learning opportunities for self-advancement. Civil servants must pass strict examinations, and those who pass are undoubtedly outstanding individuals. Looking at China, the quality of public officials would at least improve.

To ensure civil servants are incorruptible, we must first secure their livelihoods. The saying "Only when clothing and food are sufficient will people know propriety and righteousness" is a universal truth. Civil servants are the ones who directly interact with the people. If they become corrupt due to financial insecurity, it is the ordinary people who suffer directly. However, the responsibility for "appointing the wrong people" should be borne by the government and cannot be shirked. We have already spoken extensively about the issue of securing public officials' livelihoods. Recently, regarding the livelihood of Shanghai's police officers, we further suggested that the government cannot immediately handle the problem so the people should do everything possible to assist first. For example, with the establishment of cooperatives, the people should do their best to provide loans to promote their success, and the government should first raise funds to repay the people. The police themselves should be very honest and serve the people. This is the model of "government-people cooperation."

Civil service is a lifelong career, so it should not be affected by political tides. Establishing a civil service system can break the "a new emperor, a new court" mentality, allowing outstanding talent to avoid scheming and currying favor, and instead use their own abilities, their own morality, and their own service performance as a lifelong guarantee. This point is even more important at a time when the tenure of current political officials is uncertain. It is natural for political officials to change with their own moral character, abilities, and the sentiments of the people. If civil servants also have uncertain tenure, the entire political system will inevitably be in chaos, and the people will suffer even more. Therefore, ensuring that civil servants are not swayed by political tides protects the lifelong service of outstanding civil servants.

For decades, most people in our China have focused on political affairs and rarely paid attention to administrative affairs. Some even consider administrative affairs to be the work of clerks and petty officials and disdain them. As for how to cultivate administrative talent and how to provide security, of course, there is no discussion. We must recognize that if a civil service system is not established, peacetime politics cannot get on the right track. Then, when dealing with wartime, compared to other countries, we will naturally "pale in comparison." We hope the government will pay close attention to this.

### Intense Attacks by Japanese and Indian Troops; Enemy Retreats North from Maungdaw; Increasing Numbers of Indian Soldiers on the Front Lines Defect to the National Army

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 18th – The fighting around the pass southwest of Maungdaw has intensified since midnight on the 14th until dawn on the 15th. The enemy forces, under intense attacks from various Japanese and Indian units, have abandoned their positions in the hilly areas southwest of Taung Bazar and have retreated from the first line of defense. They are now holding the second line of defense with armored vehicles as the main support, continuing to resist. On the other hand, at dawn on the 14th, the enemy forces launched a fierce and indiscriminate artillery bombardment against the Japanese army with heavy artillery and field guns, firing as many as 10,000 shells in one day and night. The Japanese army also responded with artillery fire towards the enemy positions, so the narrow Maungdaw line was filled with the intense sound of artillery fire from both sides. Furthermore, as the enemy forces retreated from the first line, they set fire to nearby villages to prevent the Japanese and Indian troops from pursuing. By midnight on the 15th, the enemy's heavy artillery positions finally succumbed to the Japanese army's intense attacks and began to move backwards. At dawn on the 16th, under the cover of aircraft, the remaining artillery and armored vehicle units fled north of Maungdaw. The Japanese and Indian troops, recognizing that the time had come, launched an attack on the already wavering enemy positions. As a result, Maungdaw, which the enemy had been stubbornly holding for several days, fell into the hands of the Japanese and Indian troops under their fierce attacks.

Central News Agency, Burmese Front Base, 18th – After the Japanese and Indian troops launched a general offensive in the Kaladan area, they defeated the British non-military forces and are now continuing towards the Paletwa Dam. It is now judged that the Japanese and Indian troops achieved the following results in the southern India-Burma border area from March 21st to April 10th: 1,200 enemy corpses were abandoned, 100 military horses were abandoned, 10 enemy tanks were captured or destroyed, 27 light armored vehicles, 111 trucks, 4 mortars, 1 cannon, 37 heavy and light machine guns, 34 automatic rifles, 322 rifles, 200 parachutes, 11 boats, 1 barrack, and a large amount of other grain, clothing, and ammunition were captured.

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 18th – The Indian National Army units are advancing together with the Japanese army, causing the enemy forces to be in a state of being unable to resist. Therefore, they are taking extremely defensive measures against the activities of the Indian National Army. That is, the enemy forces defending Imphal are forced to change the traditional policy of the British army insisting on the first line being composed of Indian troops and instead implement a new deployment of Gurkha troops in the first line, British troops in the second line, and Indian troops in the third line. However, the Indian troops within the British and Indian armies are showing signs of wavering, the morale of the entire army is low, the command system is in disarray, and the number of those joining the National Army is increasing daily. On the morning of the 14th, Lieutenant K and 32 Indian soldiers from the enemy forces at the Mopaung Heights, unable to bear the pressure from the British, requested to join the National Army camp from the Japanese army front-line units. From this, one can glimpse the chaotic situation within the enemy camp.

### Intense Anti-British Movement; Chaotic Situation in India; Congress Party Initiates Active Campaign

Central News Agency, Bangkok, 18th – Since the Japanese-Indian Allied Forces entered Manipur with a sweeping momentum, Indian politics have been greatly affected. Recently, the anti-British movement, centered on the Congress Party, the Central Committee, and the Muslim League, has become increasingly active. Therefore, India is currently in an unprecedented state of great chaos. The activities of the Congress Party's underground organizations in the eastern and northwestern regions are becoming increasingly active. Railway stations in Assam and Bengal are plastered with slogans such as "Welcome the Independence Army," "Expel the British," and "Down with [unclear]" These forces of the Congress Party have already permeated all railway employees. In addition, the Congress Party is advocating a no-tax movement and organizing strikes and slowdowns to the United Nations. Although the British-Indian authorities have now restricted the movement of Indians and deployed secret police to suppress the people, and have established a security committee in the Bengal Provincial Government to forcibly suppress them, Indian officials in eastern Assam and Bengal Province, believing that the opportune time to achieve independence has arrived, are abandoning their posts and joining underground activities. Furthermore, the Muslim League, which has a reputation for being an Indian independence movement, and a part of Palestine, has recently been the first to demand the independence of Assam and Bengal. As a result, the Red Shirt Party, which is now said to stand on the same position as the Congress Party, has launched an active campaign in recent weeks. The rioting people of Waziristan (southern part of the Northwest Frontier Province) have recently been attacking police stations everywhere. Although the authorities have dispatched a large number of troops and police to suppress them, the result has been to add fuel to the fire, and the incidents of rioting are becoming increasingly intense. Furthermore, according to a broadcast from Delhi Radio on the 8th, all factories in Madurai, southern India, have had to stop work due to worker strikes, which shows that the scope of the strike wave is quite extensive. Reflecting this situation, the Bombay factory, which represents the interests of western capitalists, demanded reorganization. The Bombay Municipal Council elected Mr. Narendra, a Congress Party member currently in prison, as mayor on the 10th, from which one can also see a glimpse of the fierce political struggle launched by the Indian people against the British-Indian authorities.

### Japanese Aircraft Attack the Marshall Islands; Bomb Enemy Base

### Germany Fully Prepared for Changes in the War Situation; Strong Coastal Defenses in the Netherlands

Central News Agency, Berlin, 18th – A German News Agency reporter reported on the 17th that the German military authorities' contingency response system in the midst of complex war situations is as follows: At the beginning of this week, various changes occurred on the Eastern Front, but it seems that there will be no fierce battles in the next few days. The Axis powers' preparations for invading Europe are still progressing diligently. Their attack plan seems to be gradually getting ready, and the German military authorities also have comprehensive countermeasures. According to the German military authorities, the German troops on the Eastern Front are calmly preparing for combat before receiving orders to launch a large-scale attack. The results of the changes on the Eastern Front are already in the German High Command's plan. The "delaying tactics" adopted by the German army are implemented after careful review by the German High Command. The temporary success of the Soviet army should not be underestimated, but when they reach a certain point, the German army will take decisive measures to inflict heavy damage. The military situation in the southwestern corner of the Crimean Peninsula should be observed in the context of the overall military situation.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 18th – According to the Maritime News Agency, military reporter Klaus, after inspecting the defenses of Western Europe, expressed his impressions, saying that if the enemy wants to attack Europe at the mouths of the Scheldt, Maas, and Rhine rivers, they must first occupy important towns, which are all fortified. In addition, waterlogged areas have been designated to protect fortresses. Even if the enemy air drops troops into the interior, they will not have freedom of movement. If enemy troops invade the mouths of the Rhine, Maas, or Scheldt rivers, the land there can be immediately flooded, making it impossible to establish bridgeheads. The German army has conducted regular exercises using various methods to test whether the waterlogged areas are beneficial to the enemy.

### France to Become a Battlefield Again; The Date is Not Far Off; Laval Warns the People

Central News Agency, Paris, 18th – According to the Maritime News Agency, the French "Le Matin" published this morning an address by Laval to senior officials in the Lyon region. Laval mentioned the possibility of an Allied landing in Western Europe. It is said that the date for France to become a battlefield again may not be far off. He hopes the people understand the government's intentions. In the event that the Allies and the German army open fire in France, the government will take measures to help the people in the gun-filled and bullet-riddled areas escape danger. Ultimately, when the Allies land, will it be the Vichy government or the Algiers government that protects the lives of the French people? Gentlemen, wait and see what happens.

### After German Troops Entered Hungary, the Military and Political Situation in the Balkans Changed

Since Soviet troops have been advancing towards the Romanian and Hungarian borders, the situation on the northeastern border of the Balkan Peninsula has become increasingly urgent, reaching its peak. The movement of the Southeastern European front is now being closely watched by all of Europe. How long and where will the Soviet advance continue? What is Germany's counter strategy? The following is a comprehensive review of various situations.

A panoramic view of the 1,000-kilometer Iron and Blood Front The current front line, the southernmost wing of the German Southern War Zone, extends from the west of Nikolaev to Belloya Mask, a length of 250 kilometers. The central war zone starts from the Belloya Mask area, turns west, crosses the Dniester River from the Barda area, and then leads to Balki in Bessarabia Province, Romania. Then, along the Prut River, it passes through Chernivtsi, Kolomyia, and Stanislaviv areas to the Danupoli area, winding for 500 kilometers. The left wing extends from Danupoli to Kovel, a length of 300 kilometers.

From Nikolaev to the Barda area, the Soviet forces are Molinovsky's 3rd Ukrainian Front; the central part is Konev's 2nd Ukrainian Front; and north of the North Bukovina area is Chekhov's 1st Ukrainian Front, each attacking forward.

However, among these three front lines, the middle zone of the Dniester and Bug rivers in the central war zone is the most important. The battle in this area is highly mobile. The Soviet army has already captured Balki and reached the Prut River, and part of it has crossed the river to attack the Romanian plains, launching a major battle with the German army.

At the same time, the German army has declared its abandonment of Chernivtsi, a key point in North Bukovina, and the key areas of Kolomyia and Stanislaviv at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains are also in fierce fighting. Kolomyia is the intersection of the four trunk lines connecting Stupek, Danupoli, Chernivtsi, and Budapest, and is militarily very important.

Soviet Attack Objectives The objectives of the Soviet army's large-scale offensive are threefold in the military aspect: Conquer the Romanian oil field area Surround the German army on the Ukrainian front. Use this to shake the defensive strength of the German army on the entire Eastern Front and seize the German army's resistance strength.

However, no matter how strong the Soviet army's strength is, it cannot sweep the entire Balkans. Therefore, the Soviet army's military offensive is more likely to achieve political effects, with greater expectations, that is, to carry out red political work when the Soviet army approaches the Balkan countries. It is a well-known fact that the Soviet Union has continued to launch political offensives throughout Europe since last year, not allowing the United States and Britain to stand in the way. Recently, contact with the Balkans has become more active. The use of Czech fugitive politician Benes, direct military assistance to the Kitte Barticoun regime in the former Yugoslavia, the use of Bulgaria in neutral relations, the strengthening of the Soviet embassy military attaché in Bulgaria, the strengthening of cultural propaganda activities, and the arrival of the former "Third International" chairman Dmitrov in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, all prove its strategy.

Recently, Soviet newspapers discussed Balkan policy, advocating that Serbia, Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania, Macedonia, Greece, etc., should be united to form a Balkan Federation and establish a pro-Soviet People's Government. The Soviet Union's attempt is already clear.

German Blitz Countermeasures Since the German army entered Hungary with lightning speed to deal with the major situation, the military and political situation in the entire Balkan region has undergone epoch-making changes due to the rapid strengthening. The deployment of new German troops in the Carpathians, Bulgaria and Romania's further active cooperation with Germany, and the smooth and secure connection of Balkan cross-border railways, roads, and rivers, etc., extend several strong "lines" from the German mainland, becoming iron bars holding the Balkans.

The German army took decisive military measures to ensure the Balkans, and at the same time, it did not neglect the extremely important fact of the political impact on the entire Balkan region. In this sense, stationing some German troops in Hungary in order to save reserve forces when Britain and the United States open up a second front can achieve full effect.

As for Romania, especially Bessarabia, which is under direct threat, it has further cooperated with Germany. In terms of internal affairs, under the rule of General Antonescu, it is firmly united. Since the German army entered Hungary, the Balkisson of Chette has been resolutely swept away, so the status of the State of Croatia has been further strengthened.

At present, the only foothold for Soviet political activities in the Balkans is Bulgaria. The pro-Soviet faction and the illegal Communist Party in the country have been very active recently, but the current regents and government firmly support the Axis policy, and the pro-Soviet elements' activities are not enough to become a major political problem. Bulgaria has good relations with Turkey. No matter how the anti-Axis side instigates, the two countries will never participate in the war. After Britain and the United States recently carried out terrorist air raids on the capital of Bulgaria, it aroused the people of the country to be extremely indignant and curse Britain and the United States.

Therefore, Germany's future countermeasures for the second front will be to step up the reinforcement of troops in that area. At least, relying on the current front line, it is not impossible to counterattack the Soviet army and cause it to collapse. Therefore, the previous passive combat will come to an end at this point. On the one hand, it is steadily advancing the strengthening work inside the Balkans. The Balkans, which have become an important supply depot for the European Axis, cannot allow the Soviet Union to disrupt the current military and political situation.

### Personnel of Various Countries’ Embassies and Consulates - Britain Forbids Departure - The US Government Also Adopts Similar Measures

Geneva, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a dispatch from London: The British Foreign Office issued a public notice today stating that, effective from midnight tonight, diplomats and consular officials of all countries are forbidden from leaving British territory, and the diplomatic pouches of the heads of missions of all countries must also be subject to inspection. The United States, the Soviet Union, and the self-governing dominions (excluding Ireland) are not subject to this restriction. The full text of the notice is as follows: "This Government has notified the diplomatic representatives of all countries stationed in Britain that, from midnight on April 17th to 18th until further notice, the following prohibitions will be implemented: Diplomatic representatives may not send or receive coded telegrams in British territory. Diplomatic pouches may not be delivered without inspection, nor may official pouches be received after the aforementioned date without inspection. Official liaison officers, diplomatic and consular personnel, and their official and private staff may not leave the country." The notice continued, stating that "In view of the unprecedented military operations to be launched this year, any leakage of information sufficient to aid the enemy, or to subject the lives of our country and its allies to unnecessary loss, would not only seriously prejudice these military operations but also seriously damage the relations between our country and any relevant countries. We are therefore compelled to take these extraordinary security measures. These restrictions, subject to conditions commensurate with security measures, will be lifted as soon as possible and, to the extent possible, communication between diplomatic and consular personnel of various countries and our government will be facilitated as much as possible."

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The US government has acted in concert with the British government, imposing similar restrictions on foreign diplomats. Since midnight yesterday, these diplomats are not allowed to transmit or receive any diplomatic pouches without inspection, nor are they allowed to dispatch staff or send family members to the United States. It is reported that the severity of this restriction on diplomatic personnel is unprecedented.

### Cotton Association etc. Prepare to Form Cotton Production Increase Committee - Agreement on Concrete Measures to Increase Cotton Production

In order to increase cotton production in Central China, revive industry and promote prosperity, relevant authorities, including the Cotton Control Committee, the Central China Cotton Production Improvement Association, the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Yarn Factory Industry Association, and the Jiangbei Comprehensive Research Institute, have jointly formed the Cotton Production Increase Agreement Committee to promote cotton production in Central China.

### Residence Permits Can Be Renewed Without Photos - Explanation of Renewal Method by the Head of the Baojia Office

The Baojia Office of the First Police Bureau has already formulated and announced the measures for renewing residence permits. However, some Baojia sections of some sub-bureaus often demand photos or require personal seals when residents apply for renewal, creating difficulties. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency made a special visit to the head of the Baojia Office, Mr. 　　Wu, 　　who explained as follows: "Our Bureau has made every effort to save materials in the renewal method, so the issue of photos has been carefully considered. It has been decided that those who have already obtained a citizen permit from the sub-bureau are allowed to be exempted from submitting photos, except for those whose photos are damaged or unclear. They can use the photos left with the sub-bureau when applying for the citizen permit. Although the processing procedures are somewhat troublesome, public officials must serve the people as a principle and think of the people. This point has already been announced, so we regret the difficulties caused by the Baojia sections of the sub-bureaus and will order them to follow the rules."

Seal Not Required

"Also, although the application form has the words 'seal' under the applicant's name, the filling instructions state that 'the application must be signed and sealed by the head of the household and the head of the Jia to be valid.' Therefore, those who do not have a personal seal do not need to affix a seal, and fingerprints have already been affixed. All the heads of the Jia and households have seals, but not all residents have them, so those who have seals should affix them, and those who do not have seals can be exempted. This is also a point of saving materials and simplifying procedures. Our office will order the Baojia sections of the sub-bureaus to follow the rules to facilitate the people."

### Preparatory Meeting for the Chamber of Commerce Association Representative Assembly to be Held Today

### 67th Period Household Rice - Rice Shops Can Pick Up Rice Today - The City's Food Supply is Still Abundant

The allocation of household rice has been slightly delayed due to the transfer of the Director of the Food Bureau and the handover. According to reporters, Shanghai's food supply is still abundant. The 67th period household rice, each rice shop has paid the money to the Material Procurement and Allocation Section yesterday to exchange for the warehouse receipt, and can pick up rice from Zhejiang Xingye, Taikoo, China and other warehouses today. It can be sold in the near future, so the unreasonable rise in the black market price of rice can be brought under control.

The Baojia commemorative tickets for airplane contributions are distributed by the committee to the district offices, which are then distributed to each household by the Baojia heads, who are responsible for publicizing and encouraging each household to purchase them voluntarily in order to prevent abuses.

After receiving the commemorative tickets, each Baojia head must consider the economic situation of each household and encourage them to purchase ten-yuan or five-yuan tickets. If any household has any questions, the Baojia head should explain and guide them at any time.

The amount of tickets purchased by each household should be voluntarily sent by each household to the district office to which they belong for collection. The district office should stamp the ticket after receiving the money from each household and quickly transfer it to the bank designated by the committee.

Baojia heads must not force households that cannot afford to purchase tickets, but the tickets issued must be returned to the distributing agency.

These measures will be implemented after being approved by the municipal government.

### Impersonating Investigators to Extort Business Firms - The Economic Department of the First District Strictly Prohibits

The price of goods in the city has fluctuated at the end of the year and the beginning of the year, which is a serious harm to the people's livelihood. After the economic and administrative authorities of the city sent personnel to investigate and strictly enforce, the price of goods has gradually stabilized. However, recently, unscrupulous people have taken the opportunity to impersonate investigators to defraud and extort money. The reporter made a special visit to the Economic Department of the First District Office to inquire, and Director Feng received and expressed the following opinions:

"Recently, there have been people who have falsely borrowed the name of investigators to defraud and extort money from various business firms, which is very hateful. I have repeatedly received reports from various reports, and after detailed investigation, the defrauded business firms cannot clearly identify which agency's investigators they are, which I deeply regret. Although there is more than one agency in the city that manages materials and prices, the investigators sent by our office have been strictly regulated in the investigation procedures. Each investigator carries an investigation form and a dispatch form. The dispatch form specifies the names of the business firms to be investigated and the time of the investigation. After the investigation is completed, the dispatch form should be handed over to the person in charge of the investigated business firm for seal verification and brought back to the reporting office, and the head of the competent section will collect the investigation certificates and attendance forms of each investigator on the same day to prevent abuses. This procedure can be said to be tightly knit. Now, there are often cases of investigators extorting money outside, which should be unscrupulous people borrowing names. We hope that when there are investigators going to investigate in the future, each business firm must ask to see the investigator's investigation certificate and dispatch form. If the incoming person claims to be an investigator from our office verbally without showing various certificates, they can call 17200 to inquire with our office and severely punish them. Also, the Economic Security Department has announced its establishment, but before the department has officially started working, our office's investigation work will still continue according to the original policy."

### Chambers of Commerce Should Transfer Materials - Strive for Fairness - Strictly Prohibit Resale for Profit, Otherwise They Will Be Prosecuted

Recently, in order to simplify the procedures, various unified allocation authorities have authorized the chambers of commerce of each industry to transfer the materials allocated to them to their member companies. It is learned that the chambers of commerce must strive for fairness when transferring the materials allocated by the authorities and must not favor one over the other or have ulterior motives. Chamber of commerce members who obtain these materials must limit themselves to using them for their own purposes if they are raw materials and must not resell them for profit. If they are manufactured products, they should be sold at the market price and strictly prohibit hoarding and speculation. Chambers of commerce should send personnel to investigate at any time. Once illegal incidents occur, the persons in charge of the chambers of commerce will be punished. It is reported that a few chambers of commerce have charged illegal handling fees from member companies when transferring materials, which is illegal and increases the burden on member companies. However, if chambers of commerce want to charge this fee, they should apply to the authorities for approval in advance.

### High Standing Supervision Committees in Various Industry Markets

Recently, various industry markets in the city have found that members in the market often fail to abide by the rules in transactions, or even non-industry people mix into the market to engage in black market transactions. This situation has a great impact on prices. In order to thoroughly clarify the order in the market, the various industry markets have separately established supervision committees. The directors and supervisors of the chamber of commerce are ex officio members and take turns to station themselves in the market to supervise everything. At the same time, in order to restrict people from entering the market, each market specially stipulates that members must wear badges, otherwise they will be driven out of the market.

### The Current Urgent Task for China and Japan is to Strengthen Economic Relations - Matsudaira Department Issues Statement

Due to the appointment of Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the new Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, all parties deeply expect that the economic relationship between China and Japan under the decisive battle will be further promoted. Matsudaira, the Minister of Information of the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office, met with foreign reporters at the Huizhong Hotel at 5 pm yesterday. In his speech, he strongly stated that it is an urgent task to closely strengthen the economic relationship between China and Japan.

Great Expectations Minister Matsudaira said: Mr. Ogura, the Economic Advisor to the National Government, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the 17th, one day later than the scheduled date. He issued a statement on the day of his appointment, saying: "If China and Japan want to talk about economic cooperation, they must first seek to integrate the ideas of economic people in your country. In other words, not only should economic people in China have a deep understanding of Japan's national conditions, military power, economic power, and science and technology, but also Japan should deeply understand the actual situation of Chinese culture and economy, as well as the traditional habits of the people. This is what I think is most important." Last summer, Mr. Ogura came to China as the head of the Economic Observation Group and led representatives of the economic community to have cordial talks with economic people in China in Shanghai, and exchanged views frankly with officials of the National Government in Nanjing. Therefore, he has already understood the economic situation in China. Not only is Japan needless to say, but also China has great expectations for Mr. Ogura.

Join Hands In the past year when I came to China, I had the opportunity to ask Mr. Ogura, the head of the Economic Observation Group, and his members for their opinions in Nanjing. Today, I can still remember in my mind that a group of people stated the following views, which roughly stated: In the past, Japanese industrialists did not have enough activities in China. Why? Because economic activities in China, except for the textile industry, mainly revolved around trade and its affiliated financial shipping industry. However, due to the unstable political situation in China, such as the anti-Japanese wave before the incident, Japanese industrialists had panic and were hesitant to invest, and even withdrew their investments. However, the situation has changed today. The first-class industrialists in China are willing to join hands with Japanese industrialists, so Japanese industrialists also hope to cooperate with powerful industrialists in China.

Common Front Before the incident, as mentioned above, China and Japan were in constant conflict everywhere, and even economically they were going in opposite directions. However, now China and Japan have reached the fate of having to cooperate and be consistent. The stereotype that "China is an agricultural country and Japan is an industrial country" has also been eliminated. Both sides are in a relationship of complementing each other's strengths and communicating with each other's needs, and become comrades in arms on the common front, maintaining a relationship of living and dying together.

Determination to Aid China Since last year, Japan has implemented various new policies. In terms of economic relations, such as the abolition of military tickets, the relaxation of restrictions on the movement of materials, and the adjustment of joint-venture companies, mutual assistance will be provided in case of economic difficulties. Previously, the Japanese government stated its determination to aid Chinese currency from beginning to end, which was also a measure based on the above relationship. This can further clarify that the economic policies of the two countries are consistent. This time, we welcome the new advisor under this firm and immovable policy. A few days ago, we heard the opinions of the economic community in China, who longed to first normalize the economy of Shanghai, especially to revitalize various industries, but we also have the same hope.
