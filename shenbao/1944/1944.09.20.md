### Discussion of the European Situation

Q: Recently, there has been general concern for Germany regarding the development of the European war situation. However, observing the current state of the war, is the strategy advantageous or disadvantageous for Germany?

A: From a local perspective, Germany is certainly at a slight disadvantage. However, from a general tactical perspective, it may not be disadvantageous. First, the goal of the anti-Axis powers in their war against Germany is to use their abundant human and material resources to deplete Germany's strength. However, Germany, in order to counter this tactic of the anti-Axis forces, has been carrying out planned retreats on the Eastern Front, the Northern France Front, and the Italian Balkan Front, avoiding unnecessary sacrifices to preserve manpower and resources. Therefore, in this respect, the anti-Axis powers' strategy has failed. Second, after Germany has carried out planned retreats in various locations, its outer defense lines can be shortened by more than one-third, concentrating forces on the inner defense lines. At the same time, it can increase the number of troops in the country by two million and distribute them to various fronts, further strengthening the inner defense lines. Conversely, for the anti-Axis forces, not only is it inconvenient to operate due to the excessive length of the front lines, but they also experience extreme difficulties in communication and transportation. Third, the lengthening of the anti-Axis front lines and the shortening of the German front lines are enough to prove the advantageous conditions for both sides. It is indeed difficult for the anti-Axis forces to attack German troops under disadvantageous circumstances. Furthermore, during the months of September and October, the North Sea area is in the midst of heavy fog, which diminishes the effectiveness of the air force. Therefore, British and American troops encounter difficult conditions in terms of military affairs, geography, and the weather, creating a dilemma.

Q: Then, besides military factors, what other elements determine victory or defeat?

A: Those are nothing more than international relations, domestic political leadership, and the national spirit.

Q: May I ask if the current international situation in Europe is advantageous for Germany?

A: Germany's position in Europe is advantageously situated as a third party between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union. The relationship between the Soviet Union and Britain and America, whether in military, political, or economic terms, is fraught with endless contradictions, which is generally recognized by all countries in the world. And the more the war progresses, the more clearly the contradictions between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union are exposed. First, let's not discuss the fundamental contradiction between British and American capitalism and Soviet socialism. Even in terms of the purpose of this war, the war aims of Britain and America and the war aims of the Soviet Union are fundamentally different. The war between Britain and Germany came before the war between Germany and the Soviet Union. At the time of the war between Britain and Germany, the Soviet Union and Germany still maintained a non-aggression treaty relationship, and later added economic and other treaties. This proves that initially the Soviet Union had no intention of joining forces with Britain and America. When the German-Soviet war broke out, Britain and America applauded from the sidelines, hoping that Germany and the Soviet Union would destroy each other. This is further clear evidence that Britain and America did not want the Soviet Union to rise. Today, Britain, America, and the Soviet Union are able to stand on a common front, but this is only an accidental alignment. Since it is accidental, there is no reason why the war aims of both sides should be the same. Second, in the German-Soviet war, the Soviet Union has always maintained its own independent and detached character, often giving Britain and America a sudden blow. This is not only the case in military matters, but also in other political issues. Examples such as the Polish issue, Yugoslavia, and the Italian issue are too numerous to mention. Third, whether before, during, or after the war, Britain and America, for their own interests, cannot lack a land power in continental Europe. However, France is not up to the task, and only Germany can do it. Therefore, in the future, continental Europe will definitely not lack Germany as a country. Because of these various reasons, although Britain, America, and the Soviet Union are all at war with Germany, in reality, Britain and America want to use German power to deal with the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union wants to use German power to restrain Britain and America. In the end, the one that benefits the most is Germany. Therefore, we believe that Germany has the most advantageous position of independence and autonomy in the complex international relations of Europe.

Q: As for domestic political leadership and national spirit, how is Germany doing?

A: Although Germany experienced an assassination attempt against President Hitler a month ago, after this incident, all shameless politicians and military and political traitors in Germany were completely purged, so the unity within the country has been strengthened even more than before. As for the vigorous national spirit of the German people, and the exhaustive demonstration of the tenacity of the German nation, it is enough to determine the trend of the war. France lacked a strong spirit, so Germany conquered it and signed a treaty of surrender within a few weeks. And today's German people, with their vigorous national consciousness and national spirit, will be able to overcome the current difficulties and crises. At the same time, since the First World War, the German people have tasted the painful lessons of the Treaty of Versailles for decades, and deeply know that they must not repeat the mistakes of the treaty of the First World War. Therefore, they will definitely not choose any other path besides fighting to the end. Because the German people deeply recognize that if Germany does not achieve final victory, it will never be able to stand in the world of tomorrow.

### The China News Association, Entrusted with the Important Task of Ideological Warfare, is Ready for Organization and Will be Established in Shanghai on the 25th

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency): The world war has now entered the final decisive stage, and the success or failure of the construction of the new world is also facing a decisive period. Therefore, all warring countries are exerting all their efforts to seize this final opportunity and strive for victory. Recognizing the evolution of the Greater East Asia War, our country, from top to bottom, feels the need to expand mobilization and enhance cooperation. Recently, colleagues in the national press, feeling the importance of the ideological decisive battle under the general war effort, are eager to unite the national press based on the basic outline of the wartime cultural propaganda policy, so as to mobilize the total strength of the whole body to assume the mission of reporting and serving the country. After two months of running and planning by all relevant parties, this matter has been largely completed, and has been submitted to the Propaganda Department and then to the Executive Yuan, which decided to formally approve the organization of the China News Association as a major organization in the Chinese press. From the position of the whole body, it seeks to concentrate the power of the Chinese press itself, so as to achieve the mission of national news. It is now learned that the association has set the date for the grand inaugural meeting on the 25th of this month at the Bund Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association in Shanghai. All parties in the country have deep expectations for this.

### Strengthen Cooperation

Since our country declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9 last year, the National Government authorities have begun to prepare the wartime system in various departments in order to strengthen cooperative warfare. In terms of cultural propaganda, the Supreme National Defense Council passed the basic outline of the wartime cultural propaganda policy on June 10 last year as the highest guideline for ideological warfare, so as to mobilize the total strength of cultural propaganda to assume the task of cultural warfare and ideological warfare in the Greater East Asia War. Since the promulgation of this outline, the organization of our country's cultural propaganda circles has gradually become more concrete, especially the press has paid special attention to giving full play to the public character, so as to enhance strength and become a major main force under the general war effort. The establishment of the News Association this time is a manifestation of the further strengthening of unity and concentration of total strength in the Chinese press. It not only has the great significance of concentrating the strength of the national press under the current war situation to launch an ideological decisive battle, but also, in terms of the history of our country's press, this major organization that unites the national press is also a landmark page. It has swept away the newspaper characteristics of the past liberal era, and its significance for the public development of the Chinese press in the future is also extremely important. Moreover, the member newspaper companies of the China News Association this time include the entire peaceful region, and there are also Japanese newspaper companies in China participating, so it is truly an unprecedented major unity of Chinese press people and allied newspaper people in China. In order to cooperate with the unity of the press, the Propaganda Department has spared no effort in promoting the organization of the News Association. It specially appointed Guo Xiufeng, Xu Liqiu, Chen Bin, Osaka Yoichi, Jin Xiongbo, Qin Mo, and Wu Linzhi, seven influential figures in the press, as preparatory committee members in July of this year, and held a preparatory meeting at the Hua Mao Hotel in Shanghai at 10:00 a.m. on August 5. At the meeting, Minister Lin reported the significance of establishing the China News Association. At 11:00 a.m., Guo assumed the role of temporary chairman and formally convened the first preparatory meeting to begin preparation work. Then, at 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon, the second preparatory meeting was convened. By this point, all necessary preparations had been basically completed smoothly. The member newspaper companies have also been reviewed and approved by the Propaganda Department and the Preparatory Committee. It is expected that after the establishment of the association, the member newspapers of the association in various parts of the country will, under the leadership of the association, embrace the same goal and the same belief, and devote their full strength to publicizing national policies and communicating public opinion, so as to assume the great task of ideological warfare under the decisive battle.

### Fierce Battles on Peleliu and Other Islands: Japanese Troops Launch Offensive, Sinking More Than Sixty Enemy Ships and Vessels

Pacific Base, 19th (Central News Agency): Fierce air battles between Japanese and American forces are taking place on Peleliu and Angaur Islands in the Palau Islands, and on Morotai Island in the Moluccas Islands. Under the cover of powerful mobile units and the air force from the New Guinea base, enemy forces are constantly increasing their strength and launching offensives against the Japanese forces in that area. The resistance of the Japanese troops is extremely fierce. According to a broadcast from San Francisco radio station on the morning of the 17th, the American troops on Peleliu Island encountered stubborn resistance from the Japanese troops and could not progress as expected. The Japanese troops launched three fierce counterattacks in one day. The war situation in various areas is recorded as follows: ○ Peleliu Island: Enemy landing forces, under the cover of fleets, heavy artillery, and aircraft, are adding new troops in an attempt to open up the war situation. The Japanese army's counterattack lasted for 24 hours, and the entire landing force made no progress, remaining near the southern end of the island. Since the enemy began air raids on the 12th, the Japanese army has sunk one enemy cruiser, destroyer, submarine, and minesweeper each around the island, as well as more than sixty landing craft, and destroyed more than one hundred and fifty enemy tanks and shot down twenty-six enemy aircraft (five of which are unconfirmed), and destroyed up to seven. All 150 tanks that the enemy first landed on the 15th were destroyed, suffering heavy damage. ○ Angaur: When the enemy attacked Peleliu Island on the 12th, they also shelled and air-raided the island at the same time in an attempt to suppress the Japanese positions. On the morning of the 14th, they used multiple boats to scout landing points on the eastern coast, and their landing attempt was very obvious. The Japanese troops on the island were prepared. At around 9:00 a.m. on the 17th, the enemy forces began landing under the cover of artillery fire and air raids. The Japanese army fought back bravely, causing the enemy to suffer the same damage as on Peleliu Island. ○ Morotai Island: Enemy forces landed at the southern end of the island and gradually built up the landing point. It now seems that they have begun to build an airfield. The Japanese troops on the island are doing their best to carry out counterattacks to prevent the enemy's progress in construction work. Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency): According to a report from the South Pacific base, the Japanese troops on Peleliu Island, from the garrison commander down to the officers and soldiers, are still alive and well, and are fiercely counterattacking the landing enemy forces, causing the enemy forces to fall into a state of confusion. On the evening of the 15th, in the southwestern area of the island, the Japanese tank team and the infantry unit cooperated to launch a fierce attack on the enemy forces occupying the airfield, causing the enemy's position to waver. At the same time, the artillery unit also attacked with machine guns and artillery at the right moment, causing great damage to the enemy, especially in the northwest area, the enemy's confusion was even more obvious. In the operations on the 17th, the Japanese troops concentrated their combat power on the enemy tank units, and all the enemy tanks were destroyed. Although the connection of the Japanese troops in the southern part of the island was sometimes cut off, the Japanese flag could still be seen flying, and the battle is still continuing. South Pacific Japanese Army Its Base, 19th (Central News Agency): The enemy forces shelled Angaur Island with naval gunfire on the morning of the 17th, and at the same time dispatched more than thirty landing craft waiting behind the ships. The heavy artillery positions of the Japanese garrison on the island gave the first batch of enemy landing craft a great blow, causing them to collapse. Although the enemy forces were attacked by fierce Japanese artillery fire, they finally landed on the east coast of the island at 9:00 a.m. The Japanese garrison bravely fought back, launching fierce attacks and repeated night raids. A considerable number of enemy troops landed on that day from morning to dusk. It is reported that they have 2,000 tanks. South Pacific Base, 19th (Central News Agency): On the 16th, about 150 enemy small aircraft attacked Halmahera Island, and the local Japanese troops shot down and destroyed 20 of them. In addition, around the same time, one enemy torpedo boat entered Anwan on the island and has been sunk by Japanese land artillery fire.

### Japanese Troops Advance West along the West River, Approaching Wuzhou and Zhaoqing, Shooting Down Two American Planes in the North

China Base, 18th (Central News Agency): According to reports from the Japanese reconnaissance aircraft team, the Japanese army is advancing westward along the Nanjiang River. Part of it has broken through the provincial border and is directly approaching Wuzhou, the front-line base of the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing in South China. This time, the Japanese army has broken through the steep mountainous area along the West River and launched a rapid attack. Part of it captured Huaiji in Guangxi Province and passed through the south of Xindu (80 kilometers west of Maoji), and on the morning of the 17th, it directly approached a point 30 kilometers northeast of Wuzhou. China Base, 18th (Central News Agency): On the morning and evening of the 17th, the Japanese dive bomber team bombed about 600 Chongqing troops who were collapsing in the mountainous area northwest of Zhaoqing along the West River again. In addition, the Japanese Point Gate team engaged in an interception battle with nine Chongqing and American P-51 aircraft that attacked the vicinity of the Japanese battlefield twice in the morning and afternoon of the 18th. As a result, two of them were shot down in the sky 90 kilometers north of Zhaoqing, and the Japanese side suffered no losses.

### West River Shaoguan Contact Cut Off

Japanese Army Front Line, 19th (Central News Agency): After the Japanese South China Army broke into Zhaoqing, the Chongqing Army fell into an irreparable state of confusion. Since this summer, the Chongqing Army miscalculated that the Japanese army intended to open up the Yuehan Line, so it dispatched the main force of the 37th Army Group in the West River Basin area to the north and deployed it on the Yingde Lianjiangkou front line to defend Shaoguan. However, the Japanese army unexpectedly attacked the weak West River Basin area starting from the 9th. Although the Chongqing Army tried to stop the Japanese army from advancing in the Zhaoqing area, the Japanese army urgently cooperated with the naval units advancing along the West River from the east, south, and north sides, and deployed a siege position, and actively advanced, and occupied the key points of Sihui, Gaoming, and Kaiping in an instant. In the evening of the 16th, it annihilated about 10,000 Chongqing troops from the 35th Army Group, broke into Zhaoqing, and at the same time used a strong force to quickly retreat to Deqing, and annihilated the Chongqing troops who were in a state of confusion in the Fengchuan area. Zhaoqing is the forward strategic stronghold of Guangxi Province along the West River. Therefore, after the Japanese army conquered it, in fact, the north and south armies of the Chongqing army in the West River basin were under the control of the Japanese army. The Chongqing army took Deqing and Fengchuan as its vanguard, connecting Wuzhou, and formed a front line, trying to prevent the Japanese army from advancing westward, and desperately defended it. However, due to the Japanese army's control of the north bank of the West River, its connection with Shaoguan was completely cut off. Therefore, about two divisions of the 35th Army Group of the Chongqing army completely lost their fighting spirit and fell into a state of collapse.

### Xiangyue Japanese Army Distance Gradually Approaching

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency): According to a report from the United News Agency's visiting reporter, the distance between the north and south attacking forces of the Japanese army advancing deep into Guangxi from Hunan and Guangdong provinces is now approaching moment by moment. The gap left by the Japanese army to complete the purpose of cutting off the Chinese mainland is currently only 70 kilometers. This gap is the gap between Yongming (east of Guilin) and Huaiji (more than 30 kilometers northwest of Guangzhou). The aviation base painstakingly managed by the American army in the Guilin area has been destroyed, and the left wing of the Japanese army can reach Yongming. Other Japanese troops can break through the border of Guangxi Province from Guangdong and occupy Huaiji. Once a 70-kilometer gap is opened, the Japanese army will be able to secure the traffic route from southern Manchuria to the South China Sea, and the direct railway from Tokyo to Zhaonan Island planned by Japan can also be successful. For this plan, it is necessary to take the Xianggui Railway as the end point and capture Liuzhou. Secondly, it will establish contact with the Japanese army stationed in Annam. In order to achieve this goal, the Japanese army needs to overcome a distance of 550 kilometers.

### Battle of Guilin is About to Begin

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency): According to a Reuters report from Chongqing on the 18th, the war situation in Guangxi Province and the movements of the Chongqing army on the Guilin offensive and defensive front line are as follows: The Japanese armored forces are advancing fiercely towards Guilin from the Guangxi Plain, but their vanguard has not yet approached the main force of the Chongqing army defending Guilin. In order to cope with this great battle, the Chongqing army has completed the evacuation of the citizens of Guilin. As for the outcome of the battle, it cannot be predicted today. The equipment of the Japanese army is particularly excellent. At the beginning of the attack, it will definitely cover with artillery fire, tanks, and aircraft. However, the Chongqing army also has favorable conditions, that is, the Japanese army's supply line has now been extended to the roads in Guangxi Province. The Chongqing army can launch guerrilla warfare at will, and the Guilin area is surrounded by huge highlands and mountains for hundreds of miles. These highlands are all natural fortresses, so the future battle will be an extremely tragic one.

### Japanese Planes Heavily Damage Ganzhou Airfield

Nanchang, 19th (Central News Agency): According to a report from the Japanese base, the Japanese planes raided the Ganzhou airfield, the front-line base of the Chongqing army, on the night of the 17th, and inflicted heavy damage on it before safely returning to their original defense.

### Fifth Japanese Aviation Memorial Day

Director-General Endo Issues Statement

In battles with American B-29 aircraft, whether during the day or at night, they can be easily shot down. The improvement of aircraft performance can affect output, but this year's output is still more than double that of last year.

### Ceremony Held to Honor Aviation Contributors

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency): The Japanese Ministry of Transport and Communications will hold a ceremony to honor aviation contributors at 9:00 a.m. on the 20th, the fifth Japanese Aviation Day.

Beijing, 19th (Central News Agency): Wang Shijing, Economic Director of the North China Political Affairs Commission and President of the United Reserve Bank, returned to Beijing on the 16th and made the following remarks: The Chairman's condition has been very good, which is truly gratifying. This time, through negotiations with the Japanese government, the Bank of Japan has established a credit loan of 200 million yuan to the United Reserve Bank. This proves the enthusiasm of the Japanese government to assist the United Reserve Bank notes, and at the same time clarifies the determination to maintain the price of the United Reserve Bank notes from beginning to end. Due to this measure, the foundation of the United Reserve Bank notes has become increasingly strong, which will have a good impact on general prices. I take this opportunity to adhere to the policy of suppressing future price issues to stabilize people's livelihood.

### Air Defense Headquarters Explains Alarm Regulations and Answers Several Questions from Various Sectors

The Civil Air Defense Headquarters of this city believes that citizens of this city still do not fully understand the various air defense measures. The following are answers to several questions from various sectors. (Question) Is there a regulation to stop traffic for ten minutes when the all-clear signal is given? (Answer) The general traffic control is based on the Special Notice No. 4 issued by the Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Command on July 31, 1944. When the alert signal is issued, all vehicles should immediately stop at a location that does not obstruct traffic. Pedestrians should quickly move to the side of the road and stand by. Five minutes after the alert signal is issued, vehicles should drive at a speed of no more than 20 kilometers (kilometers) per hour. Pedestrians should proceed in order to the extent that it does not obstruct air defense affairs and does not cause traffic accidents. When the air raid alarm is issued, all vehicles and ships should stop at a location that does not obstruct traffic. Pedestrians on land should quickly go to nearby shelters or air-raid shelters to wait, etc. Also, when there are no suitable shelters nearby, pedestrians should pass in order to the extent that it does not obstruct air defense affairs and does not cause traffic accidents ten minutes after the air raid alarm is issued. There is no regulation to stop traffic for ten minutes after the all-clear signal is given. (Question) Is the all-clear signal determined by the sound of the siren or the turning on and off of street lights? (Answer) It is determined by the simultaneous sounding of the all-clear siren, not by the turning on and off of street lights. (Question) Is it necessary for the on-duty personnel of the Air Defense Headquarters to use force? (Answer) The Air Defense Headquarters is responsible for planning, supervising, and promoting all air defense work. There are no on-duty personnel outside. It is probably a misunderstanding. Although personnel such as self-defense groups who implement air defense outside provide assistance and guidance, there is no need to use force, and such behavior is not allowed. If anyone unreasonably uses violence against the people, they will be held accountable according to the law.

### Public Utilities Bureau Restricts Front-Seat Tricycles

The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has stopped issuing licenses for front-seat double-occupancy commercial tricycles because they do not comply with regulations. As for the remaining front-seat single-occupancy commercial tricycles, because their center of gravity is in the front, it is difficult to brake in an emergency, and the danger is extremely high. Moreover, passengers are prone to accidents in the front. In order to ensure passenger safety, the bureau has adopted a gradual elimination method to eliminate front-seat single-occupancy tricycles. It is hoped that businesses and merchants in the city will stop manufacturing this type of vehicle.

### French Tram Company Refuses to Restore Original Prices

Hoping that Relevant Authorities Will Take Effective Measures The problem of the French Tram Company in this city raising prices without authorization has caused great concern among citizens since the Public Utilities Bureau strictly ordered it to be stopped and the public opinion circles sanctioned it. The person in charge of the company promised to restore the original ticket prices from yesterday (19th), but according to on-the-spot investigations, the vehicles on each line of the company were still selling tickets at the increased prices yesterday, which caused great doubts among all citizens. They believe that in order to maintain the government's prestige, it must be done what is said and orders must be followed. The company first increased prices without authorization, and then disobeyed the order and refused to restore the original prices, which is a disregard for laws and regulations, contempt for official orders, and disregard for the condemnation of public opinion of the five million citizens of Shanghai, which is extremely hateful. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will quickly take the most severe and effective measures to maintain prestige and live up to the expectations of the people.

### Forged Cloth Purchase Certificate Found

On the 18th of this month, someone used a cloth purchase certificate to purchase cloth from a designated retailer (No. 191) on Changshou Road. After careful examination by the retailer, it was found to be forged and was immediately sent to the police station in the district for investigation. After learning of this, the Shanghai Special City Cloth Industry Wholesale Merchants Joint Association immediately notified each designated merchant to pay close attention.

It is hoped that citizens will not be greedy for small profits and resell them to avoid being deceived, and each designated merchant must first carefully check the number of the cloth purchase certificate before purchasing cloth, and identify the authenticity of the secret code to avoid confusion.
