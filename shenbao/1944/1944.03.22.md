### On Wartime Construction

War is a magnetic field, and also construction; the construction that comes from struggling arduously in the rubble field is the real construction.

Wartime construction is not like peacetime construction. In peacetime, there is plenty of manpower and resources, and even more ample time. In wartime construction, manpower is lacking, resources are lacking, and time is pressing. Wartime construction is both urgently needed and extremely difficult. To overcome these difficulties, one must be grounded in reality, and use the spirit of arduous and outstanding strength to compensate for the lack of material resources, and then one can overcome all difficulties.

The first thing to pay attention to in wartime construction is practical work. Now is not the time to talk about form, decorate the façade, let alone talk big and issue empty declarations. Things that are not needed in the immediate future should not be thought about or talked about. What is needed right now should be done immediately, doing one thing at a time, succeeding a little at a time. Plans in the office, if not matched with real action, are equal to no plans, and only waste energy, money and time. If public institutions arbitrarily release plans without action, it will further affect their prestige. We are not against planning, but we emphasize even more the practical implementation. The past problem of "deliberating without deciding, deciding without acting" was already unacceptable in peacetime, and even more so in wartime. The spirit of practical work, in other words, is down-to-earth work. Only this kind of work gradually moves towards the road to success step by step, drop by drop. Our only hope for the whole country, from top to bottom, is the performance of real work, and at the same time, what the country needs is only the results of real work. There can be no ambiguity in this, no deception.

The second thing to pay attention to in wartime construction is hard work. The suitable things are placed in front of your eyes, and the lack of construction conditions is manifested everywhere, but if construction work cannot be talked about now, perhaps we will not be able to work in the future. Wartime construction, on the one hand, increases our strength, and on the other hand, reduces the enemy's strength. The enemy and us are competing to see who takes the lead, and whoever takes the lead will win. So, how can we do construction work? Thousands of sentences merge into one sentence, only hard work. If a job can be done by several people, do not not work, you may as well continue to do it at night. As Dr. Soussou said, "What is the need to be ashamed of a wife doing the work of a maid, but is it impossible without servants? Remember that this is a very special time, then the country will definitely be able to produce dozens of times more work than today." This is hard work to overcome any obstacles and achieve final success.

We look at the prosperity of Japan after the Meiji Restoration in the past, the economic recovery of Germany after the First World War, and the Five-Year Plan of Soviet Russia, and everyone feels infinite admiration. However, this is not a fluke success. We have protected the modern history of Japan, the history of the revival of Germany, and the history of the Soviet Five-Year Plan. We know that all these successes were created by their entire country, from top to bottom, working hard and diligently in arduous difficulties. Their spirit of practical work and hard work has built their country. What about our spirit? How are we going to build our country?

### Yin Rugeng Returns to Beijing After Inspection Discusses Governance and Transportation Policies Navigation Possible Before the End of the Year

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - In order to understand the Director of the Zhili Canal Preparation Office _____ situation and to understand the opinions of Chinese and Japanese officials and local gentry on the management of the canal, a planned period of inspections was specifically scheduled. Last month, he personally accompanied staff to Yangzhou, where he conducted on-the-spot inspections, and held cordial meetings with Chinese and Japanese officials and local gentry to discuss the opinions of Xie on the management of the canal. The results were extremely satisfactory, and officials and people from all over the country were willing to do their best to assist. This month, on the 13th, Yin also accompanied Lin Gengyu, the leader of the Planning Group, Secretary Ren Santian, Shao Qixin, ____ experts, and representatives of the Allied Japanese General Headquarters and the Japanese Embassy, totaling dozens of people, to inspect Xuzhou, Haizhou, Lianyungang Canal Station, Bengbu and other places. At 1:00 PM yesterday, the 20th, they finished their inspection and returned to Beijing from Bengbu. Central News Agency reporters believe that the repair of the canal will not only provide another passage for materials between the north and the south, but also make a great contribution. Therefore, in order to understand the views of the stock market on this trip and the future policy of the Zhili Canal, they specially visited the history of more than a thousand years, as the only Great Wall in the world dedicated to transporting rice from Jingnan in our country to the north, and were equally known as a magnificent world project.

Since the Qing Dynasty

Due to the change of course of the Yellow River, the canal was cut off, resulting in the canal being silted up. The annual dredging ____ was costly. After the Boxer Indemnity, financial difficulties arose, and the Qing court ordered the abolition of the canal and the cessation of transportation, and the governors-general stopped the river management funds. As a result, the river administration was relaxed and continued to this day, and it has not been able to complete the life of the north-south transportation artery, which is a pity. However, looking back at the countries of the world, although their railways and highways are as dense as spider webs, they still attach great importance to canals. Moreover, the transportation in our country is not very developed, the area is extremely vast, and the material economy urgently needs to be communicated. After the Greater East Asia War, the number of maritime transport ships is quite insufficient, and railway cargo is extremely congested. Therefore, the government specially established a preparation office for governing the canal to repair the canal and appointed me as the director. However, this matter is of great importance and requires a large amount of manpower and resources, but my talents are limited. Therefore, in order to understand the opinions of all parties on the management of the canal, I specially formulated

Planned inspections

In one case, the river conditions in various places were clear, and in one case, the opinions of Chinese and Japanese officials, local gentry, and water conservancy experts on the management of the canal in various places were heard. Every place was warmly welcomed by the provincial governors and county magistrates, for which I am extremely grateful. Moreover, I was able to hear many high opinions at each cordial meeting, but the time was too hasty. I was unable to ask for advice one by one. All parties have opinions on the management of the canal. Therefore, I hope that if all parties have other opinions on the management of the canal, they can submit them to this office in writing, which is what our colleagues at this office are looking forward to.

Future governance policy

It is planned to divide the entire canal into six sections: the Jinlin Section, the Linji Section, the Jihuai Section, the Huaijiang Section, the Zhensu Section, and the Suzhou Pillow Section, with a total length of 1,500 kilometers. When all sections are open to navigation, the goal is for the Jiangnan Canal to be able to navigate 900 ____, and the Jiangbei Canal to be able to navigate 300-ton cargo ships. The first phase of construction will begin in mid-April or early May, except for the section from Taierzhuang to Guazhou. If there are no other incidents, navigation will be possible before the end of this year. In short, this project is extremely difficult, and my talent is limited. I still hope that all parties from China and Japan will do their best to assist, so that after the repair is completed, materials can be circulated, and we can make a contribution to the Greater East Asia War.

Transferred to Suzhou and Hangzhou

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - To observe the Director of the Governance Canal ____ the canal work and to understand the opinions of Chinese and Japanese officials and local ____ on the management of the canal, on the morning of the 21st at 9:00, I once again ____ the same office team leader Lin Gengzi, financial team leader Dang ____xi, secretary Ren ____tian, Shao Qixin, ____ technical team, and representatives of the ____ Bang Japanese General Headquarters.
