### On the Philippine Battle Situation

After being severely damaged and retreating in the sea and air battle off Taiwan, the enemy American naval and air forces gathered their remaining ships and landed on the small island of Leyte in the central Philippines on the 18th. Starting from the morning of the 24th, the Japanese fleet, with its naval and air forces united, moved overseas in the eastern sea of the Philippines, dealing a fierce encircling and intercepting blow to the invading enemy American navy and transport ships, aiming for their annihilation. The Philippine Islands are the maritime outer defense line protecting the Japanese mainland. The Japanese navy, which has been enduring and biding its time, waiting for the right moment, will surely seize this opportune moment, display its historically traditional naval spirit, and sweep away the enemy American ambition to dominate East Asia. At the same time, in order to cover up their defeat, reverse the decline, and gain the trust of the anti-Axis nations, the enemy American forces may, relying on their self-proclaimed superior resources, engage in a desperate "cornered dog jumping over the wall" style battle on the Philippine seas. Thus, the landing on Leyte Island will develop into a major decisive battle in the Pacific. Regarding the enemy American intentions in invading the Philippine Islands, we already discussed them in yesterday's commentary. Now, we will further examine the future of the Philippine battle situation from a strategic perspective, explaining the enemy American self-destruction. The Japanese navy, since the Battle of Saipan, has been enduring and biding its time in order to appropriately choose the moment, prepare to concentrate forces sufficient to destroy the enemy, inflict maximum damage on the enemy before the decisive battle, render the enemy unable to recover, and gain the initiative to easily achieve victory. The enemy's failed offensive on Taiwan, driven by impatience and restlessness, without sufficient replenishment, attempted to recapture the Philippines, cutting off communication with the Japanese mainland. Strategically adopting a "reverse warfare method" is already risky. Moreover, naval warfare resupply is more difficult than land warfare. Enemy American naval commander Fletcher admitted that "the greatest difficulty in the Pacific war is supplying its needed supplies, which will be three times that required in the European war. Therefore, the difficulty of resupply will increase with the American advance, and the rate of increase in difficulty will not be proportional to the increase in distance." Now, the battered ships, without proper repair and replenishment, continue to fight, requiring even greater resupply from the rear, and the difficulties are even greater. Conversely, the Japanese navy does not have this kind of difficulty to constrain strategic decisions. If the enemy American forces in this attack on Taiwan had been able to gain a foothold as they did on Leyte Island, the Japanese navy would have encountered some strategic difficulties. Because if the enemy American forces established a bridgehead in Taiwan, they could seize strongholds in the southeastern coastal areas of China, reducing the threat from one side and not completely exposing the weakness of maritime resupply difficulties. This time, the Japanese navy crushed the enemy American attempt to attack Taiwan, forcing the enemy to take adventurous actions in the Philippines. This is based on strategic requirements and is also the first strategic success of the Japanese navy. Secondly, based on the daily reports from the Japanese General Headquarters, the Philippine battle results show that more than sixty enemy ships, large and small, have been sunk and destroyed. The fate of the enemy forces landing in Leyte Gulf has also been determined to be nothing but annihilation. Therefore, in terms of the current actual situation, there is no doubt that the allied forces will be able to defeat the enemy American fleet in a very short time. Based on the above, the Japanese navy holds an absolutely superior strategic position, coupled with vigorous morale and courageous spirit. The Philippine battle situation will become the highest expression of the righteous character of Japan's Greater East Asia War for the defense of East Asia. The people of our Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere should rise up together and seize this best opportunity.

### Major Battle Continuing in the Eastern Sea of the Philippines

Another Seven Enemy Aircraft Carriers and Cruisers Sunk and Destroyed More Than Fifty Enemy Ships Sunk and Destroyed in Leyte Gulf

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 5:00 PM on the 26th: Sea and air battles between the enemy and our forces are still continuing in the eastern sea of the Philippines. The confirmed results of the fighting so far are as follows: Two aircraft carriers and one cruiser sunk; four aircraft carriers destroyed.

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:50 PM on the 26th: (1) Since October 20th, Japanese ground troops on Leyte Island have been engaging and repelling about three enemy divisions that landed near Tacloban South and Clark. They are still fighting fiercely. (2) Since October 19th, Japanese air units have continuously attacked enemy transport convoys and their escorting vessels in Leyte Gulf. The Japanese fleet also broke into Leyte Gulf at dawn on the 26th and launched a strong assault on numerous enemy ships. As of now, the confirmed overall results in Leyte Gulf (excluding the results obtained by suicide planes that did not return) are: The Japanese army sunk five enemy small transport ships, set eleven on fire, ran four aground, and destroyed two. It also destroyed two enemy aircraft carriers, ran one enemy battleship aground, destroyed two, sank two enemy cruisers, destroyed three, sunk one enemy destroyer, destroyed three, sunk seventeen enemy large landing craft, and destroyed and set two on fire. In this operation, the Japanese side suffered losses of one battleship sunk and one damaged, as well as several planes lost to suicide attacks and not returning to base.

### Japanese Forces Secure Control of the Sea and Air Around the Philippines

Naval Units Have Advanced to the New Battlefield

Philippine Front, 26th (Central News Agency) The Japanese forces have secured control of the sea and air around the Philippines. Therefore, enemy air raids on the Philippines have weakened. For example, only seven large enemy planes attacked the Philippines on the 25th, and only two attacked the Visayas region.

### Fully Demonstrate Integrated Power

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) Since the Japanese air force inflicted a crushing blow on the enemy American powerful mobile force in the sea and air battle off Taiwan, it has been closely monitoring the enemy's movements. Although the enemy suffered setbacks in operations in the central Pacific, it still hoped to advance its planned operations in the Philippines. Since the 17th, it has landed some forces in the Leyte Gulf area of the Philippines. The Philippine operation, from the enemy American standpoint, is a major operation in the Pacific, so the Japanese-American operations in that area have a profound impact on the future of the Greater East Asia War. In order to cover up the fact of its defeat in the air battle off Taiwan, the enemy is instead publicizing the urgency of the battle situation in the Philippines, engaging in scheming, and mobilizing its battered fleet to carry out formal operations in the Philippines. However, the Japanese Combined Fleet naval forces, in response to this historical shift, coordinated with the air force and resolutely launched a fierce attack on the enemy's powerful aircraft carrier group, fully demonstrating the integrated power of the naval air force and submarines. This has not been seen since the First Solomon Sea Battle. In the past, the Japanese naval forces have been closely monitoring the developments of the war, responding calmly, and preparing for the impending decisive battle. Therefore, now that the time has come for the Japanese naval forces to strike, they are able to coordinate with the naval air force and break into the new battlefield in the eastern sea of the Philippines. Since the Gilbert operation, the enemy has been enticing the Japanese fleet to come out, and the enemy's so-called fleet clearly refers to the naval forces. However, the timing of the Japanese naval forces' attack is entirely at the initiative of the Japanese side. The Japanese side can deal with any enemy action as it wishes. Moreover, now that preparations for the decisive battle have been completed, the Japanese side has taken the initiative to launch the continuous decisive battle that the enemy seeks, and the situation in the eastern Philippines has become urgent as a result.

### Air Raids on Various Parts of the South Seas

Japanese Base in the Central Pacific, 25th (Central News Agency) Several enemy small planes attacked Yamil Island in the Marshall Islands during the day on the 23rd. Also, a dispatch from a base in the southwestern Pacific on the 25th reported that about forty enemy medium-sized planes attacked Pula, Seram Island, during the day on the 23rd, and three were shot down by the Japanese side. Also, twenty-four enemy planes attacked Antong during the day on the same day.

### Japanese Fleet Focuses on Quality in Operations

Enemy Lacks Tactics, Collapse Not Far Off

Central News Agency Report A naval expert in Shanghai recently observed the results of the major battle in the eastern sea of the Philippines, as announced by the Japanese General Headquarters, as follows: The war that will determine the victory or defeat of Greater East Asia began in the eastern sea of Taiwan and is now unfolding in a fierce major battle in the eastern sea of the Philippines. The enemy Americans have strategy but lack tactics. Therefore, most of the enemy's main aircraft have already been destroyed, and all of the fleets have been scattered. At this time, under the fierce general attack of the Japanese Combined Fleet, what we must pay attention to is the current state of the Japanese-American naval battle. The Japanese fleet has undergone intense training and concentrated refinement for fleet operations for the past seventy years, focusing on quality. However, the enemy Americans focus only on quantity, and all of the ships have not undergone sufficient training, and the skills of the crew and soldiers are poor. Therefore, in this artillery battle, when the Japanese fleet broke into the enemy fleet, the enemy was immediately destroyed. At that time, what the enemy feared most was the flagship guns of the Japanese main battleships, and they often wandered around in a panic. Today, according to the announcement of the General Headquarters, the enemy ships probably ran aground while fleeing. From this, we can see that the enemy has strategy but lacks tactics. Now that the enemy has been broken through by the Japanese fleet, victory can be determined. Based on today's announcement by the Japanese General Headquarters of the major battle results, the collapse of the enemy American navy under Japanese artillery fire cannot be far off.

### Twenty-Four Enemy Planes Attacking Kyushu Shot Down

Japanese General Headquarters Announced Battle Results Yesterday

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 12:00 on the 26th: When enemy B29-type planes attacked Kyushu and Jeju Island on the 25th, the battle results obtained by the Japanese army were as follows: five shot down, nineteen destroyed, totaling twenty-four.

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) Fukuoka telephone report: The US Air Force's 20th Bombardment Wing stationed in Chongqing has been actively increasing its strength, watching for opportunities to attack northern Kyushu, Japan, by air. On the 25th, it dispatched about a hundred B29-type planes, divided into several formations, flying at an ultra-high altitude of six to seven thousand meters, and invaded the western region of Kyushu. The elite Japanese air defense units intercepted and attacked them fiercely. The enemy formations fell into confusion and scattered. The intrusions into Omura, Amakusa, Kumamoto, Saga, and other places were all blocked by the local Japanese air defense units, failing to achieve their goal of bombing important areas, and blindly dropped bombs and incendiary bombs in the Ariake Sea and the mountainous areas of Saga Prefecture. The Japanese side's losses were limited to a small area and were extremely minor. At 11:00, the enemy planes fled to the sea west of Kyushu.

### Japanese Army Planes Cleverly Intercept

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) The Japanese air defense units fiercely attacked the group of about a hundred enemy planes of the US Air Force's B29-type planes stationed in Chongqing, which attacked Kyushu and Jeju Island on the 25th. The battle results of this operation have been announced by the Japanese General Headquarters, with a total of five shot down and nineteen destroyed, severely damaging one-quarter of the total. Previously, when the enemy attacked northern Kyushu with a formation of no less than a hundred planes on August 20, 21, and 22, it lost more than fifty planes, with twenty-three shot down. Therefore, when attacking this time, they were deeply afraid of the power of the Japanese air defense units and hardly dared to approach, only invading from high altitude and adopting blind bombing tactics. However, the Japanese army air squadrons and anti-aircraft artillery units skillfully annihilated them, resulting in such battle results. It has been confirmed that the nineteen destroyed planes were spewing black smoke, and based on the distance from their base, it is doubtful whether they can return to Chengdu, and it is feared that many will fall midway or be forced to land.

### Records of Three Attacks by Japanese Air Squadrons

Enemy Forces Isolated on Leyte Island

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) Since the morning of the 24th, the Japanese army, navy, and air force have cooperated to intercept the American forces landing in the Philippines and their maritime mobile forces, decisively adopting offensive actions and successively attacking enemy fleets and transport convoys. The pursuit is still underway on the 26th. The details of the battle are summarized as follows: Before the Japanese forces launched the attack, the enemy American fleet consisted of about 2-3 groups of mobile forces mainly composed of 2-3 aircraft carriers each, about 8 aircraft carriers in total, including 3-4 standard aircraft carriers, all operating at sea 300-400 miles east of Luzon Island. On the 24th, the Japanese air squadrons carried out three attacks. The first attack reached the battlefield at 10:30 AM, destroying 3 enemy aircraft carriers, 2 large cruisers, and shooting down more than 30 enemy planes. The second attack reached the battlefield at 3:35 PM, intercepting an enemy mobile force composed of 4 aircraft carriers, 1 battleship, and 2 cruisers, and destroying one enemy Wasp-class aircraft carrier. The third attack began on the night of the 24th, targeting the northernmost group of the enemy fleet, sinking one enemy large aircraft carrier. On the night of the 24th, the Japanese submarine fleet fiercely attacked the enemy transport convoys sailing towards Leyte, sinking 4 enemy transport ships. On the 25th, the Japanese forces also attacked the enemy naval fleet. From 7:30 AM to 8:30 AM, they sunk 4 enemy aircraft carriers, 2 cruisers, and 1 destroyer. The Japanese air force also carried out a night raid, with the northern enemy fleet as the bombing target. The battle results obtained were: one enemy aircraft carrier sunk, one enemy cruiser sunk, and two enemy aircraft carriers and one battleship heavily damaged. Since the 19th, the Japanese air force and the maritime naval units, starting from dawn on the 25th, also separately attacked the enemy fleet gathered in Leyte Gulf, destroying 3-4 battleships and 30-40 other ships. As a result, many enemy aircraft carriers, cruisers, transport ships, and transports were sunk or destroyed, as follows: 5 enemy transport ships sunk, 11 destroyed and set on fire, 4 bombed and grounded, and 2 destroyed. 2 enemy aircraft carriers destroyed, 1 enemy battleship grounded, and 2 damaged. 2 enemy cruisers sunk, and 3 destroyed. 1 enemy destroyer sunk, and 3 destroyed. 15 enemy large amphibious craft sunk, and 2 destroyed and set on fire.

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) After the American forces attacked Leyte Island, they publicized it widely. According to MacArthur's announcement, the American fleet arrived off the Philippines, covering the sea for the landing, due to the Japanese side's calmness. Therefore, the enemy forces at one corner of Leyte were also suddenly stunned. A few days later, the elite Japanese naval and air forces suddenly appeared in front of and above the American fleet group and attacked it. As a result, the enemy lost most of the 58th Mobile Force, the Third Fleet of Halsey, and was forced to flee in panic after suffering a terrible defeat in the waters off Taiwan. Currently, the Japanese naval forces in the eastern sea of the Philippines are continuing the pursuit. What is particularly lamentable is that the small bridgehead on Leyte Island was completely cut off from communication with the sea by dusk on the 25th, forming an isolated and helpless situation. The fate of the landing forces is deeply known to be precarious, and the Japanese forces will begin to deal with it.

### Inauguration Ceremony of the New People's Allied Association Held Yesterday

### Chairman Wang's Instructions

Beiping, 26th (Central News Agency) At the opening ceremony of the New People's Association general joint conference, Foreign Minister Chu Minyi of the National Government specially attended the meeting on behalf of Chairman Wang to deliver instructions. The main points of the instructions are recorded as follows: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War in December of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), the National Government has issued a statement resolving to share weal and woe with the allied nation of Japan and to devote all its strength to cooperate in the war. In order to enable the people of the whole country to shoulder this new responsibility and fulfill its new mission, the New National Movement was initiated in January of the 31st year of the Republic (1942). On January 9th of last year, the National Government resolutely entered the war, and with a spirit of shared life and death, jointly shouldered the responsibility of defending Greater East Asia with the allied nations. To carry out the National Movement is to mobilize the national spirit. Its purpose is to inspire a new national spirit, enabling the people to participate in common organizations and training, concentrate their will, and enrich their abilities, so that spiritual construction and material proposals can advance simultaneously on both sides. The so-called "new" means reforming the past on the one hand, and striving to create the future on the other. In the past few years, thanks to the efforts and practices of all of you, this new spirit has permeated all levels of the North China people, making a great contribution to promoting national policies and completing the war. Now that the Greater East Asia War has entered the decisive stage, the greatest task facing China is to work together with the allied nations to win the final victory of the war. Although North China belongs to the rear, its relationship to the war is extremely close in terms of population, economy, and security. Therefore, its responsibility is also very great. In terms of population, North China has a population of 100 million. How should this large number of people be guided and trained so that their will is concentrated and their steps are aligned, becoming extremely strong fighters? In terms of economy, North China has a large amount of materials, which are necessary raw materials for military industries. How should they be developed to increase production and contribute to the war? In terms of security, how should corruption be eliminated, banditry be eradicated, and security be ensured, so that production can be further increased? Furthermore, how should the efficiency of administrative advancement be enhanced? All of these are already the focus of the government's policies, and also require the cooperation and promotion of the people in order to achieve the desired goals. On the occasion of the opening of the joint conference, I would like to state these points in the hope of mutual encouragement.

### Battle Situation in Longling

Japanese Base on the Burmese Front, 26th (Central News Agency) The main force of the Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force has approached the Japanese army positions in Longling, and part of it has moved southeast of Longling, gathering a large army northeast of Mangshi, challenging the Japanese army. However, due to the preemptive attacks of the Japanese army, the Chongqing army suffered heavy losses and seems unwilling to fight. However, they are coordinating with the British Indian army and the Chongqing army stationed in India in the Myitkyina area, eager to try. At the same time, they are strengthening the nearly completed Ledo Road-Myitkyina highway and the airfield in the Fort Hertz area, in order to wait for these air and land supply routes to be completed, and then launch a major counter-offensive in coordination. Now they are moving restlessly near Shangjie, and concentrating mortar fire to bombard the Japanese army in Longling, counterattacking day after day, in order to probe the power of the Japanese army. The battle situation in the Longling area has reached an extremely noteworthy stage with the arrival of the dry season.

Japanese Base on the Burmese Front, 26th (Central News Agency) The Chongqing army on the Yunnan side is still actively attempting to open the Burma Road. On the afternoon of the 19th, a powerful unit of the Chongqing army with mortars and Czech machine guns suddenly attacked Zhafang, a key point on the Burma Road.

### Increase Production and Eliminate Speculation with Active Measures

Vice Minister Jiang Discusses Commodity Price Issues. Industry Minister Jiang Zoxuan recently came to Shanghai to discuss methods with relevant authorities to suppress commodity prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. A reporter from the Central News Agency made a special visit to Jiang at his residence, where he was received and answered various questions posed by the reporter. The following is a record:

Q: The soaring commodity prices in the city have greatly affected people's livelihoods. What good measures does the Ministry have to suppress commodity prices?
A: Currently, in order to suppress commodity prices, in addition to strictly enforcing both fundamental and symptomatic measures and cracking down on speculative manipulation, we are also actively researching production countermeasures. If production can be increased, it will not be difficult to lower general commodity prices.

Q: This time you have come to Shanghai to discuss suppressing commodity prices with relevant authorities. I wonder if there will be good results that we can hear about?
A: Currently, the most serious issues are rice, flour, coal, and daily necessities that are directly related to people's livelihoods. The Ministry has already adopted active measures. Regarding rice and flour, we are urging control organizations to increase purchases in various district offices. At the same time, we are assessing commodity prices and strictly cracking down on speculative hoarding. In the future, the crackdown measures will be even stricter.

Q: Is it possible to increase the quantity of rations for various daily necessities?
A: The core of this issue is still to strive for increased production and strict crackdowns in order to suppress commodity prices. The sources of production have now been unblocked, so the general rationing issue is expected to improve in the future.

### City Economic Bureau Inquires About Rice Prices in Various Counties

Sends Letter to Oil and Grain Association to Assist in Suppressing Oil Prices. The City Economic Bureau bears the responsibility of stabilizing the people's livelihood and economy during this wartime.

### Nantong Maru Sinking: Company Dispatches Personnel for Investigation

All Parties Concerned About the Truth of the Accident. The China Merchant Steam Navigation Company's Nantong Maru sank near Hupu at 5:15 PM on the 23rd of this month. With the exception of a very small number of the ship's captain and over fifty other officers and over a thousand passengers (including those who bought black market tickets), the situation of the rest remains unknown. This is another tragic case for the company after the Xin Gang Huatai. All sectors of society are paying close attention to the truth of the accident and are watching the company's handling of the aftermath. The Nantong Maru was built in Hong Kong in 1911. It has a flat bottom and a tonnage of 652. It was allocated to the company by the naval authorities. It previously sailed on the Qinglong Port, Tiansheng Port, and Huojiaqiao lines, and was later changed to the Shanghai port line. It had not yet made ten round trips before this disaster occurred. The cause of the accident may be due to excessive loading. It is said that the ship carried over a thousand passengers (mostly carrying pigs, rice, etc.) in addition to 300 bags of wheat, 480 baskets of eggs, and 60 ____ in the hold. Regarding the handling of the aftermath of the case, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Deputy President Yamanaka of China Merchant Steam Navigation Company. According to him, "The loss of the Nantong Maru is not only a loss for the company, but also a loss for both China and Japan. Moreover, the number of victims is quite large. The company will dispatch First Class Reserve Officer Tomi Daiyuki and rescued crew members to the accident site tonight (the 26th) to investigate and salvage."

### Special Consumption Tax to be Paid with Vouchers

The Ministry of Finance's Tax Bureau was ordered to implement the wartime special consumption tax, starting on January 16 of this year in the Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Wuhu, Bengbu, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, and Ningbo and fifteen other important urban areas in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The special consumption tax was levied on retail goods and banquets, hotels, and other items. Subsequently, on April 16, it continued to be levied in various counties, cities, towns, villages, and districts in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The tax administration has gradually progressed to the right track, and tax revenue has been increasing day by day. Until recently, monthly tax revenue has increased to over 30 million yuan. It is now known that the bureau has reported that although the special consumption tax in various regions has been increasing rapidly, there are still merchants and people trying to evade taxes, and the collection process has failed to eliminate malpractices. Therefore, it has specifically requested and obtained approval from the Ministry of Finance to prepare for the implementation of a voucher tax payment system in order to increase tax revenue and prevent malpractices. It is said that the voucher tax payment method will be implemented next month once preparations are completed.

### A Tour of Nanhui

By Yifei. After days of hard rain, the sun after the rain makes one feel especially beloved. On the 21st of the month, the reporter stepped onto the Huangpu Riverbank in the faint light of dawn. Hired a small boat and crossed to Pudong on the other side. After landing at Dongchang Road, went straight to the East Asia Company's bus station to buy a ticket to Zhoupu. It started shortly after. There were seven people in the same car. Soldiers boarded along the way, but since the car was already full, they all stood on the footboard, one on each side, no different from passengers' obligatory bodyguards. Along the way, traffic flowed back and forth, creating a lively scene. The highway was in disrepair and overloaded, so the car moved like a cow. Otherwise, it would break down. After an hour of travel, it arrived at Zhoupu. Transferred to a large truck of the Shanghai South Bus Company and headed to Nanhui. The car was extremely crowded. Those who arrived later had almost no place to stand. Because the road was slippery after the rain and the road surface was bumpy, the degree of jolting was no different. Passengers could not bear the suffering. However, the ticket seller was able to climb around the car and perform his duties, as nimble as a swallow. The reporter admired this gentleman's skill and sighed at his own inferiority. Arrived at the county seat of Nanhui after noon. The following is a brief report on what I have seen and heard in recent days:

### Inside and Outside the Urban Area

Nanhui is a small city, only about three li in circumference. The city wall is very low, its height is only like the surrounding wall of a wealthy house in Shanghai. There is a moat outside the city, running around the city. Civilian boats travel back and forth in the river from time to time, dotted among them, set off by the endless green fields. It really makes one forget the mortal world and have a transcendent feeling. The reporter always feels that the beauty of nature is definitely not something that people living in the city can imagine. One must be there to appreciate it. The road administration in Nanhui city is really disappointing. The only so-called main street is not wide, and the houses on both sides are almost connected to each other. The stone slab pavement is uneven, and when it rains, it is like wearing a shoe with a horizontal leather sole, making one sigh "I can't walk anymore, brother." In the small alleys and deep lanes, garbage is everywhere and the stench is overwhelming. Pedestrians cover their noses. In summer, it is even more harmful to hygiene, and it seems that there is a need for rectification. The people here are very simple and honest. In terms of clothing, with the exception of a very small number of outside government officials, there are almost no people wearing western clothes. Everyone wears cloth clothes. They are also very polite to outside travelers, providing assistance in various ways and making it easy for people. It is not comparable to the arrogance of city people who specialize in bullying rural people.

### Rising Prices and the Prevalence of Checks

General commodity prices are quite high. Except for the specialties of peanuts, sweet potatoes, and fish and shrimp, rice prices are almost the same as in Shanghai, and meat prices are not much different. Daily necessities such as soap, matches, and cigarettes are about 50% more expensive than in Shanghai. Hot water bottles are very popular here, almost every household has one. Because rice straw is expensive, it is not easy to boil water. Even teahouses have to open after noon. With this kind of life, it is no wonder that the general low-paid civil servants here are constantly complaining. The total income of ordinary civil servants is only a quarter of the necessary living expenses. According to the reporter's investigation, most of the patrons of the two pawnshops here are this group of disaster officials. There is another miracle here, that is, the prevalence of checks. Whether it is a small or large transaction or private exchange, checks are used, and the payment period is always more than three or four months. Disputes over bounced checks are unavoidable. However, this trend does not change much because of this. The reason is that those who issue checks are mostly armed or have hidden influence. Merchants dare not refuse to use them. However, everything has its limit. Recently, there has also been a wave of store closures. Even more ridiculous, there are even cases of eating a bowl of wontons and giving the vendor a check for a thousand yuan, asking for change. If the reporter had not seen it with his own eyes, it would be hard to believe.

### Public Security and Rural Conditions

Nanhui County is divided into eight districts: 1. Chengxiangzhen, 2. Zhuqiao, 3. Liudu, 4. Zhangjiangzha, 5. Zhoupu, 6. Shaojialou, 7. Xinchang, 8. Datuan. In terms of public security, in addition to the above-mentioned large towns, there are traces of guerrillas and bandits in the area within more than ten li nearby. Even on the day the reporter arrived, two guerrillas were arrested in a small boat in the west moat of the city. When the reporter talked to the villagers about this matter, they were very afraid. After 9:00 PM at night, pedestrians disappeared, and only soldiers and police were on the streets. Nanhui County has a total of about 2.4 million mu of farmland, divided into east and west townships. The east township is divided into group and jia systems, while the west township is divided into bao and tu systems. The total population of the county is 525,990, with farmers accounting for the vast majority. Taking the east township as an example, there are 600,000 mu of farmland, divided into seven groups, each group consisting of nine jia. The fields are divided into sugarcane fields and salt fields. Sugarcane fields are further divided into old sugarcane, newly raised, and already enclosed. Due to the current soaring land prices, sugarcane fields are worth 30,000 yuan per mu, newly raised fields are worth 20,000 yuan, and already enclosed fields are worth about 10,000 yuan. Most of the farmers have migrated here from Chongming, Qidong, and Yuyao. Their crops are mainly coarse grains, including peanuts, sweet potatoes, soybeans, and corn. As for cotton, due to the relationship between yield and price, farmers have switched to growing sweet potatoes and other crops. In addition to the land tax of 171 yuan per mu for sugarcane fields and salt fields, and 72 yuan for rice enclosure, they also have to pay military and police rice fees carried by the land tax, amounting to 150 yuan per mu. Other burdensome taxes and miscellaneous taxes such as township business fees, etc., total over 400 yuan per mu. They also have to supply firewood and oil to the military and police. Therefore, due to the heavy burden, farmers are unable to make a living despite their hard work throughout the year. This is a serious problem today.
