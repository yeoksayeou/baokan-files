Now, the original policy will continue to be implemented, carrying out a three-year eradication plan from March 30th of the 33rd year to March 29th of the 36th year. The opium suppression agency will be the Opium Suppression Bureau established by the Ministry of Interior, which will be solely responsible. Vigorously implement the registration of opium addicts, order them to quit in stages, and severely punish violators. The import and sale of morphine, heroin, red pills, and other drugs are strictly prohibited. The sale of opium will not be permitted without special permission, and the total quantity of permitted opium will be reduced in stages according to the three-year eradication plan. Opium dens in various locations will be banned within a time limit. Opium cultivation is absolutely prohibited in peaceful areas. The central and local governments will immediately establish opium cessation hospitals in major cities to force registered opium addicts to undergo detoxification on schedule. The specific implementation details will be drafted by the Ministry of Interior and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval before being promulgated and implemented.

The fallen officers and soldiers who received awards this time were part of the brave warriors who died heroically in the North and South Pacific and mainland China within the two years before November of the 18th year of Showa, after establishing great military achievements. Among the above-mentioned officers and soldiers who received awards, 125 people, including Rear Admiral Isasuke Yamada, were specially promoted two ranks for their outstanding achievements.

Among the military personnel who were awarded the Golden Kite Medal this time were Masao Shibayama and five crew members. Masao Shibayama and others served as members of the Takasago Volunteer Corps and died heroically while engaged in operations in New Guinea.

### British and Indian Troops Retreat from Arakan Region; Fierce Fighting in the Fuyung Creek Valley

Guangzhou, 17th (Central News Agency) – Indian Broadcasting Station broadcast on the 16th: "Fierce fighting continues in the Arakan region. Fierce battles have taken place between the two sides in certain locations south and northeast of Maungdaw. As a result, British and Indian troops have withdrawn from those two locations. The Yu army in the Fuyung Creek Valley is engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army northeast of Taungtha." Furthermore, because this Japanese offensive has caused internal unrest in India, the British authorities have actively taken measures to suppress it. The British and Indian Army Headquarters warned the Indian public in a broadcast on the 16th, saying: Since the Japanese army launched an offensive against the British and Indian troops in the Maungdaw area last year, our troops have temporarily retreated to avoid unnecessary losses. Now, fierce battles have broken out again in that area. Due to the Japanese army's fierce attacks and its advantageous position, it is difficult for the British and Indian troops to exert their combat power. Moreover, the Japanese army will certainly not be satisfied with securing the Maungdaw area, and they will continue to advance towards India. At this moment, we hope that the Indian public will maintain a calm attitude and overcome these difficult times together.

### Reading the Declaration of the Joint Conference of the Rice Control Committee

The joint conference convened by the Rice Control Committee, lasting three days, concluded yesterday and issued a declaration to the public. We attach great importance to the issue of people's livelihoods, especially the most important issue of refined food. Therefore, we place special and earnest expectations on the Rice Control Committee, which is responsible for managing grain policy, to take on the responsibility of improving grain policy. In the past, we have repeatedly offered suggestions, and at this conference, we offered suggestions twice more. In fact, not only is the public opinion world expecting this, but every citizen is also expecting it. Of course, we also know that all the staff of the Rice Control Committee are also expecting this. However, as the saying goes, "The bystander sees clearly, while the person involved is confused." And, "Seeing profit, forgetting righteousness." We would rather "judge the heart of a gentleman with the mind of a petty person" and fulfill our rational responsibility as "bystanders who see clearly." If the words of the bystander do not reflect the facts or go too far, then facts speak louder than words, and the receiver will not suffer any harm. If the words of the bystander are not without basis in fact, then there should be deep self-reflection and honest acceptance. In times of crisis, those who bear heavy responsibilities must have the spirit of being able to endure all kinds of criticism and bear hardships without complaint, without any trace of resentment. Not only is this true for the Rice Control Committee, which bears heavy responsibilities, but it is also true for all other important institutions.

Since the establishment of the Rice Control Committee, the dedication to duty and tireless efforts of some of its staff members cannot be denied as facts. However, the violations of duty, dereliction of duty, and perfunctory actions of some of its staff members cannot be denied as facts either.

If the personnel of the Rice Control Committee are sound, even if adverse social environments affect the performance of the committee, the facts will be clear to all, and they will surely gain the sympathy and understanding of the people. If the affairs of the committee are delayed due to unsound personnel, the facts will also be clear to all, and even if the social environment is adverse, the blame cannot be shifted. In short, we earnestly hope that the Rice Control Committee authorities and all senior executives will frankly reflect on whether all personnel are sound, and at the same time, ensure that they become sound. We have elaborated on the content of sound personnel in yesterday's editorial.

The declaration of the committee said: "We are determined to make our best efforts to ensure that every case discussed is implemented in practice." This is commendable. As for "We hope that all parties will improve the environment and do their best to assist us. Anything that is directly or indirectly beneficial to grain affairs should be maintained, and anything that hinders grain affairs should be eliminated," these are the obligations that all parties should fulfill. Only if the Rice Control Committee first rectifies its personnel, develops in a sound manner, and establishes credibility, so that the public recognizes it, then the public will definitely support it as a backing, and there will be no time for accusations.

### Announcement to Japanese Residents: Colonel Nensei Masanobu's Belief in Victory as the Path to Victory

We must be aware that the war situation is intensifying. If we feel the pain of losing a bird in the morning and an island in the evening upon hearing news of the enemy landing on the Marshall Islands, occupying the Gilbert Islands, or bombing the Kuril Islands, then we are mistaken. Judging from a purely strategic standpoint, the closer the decisive battleground is to our homeland, the greater the damage inflicted on the enemy increases in inverse proportion. The closer the battlefield, the easier the operations. We must be prepared to break our bones and crush our bodies to stab the enemy's heart directly. Without this awareness, we cannot win this great war. I believe that winning the Greater East Asia War will require millions of sacrifices. If we are willing to endure millions of sacrifices to crush tens of millions of the enemy, then the millions who die will rest in peace. In any war, a nation with a psychology of defeat is destined to fail. No matter how dire the circumstances, those who are determined to achieve final victory will ultimately defeat the enemy.

The Russo-Japanese War was a war fought for the self-preservation and self-defense of the Orient. This war is a war of liberation for all of East Asia from the oppression of Britain and the United States. We must be aware that the sacrifices in this war will be ten or even dozens of times greater than those in the Russo-Japanese War. We must be willing to make millions of sacrifices. Only when the entire nation embraces this determination with a smile can the Greater East Asia War be resolved.

In any war, the Western devils fight for their own interests. Now that they are encroaching on East Asia, the time has come for us, a billion people of color, to rise up in unison. We must not rely on the strength of others, but must rely on ourselves. We can only unite with our like-minded neighboring countries with Japan as the center to carry out this great undertaking. This is destiny, this is a fate bestowed by heaven.

Japan is the Leader of the World

So far, in the various wars I have experienced, the first was against the 19th Route Army of Cai Tingkai in Jiangwan, then against the Central Army of Chongqing in Shanxi, against the Russian army in Nohmonhan, against the British and Indian armies in Malaya, and against the Filipino and American armies in the Bataan Peninsula, and against the Australian and American armies in the Solomon Islands. The best of all was the Chinese army. Some of you may find this strange, but if we fought with the same equipment on the same battlefield, the Central Army of China would be the best. Next is the Russian army, which still has a bit of the Oriental spirit. Then come the American, British, and Australian armies. If this strong China were to join hands with our even stronger country, if the world's strongest 500 million people shook hands, I believe even if the whole world came against us, it would not be a problem. If the two nations were permanently united, the entire world would not be frightening. China is gradually becoming stronger, and we are naturally even stronger. If we see our younger brother becoming stronger and fear that he will seize the elder brother's property, this is pettiness. This is definitely not something the eldest son, who is the leader, should have. Japan, fighting with a smile for His Majesty, can absolutely be the leader of the world. We sincerely await our brother China to become stronger and assist him to become stronger. During the last Great War, Clemenceau said, "The front-line battle is in Paris, the battle in the city of Paris, the battle in the rear of Paris." The failure of Paris in this Great War was because there was no Clemenceau.

The Responsibility of Overseas Residents is Significant

The Greater East Asia War is now truly unfolding. In Nanjing, the so-called New Policy towards China has been clarified. What is this New Policy towards China? Japan, after six years of war, has come to understand China and to understand the world. Therefore, Japan cannot survive without working together with China. This is in line with the great objective of the war. This great policy is truly His Majesty the Emperor's sacred will. We have not all grasped the true essence of Japan's national polity until today. But after observing the sacred will, Japan is eternal like heaven and earth. Why? Because this is in accordance with the vast and boundless virtue of heavenly principles, therefore Japan's nation is eternal like heaven and earth. If everyone returns to the true face of the Japanese people and puts this great imperial will into practice, the incident will be resolved naturally. If each of the one million soldiers, officials, and civilians in China can gain a Chinese comrade, and have 100 million Chinese people truly as their comrades, the incident can already be resolved. Chongqing is watching the current situation in Shanghai. Chongqing is quietly watching whether Japan's new policy is deception or a genuine article. When this genuine new policy is put into practice in Shanghai, the incident will be resolved immediately, and the resolution of the Greater East Asia War lies in the handling of the China Incident. Therefore, the 100,000 of you in Shanghai hold the key to handling this incident. On November 25th, I was ordered by the Military Commander to go to Fenghua, Zhejiang, to sweep the tomb of Chiang Kai-shek's mother, which had not been worshipped for seven or eight years due to the war. Together with a Lieutenant General sent by Chairman Wang, we took an airplane from Shanghai with the largest wreath. Fenghua is in the middle of the front line between us and them. We gathered the Chinese people and said that Chiang Kai-shek is a hero produced by your hometown, and it is not appropriate for his mother's tomb to be so desolate. Japan's morality is such that even in the case of warring enemies, we also show compassion. Therefore, we called on both sides to "lift all alerts" and asked fifty believers to perform a grand ceremony for one week. Relatives of Chiang residing in the area controlled by Chongqing also came to worship, shedding tears. I said to the local residents:

"Please tell Chiang Kai-shek that even if it takes five or ten years, please fight with peace of mind. During the war, the Japanese army will guard Chiang's mother's tomb. War and morality are two different things, and we will defend it to the last soldier. This is Japan's morality."

These words are neither flattery nor tactics, but entirely due to the inexpressible emotions of the Japanese military commander.

Earnestly Practice the Spirit of Morality

At this time of high prices, I heard that the campaign to donate aircraft by various Baojia has been very successful, and I am truly grateful. In Qingjia Lock in North China, the residents of the thirty-seven villages of Manchu-Mongolian Woolen Textiles have completely integrated and protect it as their own factory. This is one example. I often hear that there are many good deeds done in Shanghai. If we treat people with sincerity, we will definitely have followers. What is regrettable is that our soldiers, who have power and authority, still lack self-discipline, and this point must be improved. When dying soldiers donate money from their savings in their backpacks to build aircraft, if 100 million people fully embody the spirit of these soldiers and become one, what is there to fear from Britain and the United States? Even if the Marshall Islands are occupied and the Philippines are occupied, we will annihilate the enemy in Hakata Bay, the waters near the Ogasawara Islands, and Tokyo Bay. In the current war situation, do not be elated by one victory or worried by one defeat, but have a thorough understanding of the fundamental meaning of the national polity and act with unwavering determination and a belief in certain victory. Moreover, we hope that when Japan's original face is revealed and morality is practiced, the Greater East Asia War can be brought to an end in China. In this way, we can become the leader of East Asia without seeking it. If we do not do what we should do, act immorally, or insult the Chinese, no one will follow us. To be a leader, you cannot demand it, but must earn it. It is never the goal, but the result. In this speech, I reported on what kind of mindset the First Division Commander has to overcome this difficult situation, hoping that 10,000 overseas residents will practice morality in China, where the victory or defeat of this decisive Greater East Asia War will be determined. Your righteous actions will be reflected in Chongqing, reflected in the world, and will instill Japanese justice into the hearts of the enemy. Now it is our turn to have the hearts of those dying soldiers as our own. Please, 100,000 of you, practice this righteousness and complete the Greater East Asia War. (End) (Hongying: From the February 9th Continental New Daily)

### Joint Meeting of the Rice Control Commission Concludes Successfully Yesterday; Many Proposals Approved and Declaration Issued

Central News Agency Report: The Rice Control Commission continued its meeting in the main auditorium of the association at 2:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Director Yuan Zuren. Present were the vice-directors, Chinese and Japanese commissioners, key staff members of the association, and directors and inspectors of the regional offices. The meeting continued until approximately 6:00 PM, when all agenda items were voted on and passed. Director Yuan then instructed all staff members to work diligently in their respective positions and live up to the expectations of all sectors. He also read the declaration of the meeting. The meeting lasted three days before concluding. More than seventy proposals were divided into small groups for research, based on reports and resolutions of proposals. Design committees for personnel and operations were established, divided into seven groups to address the consolidation or separation of offices, personnel adjustments, procurement expansion, capital utilization, transportation, and other issues. The committees will also propose measures to the government to effectively implement inspections of smuggling and hoarding to suppress rice prices, so that future work plans can be implemented gradually.

### Declaration of the Joint Meeting of the Rice Control Commission

Our commission has a history of over four months since its establishment on October 1st of last year. These four months of history truthfully and clearly tell us that in the current special environment, handling rice control affairs is indeed not an easy task. "One does not know the difficulty until one has experienced it." Indeed, it is not something that onlookers can imagine based on superficial speculation. Even for those of us who are personally involved, at the beginning of the operation, even if we had anticipated the complexity of the affairs and the arduousness of the responsibilities, after starting to work, difficulties arose one after another, and thorns grew everywhere. The degree of complexity and arduousness exceeded our expectations by more than ten times. However, since we have already undertaken it, we must not be negligent because of the complexity or timid because of the arduousness. We can only concentrate our minds, proceed prudently, and work hard day and night, hoping that we will not fail the government's trust above and that we will be worthy of the people's hopes below. This is the past situation of the commission's work.

Affairs are Pioneering and Responsibilities are Heavy

When the commission was first established, the government appointed a dozen or so commissioners, and the commission hired hundreds of internal and external staff. At the same time, a group of rice merchants in various regions were designated as purchasing agents. Under this mixed organization, the situation of rice control was unfolded. However, the commissioners and staff members may not all be familiar with the strategies of control. As a result, both sides lacked relative experience. When the association's affairs were unfolded and work was underway, apart from using the abstract phrase of "dedication to public service and abiding by the law" as a common oath, we had to discuss and exchange knowledge with each other at any time, working and learning at the same time. Therefore, at least half of all facilities have a experimental nature. May I ask, how many people in the current society are veterans of rice control? Only because the affairs are pioneering, the staff are numerous, and at the same time constrained by the environment, if we want to achieve remarkable results, then we are very ashamed that we do not have this innate ability. However, in these short four months, we have indeed achieved considerable achievements. Even if we dare not claim credit, we can also plead not guilty. Especially during these four months, we encountered many difficulties and received many lessons, which increased our knowledge and gained many experiences, which can be used as a model for future progress. This is the initial harvest of the commission.

Earnestly Review Past Situations

Now it is already the first month of the Lunar New Year, "The plan for the year lies in spring," which is the time for people to determine the grand plan for the year. Since the commission bears arduous tasks and already has a history of more than four months, it should use objective reason to properly review the past situation. How to make those good facilities permanently continue and carry forward, how to gradually eliminate and prevent those bad situations, how to promote benefits and eliminate drawbacks, how to overcome difficulties, should also be discussed by all internal and external rice control practitioners to obtain a result. Furthermore, since the regional offices departed for service on the ground in October last year, there has been little contact between the Shanghai General Association and the respective offices. Now everyone should gather together once, face-to-face to discuss business and exchange opinions. As for connecting emotions with each other, it is still a matter of leisure. Therefore, it was decided to convene a joint meeting for three days from February 15th to 17th. This is the reason for convening this joint meeting.

Meeting Focuses on Suppressing Rice Prices

Because rice is too closely related to the people, every person in the country is actively concerned about this commission. Especially at the current time when rice prices are soaring, who among the commission, from the director to the employees, is not threatened by high prices because of eating rice? Our sincere and urgent desire to suppress rice prices is definitely not below that of the general public. We are very willing to exhaust all efforts and methods to implement measures to suppress rice prices. Fortunately, there is this opportunity for a joint meeting. Therefore, we will take "suppressing rice prices" as the central purpose of this joint meeting, hoping to be on the meeting seat. Concentrate the will of all attendees from China and abroad to generate a rapid and effective concrete countermeasure. However, after three days of continuous discussion by all personnel, we felt that the reasons for soaring rice prices are very complex and very tortuous. If you want to achieve the goal of suppressing rice prices, you still have to start by strengthening the work of each part of the commission, and at the same time, improve the environment in all aspects to assist. Improving the environment is not something that the commission can do with unilateral strength, but strengthening internal work is the responsibility that the commission should bear. Looking at the proposals received this time, most of them are about "procurement", "transportation", "storage", and "distribution" issues. If there are effective ways to solve these four points, then procurement will be smooth, transportation will be smooth, storage will be abundant, and distribution will be appropriate. The black market of rice will have no way to occur, and the rice price will be suppressed without suppression. Therefore, although the reasons for the proposals at this meeting are different. The methods are easy to change. However, different routes lead to the same destination. The sum of their respective giant objectives can be said to be "suppressing the rice price". This is the first point that this meeting wants to announce to the society.

Make the Greatest Efforts and Turn it into Facts

After these three days of meetings, all of the sixty or so proposals, whether passed or not passed, have finally had a result. Someone said, "I'm just afraid of discussing without deciding, and deciding without acting." We can now solemnly tell the society that all the proposals, fortunately, do not have the weakness of "discussing without deciding." As for whether they can be implemented after the decision, then we can also be responsible for reporting to the society that we have made the greatest efforts to make each thing come true. However, I said earlier that in addition to strengthening our own work, we also need to improve the environment in all aspects to assist us. I am not sure whether the environment in all aspects can be improved in the future, and I can certainly not answer this difficult question. However, I hope that the people in charge of all aspects will share the difficulties of the times and wholeheartedly guide this commission. Anything that directly benefits food affairs, I hope will be maintained as much as possible. Anything that hinders food affairs, I hope will be eliminated quickly. Contributing more effort to the commission is helping more with the people's food. I think all of us compatriots can definitely accept this request, because we all eat rice and are all threatened by high prices. This is the second point that this meeting wants to announce to the society.

Now the meeting has ended. Although we dare not say what kind of progress there will be in the future, there will at least be some new developments. I hope that people from all walks of life will provide guidance and work together to promote progress. The commission sincerely and eagerly looks forward to it at any time.

### British Rule in India Will Ultimately Fail: Impressions of Information Minister Matsudaira

Central News Agency Report: The regular press conference held by the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy in China, originally scheduled to be held every Thursday, has been informed that the embassy's Bureau will change it to 2:00 PM every Monday from next week. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, it was held at the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road. Information Minister Matsudaira, Vice-Consul Fukuma, and others attended. During the session, Minister Matsudaira expressed his impressions of British rule in India.

Glimpses of British Rule in India

Minister Matsudaira first said: The population of India is 350 million, of which Caucasians account for 600,000, including 200,000 British people. From this, it can be seen that one British person rules as many as 1.75 million Indians. The minister also said: Referring to the Indian Yearbook, in the Indian army, the ratio of British to Indian troops is 80% British and 20% Indian. At the same time, the Indian navy is entirely controlled by the British military. There is absolutely no Indian involvement in it, while in the army, most of the officers are British. Even if they are outstanding members of the Indian army, they can only hold positions below lieutenant in the Indian army. This is expressly stipulated in Indian law. It is bound to be met with dissatisfaction from Indians. As a result, they will inevitably escape and join the New National Army.

Independence Movement Proceeds Quietly

Two or three years ago, the policies adopted by Britain towards India, in our observation, had already failed, and British Prime Minister Churchill even despised the Indians. After Indian independence leader Gandhi was imprisoned the year before, his wife and children were also imprisoned. Britain's violent attitude, on the surface, may seem to be successful, and the momentum of India's independence movement has eased. However, this vicious means has deepened the hatred of the Indians towards Britain. Therefore, the work of India's independence is progressing quite rapidly in secret, especially at the lower levels, and is being promoted universally. To this day, the spirit of India's independence is more profound than in the past. Therefore, Britain's means have failed. Minister Matsudaira said: Foreign Minister Shigemitsu is quite familiar with the situation of British rule in India. When Prime Minister Churchill sent Cripps to India last time, he had the impression that Cripps was sympathetic to India. As a result, Churchill's policy of oppressing India was not realized. Therefore, we predicted that Britain would soon fail, and we firmly believe that in the Second World War, Britain will often fail. Those who can grasp the world's power, their destiny is only three or four hundred years. Therefore, the historical destiny of Britain in recent times will undoubtedly fail. Minister Matsudaira finally said that the day India's independence is completed will be the day Britain collapses and fails.

### President Nagao of Wakasu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Arrives in Shanghai; Three Organizations Host a Dinner Reception Last Night

Mr. Nagao Kinmi, President of Wakasu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. of Japan, recently came to Shanghai from Tokyo on business. The Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Xinwenbao, and this newspaper jointly hosted a dinner reception at the Huajia Club Pharmacy Department last night. President Nagao arrived on time. Also present were Okabe, Kurimoto, Shibata, Kodama, Yoshida, Takeuchi, Yokota, Koyama, Morimoto, Miyake, Lin Junfu, Hidaka, Wen Lantin (representing Chen Bingkun), Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Xia Qifeng, Gu Nanqun, Yao Junzhi, Xu Guanqun, Wu Yunzhai, Huang Jingqi, Li Quanshi, Lu Feng, Zheng Hongyan, Chen Binsu, and dozens of others. The atmosphere was quite enthusiastic. Lin Kanghou delivered a welcome speech, followed by President Nagao's speech, the original words of which are as follows:

President Nagao's Speech

I visited Shanghai last year, and at that time, I saw that the prices in Shanghai were much higher than I had imagined in Japan. I already felt the difficulties of Chinese life. But now the prices are even more surprisingly expensive than at that time. I deeply sympathize with the suffering of the Chinese people. The cause of the high prices in China can be said to be caused by the ambition of the British and Americans to invade East Asia. To solve this problem, the only thing that must be done is that China and Japan should thoroughly cooperate, smash the enemy's British and American strategies, and build an ideal state of Greater East Asia where coexistence and co-prosperity and peaceful and happy lives can be achieved.

Currently, there is a great shortage of medicines in China, and I express my deep sympathy for this. Medicines in China, from the time of Shennong, have been as important as food, becoming indispensable items in human life. I always use the stance of a pharmaceutical manufacturer to provide various forms of cooperation for pharmaceutical manufacturing, in terms of technology and in any other aspect.

Especially now that food prices are expensive, the fundamental cause is still due to the reduction in rice production and transportation difficulties. Most of the Chinese people are engaged in agriculture, but on the one hand, the income from agricultural products is reduced, and on the other hand, they have to buy expensive daily necessities. Once they get sick, they cannot get enough medicine. This is a very serious problem. This time I have come to Shanghai hoping to cooperate with influential people in Chinese society to manufacture medicines needed by the general rural population in China, in order to provide relief. The world's pharmaceutical industry has now reached the era of vitamins. In Japan, "Wakasu" is no longer regarded as a medicine, but as a food. In general household life, its status is second only to rice as a staple food, and it is indispensable for all three meals a day.

I hope that this extremely vitamin-rich agent can also be produced in China and supplied to the general market at the lowest price. In this way, it will definitely be of great benefit to the health of the Chinese people. The strength of a country is based on the health of its people. I hope that this necessary medicine can be easily obtained by people all over China, and at the same time, it can jump out of this high-price circle, so that this healthy and beneficial ideal can be realized, and that it can also help to suppress the rise in general prices. That is what is even more hopeful.

### The Great Sincerity Silk Factory and Colleagues Continue to Donate Funds for Education: Yesterday Donated 50,000 Yuan in Educational Grants

Our newspaper received a letter yesterday from Song Baolin, Yang Weiqun, and other colleagues of the Great Sincerity Silk Factory and all its employees, stating: "Our factory colleagues donated 10,000 yuan for educational grants for the third time last summer vacation to reward underprivileged junior and senior high school students. At that time, we drafted six regulations and sent them to your office, which you kindly followed. Our factory colleagues have now raised another 50,000 yuan to reward outstanding students. The number of recipients and the amount of the grants have both been increased. We are sending a check for 50,000 yuan and a revised set of regulations for the grant, please accept them."
