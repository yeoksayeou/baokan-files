### Countermeasures to the Food Problem

According to general estimates, Shanghai has a population of five million, with the First District being particularly densely populated. Shanghai is a city, not a rural area, and does not produce grain. In other words, the five million people in Shanghai are all consumers of rice and grain, not producers. Therefore, when rice and grain become a problem, Shanghai feels it especially acutely. The current rice and grain problem facing Shanghai is a concrete illustration of this.

After rice prices rose again in the past week, they have now reached a natural standstill. The relevant authorities are actively trying to procure supplies and unblock sources, as well as crack down on hoarding and manipulation. However, before effective regulatory measures are obtained, rather than simply hoping that rice prices will fall, it is better to earnestly do a few things that can promote a decline in prices, doing one thing at a time, even if it's only a small step.

In our editorial on the tenth of this month, we made a suggestion that the municipal authorities should raise funds, or borrow cash from national banks, to purchase rice and grains and distribute them specifically to laborers and wage earners. Now we further supplement this with the following suggestions:

(1) Those in Shanghai who have no legitimate occupation, or who have no occupation and attempt to engage in speculative business, or who have an occupation but whose income is too meager to maintain a living, should be promptly dispersed back to their hometowns. In recent years, a large number of people from various places have come to Shanghai to seek refuge. These people all have residences and property in their hometowns. Coming to Shanghai for temporary refuge was originally a temporary expedient. They have no legitimate occupation in Shanghai, but only raise a small amount of capital and initially speculate in cotton yarn and foreign exchange. Later, they hoard goods for speculation, and even later buy and sell stocks, and even frequent the gambling dens in the South City, regarding such things as "occupations" to maintain their expatriate lives. The current environment is not what it used to be. What was once considered a golden age now offers no opportunities for speculation. They should return to their hometowns in a timely manner. Secondly, those in Shanghai who have no legitimate occupation or whose occupation is insufficient to maintain a living, rather than sitting in Shanghai worrying and starving every meal, should take their families back to their hometowns, at least making it easier to solve the problem of food. We hope that the municipal authorities will set up a registration office to assist in returning to hometowns, register those who request assistance in returning to their hometowns, and provide subsidies for travel expenses. On the one hand, the government should contact the China Central Railway Authority and various shipping companies to designate means of transportation to carry people back to their hometowns. Furthermore, according to the 保甲 (bao jia) system, those without legitimate occupations, even if they can maintain a living on their own, should also be urged to return to their hometowns in order to reduce Shanghai's food consumption and maintain the food supply for those who must stay in Shanghai to work.

(2) Promote the consumption of mixed grains. Originally, in addition to rice, there are also corn, wheat, beans, sweet potatoes, etc., that can fill the stomach. In the Jiangbei areas that do not produce rice but only produce miscellaneous grains, miscellaneous grains are the regular food. In terms of nutritional value, miscellaneous grains are by no means inferior to rice. People in Shanghai often have a misconception that miscellaneous grains are eaten by the lower classes, or even by livestock. However, the current reality is that it is not easy to have miscellaneous grains to eat. We hope that citizens will recognize the reality, correct the misconception of valuing rice and despising miscellaneous grains, and use miscellaneous grains in their daily meals in order to reduce the seriousness of the need for rice.

Finally, we hope that the municipal authorities will quickly procure rice and grains, manage the rice and grain supply, and offer fair prices, first to laborers and low-wage earners. The problem of food for the people in cold weather and the problem of high rice prices cannot be effectively resolved without taking active and passive countermeasures from all aspects, both fundamental and symptomatic. We hope that the authorities will supervise from above and the citizens will comply from below, and together strive to solve the problem.

### The Japanese Army Has Occupied Sattibi Near Bixianpol and Is Besieging It; Fighting Near Kohima Will Intensify

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 13th – The Japanese army units attacking Bixianpol have been continuously reinforced with new troops. On the morning of the 6th, they launched an offensive against the enemy's strong defensive positions around the area. Due to the brave fighting of the infantry, artillery, and engineers, they occupied Sattibi (ten kilometers southwest of Bixianpol) by evening and rapidly pursued the defeated enemy along with Kubimore (eight kilometers southwest of Bixianpol). The elite Japanese troops in that area are fiercely attacking near Posaha and have re-established contact with friendly forces near Yurok, northwest of Bixianpol, and are currently intensifying their offensive against Bixianpol.

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 13th – The enemy army rushed madly between Imphal and Bixianpol, doing its best to stop the Japanese army's advance. After days of fierce attacks by the Japanese army, they finally succumbed and have abandoned their activities in that area. The troops in the Parrel area have also moved to Kohima to open a path of escape eastward with all their strength. On the 7th, with more than 20 tanks and over 1,000 troops, they began to break into Japanese-held Hill 5.521 (20 kilometers north of Imphal). After being attacked by the local Japanese troops, more than a dozen tanks were destroyed on the 7th, and the enemy lost most of its strength. On the 8th, the enemy seemed to be making futile attacks. The fighting in that area will inevitably become more intense.

### The Battle Outside Changsha Is Extremely Fierce; Heavy Fighting Is Also Taking Place Around Songxian County in Henan Province

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 13th – A dispatch from Chongqing states that the Japanese army is currently bombarding the walls of Changsha.

Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th – According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission announced on the 12th that the fierce fighting outside Changsha intensified on the 11th. Under the cover of intense bombardment day and night, the Japanese army launched an all-out attack. After a day of intense fighting, both sides suffered heavy losses. The Japanese army attempted to cross the Liuyang River about 20 kilometers east of Changsha, and also attempted to cross the Laodao River four kilometers northeast of Changsha. The fighting in Liuyang, 60 kilometers east of Changsha, is currently raging. In addition, the Japanese army in Yiyang on the south bank of Dongting Lake has advanced to a point ten kilometers south of Lanxi, southeast of Yiyang. Japanese aircraft cooperated with the frontline Japanese army on the morning of the 12th and bombed Xiangxiang in the afternoon, causing several fires.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 13th – According to a dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing military authorities announced the battle situation in Hunan and Henan on the 12th as follows: (1) On the Hunan front, from the morning to late at night of the 11th, the Japanese army around Changsha fiercely pursued Changsha City. The fighting on the outer defensive line of the city has reached its most intense stage. The Japanese troops advancing from the east have occupied a position nine and a half kilometers from Changsha, attempting to cross the last defensive line, the Liuyang River. (2) On the Henan front, the fighting in the Lingbao area south of the Longhai Railway line continues. Heavy fighting is also taking place around Songxian County south of Luoyang. The Japanese army will advance after the tank units arrive. The fighting in Songxian is now shifting to the east of the city.

Central News Agency, Luoyang, 13th – After the Japanese army captured Luoyang, it opened a direct path to the west, causing great embarrassment to Chongqing. Hu Zongnan is actively defending Xi'an, gathering troops, and strictly guarding Tongguan. The remnants of Tang Enbo's army are reorganizing their forces near Songxian, with Deputy Chief of Staff Liu Zhanxu encouraging his subordinates and requesting Chiang Kai-shek to send air force to bomb Songxian in an attempt to counterattack. Jiang Dingwen, commander of the First War Zone, is still working with Tang Enbo. Under fierce attacks by Japanese commandoes, they are now using Lushi as their base and working hard to reorganize their formation. The Japanese army on the Henan front is taking the fall of Luoyang as a turning point and is closely monitoring the enemy's counterattack attempts while also reorganizing its front lines.

Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th – According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Chongqing, Chongqing announced on the 12th that the fighting in Henan Province is continuing in the western part of the province, especially fierce near Lingbao (a key point on the Longhai Railway line).

"Significance of the Henan Operation" Broadcast by the Japanese Army Headquarters

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th – The Japanese Army Headquarters broadcast the following under the title "Significance of the Henan Operation": The Chongqing Central Society announced on May 29 that the fall of Luoyang has dealt a major blow to Chongqing militarily and politically. From this, it is clear how significant the fall of Luoyang is. Although Jiang Dingwen is the commander-in-chief of the First War Zone in Chongqing, the real power is in the hands of Commander Tang Enbo. Tang enjoys Chiang Kai-shek's trust and has been working to strengthen the defenses of the Henan area since February of this year, and has also promoted the so-called general counteroffensive in June. However, this elite direct-line troop of Chongqing not only failed to achieve any results in carrying out the general counteroffensive in a short period of time, but also collapsed and fled in all directions. This is not only true for Chongqing, but also for Britain and the United States, which used Chongqing to launch a counteroffensive against Japan. The air bases built by the United States were not built for Chongqing's sake, but for their own interests, in an attempt to bomb Japan. This time, the Japanese army took preemptive action, preventing the U.S. air force stationed in Chongqing from operating, which is gratifying. Now, the United States is reorganizing its forces and conducting aerial transport to Chongqing via India. However, of the less than 10,000 tons of aid materials transported to Chongqing each month, 70-80% is used by the Chongqing-U.S. air force. In addition, the spokesperson of the National Government also broadcast to Chongqing, saying that Chongqing is now using its blind resistance mentality to allow Britain and the United States to invade its vast territory, which is the act of a traitor. Now Japan is implementing a new policy towards China, which is no less than opening a bright path for China. This Japanese military operation is a military action against Britain and the United States, as mentioned above, which is a quick and insightful comment. The granary area in Henan has now been spared the exploitation and war disasters of the Chongqing army, and this year Henan has a bumper harvest of rice and wheat, with a harvest that can last for almost three years. Because of the opening of the Pinghan Railway, the Chinese people in North China and Central China have very bright hopes. When Zhengzhou fell and Luoyang fell, prices in Beiping fell by 10% to 50%. The allocation of wheat flour to Beiping citizens has increased by 20%. Therefore, the citizens are very happy about the Japanese army's occupation this time. Therefore, this operation is of great benefit to the livelihood of the Chinese people, which is by no means insignificant. The significance of this operation lies in this.

### Amidst the Sounds of the Invasion of Europe: The Situation in the Balkans; Germany's Military and Political Measures Are Quite Effective

Central News Agency, Budapest, 13th – Since the Axis forces withdrew from Rome and the anti-Axis forces began landing operations in Europe, the situation in the Balkan countries has suddenly become tense. However, they are increasingly relying on the German army's full preparations, so there are no signs of any dangerous omens. It is said that the focus of attention of the Balkan countries is twofold: (1) The offensive of the Soviet army against the Carpathian Mountains in Hungary and the Danube Delta; secondly, the possibility of the anti-Axis forces entering Rome, landing on the other side of the Adriatic Sea, or landing in Greece, and launching a Balkan operation, and their concern about the Soviet army's attack is said to be at its peak. The news frequently transmitted from Turkey that the anti-Axis forces' activities in the eastern Mediterranean are becoming more active is also attracting attention. Under this situation, the most thought-provoking things are three: First, the new Chief of Staff of the Hungarian Prime Minister visited the German leader's headquarters, which is considered to imply Hungary's full cooperation with the German army. (2) The elite troops of the Bulgarian army are also responsible for the defense of Hungary's front line, and it is said that a new mobilization plan has been prepared, and part of it has already been mobilized. These new trends in the two countries have shown the strengthening of Romania's anti-Soviet posture and Germany's ability to control the Balkans. (3) Croatia is also cooperating with the German army to wipe out Tito's remnants. In addition, Turkey's offensive operation is also of great concern. Some pro-British and American factions in the Turkish political circles have become active. No matter what kind of situation will develop in the future, today's Turkey has more value for vigilance than ever before. In short, Germany's military and political measures, which have been painstakingly managed for these two fronts, have been quite effective so far.

### The Main Force of the German Army on the Right Wing in Italy Is Withdrawing Northward

Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th – Huitong News Agency reports: The German army's evacuation operation in Italy is still proceeding according to the original plan. Due to the terrain, the withdrawal of the German army on the right wing is very rapid. The German army on the Adriatic coast is moving more slowly due to the obstacles of the Apennine Mountains. The main force of the German army north of Rome has withdrawn to Monte Vercino.

### The Focus of the Battle in Northern France Shifts to the Upper Reaches of the Vire River; A Fierce Battle Is Underway Southeast of Carentan

Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th – The German military authorities announced on the 12th that the U.S. military troops, after suffering heavy casualties, managed to break into the city of Carentan.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th – The German military authorities announced on the 12th that the anti-Axis forces have landed on the Vire River.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th – The German military authorities announced on the 12th that the area outside Saint-Lo near the upper reaches of the Vire River has become a new target of the anti-Axis forces' attacks.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th – Huitong News reports: According to reliable sources, the U.S. military attacked between Carentan and Seigny in an attempt to cut off the Normandy Peninsula. They occupied Carentan yesterday morning and established a bridgehead on the east bank of the Vire River, which has fallen into a stalemate. This attack failed to cut off the Cherbourg Peninsula. The U.S. tank units that attacked Cherbourg to the north have been transferred to the Vire River area. The anti-Axis forces are now shifting their target to Saint-Lo in the middle of the Vire River. The Cher army is attempting to advance westward from here to the west coast of the Normandy Peninsula. The German army is guarding the Lele pass outside Saint-Lo, which can defeat the many with the few, so the great battle has not yet begun. Yesterday, the British army fought with tanks between Caen and Bretteville south of the Seine Bay in an attempt to expand its bridgehead and is still protected by naval gunfire.

The Garrison Is Determined to Die Rather Than Surrender

Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th – According to front-line news: Colonel Erke, the commander of a coastal fortress surrounded by anti-Axis forces, reported to the command of the Lower Army: We are determined to follow the orders of the Führer Hitler and fight the enemy to the end.

Tiger Tanks Participate in the Counterattack

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 13th – Huitong News Agency reports: According to a United Press staff member, the German army launched a counterattack with sixty-ton Tiger tanks in front of Thierville, about thirty miles southeast of Carentan, in an attempt to break through the enemy's coastal positions and reach the sea. The British army is currently fighting to the death to hold the position. It is also said that the German air force's resistance has increased, but it is difficult to determine whether it is local in nature or the beginning of a major air battle.

The Enemy's Bridgehead Expands

Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th – According to the military, the anti-Axis forces' bridgehead, from the start of the landing operation to the seventh day, stretched 80 kilometers horizontally and 16 kilometers vertically.

Hamilton Aircraft Shot Down Seven

Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th – The German night fighter squadron crushed a powerful British night fighter squadron on the night of the 11th, violently attacking the anti-Axis airborne troops and shooting down seven large British Hamilton gliders. The Hamilton glider is longer than a four-engine bomber and can carry medium-sized tanks and 120 soldiers.

### Churchill and Others Inspect the Front Line

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 13th – British Prime Minister Churchill, accompanied by South African Prime Minister Smuts, inspected the northern French front line and the American-held bridgehead on the 12th.

### Roosevelt Broadcasts, Explaining the Battle Situation

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 13th – According to a dispatch from Washington: Roosevelt broadcast yesterday, saying in essence: The anti-Axis forces are currently attacking Germany on three fronts. In the landing operation in northern France, the consumption of the anti-Axis forces in terms of manpower and material resources is very large, but still less than expected. Millions of tons of weapons and military supplies and hundreds of thousands of soldiers gathered in the British mainland have been successively transported to the European theater, and this situation must continue to be maintained in the future. The landing operation is currently in full swing, but we cannot ignore the battle lines around the world because of this landing operation in northern France. If we fail to recognize the interrelationship of all the battle lines, we cannot properly estimate the importance of each battle line.

### Former Ambassador to Italy, Mr. Horikiri, Returns Home

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th – Mr. Horikiri Zen'ei, former Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Italy, returned to Tokyo via Siberia on the afternoon of the 13th. The ambassador went to Rome in December of Showa 15 (1940) and devoted himself to strengthening the relationship between Japan and Italy. After Ambassador Nichitaka arrived in Rome in Showa 18, Mr. Horikiri visited various parts of Europe as an Ambassador Extraordinary and contributed greatly to Japan's wartime diplomacy.

The Main Force of the German Air Force Is Dispatched: Fierce Air Battle on the French Coast

Inflicting Serious Damage on the Invading European Army

Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th – German News Agency reports: A larger formation of German fighters engaged in multiple air battles with superior numbers of enemy aircraft on the 12th, and patrolled over the Normandy coast. When the German aircraft implemented air control, fierce air battles broke out with British and American fighter-bombers. The area near Caen was even more intense. Although the enemy aircraft were superior in number, they were eventually repelled. During the air battle, German main force aircraft and fighter-bombers carried out low-altitude attacks on enemy tank columns and rear supply depots, causing multiple fires and explosions, and used machine guns to strafe, inflicting serious casualties on British and American infantry. Some enemy tanks caught fire after being hit.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 13th – Since the beginning of the war in northern France, the anti-Axis forces have dispatched a powerful air force to assist the army in combat. As a result, the German air force's strength has been relatively weak, which is the most noteworthy special phenomenon in the northern French war situation. On the 12th, the weather recovered, providing the best opportunity for air force activity, so the main force of the German air force that was waiting for an opportunity was dispatched immediately. According to a dispatch from London, the enemy also admitted that a Reuters reporter reported that the German air force had decided to compete with the anti-Axis air force. On the 12th, the German fighter squadron had begun to operate on all fronts in northern France. At the same time, the anti-Axis air force continued to send troops to northern France, and a fierce air battle is likely to unfold in the skies of northern France recently.

### A Fierce Battle Unfolded Over Truk Island

Enemy Aircraft Repelled Attacking Manokwari

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th – Thirteen enemy B38 aircraft attacked Truk Island on the 10th. On the morning of the 11th, 26 aircraft of the same type attacked again. All Japanese fighter squadrons immediately engaged them in a fierce battle, shooting down two on the 10th and one on the 11th. There were no losses on the Japanese side. In addition, on the morning of the 10th, 18 enemy B24 aircraft and 15 P38 aircraft attacked Manokwari in western New Guinea. After being intercepted by Japanese aircraft, four were shot down and the rest fled.

### Impartial and Calm Discussion of China by Mikio Yuzawa

The 100 million Japanese citizens cannot forget for even a moment: The Greater East Asia War was a head-on blow to England and America, who were aiding the remaining Chongqing regime, stirring up chaos in East Asia, and seeking to gain leadership of East Asia in the name of peace but in reality. It shattered their grasping hands reaching into East Asia and laid the foundation for lasting peace in East Asia.

I didn’t have much connection with China in the past. However, in the spring of 1938, I was hired as an administrative advisor to the North China Dispatch Army and the Provisional Government for about two years. During that time, I assisted in various construction projects amidst the flames of war, and I gradually developed a deep concern and affection for China. Anyone who has had any dealings with China shares the same feelings in eight or nine out of ten cases. Even though it's the same East Asia, China has everything that other countries don’t. This proves that China is a large and populous country.

Regarding the China problem, anyone who has stayed in China for a month, or five or six old Japanese residents, or even those who have never seen a Chinese person, can offer insightful criticism. Among Europeans and Americans, there are those who do not understand Chinese or Chinese characters at all but have become world-renowned experts on Chinese issues. My impressions of China are, of course, nothing more than superficial common opinions. What I hope Japanese compatriots should pay special attention to is the patriotic spirit of modern Chinese people.

Whenever Chinese people are mentioned, people often associate them with Jews, thinking them selfish and self-serving, harming others for their own benefit, lacking a sense of national identity, and devoid of national consciousness. But modern Chinese people, Chinese intellectuals, are definitely not the kind of people who are scorned in this way.

At the beginning of the July 7th Incident, we Japanese did not see this point. Everyone speculated: If we conquer Nanjing, the Chiang regime will surrender! When the Greater East Asia War broke out, everyone overestimated that the English, American, and Chiang regimes would collapse. However, speculation is speculation, and it has not been realized. At the same time, facts contrary to our speculation, such as the recent strengthening of the US Air Force stationed in China, and the active movements of the Chongqing army on the border between Burma, India, and China, are increasing day by day. Although the Chiang regime will never become consolidated, the people's anti-Japanese consciousness will not decline that much.

What is going on? We Japanese citizens already know that this is due to the strong patriotic spirit of the intellectuals in the middle class of China.

The fundamental spirit is the idea of unanimous resistance against foreign enemies, especially the so-called resistance consciousness that has joined forces with the Communist Party. This anti-Japanese sentiment is already deeply rooted and pervasive among the people. Do not ignore that the figures who lead Chinese politics, whether on the side of the National Government or the Chiang regime, are not selfish and self-serving, but have a great patriotic spirit of sacrificing themselves to save others. Do not escape reality, but face squarely the surging spirit of these powerful leaders in China, the noble spirit of defending their homeland and liberating their nation.

The Chinese masses, needless to say, are eighty or ninety percent farmers. They are ignorant and uneducated and only have the thought of paying taxes to whoever is in charge. But the intellectuals who command and lead this class are full of enthusiasm and are patriots who swear to defend the Chinese nation.

Their ancestors, in the past, in order to save the country from danger, participated in the Opium War, the Taiping Rebellion, the Guangdong Coup, and the Boxer Rebellion, etc., with a heroic spirit and self-sacrifice, wanting to expel the imperialism of Europe and America. Such a middle class with tradition, such as university students and elementary school teachers, have a burning anti-Japanese fire in their hearts and constantly reach out to the Chongqing regime, which they believe is the place to be loyal to the country. If these Chinese youth, the mainstay with a strong patriotic enthusiasm, believe in the supreme ideals of the Japanese Empire, then the Chinese people will be able to realize that resistance is wrong, and then the flames of war that engulf the whole of China will disappear on their own, and the peace that the Chinese people love most will be produced. But winning the confidence of this group of Chinese intellectuals is indeed a difficult task. That is to say, since the July 7th Incident, to what extent has Japan gained the hearts of the Chinese people? This is something that must be deeply reflected upon.

Regarding this point, I remember not long ago (February 5th of this year), Army Colonel Masanobu Tsuji, in Shanghai, made a statement: "I have been in charge of turning things around in various places before. At first, I fought against the 19th Route Army of Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai, then I fought against the Central Army of Chongqing in Shanxi, then I fought against the Soviet army in Nomonhan, then I fought against the British and Indian army in Malaya, then I fought against the American and Filipino army in Bataan, and then I fought against the American and Australian army in the Solomon Islands. But the strongest army should be counted as the Chinese." If they fought with the same equipment and on the same battlefield, then the Central Army of China would be second to none. The next is the Soviet army, because they have Eastern blood. Next are the United States, England, and Australia. If this strong and powerful China and our even stronger Japan fully cooperate, I firmly believe that even if all the countries in the world come to oppose our world's strongest five million people, it would not be enough to weigh against us. China, be strong! Strive to be strong! At the same time, we are even stronger.

Colonel Tsuji also said: "If one million Japanese military, government, and civilians stationed in China each gain a Chinese comrade, that is, have one million Chinese people as true intimate comrades, then the incident should be solved easily. Chongqing is watching the current situation in Shanghai. Chongqing is quietly watching: Is Japan's new policy real? Or is it fake? When this new policy in Shanghai can be fully implemented without any discount, the incident will be resolved immediately."

Colonel Tsuji also knew that when Chiang Kai-shek's late mother's tomb in Fenghua was unattended, he issued a military order to hold a seven-day memorial service to show the world the "sincerity" of a Japanese samurai who values morality and righteousness. In the front line of the enemy, which is equal to the enemy's land, such a thing is done. What other country besides Japan would be willing to do this? The solution to the Greater East Asia War lies in dealing with the China problem. Thinking of this, the annoying Chinese resistance consciousness is also out of the sincere feelings of loving the motherland. At the same time, for Japan, this point can also constitute a condition for a strong and powerful comrade. Every Japanese compatriot can win the hearts of the Chinese people, and enable the government to effectively implement a consistent policy towards the masses. Only in this way can we defeat England and America on the broad road. (Translated by Lu from the Yomiuri Hochi Weekly Review, May 28)

### The Rice Control Association Issues Temporary Rice Transport Permits to Prevent Difficulties in Transporting Rice.

Since being ordered to ease movement restrictions, the Rice and Grain Control Association has promulgated public notices regarding the application, issuance, types, and uses of permits for transporting rice into Shanghai. Yesterday, it was learned that to facilitate the free transport of rice in quantities between five dou and ten shi by merchants and to avoid difficulties and exactions at the place of origin and along the way, the Association has authorized merchants to apply for permits directly from the Association at 305 Jing'an Temple Road, Shanghai, before the establishment of a temporary permit issuance office at the Association. It was also heard that the Association has temporarily exempted the designated purchase of rice varieties, which will further enrich the city's food supply.

### Strengthening Control Work, Reorganization of the Commerce Control Association, Chairman Tang's Resignation Approved

The National General Commercial Control Association, as a result of recent considerations by relevant central authorities, is deemed to require reorganization, which is said to be implemented soon.

### Arrest of Rice Profiteers Under Strict Interrogation

The Economic Security Division of the First Police Bureau of this city, in view of the recent soaring rice prices, which have seriously affected the people's livelihood, received a secret report on the 11th that a large number of rice merchants were gathering at the Gongping Tea House at 3 Chongqing Road and the Tea House at 7 Shandong Road, suspected of manipulating and hoarding rice. A large number of economic police were immediately dispatched to the above two locations to arrest more than two hundred rice merchants and bring them to the division for investigation. According to reporters, the division is planning to strictly interrogate these rice profiteers separately. Once the investigation is completed, the illegal rice merchants will be transferred to the District Procuratorate and submitted to the court for strict handling in accordance with the law. It is also heard that among these rice profiteers, if it is verified that there are criminals who have committed hoarding and manipulation, they will be sentenced to the extreme penalty to serve as a warning to others, to appease the people's livelihood, which is tantamount to giving the profiteers a head-on blow.

### Closure of Opium Sales and Smoking Dens, Announcement of Handling Measures, Registration of Smokers in Each District

Regarding the handling of opium sales and smoking dens in this city and the registration of smokers, citizens have been very concerned recently. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially inquired about the details from the Anti-Smoking Bureau of the Ministry of Interior yesterday, which are listed below: There were originally 197 opium sales and smoking dens in Shanghai, of which 100 were registered and approved to be licensed. The remaining 97 must be closed by May 31. The Anti-Smoking Bureau has notified the Preparatory Committee of the Special Industry General Association to inform the merchants with the license and requested the cooperation of the Second Police Bureau to ban them and order them to stop operations. It is now heard that the opium sales and smoking dens that have been licensed will also be completely closed by the end of June. This time, the Anti-Smoking Bureau is purely implementing Article 1, Item 2 of the Central Government's measures to prohibit opium sales and smoking dens within a limited time, and Article 2, Item 2 of the measures to ban opium sales and smoking dens. The registration of smokers in this city in the first to seventh districts is entrusted to the smoker registration offices established by the police bureaus in each district. In addition, the seven districts of Nanhui, Jiading, Chongming, Baoshan, Beiqiao, Fengxian, and Chuansha are handled by the directly affiliated offices of the Anti-Smoking Bureau, with the assistance of the local police authorities at any time. It is now heard that the registration in the area under the jurisdiction of the Second Police Bureau started in March of this month, and the registration in the area under the jurisdiction of the First Police Bureau started on the 10th of this month. It is heard that smokers are still enthusiastically applying for registration because the period within June is a free application registration period. After June 30, it will be the verification registration period. After registering and receiving a license, each smoker can purchase official-priced opium with the license. Otherwise, it is prohibited to purchase opium privately and smoke opium privately. The special industry association organized by the opium sales and smoking dens mentioned in yesterday's newspaper is an office established by members of Group C in the special industry association during the former Anti-Smoking Bureau era, not the special industry association.

### Chinese Rural Construction Association Welcomes Two Professors from Allied Nations

In order to welcome Professors Shigeji Ito and Kiyoshi Sasaki, two agronomists from the Allied nations who recently came to China, the Chinese Rural Construction Association held a tea party at the Japanese-Chinese Club at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (the 13th). In addition to Professors Ito and Sasaki, the Allied side included Assistant Professor Koyama, General Manager Yamada of the Koda Yarn Factory, Section Chief Sekiya, etc., as well as Committee Member Zhang Guoyuan, Committee Member Zhao Zhengping, Yan Qingxiang, Wang Jingyu, Lu Shuchen, He Weiling, Wang Zhaoji, Fu Dichen, Wu Yechang, and President Chen of this newspaper, and dozens of others. The chairman of the association, Jia Jianan, delivered a welcoming speech first.

Professor Ito's Speech

Professor Ito then delivered a speech, stating: I have not been here for long and do not have a deep understanding of your country's agriculture, but in order to develop China's agriculture, I cannot but pay attention to agricultural economics. However, China's agricultural economics cannot copy the interpretations of Europe and the United States. It must improve China's inherent agricultural economics. To revive China's rural areas, I am confident that the efforts of the agricultural experts present and the members of the Chinese Rural Construction Association will ensure the success of China's agriculture.

Professor Sasaki's Speech

Professor Sasaki then delivered a speech, stating that he was very happy to meet with everyone here after coming to China and was delighted to be able to gather here again. He had recently been to Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places and learned about the current situation of Chinese agriculture, the policies taken, and the general situation of rural areas. In his personal opinion, the agricultural situation in Central China is very similar to that of Japan, such as the small size of farmland, the main crop being rice, and the livestock being mostly sheep, which are all points common to the two countries. Recently, China has a production increase campaign, and Japan also has a production increase campaign, but the effect of China's production increase campaign is not as significant as that of Japan. For example, the rice production volume is only one-tenth of Japan's, and the livestock production volume is only one-half. Therefore, he firmly believes that if Japan's agricultural technology is imported into China, it will definitely help to complete a part of the production increase work, and the cooperation between China and Japan in agriculture is especially necessary.
