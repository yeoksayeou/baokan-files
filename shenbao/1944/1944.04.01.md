### Commemorating Navy Day

Today is Chinese Navy Day, the first naval anniversary in China. Recalling the past, in the sixth year of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (13th year of Meiji in Japan, 1880 AD), Li Hongzhang established the navy, marking the beginning of the Chinese navy. This was over sixty years ago. In the thirteenth year of Guangxu, Zhang Zhidong, the Governor-General of Liangguang, founded the "Guangdong Naval Academy," the first institution to cultivate and train naval talent in China, nearly sixty years ago. During these sixty-plus years, the Chinese navy has not only failed to establish a strong fleet capable of fulfilling its coastal defense duties, but even the foundation of the navy has not been laid and is still in its infancy. In contrast, our ally Japan started building its navy around the same time as China. Today, the strength of our ally's navy and the abundance of its naval talent are truly shameful in comparison. On April 1st of the year before last, the Ministry of the Navy convened a national naval conference to jointly plan the construction of a new navy. Last year, on April 1st, it petitioned the National Government to designate this day as Navy Day. Today, on the first celebration of this day, we feel even more deeply moved.

Let us examine the reasons for our failure to establish a navy over the past sixty years. The primary reason lies in poor governance. Chinese politics during these sixty years can be described as being in a state of turmoil for a long time. In the late Qing Dynasty, political corruption was prevalent. Although the Xinhai Revolution and the establishment of the Republic of China initially offered a ray of hope in politics, the subsequent rule of warlords and years of internal strife kept the country in darkness. Later, autocratic rule treated national affairs as family matters, making transparent and just governance even more elusive. The limited naval power available was used as a tool for individuals to compete for political power. As a result, the Chinese navy's foundation was destroyed and its future ruined during this long period of political turmoil over the past sixty years. On the other hand, the situation in our ally Japan was the opposite. After the Meiji Restoration, the country's politics became increasingly transparent and just. Nurtured by an excellent political environment, Japan developed into a strong navy respected by the world. One failed, and the other succeeded—this was not accidental. Today, while we happily celebrate Navy Day, we must especially recognize the reasons for success and failure. We must learn from our pain, rise from the ashes, and build a new navy. This is the most meaningful way to commemorate this day.

Currently, the Naval Department of the National Government is undertaking the task of rebuilding the navy. Furthermore, we are receiving sincere cooperation from Japanese naval officers and soldiers of our allied nation, who are sharing their advanced experience to guide us. This is a great opportunity. Although we are a continental country, we are also a maritime nation in terms of our geography and strategic position. The eastern, southeastern, southern, and southwestern borders of our country, from the Bohai Bay around the Shandong Peninsula, through the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, along the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong, across the South China Sea to the Gulf of Tonkin, have the longest coastline in East Asia. Along this coastline, from Shanghai downwards, are all first-class modernized metropolises of our country. Furthermore, major cities are scattered along the waterways of the Yangtze River and the Pearl River, which are the heartland of the nation. In terms of national defense, establishing true coastal defense and a strong navy is essential. Especially in the Greater East Asia War and in safeguarding the entire Greater East Asia after the war, we need a strong coastal defense force to participate in combat and defense. This is something we must be even more aware of as we celebrate and commemorate today.

However, building a strong navy is not something that can be achieved overnight. Mayor Chen once said, "Without thirty years of history, one cannot speak of building a navy; without twenty years of training, one cannot cultivate sound naval talent." This is certainly true. The most important thing at this moment is to cultivate and train naval cadre and talent to undertake the task of building the navy. The Central Naval Academy is currently the only place to cultivate talent, and it must be strengthened and improved in all aspects. It is rumored that the funding for the Naval Academy is shockingly low. As a result, the salaries of teachers and staff are meager, and the nutrition of students is insufficient. These are, of course, the suffering of general civil servants. However, given the aforementioned daunting mission of the Naval Academy, the salaries of teachers and staff who bear this mission should be increased no matter what. The government should specifically secure funding for the Naval Academy. Currently, we may not be able to build many warships, but we must cultivate cadre and talent. To do so, we must ensure that those who are responsible for cultivating talent have a stable life. Secondly, the recent plans to establish the Central Higher Merchant Marine Academy and the Merchant Marine Ordinary Seamen Training School to train sailors are urgently needed. We hope that the government and naval authorities will handle these plans with full effort and gradually expand them.

Finally, with the most sincere enthusiasm, we commemorate today's Navy Day and look forward to the active development of naval cadre and talent training. We have specially opened a space to publish a special edition for Navy Day and donated 10,000 yuan to be used as library funds for the Central Naval Academy, contributing a small amount to express our sincere hopes for commemoration.

### Cultivating a New Chinese Navy to Complete the Greater East Asia War - Navy Day Speech by Navy Minister Ren

Nanjing, 31st (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of the Navy of the National Government, since its establishment on April 1st, the year after the National Government returned to the capital, convened the National Naval Conference on April 1st of the 31st year to unify the Chinese navy. Naval commanders from all regions gathered to discuss the grand plan of building a new Chinese navy. To deepen the national public's understanding of the navy, it was decided to designate April 1st of each year as Chinese Navy Day. April 1st of this year marks the first Chinese Navy Anniversary. At this critical stage of the Greater East Asia War, with fierce battles unfolding on the Pacific front, the National Government is cooperating with its allies to fully participate in the war. The people of the nation are preparing to welcome this deeply meaningful festival with excitement and enthusiasm. Naval Minister Ren Yuandao recently visited Shanghai to discuss matters with relevant Chinese and Japanese parties in order to celebrate the first Navy Day solemnly. A Central News Agency reporter visited Navy Minister Ren to inquire about various issues related to Chinese Navy Day. He kindly answered the reporter's questions as follows: First, the minister expressed his thoughts on the significance of the first Chinese Navy Day, saying that since the first National Naval Conference decided on the "Navy Day" of our country, the people of the nation have placed enthusiastic expectations on it. We are even more pleased to celebrate the first anniversary. The strength of a country's navy depends on its own efforts, but the recognition and efforts of the people are also important. Chinese naval construction has not made significant progress in the fifty years since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95. However, our ally Japan has relied on the united efforts of the entire nation to create its superior position and immense strength today. The Chinese navy has lagged behind due to past circumstances. The National Government designated April 1st as our Navy Day to make the people of the nation deeply aware of the importance of the navy, unite to cooperate, and provide supervision and guidance to the navy to jointly complete the construction of a new Chinese navy. The reporter then asked the minister about the construction of the Chinese navy. The minister replied that the Chinese naval construction has been proceeding in accordance with three major work goals over the past three years. In terms of defense equipment, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Weihai and other important ports, as well as the special base in Hankou, have been equipped. In terms of education work, there are the Central Naval Academy, the Central Seamen Training Center, and local line battalions to train cadres and soldiers. In terms of surveying, the water level measurements from Yangzikou to Wusongkou to Hankou and the hydrographic charts have been completed successively. However, the training of naval personnel is different from that of land troops and requires a longer period. In the future, we will strive forward under the guidance of the Chairman and with the cooperation of our allies to create the strength of the Chinese navy and cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. Finally, the minister spoke about the Chinese navy's cooperation with its ally Japan in the Greater East Asia War, saying that since the National Government joined the Greater East Asia Liberation War, the new Chinese navy has been cooperating with its allies in the rear of the logistics base to maintain peace on the coast and ensure maritime security. Recently, it has been working closely with the allied navy to start joint work and do our best to win the war. Finally, Navy Minister Ren expressed his determination, saying that since the new Chinese navy has begun to make rapid progress, he believes that it will soon be able to exert its power together with the allied navy on the Pacific front.

Telegram of Congratulations from Commander Kondo

Today (April 1st) is the first Navy Day of our country. Admiral Kondo Nobutake, commander of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, sent a telegram to Navy Minister Ren to congratulate him. The telegram reads: "Today, I am pleased to celebrate the first Navy Day of your country. I sincerely express my best wishes for the bright future of your country's navy and hope that you will move forward bravely to complete the Greater East Asia War."

### Guidelines for the Comprehensive Adjustment of the Jointly Operated National Policy Companies Decided, Aiming to Increase Production and Complete the War

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - The joint China-Japan national policy companies have been adjusted by the army since last year with the sincere understanding of the Chinese and Japanese authorities, and the comprehensive adjustment guidelines have been decided on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital today (30th). Subsequently, the Huazhong Kaido, China Shipping, Shanghai Inland River Shipping, Huazhong Transport, Huazhong Urban Public Bus, Huazhong Electrical Communication, Huazhong Mining, Huanan Coal Mine, Huazhong Hydropower, Da Shanghai Gas, Hengchan and other eleven companies related to the Huazhong Revitalization Company will formulate plans in accordance with the outline, taking into account the actual situation of each company, and will be reasonably resolved as soon as possible. This move is of great significance. The investigation outline is extremely coordinated and fair in terms of both management of assets and personnel. The organization and management are based on our country's laws, so the name and reality are in line, and our country's guidance and supervision are in place. The integrity of the National Government's sovereignty and economic development have been clearly guaranteed. The fact that it is held on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital symbolizes the leap in political and economic progress that has been made in the four years since the National Government's return to the capital. The transfer of companies to our country's managers will greatly contribute to our country's fiscal revenue. After the adjustment of the companies, we can also work hard to expand production in our country. The future of industry is promising, and we have a firm desire to complete the Greater East Asia War and cooperate between China and Japan.

### Ambassador Tani's Remarks

Nanjing, 31st (Central News Agency dispatch): In order to implement the new policy towards China, strengthen economic cooperation between China and Japan, and cultivate combat power, the Japanese government has adjusted the Sino-Japanese joint ventures. Mr. Tani Masayuki, the Japanese Ambassador to China, issued the following statement: The Japanese government is carrying out cooperation with China based on the new policy. Regarding the adjustment of various state-owned companies jointly operated by China and Japan, the Wentai Industry Co., Ltd. and the Huazhong Silk Co., Ltd. were adjusted in October last year. Huazhong Fisheries Co., Ltd. was also adjusted in January this year. Regarding Huazhong Railway, Huazhong Electric Communications, Huazhong Mining, Huainan Coal Mine, Zhonghua Shipping, Shanghai Inland River Shipping, Zhongsui Electric Power, Greater Shanghai Gas, Huazhong Transportation, Huazhong Urban Public Transportation, and Shanghai Hengchan and other 11 joint stock companies, the embassy authorities and executives of the Huazhong Revitalization Company, together with the National Government authorities and Chinese executives of various joint ventures, maintain close contact and discuss specific methods. Recently, a general consensus has been reached on the outline for adjusting the above 11 companies. In the future, each company will quickly schedule adjustment work individually based on this outline. The goal of this adjustment outline is to realize the methods and spirit clarified in the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration, that is, on the one hand, to respect China's autonomy based on the principle of mutual benefit and equality, and to promote economic cooperation between the two countries, while at the same time, the two countries will cooperate to complete the foundation for the victory of the Greater East Asia War. As a result, it will make a great contribution to China's economic recovery and the National Government's self-strengthening.

### The Principle of Equality and Mutual Benefit

In order to thoroughly implement this purpose, Japan will begin to adjust the company structure. At the same time, the enemy assets, Anglo-American companies and various enterprises with the same nature as the companies to be adjusted this time, whose shares are kept in Japan, will also be transferred to China in whole or in part this time. The development of each company's business should be as we expected and is a joyous and congratulatory event. The outline and main points of the above-mentioned adjustment are described as follows:

*   From now on, each joint venture company will be completely under the direct command and supervision of the National Government in name and in fact. At the same time, in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and Joint Declaration, government bureaus will cooperate with each company on various military matters.
*   The affairs of each joint venture company shall be handled in accordance with Chinese laws and regulations. The National Government will promptly prepare the necessary regulations for the guidance, supervision, assistance, and protection of each company, so that all the agreed upon ordinances, regulations, etc. of the new government at that time may be abolished.
*   The capital and number of employees of each joint venture company shall, in principle, be more than half from the Chinese side.
*   The National Government will take all or part of the Anglo-American enemy assets to increase the capital of each joint venture company. At the same time, the participation of Chinese private sector talents and capital is welcomed.
*   Within the possible scope, Chinese employees will be hired, and the treatment of Chinese and Japanese will be completely equal.
*   The financial, material, and technical assistance provided by the Japanese side to the joint venture company will still be handled by the Huazhong Revitalization Company. At the same time, each company shall maintain close contact with the Revitalization Company regarding business matters.

### Economic Cooperation Cultivating Combat Power

Finally, I would like to add that the businesses operated by the companies to be adjusted this time, such as railways, telecommunications, and shipping, are directly related to the war, and the development of national defense resources, etc., contribute to the cultivation of combat power, and are public undertakings that are directly related to the lives of the people. Under this wartime system, their business capabilities should not be reduced, and efforts should be made to advance them. China and Japan paid special attention to this when discussing the outline. Furthermore, Japanese colleagues who are employed in joint ventures must recognize and understand the authorities' measures, and must devote all their efforts to enhance their work, strengthen Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, and cultivate combat power. Do not fail to live up to expectations.

### Huazhong Company Takes Over Transportation Undertakings in Huaihai Province

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency dispatch): After the Sino-Japanese joint state-owned companies have been successively adjusted by China and Japan, various transportation undertakings within the Huaihai Province will be taken over by the relevant companies of Huazhong. In the future, management will be more convenient, and the authorities of the Ministry of Construction will also issue a statement on this matter. The record is as follows: Since the establishment of Huaihai Province, the Ministry of Construction has begun to prepare to transfer the various transportation undertakings operated by North China Transportation Company, etc. in the province to the relevant companies of Huazhong for takeover, so that the management will be more reasonable, and the national economy will be further developed. After consultation with the Japanese Embassy, it has been agreed that from April 1st, the railway line from Bengbu to the station south of Xuzhou on the Xiapu-Shangjin line will be taken over by the Huazhong Railway Company. In order to facilitate contact with the relevant authorities in Huaihai Province, the company has set up a resident staff in Xuzhou for liaison. At the same time, although the Longhai Line in the province is still operated by the North China Transportation Company, it is directly supervised and commanded by the Ministry of Construction of the National Government. The highways along the Jinpu Line south of Xuzhou will also be operated by the Huazhong Railway Company, and the transportation business will be handled by the Huazhong Transportation Company. In addition, the telegraphs and telephones along the Bengbu-Xuzhou railway will be operated by the Huazhong Electric Communications Company.

### Biscay Bay Heavily Defended by Germany Second Line of Defense Under Construction

A certain German naval base, 31st (Central News Agency dispatch): According to a report from Mr. Yuenny, a war correspondent for the Haitong News Agency: After the completion of the first line of defense of the German army in the Bay of Biscay, the second line of defense can also be completed within a few days. The German military authorities have slightly revealed the content of the defense there. In a short period of time, hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of cement have been transformed into bunkers, gun emplacements, and military barracks. A large number of experts are using scientific methods and utilizing natural terrain to build artillery positions. The famous mining experts of Deguo are also working on the coast. German sappers are building a 1,050-meter tunnel. In a certain place, an underground city has been built under the ground. The enemy's largest bombs and continuous shelling cannot move it at all. This type of bunker is built at each important point along the coast, equipped with all kinds of new weapons to prevent enemy invasion. The defense here is completely based on the experience gained from Naturno. It is impossible to seize this defense line by military force and siege, because the bunkers can be self-sufficient for several months. The first line of defense is like this, and the second line of defense is also like this. The coastal canal network has also built this "waterway system," which cannot be surpassed by various tanks and troops.

### German Surgeons Use X-Ray Glasses Surgery Saves Time

### German Defensive Posture Solid

Due to the offensive of the Red Army on the Eastern Front and the day-and-night bombing of German cities by the British and American air forces, the anti-Axis side has been propagating that Germany today has encountered a major crisis no matter what. In fact, Germany is still exerting strong combat power everywhere, and the domestic front is also in good order, showing strong resistance. Therefore, the anti-Axis side has recently said the "truth" that "Germany is difficult to deal with." A certain Swiss weekly also commented on "Germany has no signs of collapse" and strongly stated that Germany's combat power is extremely strong. The source of Germany's combat power discussed in the publication is as follows:

### Superior Military Strength

The anti-Axis side estimates that the current strength of the German defense army is about 300 divisions. This force is not inferior to that at the beginning of the war. Germany has mobilized 51-year-old men born in 1894 as reserve forces, and 14-year-old teenagers have also been mobilized as auxiliary personnel during air raids, and has implemented the so-called true national mobilization. In addition, semi-military organizations such as the Todt engineering team, the Speer construction team, and the Nazi Party transportation team are powerful entities with a total of 1.2 million to 1.6 million members. Secondly, the morale of German soldiers is also admired by the world. The morale of the German soldiers on the Eastern Front is extremely high, which is due to the fear of Bolshevik rule over Germany, and mainly due to the fanatical patriotism unique to Germans. To give an example, ten German divisions surrounded by the Red Army in the Kanafu area refused to surrender even after being encircled, and were eventually rescued by friendly forces. This shows the determination of the German army's will to fight.

The issue of military production capacity is the same as that of enemy countries. In Germany's case, in general, there are no shortages of materials worth mentioning.

### Perfect Air Raid Countermeasures

Germany has indeed suffered a great blow due to air raids. But needless to say, Germany's combat power has not been weakened as a result. Regarding the psychological impact of air raids on national morale, the German government has taken effective and appropriate measures to overcome it. If Germany did not have appropriate measures for the evacuation of personnel and materials, the organization of construction teams, repair teams, and sorting teams, and the organization of emergency food distribution, it might have already fallen into chaos. Regarding the evacuation of people, the government has evacuated children from the western regions to the eastern and southern regions. In the event of air raids, the government mobilizes military trucks to first move the victims of air raids to barracks outside the city.

On one hand, the government mobilizes thousands of sorting teams and fire prevention teams in air raids, and immediately repairs the damaged houses, first preserving one or two houses, restoring electricity and water facilities, and ensuring a minimum level of life. After the air raid, the Nazi Party's motorcade immediately went to the air raid area to provide tea and meals to the victims.

### Industrial Reorganization

The industrial center has been moved from the Ruhr area to Upper Silesia, where the Ruhr Konzern has formed a huge industrial area. In addition, most factories have been built in villages throughout the country according to the government's local decentralization policy.

Looking at the interior of the factory again, each factory constitutes a unit of the national factory group, and even if a certain factory is damaged by an air raid, it can still maintain production. This is only possible after the unified model of industrial products. The total number of wage workers in Germany is currently 23 million to 29 million. Because the first-level male workers have been dispatched to the front line, the number of female workers is gradually increasing. To a certain extent, the shortage of skilled workers is unavoidable. Currently, the outstanding ones are being selected from the 8 million foreign workers and trained to become skilled workers. On the one hand, the factory supervisor and the police authorities are cooperating with each other to increase production.

### Successful Food Countermeasures

Over the past four years, Germany has achieved remarkable results in the food issue. Except for meat, the other food rations have not changed from the beginning of the war. Even if Ukraine is lost, it will not be a problem in Germany. The Balkan countries that maintain trade relations with Germany are becoming closer to Germany due to the recent entry and exit of the Soviet Union.

For example, Romania recently agreed to export 750,000 tons of wheat to Germany. Potatoes alone account for about 700,000 tons of food and industrial raw materials each year. This year, there is a slight shortage.

From the above, the current state of Germany is completely different from that of 1919. There are no conditions that lead to the collapse of Germany. In this way, unless there is a major change in the military situation, Germany can continue its solid defensive posture for a long time. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, March 14)

### Military Attaché Kondo Talks About the Significance of Navy Day Hopes for the Increasingly Sound Development of the Chinese Navy

Navy Military Attaché Kondo of the Japanese Navy Military Attaché Office in Shanghai issued a statement on the occasion of China's first Navy Day, stating: I am extremely pleased to celebrate the first Chinese Navy Day today. Two years ago, I gathered with Chinese naval generals to promote the great cause of building a new navy and contribute to China's revival and the construction of Greater East Asia. During this period, under many difficult circumstances, we have worked together to advance towards the completion of our current responsibilities. Not to mention the various military command and political reform agencies, other aspects such as enriching ships, rectifying important port departments and base troops, and training brave and good at fighting personnel have made great progress. Today, we have been able to assist the Imperial Navy in engaging in some important tasks such as operations and guard duties. This is a matter of the era and is worthy of celebration.

Of course, the current situation is still far from ideal, which goes without saying. However, under the leadership of Chairman Wang and the Naval Minister, I am confident that there will be a glorious development in the near future. We now recall the Sino-Japanese War, which was the history of the Chinese Navy occupying the forefront of the world navy, and we also recall the many famous generals and brave men that history produced, and we feel the greatness of the Chinese Navy's future. I sincerely hope that the Chinese Navy will develop in an increasingly sound manner in order to complete the Greater East Asia War and carry out the great cause of China's revival.

### Deputy Director Su Talks About Improving Police Life Promoting Major Issues of Police Administration

In order to promote police administration and improve police treatment, Mr. Su Chengde, Deputy Director of the First Police Bureau of this city, issued a statement saying: Since the merger of the former three bureaus and the Husi Police Bureau, the bureau has completed the unification of police administration and strived to promote it. However, the current cost of living has risen alarmingly. If we want to improve police administration, then improving the lives of the police is also a major issue at present. Only after the police's lives are stable can they serve the society with all their energy. Therefore, I proposed in the bureau affairs meeting to organize a police consumer cooperative to purchase daily necessities by themselves and distribute them to police personnel at a fair price. We have now received the support of people from all walks of life, so we can promote it smoothly, and the date of establishment is not far away. On this point, I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of all the police to people from all walks of life in the financial sector who have enthusiastically supported us. On the one hand, the government authorities are also quite concerned about the issue of police treatment. The salaries of police officers will be increased by 10% of the total amount starting this month, based on the amount of salaries for the Lan Moon. Daily necessities such as rice, flour, and coal balls have been increased in quantity and rationed, such as rice being increased by 5 liters per person per month, flour by 3 jin per person, and coal balls by 20 jin per person, which will also be implemented starting this month. In short, the bureau is intensifying its research on improving the lives of the police, so that every glimpse of life can be stable, dedicate themselves to the country, and be loyal to their duties. Then, the police force will be strengthened and sound, and local security will be ensured.

### Baby Health Competition Held Finals Yesterday

However, it has been found that there are also such illegal businesses operating in the First District, with the same nature as the illegal pawnshops in Nanshi. There are a total of more than 100 such businesses, concentrated in Taishan Road, Nanze Slope Road, Shunchang Road, and Ximen Road. These businesses do not have formal business licenses and charge particularly high interest rates, which is a serious threat to the poor. It is hoped that the authorities will thoroughly ban them.

### Minister Tajiri Left Shanghai Yesterday to Return Home, Expressing His Sentiments Before Departure

The former Japanese Minister to China, Mr. Tajiri, who has been transferred to an important position, left Shanghai yesterday (the 31st) to return home. Before his departure, he expressed his sentiments, hoping that the people of China and Japan would work hard for the Greater East Asia War. Minister Tajiri stated: "Since the establishment of the Ministry of Greater East Asia in November of the year before last, I have been in charge of the local embassy office for one year and five months. I am truly grateful for the cooperation and guidance from all aspects of China and Japan. The situation is becoming increasingly serious. In the future, the war's pressure on Shanghai in Central China will inevitably increase. The National Government, which has already returned to its capital for four years, has made its greatest efforts to unify the country and rectify internal affairs. The economic sector among the people has also discussed and substantially agreed on how to adjust China's traditional economy to wartime controlled economy. Therefore, today, if China and Japan trust and cooperate with each other, they will surely overcome difficulties and complete the important task of jointly promoting the Greater East Asia War. Furthermore, they can build a New East Asia, unify a New China, and establish new Sino-Japanese relations."

"This year is the decisive year of the Greater East Asia War, and it is also the year of certain victory. This can be newly determined. The era of doubt and debate has passed. Today, we have entered a stage of practice first. Therefore, what can be put into practice should be implemented immediately. This is the secret to completing the Greater East Asia War and the essence of building Greater East Asia. Now, a strong Japan and a strong China are cooperating with each other, gradually moving towards the path of building Greater East Asia. Today, the independent nation of India has also been born. Asia is restoring its original face, giving full play to its unique strengths in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects. The day of Asia's revitalization is not far away. However, in order to achieve this day, we must each work hard. If we believe that we have hope, we cannot rest assured. We must make efforts according to how much hope we have. On the occasion of my departure, I would like to express my deepest gratitude for the kindness of guidance and restoration from all parties, and I wish you all good health."

### Lu Jiawan Branch Released Theft Prevention Guidelines

Since the implementation of long-term blackout regulations starting from March 3rd, the Lu Jiawan Police Branch has paid attention to prevention to ensure the safety of residents, dispatching additional police officers and plainclothes personnel for close inspections, and notifying Baojia personnel to assist. However, in the past few days, there was a case of robbery and stripping of pedestrians in Da Pu, where two suspects were caught on the spot. The next day, there was a robbery case at a residence on Changxing Road (formerly Didi Road). However, due to the delayed report, the bandits escaped without a trace. Therefore, if residents encounter theft in the future, they should follow behind, report to the police immediately when they encounter them, or observe the location of the stolen goods and report the address to the police station. If they encounter rioters on the way, they can resist or shout loudly to facilitate a quick arrest. Regarding theft prevention guidelines: Go home early when there is nothing to do. Be careful with doors and windows. Businesses open at night should have someone patrol outside the door. Large factories, companies, and stores should automatically arrange for people to take turns on night duty. If someone claiming to be military police comes to inspect, they must ask to see their credentials. If they have no credentials, they can refuse them. Baojia personnel should inspect bad elements. Including: A. Those who have no occupation and are idlers. B. Those who have been criminally punished. C. Those who have no permanent property and have bad habits. D. Those who are known to be thieves. Report them secretly to the police station within one week and pay attention to their actions at any time. In addition, those in charge of public places such as theaters, teahouses, bathhouses, and barbershops should pay special attention to the actions and words of customers. If Baojia personnel know but do not report, they will be subject to police penalties, detention, or fines.

Bad Element Prevention Measures

Each Bao is assigned a telephone for people to report to the police. Wooden doors are installed in each lane. One door is opened for entry and exit at dawn and dusk, and staff are assigned to duty. Major factories, stores, and residences should install alarm bells to ensure safety. The Self-Defense Corps Patrol Team is organized, based on the old forty Lianbao in the area. Each Lianbao has one squadron, each Bao has one platoon, and each Jia has one squad, with six people per squad. They patrol in two shifts from 6:00 PM to 12:00 AM, carrying wooden sticks and police whistles. Police station patrol teams, based on five major Lianbao, patrol on time. The Lianbao chiefs are also instructed to tell citizens to pay attention to two points: Residents who accommodate out-of-town guests for more than three days must report to the police station. Those without a citizen ID card are not allowed to stay overnight. In case of an accident, the group should quickly report by phone to the Lu Jiawan Branch at 70060.

It is now learned that the regulations have been re-revised to exempt those whose sales are less than 5,000 yuan per ten days. In other words, vendors whose daily sales are less than 500 yuan are allowed to be exempt. The District Taxation Bureau has ordered the Nanshi and other tax collection offices to implement this uniformly.

### Pukou-Beijing-Busan Express Train Abolished

Short commentary

### Comply with Theft Prevention Rules

Since the long-term blackout, petty criminals have been using the darkness to attempt robberies. We have repeatedly offered suggestions for prevention. Now, the Lu Jiawan Police Branch has decided on "Theft Prevention Guidelines" and "Measures to Prevent Bad Elements" and is strictly enforcing them. This is very important for the safety of citizens and the overall public order. We hope that citizens will pay attention and assist.

Originally, citizens have the obligation to quickly report to the police any incident that disrupts public order, regardless of whether they are directly involved or not. Helping the police eliminate petty criminals, maintain public order, and seek tranquility for the entire society is to seek tranquility for themselves. Therefore, we should abide by the provisions in the "Theft Prevention Guidelines," pay attention to and investigate the residents within our Bao and Jia at any time, and pay special attention to suspicious residents or mixed residents, and report to the police station responsibly, without fear of trouble.

It is said that petty criminals often use weapons when plotting wrongdoing. However, real guns are extremely rare. Most are fake guns used for intimidation. Recently, the police station has been sending police patrols anytime and anywhere. It is heard that the Lu Jiawan Branch has organized forty patrol teams to shuttle back and forth all night, forming a tight police network. Therefore, if citizens encounter robbery, immediately resist and shout loudly, track and report to the police station. Making petty criminals lose courage and restrain their actions is the active way to prevent crime.

Economic Commentary

### To be Fair

We are against stock market speculators, not stock market investors. Therefore, our initial expectations for the resumption of the stock exchange were so earnest. And we deeply hate the speculative behavior of the Chinese stock market, which caused the soaring and plummeting of stock prices, because both soaring and plummeting are inconsistent with the original intention of promoting investment and supporting enterprises.

The main reasons for the stock market crash in the past month are nothing more than the following facts: financial stagnation, production shrinkage, excess stocks, and speculation. According to the task of the Japanese stock market in wartime, which is the task of supplying funds, then, during the stock market crash period, stock market countermeasures, in other words, the method of maintaining the stock market, must be planned.

Based on the above reasons for the stock market crash, the stock market countermeasures that address the symptoms are nothing more than adjusting finance, promoting production, absorbing stocks, and cracking down on speculation. These can be said to be the responsibility of the government authorities. As for the responsibilities of those who issue commercial securities and those who buy and sell industrial securities, they are relatively simple. To be fair, the former's responsibility lies in striving to promote their own production business and should not be happy or sad about the rise and fall of their industrial securities. The latter's responsibility lies in clearly identifying the object of industrial investment and should not judge the merits and demerits of entrepreneurs based on the temporary rise and fall of stocks. To be fair, an entrepreneur should not always "issue shares" in his enterprise by increasing capital without increasing production. However, a stock purchaser, especially those who purchased stocks on the eve of the stock market crash, if they are willing to deliberately damage its reputation and disrupt its order due to the losses they have suffered, it is also most unreasonable.

### Hoarders Lower Prices to Seek Cash, Spot Supply Increases, Transactions Among Industry Peers Quite Dull

It is reported that in the past three weeks, due to the authorities' strict suppression and stabilization of prices, hoarders have released their warehoused goods to seek sales. The spot supply of goods on the market has increased by more than one-third compared to a month ago. Citizens have made some inquiries due to slightly lower prices. However, transactions among industry peers in the market are quite sluggish. Holders are eager to sell at a low price, but buyers are ultimately short of funds, and collections are not forthcoming, resulting in an unusually dull situation. It is reported that the sales prices of various goods are more prone to a falling trend, and quoted prices are more stagnant because the sales of goods door-to-door have some outlets. However, the relevant authorities' new countermeasures for managing prices will be implemented separately in the near future, so that the sales prices of all goods will fall into standardization before stopping.

The stock exchange will stop processing stock split receipts from today. Since the exchange processed stock splits and temporarily issued receipts, it often stopped transferring ownership due to company shareholder meetings, etc., causing receipt holders to exchange their receipts for stocks, inevitably delaying the date, causing misunderstandings from the outside world. Therefore, it will stop processing stock splits from today.

### The Meaning of Navy Day

— Ren Yuandao

Navy Day is the anniversary of the Chinese Navy. The Chinese Navy has never had a Navy Day in its seventy-year history from the late Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China. The words "Navy Day" were first created on April 1, 1943. On April 1, 1942, the Ministry of Navy convened a national naval conference in Nanjing, and the following year submitted a request to the National Government to designate this day as Navy Day. The significance of this is not only resonated by the entire army, but also resonated by the entire Chinese nation. To declare the history of the founding of the Chinese Navy, one part is in the Yangtze River area, and another part is in the Guangdong and Northeast areas. The spirit of factionalism has not been broken, and the spirit of coordination has not been realized. Therefore, although there is a long history, there are few major gains. Now, the naval personnel from all over the country are gathered together, which not only sweeps away the division from the past, but also truly demonstrates the spiritual unity of today. Sharing weal and woe, with one heart and one mind, in the midst of the global war clouds, building a new navy, and shouldering the important task of ultimate victory with the allied nation of Japan, can move stones and touch ghosts and gods. The splendid and bright future can be compared with the Navy Day of the allied nation of Japan, and it will last forever. We should seek far and never forget the great glory of this day, and fight cautiously and strive for its great and bright results, in order to build a new navy and a new China.

### After the National Government's Return to the Capital: A Brief History of the Newly Established Navy

Our nation's navy was established during the mid-Qing Dynasty, a history spanning a century. However, due to a defeat in the Sino-Japanese War, compounded by the muddled state of the late Qing Dynasty, and further exacerbated by the control of corrupt naval cliques, it gradually weakened over time, making revitalization impossible. Customs control was lost, causing widespread concern. Upon the National Government's return to the capital in the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), there was no room for doubt regarding the reconstruction of the navy. Therefore, on April 1st of the same year, the Ministry of the Navy was re-established, with our highest leader, Chairman Wang, concurrently serving as Minister. Ling Xiao was appointed as the Political Vice Minister, and Xu Jixiang as the Administrative Vice Minister. Veteran naval officers from both the North and South were recruited to take charge of various affiliated agencies. Subsequently, with the assistance of friendly nation Japan, over ten warships of varying sizes, including the Hai Xing, Hai Xiang, and Hai Sui, were returned successively. In the same month, the Nanjing Fortress Command was established, with Xu Jianting as the Commander. Various ships and bases were placed under its jurisdiction. Soon after, the Nanjing Jiangnan Naval Base Team was established, along with the establishment of base detachments and subunits in key coastal and riverine areas. Concurrently, in Shanghai, the Rejuvenation Government's Office of Pacification and Water Patrol School and the Hydrographic Survey Bureau were taken over. The Office of Pacification and Water Patrol School was reorganized into the Central Naval Academy, with Jiang Xiyuan as the Principal, responsible for naval education. An affiliated training institute was established to train sailors for service on various warships. The Hydrographic Survey Bureau was reorganized into the Naval Hydrographic Survey Bureau, with Ye Kesong as the Director, responsible for nationwide hydrographic survey operations. An affiliated Hydrographic Technology Training Institute was established to train hydrographic survey technical personnel.

In June of the same year, Minister Wang, recognizing the importance and demanding nature of the naval reconstruction undertaking, and being preoccupied with his duties as National Chairman, knowing that Commander-in-Chief Yuan Daoduo of the First Route Army was resolute, decisive, and responsible, appointed him to replace himself. Furthermore, with Vice Minister Ling needing to serve as the Chinese Naval Attaché to Japan, the vacant position of Political Vice Minister was filled by Jiang Xiyuan, the Principal of the Naval Academy, concurrently. The position of Administrative Vice Minister was filled by Fu. In December of the same year, Minister Wang, recognizing the importance of coastal defense in North China equal to that of Central China, dispatched Counselor Zhao Peijun to Weihaiwei to establish a Naval Base Department, with Counselor Zhao concurrently serving as Commander. Base detachments were also established in Qingdao, Yantai, and Lianyungang, all under the jurisdiction of the Weihaiwei Base Department. In September of the thirtieth year (1941), Commander Zhao, due to illness, was unable to handle the demanding duties, and was recalled to the Ministry for recuperation. Bao Tingyi was dispatched to replace him as Commander of the Weihaiwei Naval Base Department. In June of the thirty-first year (1942), the Guangdong River Defense Command was expanded into the Guangzhou Fortress Command, commanding over twenty existing ships, including the Hai Hu, as well as various base teams and detachments in South China, along with the naval training camp. In July of the same year, recognizing the importance of coastal defense in North China, the Weihaiwei Naval Base Department was expanded into a Fortress Command, with Commander Bao promoted to Commander. In July of the thirty-second year (1943), the Hankou Naval Base Department was also established, with Commander Meng Xiuchun as Commander. Various naval bases and ships above Jiujiang were placed under its jurisdiction. In December of the same year, the affiliated training institute of the Central Naval Academy, upon order, was reorganized into the Central Sailor Training Institute, with Chief of the Military Education Department Huang Xun as the Director, directly under the Ministry of the Navy. In February of the thirty-third year (1944), the Dinghai Special Naval Base Team was established, with Section Chief Xie Weiliang as the Commander, under the Nanjing Fortress Command.

Statistics show that from the National Government's return to the capital on March 30th of the 29th year (1940) to the present, a period of only four years, the following have been established: three naval fortress commands in Central China, North China, and South China; one Hankou Naval Base Department; one Dinghai Special Naval Base Team; one Central Naval Academy; one Central Sailor Training Institute; and one Hydrographic Survey Bureau. In addition to the numerous large and small ships returned by our ally, Japan, over forty newly built small gunboats have been commissioned by the Jiangnan Shipyard under the direct supervision of the Ministry of the Navy. These ships have been deployed along the coasts and rivers of Central China, South China, and North China to suppress and deter, ensuring peace and stability in the rivers and seas. In terms of naval education, the Naval Academy has graduated two classes, numbering approximately two hundred officers. The advanced naval cadre training courses have graduated three classes, totaling sixty officers. The Sailor Training Institute has graduated nine classes of sailors, with a total of several thousand graduates including those from various special training courses. While large-scale shipbuilding plans have not yet been fully implemented, the plan to cultivate talent is gradually being completed. With such a vibrant and rapidly advancing new navy, if the people of our nation can urgently catch up and work together, not only will securing our maritime borders be within reach, but also raising our national banner on the Pacific Ocean, sailing alongside our ally Japan's mighty ships, and flying our flags together, is not absolutely impossible. This depends on the naval authorities to promote and encourage, but also on the profound understanding of the entire nation.

### Overview of the Central Naval Academy

School Buildings

The academy is located in the southern part of Shanghai, on Junhua Road, on the northern bank of the Huangpu River. It currently occupies 436,954 square meters, with ample land reserved for future expansion. There are seven buildings, including a former naval hospital and a naval aircraft factory. The remaining buildings were newly constructed successively.

History

The academy was established in April of the 29th year of the Republic (1940) after the National Government returned to the capital. It took over thirty students from the Rejuvenation Government's Office of Pacification and Water Patrol School, who formed the first class of the academy. Over a hundred new students were recruited from Beijing, Pingjin (Tianjin), Shanghai, Hankou, Guangdong, and other places, forming the academy's second class. The period of study for both classes was set at two years. The first class graduated in April of the 30th year (1941), and the second class graduated in April of the 31st year (1942). After graduation, they were assigned to warships for one year of practice, followed by the award of the rank of Ensign. The graduates of the first and second classes have all been assigned to various fleets.

From the third class onwards, the period of study was changed to three years. The third class entered the academy in May of the 30th year (1941), the fourth class in May of the 31st year (1942), and the fifth class in May of the 32nd year (1943). They are currently still studying. All students are recruited from Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin (Tianjin), Hankou, Guangdong, Qingdao, and other places. The sixth class will be recruited from the above locations in August of this year. In addition, in the past two years, the academy has held three sessions of advanced naval cadre training courses, selecting active senior naval officers and providing them with education in morale and advanced military tactics.

Equipment

Regarding educational equipment, continuous efforts have been made to enrich it, either through gifts from friendly nations or through government purchases. Currently, the basic necessary teaching aids are largely complete. The major items include: a machine shop, including a complete set of ship boilers and steam engines; a machine factory, including a complete set of tools; an aircraft hangar, including one aircraft; one anti-aircraft gun; one naval gun; one searchlight; one wireless direction finder; and four sampans. Other instruments, charts, and specimens for navigation, gunnery, torpedoes, seamanship, and signaling are all available. In addition, there is a naval training ship and several gunboats and small launches for students to use for practical exercises at any time.

Academic Education

The academy's education aims to impart the skills of junior naval officers. In the first year, general subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, Chinese language, and foreign languages are taught. From the second year onwards, students are divided into navigation and engineering departments (navigation accounting for about three-quarters of the total students, and engineering accounting for one-quarter), and military subjects are taught separately.

The main military subjects include: tactics, naval architecture, navigation, gunnery, naval warfare, torpedoes, communications, aviation, marine engineering, military science, ship management, and military administration.

Student Organization

There are currently 148 students, divided into four companies, each with one company commander, one company executive officer, and one student squad leader and assistant squad leader. Students are allowed to leave the academy only from 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM on Sundays and holidays. At other times, they are strictly prohibited from leaving the academy. Students undergo a physical examination once a month. Based on the records of these examinations, the students' physical condition improves each quarter after entering the academy, which is clear proof of the effectiveness of the training.
