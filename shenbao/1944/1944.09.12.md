### Current Problems in Secondary Education

Post-war issues have become the central concern of far-sighted individuals worldwide. The question of how to nurture our next generation is one of the prerequisites for addressing these post-war challenges. Therefore, we must pay special attention to the current problems in Chinese education. Our newspaper held a symposium with university professors and published discussions on this topic some days ago. Now, we are convening a secondary education symposium, gathering teachers from various secondary schools in the city to frankly discuss the current situation and express their ideals (see today's newspaper, page 3, for symposium records). We firmly believe that this will benefit the future of secondary education in our city. Here, we need to supplement the symposium's conclusions and express the following expectations for education authorities and the education sector in the future: The biggest problem currently facing secondary education is the excessively difficult living conditions of teaching staff. Due to the hardships faced by secondary school teachers, three phenomena have emerged: ○ Secondary school teachers change professions, leading to a shortage of excellent teachers; ○ They seek additional income outside of teaching, making it impossible to focus on their primary duties; ○ Excellent teachers are hard to find, leading to a lowering of standards. Therefore, improving the lives of secondary school teachers is the most pressing issue. The symposium concluded with the hope that the authorities would find ways to provide subsidies, make school finances transparent, improve teacher salaries, promote mentorship programs, and cooperate with public opinion, all of which are very concrete suggestions. The authorities already have special rationing systems and educational insurance for education personnel, and we hope for their prompt and effective implementation. We also hope that: ○ School authorities will genuinely implement financial transparency to avoid being ridiculed as "academic shops." ○ Teachers will form their own organizations to cooperate and assist each other. ○ Teachers should improve their own lives, strive for further education, and avoid clinging to old ways, becoming complacent, and falling behind the times. The second major problem in secondary education is the issue of youth dropping out of school. Due to the alarming increase in tuition, miscellaneous fees, and book costs, a significant pressure has been placed on the education of children from salaried families, hindering the development of secondary education. Therefore, while hoping for a reasonable adjustment of education costs, there is a particular need for the inspiration of scholarship assistance programs, which is quite gratifying. What we must solemnly point out is: ○ Regarding the issue of approval standards, we must base them on the current state of education in our country and the future needs of the nation and its people. There should be no bias towards universities, secondary schools, or primary schools. In principle, universities should especially focus on practical subjects, while secondary schools and below should increase the number of scholarship students as much as possible to provide more young people with educational opportunities, with particular emphasis on the words "[poor and needy]"; however, ○ In terms of approval standards, we ultimately cannot ignore the word "[excellent]". However, the "[excellent]" we refer to should not only focus on academic test scores, but also pay attention to their usual academic performance, character, and physical fitness. In terms of academics, special attention should be paid to their understanding of the reality of the nation and its people. If they pass all subjects but have no understanding of the reality of the country and society, and lack a sound outlook on life, they will not be accepted by the new era. ○ To promote scholarship programs, it is hoped that schools will increase contact with scholarship fund organizations and cooperate with each other to achieve practical results, so that on the one hand, they do not betray the good intentions of donors, and on the other hand, they can face the nation and its people, truly cultivating vitality and nurturing talents for the country. The issue of post-war education raised at this symposium is the most noteworthy. The opinions of the two Mr. Suns seem to consistently advocate "[character education as the foundation, scientific education as the application]". In principle, we can certainly agree with this. However, we believe that this is a major issue that cannot be determined by one or two symposiums. We earnestly hope that experts who are concerned about the future of the nation and its people and who have experience and research in education will express their insightful opinions. We are determined to publish and openly discuss and research them within the possible scope, in order to obtain more accurate and truthful conclusions and more active and concrete plans. Our future era is one of independence, liberation, recovery, and reconstruction. The secondary education plan for such a new era should be a thorough liquidation of the old system and old methods. On the one hand, we must develop the legacy of Eastern spiritual civilization to transform the entire academic atmosphere, but on the other hand, we must not ignore the fact that the times are only moving forward, and we must stand on the position of science and catch up!

### Close Cooperation Between China and Japan to Build Great East Asia

Important Speech by Japanese Prime Minister Koiso
Tokyo, November 11 (Central News Agency) Japanese Prime Minister Koiso delivered a policy speech on the 7th at the 85th Diet session.

Japan's true intentions have now gradually penetrated among the Chinese people, and the cooperation between China and Japan is becoming even closer.

### Returning from the Soviet Union

When the reporter bid farewell to Moscow, the most concerning issue for the citizens of the capital, following the progress of the war, was the opening of commercial food stores, commercial bars, and department stores. April 15th was the day after the famous Russian holiday of Pascha. Affected by the economic recovery policy in the city, the atmosphere of the former religious revolution, which was reported before the festival, unconsciously revived, becoming the focus of citizens' curiosity and hope. Twenty-seven or eight commercial food stores, which were very lively and opened all at once on the main streets of Moscow, were gifts for the Pascha festival and immediately stirred the hearts of the citizens. It was rumored that the citizens who opened the stores ran ahead of us and lined up in long lines in front of the food stores. Many police officers were dispatched to organize the enthusiastic lines.

### Unbelievable Commodity Prices

Looking at the items displayed there, such as meat, vegetables, canned goods, sugar, candy, bread, alcohol, fruits, tobacco, etc., all the daily necessities of food are available. However, the value of the commodities displayed there is staggering. For example, sugar is 800 rubles per kilogram, bread is 1,000 rubles, meat is about 400 rubles, cakes are 50 rubles each, apples are 50 rubles each, vodka is 200 rubles per bottle, wine is 300 rubles per bottle, and white bread is about 100 rubles per kilogram. (The exchange rate of the ruble to the Japanese yen is 35 yen 60 sen according to the diplomatic corps rate). Now, if the average monthly wage of workers and staff members in the Soviet Union is calculated at about 400 rubles, then their one-month labor value is only equivalent to the value of one kilogram of meat or half a kilogram of sugar. Therefore, the price of this kind of food store makes people feel like they are being treated like fools. No wonder citizens often stand in place and curse, saying: "This store is an anti-religious store. The prices they set are truly unbelievable." The following is an interesting conversation among Moscow citizens: "A very grand museum has been opened everywhere since yesterday. Have you been to see it?" "I haven't been to see it yet. What kind of museum is it?" "That's very good. Humans may not have tasted such rare things before. Now you can visit for free. Go and see it!"

### The Excitement of New Stores Opening

But despite the mockery, the lives of the citizens of Moscow have become more lively due to the opening of new food stores. People with a little money in their hands want to buy something. Everyone is scheming for business. The largest food store had a turnover of about 30 million rubles on the opening day, which was reduced to 3 million rubles a month later, but the number is still considerable. Soon after the opening of this kind of food store, commercial bars also appeared like bamboo shoots after the rain in the same places as before the German-Soviet war. And these are also the "anti-religious" bars that the citizens talk about. The prices of both wine and dishes are very high, and customers will never get drunk. Soup is 30 yen per bowl, beef cake is 50 yen per bowl, and a bottle of wine is 100 yen. If you study it a little, you have to pay one or two thousand gold. Therefore, customers cannot always eat and eat with trepidation, afraid that they will not be able to pay the bill. Although listening to jazz music, they are uneasy in their hearts. It's like running all night without jazz music. But officers with two Heroic Medals hanging on their chests are cheering and drinking with two or three women at the same table. However, he often cannot pay the bill and collects money from familiar friends to perfunctorily pass. The general public rarely visits these places.

A Certain Japanese Army Base, November 11 (Central News Agency) After the Japanese army in southern Zhejiang occupied Lishui, they continued to advance along the Ou River towards the coast, eliminating the resistance of the newly organized 22nd and 33rd Divisions of the Chongqing army, and occupied Wenzhou at 9:00 AM on the 9th. Guangzhou, November 11 (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from Chongqing, the Japanese army is now fiercely attacking Qingtian, which is located between Lishui and Wenzhou.

Tokyo, November 11 (Central News Agency) After the Japanese army in Zhejiang Province began operations near Jinhua along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway in mid-August, they gradually defeated the Chongqing army of the Third War Zone under the command of Gu Zhutong and advanced southward.

After the operational posture in the area was fully prepared in early September, they began the attack and finally captured Wenzhou, the largest stronghold of the Chongqing army in southern Zhejiang Province, on the 9th. Recently, the Chongqing and US forces have built deep positions on the mountains on both sides of the highway from Jinhua to Lishui to Wenzhou in an attempt to obstruct the progress of the Japanese army and continue to act in an attempt to cut off the Japanese army's rear supply route, but they were eventually defeated by the Japanese army everywhere. The Japanese army also carried out a surprise attack, crossed the Ou River, and suddenly occupied it. Wenzhou is a liaison base for the Third and Seventh War Zones of the Chongqing army, and is an important military stronghold of the Chongqing army. It is also a coveted area for the enemy and the United States. Recently, the enemy and the United States have clearly intended to use the area as a base to cut off the southern transportation route of Japan, and even as a bridgehead for the continental operation. However, due to the Japanese army's preemptive strike and capture of the area, the enemy and the United States' attempt has been crushed in the bud.

### reaching 40 aircraft

On the other hand, the Japanese air force suddenly detected a B-29 plane that was forced to land near Laohekou, Hubei, and immediately attacked it, and soon burned it down. The

### combined battle results

### Results of Edible Oil Registration

— KURIHARA, Toraji

In light of the current commercial situation, the Oil and Grain Control Committee of the National Commercial Control Federation, in order to understand the consumption status of edible oil, an important staple food for the citizens of Shanghai Special Municipality, and its current situation, established a registration system for the existing quantity and sales of edible oil. On the 26th of last month, members of the Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Association, i.e., oil mills, edible oil dealers (wholesalers), and retailers in Shanghai, were notified to register.

### Registered Quantity of Edible Oil

Regarding the registered contents of the existing edible oil, the four Chinese oil mills and two oil presses that have completed registration with the association have registered all of their stocks. In addition, 141 dealers and 335 retailers have registered. Looking at the total number of operators, the registration rate for oil mills is 100%, but the registration rate for the others is relatively low. However, upon closer inspection, it can be confirmed that the registration rate is about 7% of the actual number of businesses. Among the 270-280 dealer members, about 200 are still operating. The total number of retailers is approximately 1,500-1,600, but more than two-thirds of them are also engaged in the business of food and grocery stores, and the oil they store is minimal, so it is not a problem. This is because there are only about 500 specialized edible oil retailers. Compared with the results of previous registration orders for daily necessities and rice by various authorities, according to rumors in the market, the results of this edible oil registration can be said to be quite good. Looking at the registered quantity, the existing stock of oil mills is more than 5,000 piculs, the stock of dealers is more than 21,300 piculs, and the stock of retailers is more than 9,870 piculs, totaling more than 36,200 piculs. Assuming that the average annual consumption of rice per person is 2 shi (approximately 200 kg) and the average annual consumption of edible oil per person is 10 jin (approximately 5 kg), then the total registered quantity of oil, more than 36,200 piculs, can be said to be equivalent to the registration of 724,000 shi of rice.

### Natural Reduction in Consumption

Moreover, the actual monthly consumption of edible oil by citizens is about 0.6 jin per person, which has naturally decreased. Therefore, the registered quantity is more than sufficient to last for one and a half months. In addition, it is estimated that unregistered oil accounts for about 30%, approximately 12,000 piculs. Furthermore, citizens also have some oil stored in their homes. Even if the source of edible oil is inconvenient or scarce, a certain amount of replenishment (estimated at 300-400 tons) can be obtained each month. Therefore, it seems that edible oil will not become an imminent crisis. However, in recent times, the market price of edible oil has increased more sharply than other goods, which have risen generally due to the electricity saving problem. Why is this? It goes without saying that it is due to the hoarding of financial capitalists. The actual effect of preventing this malpractice is being studied, and a control measure that does not greatly harm the interests of the operators is being sought. Therefore, there is the current system of issuing warehouse receipts, restricting the period of time that operators can store goods, and the registration system. The Control Committee hopes to announce a system that does not cause even minimal harm or anxiety to legitimate buying and selling transactions.

### Cooperation of Employees

Fortunately, we have obtained the above registration results with the understanding of the same industry. This tells us that if operators are not allowed to make undue profits, and the appropriate profits and normal business are not caused any inconvenience, and the handling is not unreasonable, then the conscientious employees will not hesitate to cooperate. In other words, because the person in charge of the Control Committee is a Chinese industry leader, and the cadres are all familiar with the same industry, it is felt that they will never mistreat our colleagues or hinder legitimate trade, which makes everyone feel relieved. Perhaps this explanation is not self-praise! In short, this is indeed a gratifying fact.

### Municipal Advisory Council Recommends Encouraging Rice Production

And Improving Price Controls to Ensure Food Supply - The Municipal Advisory Council of this city, based on previous reports, noted that farmers in remote inland areas, except for areas along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway with convenient transportation, were unwilling to plant rice this year due to the low prices set for rice in the past. The council immediately recommended improving price controls and other measures, as well as encouraging rice production. A letter was sent to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government requesting the central authorities to instruct local government agencies to thoroughly investigate and encourage rice production to ensure the food supply. The Municipal Government has now replied that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has been consulted and that each provincial and municipal government has been instructed to handle the matter accordingly.

### Police Continue to Crack Down on Opium Dens

One Each in Nanshi and Zhabei - The authorities of the Shanghai Police Bureau in charge of suppressing opium dens are actively promoting the suppression of opium, especially strictly investigating opium dens for customers to smoke. They have repeatedly cracked down on opium dens. On the afternoon of the 9th, the department separately cracked down on two large-scale opium dens in Nanshi and Zhabei. In the opium den at 31, Lane 3, Chang'an Road in Zhabei, the owner, Pei Yanong, five employees, and eleven opium smokers were arrested. Nine opium pipes, eight opium lamps, six liang (approximately 300 grams) of opium, and many other parts such as large and small opium boxes were confiscated. In the Ximen opium den at 3, Jiping Lane, Fangxie Road in Nanshi, the owner, Yang Hongxiang, four employees, and two opium smokers were arrested. Five opium pipes, seven opium lamps, more than twenty liang of opium, and smoking paraphernalia such as account books, opium boxes, and cigarette tips were confiscated. The witnesses were taken to the bureau together. After separate trials and inspections, all opium offenders were detained in accordance with the anti-opium regulations and not allowed to post bail. They were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution.

### Earnestly Hope Opium Addicts Will Register and Quit

The bureau is also cracking down on opium while earnestly hoping that opium addicts will love themselves, register as opium addicts as soon as possible in accordance with the law, and quit opium in stages. They must absolutely not hold back and violate the law. At the same time, privately established opium dens are also expected to close voluntarily and not provide customers with opium for smoking or sell opium for profit. Otherwise, once discovered, they will be severely punished in accordance with the law. It is also hoped that citizens will report to the Opium Suppression Department at any time so that officials and the people can cooperate to eliminate the atmosphere of opium in Shanghai and refresh the city's appearance.

### Police Bureau Adjusts Heads of Administrative Sections in Branch Bureaus

### Regular Transfer of District Baojia Offices

The Shanghai Baojia Committee believes that the handover procedures for the Baojia administrative system, which have been clearly defined by the Municipal Government, must be studied in detail. Therefore, it convened its third committee meeting yesterday to discuss the matter seriously. It was decided that the various districts' offices are currently conducting their various affairs for this month as usual, which is difficult to interrupt, and that the expenses are already huge, making it impossible to make up for them. Therefore, it was decided that the transfer date for each district under command should be stipulated as between the 20th and 30th of this month, and no later than September 3rd, which will still be collected by each district for the purpose of ending the process. It is reported that the association has submitted the above-mentioned resolution to the Municipal Government and informed the Municipal Police Bureau to instruct the Baojia Department to investigate and order the district offices to comply with it.

### Poultry Market Established Yesterday

### Special Insurance for Teachers and Staff to Be Handled by a Special Committee

The committee is divided into general affairs, business, and payment groups. The Social Insurance Bureau is actively compiling the budget for the start-up, and once approved, it can begin operations. It is reported that the initial assumption is that the number of insured persons will be between 12,000 and 15,000.

### Authorities Strictly Suppressing Off-Exchange Trading of Chinese Stocks

Thorough Investigation of Speculative Transactions Yields No Concrete Evidence - After the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry dispatched personnel to thoroughly investigate the account books of the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange, they continued to thoroughly investigate the number of shares bought and sold by each broker of the exchange on behalf of customers, and their business account books, to see if there were any speculative buy-short and sell-short transactions. Part of the results have been reported to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for review and instruction. According to sources, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry did not find any conclusive evidence of speculative transactions during the investigation. However, it is reported that in order to stabilize finance and consolidate industrial and commercial investment, the authorities will strictly enforce the suppression of off-exchange transactions by exchange brokers.

### Retail Sugar Merchants Required to Collect Goods Within a Time Limit

The Shanghai Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office recently issued a notice regarding the combined allocation of special sugar in the 24th and 25th periods for Group One users (i.e., former Category B retailers), requiring them to exchange and collect purchase certificates within a time limit. The notice stated: "It is hereby notified that the special allocation of sugar in the 24th period is currently being allocated. In consideration of the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival and the urgent need for sugar by all users, it has been specially requested and permitted by the authorities to issue the special allocation of sugar in the 25th period together with the sugar in the 24th period in advance. Now that the allocation has been completed, except for Group Two users who will be notified by letter, all Group One users (i.e., former Category B retailers) must still come to the office to exchange for purchase certificates as usual. It is hereby decided that purchase certificates will be issued within two days, September 13th and 14th. It is hoped that all users will bring the back of the previous red sales permit stamped with the store seal and the Yangchun Noodle Purchase Certificate to the office within this time limit, and pay off the payment to the designated sugar firm before September 16th, after which the goods will be shipped immediately. Those who fail to collect the purchase certificate within the time limit, or have collected the certificate but fail to pay off the payment within the time limit, will be deemed to have automatically waived the allocation and will be cancelled."

### Merchants and Citizens Must Report Goods in Accordance with Regulations

### Tongren University of Shanghai Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday

Shanghai Private Tongren University, after more than a year of preparation since its inception in July last year, is now ready. A grand opening ceremony was held at the university on Datong Road at 10:00 am yesterday (11th). Government officials present included Foreign Minister Chu, Director Dai of the Education Bureau representing Mayor Chen, Lu of the Health Department, Sun Lifu, Lin Ji, Liao Jianan, Chen Zhongfu, Yuan Junchang, Chen Shaowei, Zhao Zhengping, Xu Liqiu, Ding Fubao, Yan Fuqing, Zhang Enlin, and others.

Qiao Zheng, Rear Admiral Kondo, Rear Admiral Ito of the Navy, Naval Attaché Rear Admiral Kondo, Watanabe Yuxiong, President of the Japanese Residents Association, Funatsu Tatsichiro, and other guests from all walks of life and all students, totaling more than a hundred people.

### Principal Chu's Speech

First, Principal Chu Minyi of the university delivered an opening speech, reporting that after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Allied Japanese government, in view of the closure of most of the medical schools and health institutions established by the British and Americans in China, and the inconvenience felt by the Chinese people due to the lack of medical and diagnostic institutions, specially established Tongren Hospitals in various parts of China to relieve young people who had lost their studies and the suffering of patients. At the same time, in order to cultivate talented young Chinese medical personnel, preparations were made for the establishment of Shanghai Medical University. Since the establishment of the preparatory committee on July 25 last year, it was decided to establish three colleges: medicine, pharmacy, and hygiene, and named it Private Shanghai Tongren University. In accordance with the provisions of the revised regulations for private schools by the Ministry of Education, a board of directors was established. Vice Chairman Miyakawa of Tongren Association and I have discussed the matter several times, and appointed Mr. Lu Runzhi, Wen Lanting, Wu Zhenxiu, Xu Guanqun, Yan Fuqing, Le Wenzhao, Jiang Kun, Guo Shun, and Yuan Jufan as directors, and I was elected as chairman. With the assistance of the government authorities and the Allied authorities, the preparatory work proceeded smoothly, and the former St. Mary's Girls' School on Changning Road was selected as a branch campus. It was also agreed that Renji and Hongren Hospitals would be the teaching hospitals of the university. The original intention was to establish the three colleges during the war, but due to the lack of medical materials and the difficulty of transporting equipment, only the medical college was established. I concurrently serve as the dean of the medical college, and Mr. Zhang Sukang was appointed as the secretary-general, Mr. Higashiniro as the dean of academic affairs, Professor Tsuzuki of Tokyo Imperial University as the consultant, and Mr. Tsurumi Hisashi as the director of general affairs. After the personnel were determined, registration procedures were carried out with the Education Bureau, and with the support of Mayor Chen and Minister of Education Li, the registration was approved. Thanks should be expressed to Mayor Chen and Minister Li. After all the preparatory work was completed on the 6th of this year, enrollment began on July 1. However, due to the small size of the school buildings and the imperfect equipment, the board of directors decided to temporarily enroll 30 students in this term, so that each student can study quietly and avoid the worry of neglecting one thing for another in teaching. Unexpectedly, young people from all over Beijing and Shanghai heard the news and applied for admission, reaching more than 1,000 people. I deeply regret those who missed the opportunity, and I sincerely hope that the officials of the Chinese and Japanese governments and people from all walks of life will provide guidance and supervision in the future, so that this school can fulfill this great mission.

### Mayor's Admonition

After the speech, Director Dai of the Education Bureau, representing Mayor Chen, read the mayor's instructions, which mainly stated: At the intersection of the righteous positions of China and Japan, the Allied Japan is sparing no effort in building Greater East Asia. The establishment of Tongren University this time is of great significance. Allied medicine is advanced, and the people are healthy. Due to the lack of medical talent in our country, we have been subjected to the humiliation of being called the "sick man of East Asia." This time, thanks to the Allied government for sending well-known medical experts to China to assist in the cultivation of medical talent in our country, I believe that they will be able to complete their mission. At the same time, it will also make a great contribution to the communication between Chinese and Japanese cultures. After the mayor's instructions, Director Lu of the Health Department, Minister Usami representing Ambassador Gu, and guest Chen Zhongfu delivered speeches successively, and after reading the congratulatory telegram from Minister of Greater East Asia Konoe, the ceremony concluded at 12 o'clock.

### Symposium on Secondary Education

In order to discuss the general direction of education improvement, this newspaper held a symposium on university education on the 4th of this month. On the afternoon of the 6th, a symposium on secondary education was held at the Gongshang Lianyi Association. The attendees included Fan Baoruo, Sun Deyu, Sun Xiangzhong, Xu Fu, Ju Qingyuan, Ruan Binhua, Zhu Yunnan, Zhang Gongsu, Gu Jia, Kong Minzhong, Chen Tianyu, Lin Buji, Xu Jingqing, Cui Jianwu, Feng Zhen, Li Yulan, and Wu Pengfei, all teachers from various middle schools. The meeting was chaired by Huang Jingwan, director of the social service department of this newspaper. The following is a record of the main points of the symposium: Huang Jingwan: I am very honored that all the teachers have taken the time to attend the symposium on secondary education today and express their valuable opinions. Education is a reflection of the politics and economy of the times, and schools are the main source of education. Secondary schools, in particular, are the key to determining the advancement of education. All the speakers are rich in experience in secondary education and must have profound insights into how to improve and reform the current problems of secondary education. Therefore, I have specially raised several core issues and asked you to express your opinions. I would be very grateful.

### First: Improving Teachers' Living Conditions

Huang Jingwan: Now, please elaborate on the issue of "improving teachers' living conditions." According to recent reports, the municipal government is particularly concerned about the education sector and is preparing to implement a special allocation system and teacher insurance system for education personnel, which is very exciting. At the same time, this newspaper also has teacher and staff subsidies and medical aid funds to fulfill its service responsibilities. Chen Tianyu: To address the lives of teachers, I would like to speak from two aspects: ○ On the teacher's side, teachers have a great influence on students. (1) Teachers should have the ambition to take education as a lifelong career. (2) Teachers should have outstanding knowledge and specialized skills. (3) Teachers should have exemplary moral character. ○ On the school's side, (1) in terms of material aspects, teachers' salaries should be increased as much as possible, at least to maintain their health. (2) In terms of spiritual aspects, schools should not regard teachers as employees, but should make teachers recognize themselves as the center of the school and encourage the spirit of teachers. The best measure is to make the economy public, such as pre-paying salaries to stabilize life. When life is guaranteed, the spirit will naturally be comforted. Kong Minzhong: When it comes to education, those who run schools should certainly think of ways, but most importantly, the government authorities should also bear the same responsibility. The government's efforts for education can be regarded as the minimum! Cui Jianwu: Colleagues in the education sector, whether principals or teachers, should jointly take responsibility and work together to solve the current crisis, so that the phenomenon of "school shops" will no longer exist in the future. Fan Shiruo: Regarding the issue of teachers' lives, we can now come to a conclusion: ○ We hope that the education authorities and society will attach importance to education. ○ The school's economy should be made public, and teachers' salaries should be increased as much as possible as a percentage of total income (at least 70% or more), especially for elderly and retired teachers and staff, who should be given preferential treatment. ○ Promote the guidance teacher movement. ○ The media should reveal the darkness of the education sector based on facts.

### Second: Review of Scholarship Movement

Huang Jingwan: Our newspaper has been running scholarships for seven sessions, with poverty, excellence, and health as the screening criteria. We are sincerely grateful for the assistance of various schools, and we hope that schools will strictly educate and manage the students who receive assistance and maintain close contact with our newspaper. Now, for the review of the scholarship movement, please express your opinions. Cui Jianwu: Your newspaper has achieved excellent results in running scholarships. However, I would like to suggest that the admission standards be relaxed, especially for students who are indeed poor but whose grades are slightly worse, who should be given special treatment for relief. Fan Zeruo: In addition to the examination method, please refer to the school's usual grades, because some students are temporarily flustered and psychologically abnormal, resulting in poor screening results, which often leads to failure to be selected. Huang Jingwan: Regarding the screening criteria, our newspaper does not completely rely on the examination. The examination is only one of the criteria. In addition to the score, we also refer to the family situation and grades at school. If the grades at school are very good or too poor, we will handle them carefully and try our best to avoid speculative attempts. Regarding this point, I would like to ask all schools to assist us. Now, please express your opinions on the aspect of relieving students who failed to be selected. Xu Fu: If students in our school do not receive enough scholarship money or are not approved, the teachers and students will create a scholarship to make up for it. In the next semester, we plan to adopt a grade-based scholarship system to enable students to develop the virtues of sympathy and mutual assistance, so that no one will drop out of school due to the inability to afford tuition. Kong Minzhong: Primary and secondary schools are the foundation of general education, and the number of primary and secondary school students is the largest. Therefore, please increase the percentage of scholarships approved by your newspaper for primary and secondary school students. As for our school's response to the scholarship movement, in addition to providing free tuition to the top five students with excellent grades in each grade, we also provide free tuition to those who receive scholarships from various places and who are particularly poor, and return the scholarship money. Xu Jingqing: I believe that scholarships should pay special attention to poverty. Those who are excellent but not poor will not be approved, but those who are poor but whose grades are slightly worse should be given flexibility. Our school provides free tuition to scholarship students who are particularly poor, and also returns the scholarship money they receive to purchase books and stationery. Xu Fu: Regarding reducing the burden on students, our school implements a book borrowing system, that is, teachers encourage students in senior grades to lend their used books to students in lower grades. This method can be used as a reference for various schools. Fan Zejun: In summary, there are four points that can be used as a reference for future scholarship movements: ○ Attention should be paid to usual grades. ○ The approval criteria should focus on primary and secondary school students. ○ Emphasis should be placed on the word "poverty" rather than excellence. ○ Please increase the number of free places in various schools and maintain close contact with scholarship agencies.

### Third: Restricting Transfers to Maintain Student Level

Hua Gujingwan: Since running scholarships, we have gained some experience. Now, the number of students transferring at all levels is very large. Among them, there are legitimate reasons such as relocation or different interests. However, some students are fickle and some skip grades. In short, it is not beneficial to schools and students, and all schools should pay serious attention to student transfers. Fan Zeruo: Regarding the issue of transfers, restriction or prohibition is of course impossible, but attention should be paid to the connection of grades, because there are often false and untrue phenomena. Therefore, in addition to a piece of diploma, strict examinations should be carried out to ensure that the course work is connected and there is no abuse of skipping grades.

### Fourth: Extracurricular Life of Middle School Students

Huang Jingwan: In addition to the educational problems within the school mentioned above, we feel that it is necessary to guide the extracurricular life of students. Cui Jianwu: Regarding students' extracurricular life, the most important thing is to promote normal entertainment. Fan Zeruo: Please, you guys, promote more and add public sports fields as places for students to rest and play after school. It is best to open up places with a suitable location and a large area, such as parks and racetracks. Ruan Binhua: Organize student research societies, reading societies, lecture societies, etc., and provide guidance from the school. Kong Fanzhong: I think that the above points can all be included in school life. In addition, we should also promote handicraft and music courses, on the one hand to cultivate temperament, and on the other hand to reduce improper entertainment. Apart from this, I think the less extracurricular activities, the better. Wu Pengfei: Our school has always focused on moral, intellectual, physical, and aesthetic development, especially physical education, with emphasis on life guidance, so that students will not be detached from the life of the masses and become lonely bookworms. Fan Gongruo: Within the possible scope, please schools promote and guide students' extracurricular life, increase music and handicraft courses as much as possible, or designate some places as sports fields for students.

### Fifth: Post-War Educational Construction Policy

Sun Xiangzhong: The current trend in education is too much emphasis on utilitarianism, which can indeed make young students have ambitious goals. However, the development of utilitarianism promotes material civilization. The more developed the material, the more external things are enough to change people's temperament, resulting in hedonism. Since the end of the Qing Dynasty, our country has always paid too much attention to Western civilization and put our own culture behind us. Therefore, on the surface, social activities are as hot and intense as fire, but in essence, they are gradually declining. From the perspective of education, the national character is gradually declining. Therefore, in order to reverse the crisis, the most important thing is human-based education. The so-called human-based education is that every citizen, whether in psychological or physiological aspects, must have sound development. In other words, it is to promote morality. The effect of promoting morality is to enable every young person to have the inherent nature of mutual generation, mutual support, mutual respect, mutual love, filial piety, loyalty, trust, etc., so as not to be blinded by the social habits of rampant human desire. In this regard, China's current education is undoubtedly a failure. For example, many university students often cannot even use their own national language, can write with a fountain pen but are not good at using a brush. In fact, this is too far from true civilization. General schools often pay too much attention to specialization and ignore basic education because they pay too much attention to material and ignore spirit. Therefore, the most important responsibility of primary and secondary school education is to preserve the inherent culture and develop the inherent nature of youth in addition to introducing Western civilization. I feel that the temperament of general schools is generally low, which has a great impact on students. If everyone in our education sector can adhere to the purpose and jointly take responsibility, the students will naturally cheer up. We cannot follow the world, we must change the world. Following the world is utilitarianism, and changing the world is humanistic culture. This is the reason why humans are different from animals, and this is also the difference between civilization and barbarism. For example, if students only have formal politeness to teachers, and when time passes, they regard each other as strangers, this is a manifestation of utilitarianism, but what we need is human nature education, so we must teach the relationship between people, the relationship between teachers and students, and so on. In this way, even if we do not teach the form of bowing and saluting, there will naturally be a close spiritual connection between teachers and students. The current social turmoil and the failure of politics to get on the right track are undoubtedly the failure of education. The relationship between politics and education is like a chicken and an egg. If politics is bad, it is not easy for education to improve. If education does not develop, politics will not get on the right track. History has created us, and we will create the next generation. Passing on from generation to generation, constantly changing. As for the trend of the next generation, it depends entirely on the efforts of the current education sector. Therefore, on the one hand, we should educate students, and on the other hand, we should pay attention to the social and political trends to eliminate material desires with spiritual strength. Sun Deyu: Just now, Mr. Sun elaborated on his profound insights and clearly defined the direction for the future of education. However, I feel that in implementation, the first thing is to improve the curriculum. The content of extracurricular reading materials for middle school students is too dangerous. Once the thinking is divergent, it is very difficult to correct it. In elementary school, it is still innocent, but middle school can be said to be a degenerate institution. In ancient times, my country's teacher-student relationship included imparting knowledge, teaching skills, and explaining culture, but today's education cannot be implemented in any way. On the contrary, it has become a store for selling class hours. Teachers are not responsible, and students' respect for teachers and Taoism is even more out of the question. Therefore, I advocate improving the curriculum and introducing our country's inherent culture. Currently, teachers are not well-fed and lack strength, and are always concerned about their lives. Students often waste their studies and focus on money, and are wandering in the wrong direction, developing a myopic view of psychology. However, the responsibility of secondary education is not less than that of universities and elementary schools. The Book says, "Be precise and unified, hold the middle." The word "middle" can also be interpreted as the word "middle" in middle school. "Yangzi wept when he saw a fork in the road." If we are not careful, we will make a big mistake. Therefore, we should hold a far-sighted vision, improve the content of the curriculum, target the drawbacks of "what you learn is not what you use, and what you use is not what you learn," and at the same time take care of physical and mental cultivation. The method, such as weekly meetings and memorial weeks, is a kind of mental training. In addition, we should also run more vocational education. Fan Zeruo: The above two Mr. Suns have expressed their earnest and profound remarks and given us clear enlightenment on the future direction of education construction. Now, to summarize it in one sentence, it is "character education as the foundation, and scientific education as the application."

### Mr. Wu Rende's Frugality and Donation to Charity

### Correspondence

The Shanghai Branch of the Issuing Department of the Central Reserve Bank sent a letter yesterday stating: [Having read Mr. Cheng Qipeng's article [The Issue of Withdrawing the Smallest Denomination Banknotes] in the National Forum column on September 7th, there seems to be a misunderstanding regarding the Bank's handling of subsidiary currency exchange. This Bank has always tried its best to exchange subsidiary currency without restrictions, but for practical convenience, it is stipulated that it should be exchanged in units of one yuan. This letter serves to correct the record.]

### Thunderstorm

That morning, Longfu got up especially early. While brushing his teeth in the washroom, he heard the radio.
[Hmm...]
He was suddenly startled, and dropped the aluminum teacup to the ground. He jumped, and his socks got wet, but he didn't notice at all.
[Good... good!]
That was all he was aware of. For a moment, his body trembled. Of course, it wasn't because of fear. It was because of mixed feelings, the surging of his heart and body. After a moment, his head lowered. He even forgot himself and wanted to pray to heaven. Bean-sized tears fell onto the bed, one by one.

Even so, he was an employee of the Naval Ministry, and he hadn't known a single piece of news until he got off work yesterday. Of course, as just a military employee, he didn't want to know such a top secret about starting a war, but he just felt strange. Only today did he understand. Actually, if he guessed, he might have known. But looking at the atmosphere within his department, whether yesterday or the day before, everything was the same as usual, without any change.
(Truly admirable!)
Longfu wasn't sad because he was a military employee, but instead deeply felt the Navy's control. What Westerners called the [Silent Navy] was now fully realized.

He quickly washed his face and went back to his room to put on his suit. Given the nature of his work as a painter, he usually didn't go to work until nearly noon, but today he couldn't stay in his room.

Taking his shoes out of the wooden shoe box, the landlord came out in his pajamas and said,
[The fighting has finally started!]
This landlord was always talking about money, usually very despicable and petty, but on this day, his face showed a clear and moving expression.
[The fighting has started... truly exhilarating!]
Longfu put on his shoes and jumped outside.

Although he went to the restaurant where he usually ate breakfast, he didn't feel hungry and didn't want to eat anything. If he were a soldier, perhaps he wouldn't care at all in this situation and would still eat heartily, but he felt like he was fine without eating.

The passengers in the streetcar had completely different expressions than yesterday. No one was reading the newspaper. The morning newspaper sold faster than ever today, and it had already sold out completely.

Longfu felt like he had forgotten something very important, and thought of Zhenren.
(Zhenren must be very happy! Then where is he exactly? If he were an air force officer, perhaps Zhenren would definitely be assigned to the front line, but Zhenren is a naval officer...)

The streetcar stopped at Yotsuya Station. He ran up the stairs to catch the bus. (140)
