### The Responsibility of Today's Social Leaders

Shanghai is a large metropolis, so the occupations of Shanghai citizens mostly belong to the industrial and commercial sectors. In other words, the industrial and commercial sector constitutes the mainstay of Shanghai. The leaders of the industrial and commercial sectors are the leaders of Shanghai society. When we speak of "The Responsibility of Today's Social Leaders," we are referring to the leaders of the industrial, commercial, and economic sectors.

Because the industrial and commercial sectors constitute the mainstay of Shanghai, the responsibility of the leaders of these sectors to safeguard Shanghai is particularly significant. However, since 1937 (Republic Year 26) until now, to what extent have Shanghai's social leaders recognized their responsibility to safeguard Shanghai? To what extent have they fulfilled that responsibility? If we try to conduct a frank review and examination, it becomes a major question.

In our editorial on June 6th, we mentioned the issue of the awakening of Shanghai people, pointing out three types: "[Putting the public before the private, putting the private before the public, and only the private without the public]." Which should be discarded and which should be chosen? It is up to the citizens of Shanghai to awaken together and carefully decide on the correct path. Based on general observation, very few citizens currently are able to "[Put the public before the private]." Even those who "[Put the private before the public]" are not numerous. The most common is "[Only the private without the public]," only knowing about private matters and private interests, disregarding public affairs and public interests. For example, those pursuing profiteering, using any means necessary, disregarding the public, harming others to benefit themselves, and only seeking private gain are perfect examples of "[Only the private without the public]."

We believe that the atmosphere of "[Only the private without the public]" in society is cultivated by a segment of social leaders. Zeng Guofan said: "Where do customs come from? They depend on the influence of the hearts of a few people." If social leaders can lead by example, they will naturally have a guiding influence. Excellent advocacy will naturally cultivate excellent customs, while poor advocacy will also cultivate poor customs. Now, if we carefully examine the behavior of a segment of social leaders, they only focus on the development of their private enterprises and have little enthusiasm for public undertakings. Some wealthy individuals only know how to enjoy themselves and do not even put effort into their private enterprises.

Secondly, there is a lack of clear understanding of the current situation, and a tendency to listen to rumors, holding onto a "[Waiting-and-see attitude]." They believe that the European situation will end in two or three months, and it seems that there is a related connection in East Asia, so the end is not far off. They easily believe in counter-propaganda, such as rumors that Chiang Kai-shek will return to Shanghai. In reality, Chongqing is currently completely controlled by the Americans. If Chongqing still had its own strength, why couldn't it defend important places like Changsha and Hengyang? Before the Greater East Asia War, we often heard unfounded rumors, such as eating mooncakes in Shanghai during the Mid-Autumn Festival, and eating New Year's Eve dinner in Shanghai during the Lunar New Year, etc. But in fact, they were all absurd and unreliable, nothing more than empty promises that could not be fulfilled.

We believe that past rumors have already been disproven by facts, and we can no longer have a blurred understanding of the current reality. From a distance, even if the European situation ends in the short term, it will have little impact on East Asia. The essence of the Greater East Asia War is a war for the liberation of the Greater East Asia nations, a life-and-death battle where the victor survives and the loser perishes. Unless Britain and the United States are defeated and withdraw from East Asia, the Greater East Asia War cannot end. Therefore, attempting to maintain the status quo is to court destruction. From a closer perspective, Shanghai is Shanghai, and the European situation is the European situation. It is an exaggeration to say that the end of the European situation is related to the Greater East Asia War, and it is even more absurd to say that Chiang Kai-shek will return to Shanghai when the European situation ends. From the perspective of Shanghai people, no matter how the situation evolves, we must first do our best to overcome the crises in Shanghai itself at all times and in all places, not to mention contributing to them. If we only care about private matters and hold a "waiting-and-see attitude," the imagined future will be difficult to realize, and the crises will erupt first. "When the nest is overturned, no egg remains intact." Social leaders as intelligent as you are probably would not ignore this!

We have repeatedly cried out about the crises facing Shanghai today, such as the need to strengthen security and increase funding to counter enemy conspiracies, and the need to crack down on profiteering and suppress prices to combat soaring prices. Therefore, the responsibility of Shanghai's social leaders today is to passively avoid violating wartime life, avoid pursuing profiteering, and correct the selfish atmosphere in the industrial and commercial sectors. Actively, they should be enthusiastic about public welfare, seek happiness for society, and set an example of putting the public before the private.

### Japanese Troops on the Nujiang River Launch a Clever Internal Line of Operations

Chongqing Expeditionary Force Counterattack Repelled

Nujiang Front, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The elite Japanese troops on the west bank of the Nujiang River are currently inflicting heavy losses on the Chongqing army through clever internal line operations. Since the beginning of May, a portion of the Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force, equipped with American equipment, has launched a major counterattack with its abundant manpower and the material support provided by the American military. The intensity and aggressiveness of this counterattack are truly noteworthy in the Chongqing army's history since the start of the Incident. Furthermore, the Chongqing military authorities believe that this operation will not only have a significant impact on the War of Resistance in the future, but will also be enough to sway the destiny of Chongqing in the future. It is truly an unprecedented major offensive operation. Moreover, since the start of the operation, the Chongqing army has suffered 50,000 casualties, but it continues to attack. These facts also demonstrate the degree to which Chongqing attaches importance to this operation. The current intention of the Chongqing army is to achieve its goal of controlling northern Burma and the Ledo Road after capturing key locations such as Tengchong, Longling, Lameng, and Pingyou. Therefore, it is currently attacking fiercely with a large amount of manpower and material resources. However, the Japanese army has established a solid defense against this and has launched a clever attrition warfare. The Chongqing army's attempt is extremely difficult to realize.

Japanese Base on the Burma Front, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese air force stationed in Burma, in cooperation with the ground forces in the Nujiang area, launched a fierce attack on the Chongqing army positions in the Tengchong and Mengchangjie areas on the 10th. In Mengchangjie, they completely captured several hundred Chongqing troops in Sheng Yu Village and destroyed a large number of vehicles, mortars, and anti-aircraft guns. A portion of the Japanese air force also bombed the Chongqing army air base in that area, inflicting heavy losses. Five Japanese aircraft did not return.

Japanese Base on the Burma Front, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The morale of the Chongqing army near Longling has rapidly declined due to the continuous fierce attacks by the Japanese army. In addition, they have repeatedly lost key locations, and the morale of the entire army has been shaken. The Japanese army and air force in that area coordinated their attacks, launching a fierce attack on the (V-2) high ground 4 kilometers north of Longling and the high ground 2 kilometers southeast of Longling on the 10th.

### Japanese Troops Advance Along Hunan-Guangxi Railway, Reaching Quanzhou County

Liuzhou and Xi'an Airfields Bombed

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a United Press report from Chongqing, after occupying Lingling, Japanese troops in Hunan have advanced southwestward along the Hunan-Guangxi Railway and have now crossed the border between Hunan and Guangxi provinces, reaching Quanzhou County in Guangxi. Commander Stilwell confirmed this matter. Quanzhou County is only about 100 kilometers from Guilin and is a key point in the South China defense organization. The Chongqing military headquarters has not yet released any information regarding the battle in the Quanzhou County area. Japanese troops in other areas are also currently advancing.

A Certain Japanese Base on the China Front, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – After tracking and pursuing enemy aircraft that attacked at dawn on the 11th, Japanese aircraft squadrons continued to raid the Liuzhou airfield, braving inclement weather and heavy anti-aircraft fire from the Chongqing army. In addition to destroying five large American aircraft stationed near the runway, they also set fire to one of the ground facilities. After achieving their objectives, the Japanese aircraft returned leisurely.

A Certain Japanese Front Base, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese air force raided the Xi'an and Liuzhou airfields on the night of the 10th, completely destroying their protective facilities. In Liuzhou, one of the ground facilities caught fire, and five large aircraft on the ground were destroyed. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.

### Personnel Changes in the Japanese Ministry of the Navy

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese naval authorities have transferred Vice Admiral Eiji Goto, commander of the Chinkai Naval Defense District, to the Naval General Staff. His successor has been decided as Vice Admiral Takazumi Oka. Also, Rear Admiral Kokichi Takagi, Director of the Education Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy, has been transferred to the Naval General Staff. The vacancy has been decided to be filled by Rear Admiral Shinzou Onishi.

### Zhejiang Provincial Government Strictly Prohibits Forced Conscription of Military Rice

Hangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Zhejiang Provincial Government believes that in all remote areas of the province, farmers deeply resent the past pain of forced conscription of military rice due to preconceived notions. If no measures are taken to quickly comfort them and earnestly encourage increased production, this year's yield will inevitably decrease. Yesterday, it specially ordered the county governments to thoroughly investigate and persuade, in order to enrich the people's food supply. At the same time, it strictly prohibits the military and police from forcibly conscripting rice in a perfunctory manner.

### Quebec Conference Will First Discuss Strategy

Political Issues Take Secondary Importance

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Reuters reports: President Roosevelt, along with his wife and physician, Admiral McIntire, arrived in Quebec yesterday to prepare for a meeting with Prime Minister Churchill. Chief of Staff General Leahy and several other military and political figures accompanied him. Churchill arrived in Quebec after Roosevelt, accompanied by Mrs. Churchill and a large number of officials.

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The German News Agency reports: According to an official announcement from Quebec, Stalin has declined the invitation to the Quebec Conference. Stalin stated that his colleagues unanimously believe that he cannot leave the country due to the war against Germany.

Stockholm, 13th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Reuters reports: The purpose of the Quebec Conference is not yet clear. The British delegation includes army, navy, and air force generals, as well as the Minister of Transport, suggesting that the conference is military in nature. However, news released from London over the weekend emphasized the importance of the Soviet-Polish issue, and the British news agency published news that British Foreign Secretary Eden and U.S. Secretary of State Hull will also travel to Quebec. Stalin's refusal to attend the conference is probably to avoid others spying on his secrets, and Moscow is also aware that the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Polish issue has caused dissatisfaction among British and American people and has not improved. The Roosevelt-Churchill conference will first discuss strategic issues, with political issues taking only secondary importance. The Soviet Union's attitude is an important factor in all political discussions, which goes without saying. Roosevelt and Churchill cannot ignore the Soviet Union's attitude when dealing with European issues. The measures taken by the Soviet Union towards Poland are clear evidence of seizing political and military initiative from the hands of Britain and the United States. The Soviet Union's attitude is clearly the main issue of the Quebec Conference.

### German Ambassador to Romania Shot Dead by Romanian Soldiers

Bern, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The German News Agency reports, citing a report from the Stanbol News in Geneva: During the recent disturbances in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, Romanian soldiers shot dead the German Ambassador to Romania, Killinger. The Soviet government has reportedly requested that the Romanian side hand over the ambassador to the Soviet side. The Romanian army's move is related to the Soviet request, which is quite possible.

### British Forces Exert Pressure on Dutch-Belgian Border

Fierce Fighting on Upper Moselle River

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Reuters reports: The German troops' withdrawal has shifted the fighting to the Scheldt Estuary. Canadian troops are still closely pursuing the German troops and preventing them from retreating to southern Holland. The British Second Army on the Albert Canal is attempting to expand its bridgehead on the opposite bank and is putting pressure on northeastern Holland. The U.S. First Army continues to attack between Maastricht and Ardennes. General Hodges's goal seems to be the Aachen Basin. After regrouping on Saturday, the U.S. Third Army crossed the Luxembourg border from the Arlon area and has occupied Luxembourg City. The U.S. pressure on Hagenlingen-Metz in the central Moselle area has eased slightly. The left wing of the U.S. Third Army will soon advance from Neufchâteau. Fierce fighting is currently taking place on the upper reaches of the Moselle. Whether this new movement of the U.S. military has strategic significance or is only diversionary in nature is currently unknown. The southern end of the western front is at the Langres Plateau. The German troops south of Dijon have moved eastward according to plan and are close to Belfort. The U.S. Seventh Army launched a flank attack on the German troops in the Besançon area and was repelled. The German defense line between the Doubs River and the Swiss border, west and southwest of the Béria Mountains, is also under heavy pressure from the enemy.

### German Counterattack in French-Italian Border Area

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The German News Agency reports: German troops in southern France have begun a counterattack north of Menton, which is located east of Ventimiglia in the French-Italian border area.

### A Trip to Qingpu (1) Hua

In order to understand the actual conditions of the rural villages in the suburbs, this newspaper dispatched a reporter to make a short trip. The reporter was ordered to first take Qingpu as his destination.

Setting Foot on the Qingpu Road

At 7:30 AM on September 8th, I departed in the misty rain. At the southern end of Great Shanghai Road and Fujian Road, I boarded the bus bound for Qingpu. After a moment of driving, after passing Chang'an Road, I crossed the railway, where the Chang'an Road police station checked residency permits. After a few steps, it was the Jianghai Customs Collection Branch. Fellow travelers carrying goods all paid taxes as usual. Further west, we arrived at the Great Inspection Post, where all passengers had to get off and walk, undergoing a detailed inspection by the inspection post before re-boarding the bus and continuing westward.

One of the fellow travelers, Mr. Tao, was from Jinze in Qingpu. He was originally from a family with some land. Recently, due to the rising cost of living, he was engaged in small-scale business. His conversation with me about the lives and economic conditions of farmers in the countryside, from shallow to deep, and from far to near, provided a lot of information. When I saw a green and lush natural landscape, I couldn't help but exclaim, "This year's harvest should be very optimistic, right?" He replied, "The early rice harvest has been ravaged by the scorching summer drought and the recent gales and torrential rains, with at most only 50-60% of the harvest. The late rice is still uncertain. If there are still gales and torrential rains in the next few days, blowing them down completely, I fear that it will be much worse than the early rice currently being harvested. Fortunately, the weather has been cloudy with light rain these past few days, so it shouldn't cause any harm. I only hope that heaven will grant our wishes, and the late rice can be fully harvested, that will be the blessing of the farmers in Qingpu!"

From Mr. Tao's conversation, I began to pay attention to the already yellowed rice paddies on both sides of the fields, which were probably the early rice he mentioned. Among the green and lush late rice, there were also occasional scattered plots that were mostly leaning to one side or another. Their numbers seemed very limited.

After about two hours of driving, we arrived at Gencheng Gate in Qingpu – known as the East Gate. The bus stopped at the foot of the drawbridge outside Gencheng Gate. The passengers got off one after another, each paying a fare of 350 yuan.

After getting off the bus, I followed the city moat around to North Gate Street, which is Qingpu's bustling downtown area. Large and small shops were lined up one after another. The reporter checked into the "Qingpu Grand Hotel." It was a small room, just enough for a bed. Besides a coffee table and square stool, there was nothing else, but the marked price was higher than similar hotels in Shanghai, requiring 132 yuan, plus a special tax of 20 yuan.

Conditions in the Rural Villages

Qingpu is a rice-producing area, and most of the people rely on farming for a living. Those who live in the rural villages are mostly tenant farmers. In the past, they were mostly able to make ends meet, but in the last year or two, they have suffered the pain of not being able to make a living. The layers of exploitation in between are certainly a major cause, but the lack of self-improvement on the part of the tenant farmers themselves is also a significant factor. Just taking gambling as an example, at the beginning of this spring, when the Zhujiajiao gambling dens had not yet been banned, the general young and strong rushed to them like ducks to water, gambling day and night, neglecting sleep and meals. Those who went bankrupt and those who committed suicide were often heard of. During the slack farming season, there was really nothing to do, so they thought about how to pass the idle time. Thus, mahjong, pai gow, betting on stalls, and all kinds of gambling formed groups everywhere. As for those who smoked opium and white powder (referring to heroin or white flour), they were also not few.

Farmers feel particularly headache about exorbitant taxes and levies. For example, the monthly tax of 3 yuan per mu, regardless of whether it is cultivated or not, is unavoidable. Once the military passes through the territory, the Baodia chief will always accompany them door-to-door to allot 2 or 3 sheng of rice per household. The remaining scattered and trivial items are numerous. The harvest of one mu is limited, and the exploitation from various sources is endless. The farmers really feel out of breath.

### Chairman Wang's Admonitory Speech to Encourage Cadre Corps and Team Cadres of the Ninth Term of the Military Officers Training Corps

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Cadre Corps of the Ninth Term of the Central Army Military Officers Training Corps held a supplementary opening ceremony on the 12th. Deputy Corps Commander Chen presided over the ceremony. Central government officials present included Chief of General Staff Bao, Army Chief Ye, and Navy Chief Ren, as well as Major General Asakai of the Allied Nations, and over 500 students. First, Deputy Corps Commander Chen read Chairman Wang's (concurrently the Corps Commander) admonitory speech, followed by Major General Asakai delivering a speech on behalf of the highest military advisor of the National Government. Deputy Corps Commander Chen then read the precepts for military personnel of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The ceremony concluded at 11:00 AM.

Chairman Wang's Admonitory Speech

Today, we are holding the opening ceremony for the Cadre Corps of the Ninth Term of the Central Army Military Officers Training Corps. As your Corps Commander, I would like to emphasize a few points for your encouragement. We are now in the decisive phase of the Greater East Asia War, and our military building efforts must be intensified. Military building begins with training, and cadres at all levels are central to the training of troops. The quality of the troops depends entirely on the quality of the cadres. Only with excellent cadres can we train excellent soldiers. Therefore, even in these times of pressing defense and hectic military affairs, you have been selected to come to the Corps for training, so that you can quickly complete the task of military building, assist the Allied nations in ensuring the security of the rear, and strive for the final victory in the Greater East Asia War. The focus of the training should be:

First, emphasize the understanding of national policy. Regarding the understanding of national policy, it is essential that all existing national troops fully recognize the unity of the East Asian peoples, in order to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. The fate of East Asian nations is intertwined; they share weal and woe. Therefore, the rise and fall, survival and demise of East Asian nations depend entirely on the victory or defeat of the Greater East Asia War. Victory means co-existence and prosperity, and all East Asian nations will be liberated. Defeat means that when the nest is overturned, no egg will remain intact, and no East Asian people can escape. This sense of sharing joys and sorrows, of living and dying together, is the primary essence of the national army's spiritual education. Only then will the use of military force not go astray and misdirect its...? (Unclear code).

Second, emphasize the strictness of military discipline. On this point, we must ensure that military discipline is strictly observed at all times and in all places, to serve as a model for improving all units. Military discipline is the lifeblood of the army. Even in daily life, in eating and resting, you must cultivate the habit of strict discipline. Only then, with a single command, can you go through fire and water without hesitation. Only when the army cultivates this kind of iron discipline in peacetime can it concentrate its strength on the battlefield to fight the stubborn enemy and strive for the victory in the last five minutes.

Third, emphasize the training of military skills and physical strength. Scientific and technological skills occupy a very important position in modern warfare. While spiritual strength is fundamentally important, it must be supplemented with military skills and physical training to achieve perfection.

Your training period in the Corps is only four months. You must work diligently day and night, not only on spiritual cultivation, but also on studying hard, so that you can gain insight from your studies. In the future, after returning to your posts, you should use what you have learned to educate soldiers and train elite troops to shoulder the responsibility of reviving China and defending East Asia. The country has high expectations for you.

### The Police Bureau's Inspectorate Implements Special Inspections

Rectifying Police Discipline and Inspecting Branch Bureau Operations

The Police Bureau's Inspectorate of this city, in order to thoroughly rectify police discipline and actively promote matters related to police supervision, in addition to constantly supervising and inspecting the police affairs of various branch bureaus, has also scheduled the first special inspection to be held from the 11th of this month to September. The chief inspectors of each district are instructed to rotate personnel to the branch bureaus under their jurisdiction to inspect internal affairs such as general administration, judicial police defense, and detainees in detention centers, as well as external affairs such as inspecting order at police posts, train stations, wharves, lighting control, and business hours of various industries managed by the police bureau. Detailed information will be reported to the Inspectorate for verification.

### Strictly Prohibiting Extortion by Fire Department Personnel

The police authorities of this city, in view of recent cases of unscrupulous individuals impersonating the name of the Police Bureau's Fire Department and entering shops and residences to extort money, have issued the following statement to strictly prohibit such activities: [Recently, there have been unscrupulous individuals impersonating personnel of the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau's Fire Department, entering shops and residences without authorization, and extorting money under the pretext of inspecting fire equipment or privately constructed projects (such as mezzanines). This kind of fraudulent behavior not only harasses the general public, but also damages the reputation of this bureau, which is especially abhorrent. The Fire Department of this bureau may dispatch personnel to investigate civilian-installed fire equipment when it deems necessary. As for dangerous situations inside buildings, the Fire Department may also dispatch personnel to investigate after receiving written complaints from citizens and deeming it necessary to pay attention. However, those assigned to this kind of investigation are all officers above the rank of sergeant, all wearing Fire Department uniforms and carrying employee ID cards (with a photo of the individual attached for identification). If these assigned investigation personnel discover substandard fire equipment or dangerous situations, they will report the facts to the Fire Department Director, who will issue a written warning to the homeowner or resident, instructing them to make improvements. Various facilities related to construction (such as mezzanines) fall under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Bureau and are not within the scope of the Fire Department's business. However, if the Fire Department finds a building to be seriously dangerous, it will notify the Public Works Bureau in writing for verification. There is no procedure for directly dispatching personnel to demolish any buildings. The public, being unaware, often misunderstands. In the future, if anyone encounters individuals claiming to be personnel of the Fire Department of this bureau and daring to extort money under false pretenses, the party involved should ask them to produce their employee ID card. If there is no genuine ID card, it is an impersonation and can be reported to the police for detention. If they carry an employee ID card from the Fire Department of this bureau and engage in the aforementioned illegal behavior, do not hesitate to note their name and official position, present the evidence, and report it to the Fire Department Director of this bureau so that appropriate punishment can be given. Furthermore, it has been heard that there are also individuals in this city who impersonate the name of the Fire Department to sell fire extinguishers and other fire protection products. The public, being unaware, often falls for their tricks. The Fire Department never acts as an agent for the sale of fire protection equipment. Even if it is found that something must be installed, the public will be notified in writing to install it according to the law. There is absolutely no procedure for verbally coercing the sale of fire extinguishers. Any citizen who discovers this kind of impersonation of the Fire Department's name to sell fire extinguishers can immediately report it to the Fire Department of this bureau by telephone (telephone number 15183) or report the facts to the nearest police branch bureau for investigation. The director of this bureau sincerely hopes that all citizens will cooperate with this bureau and report any such illegal behavior as much as possible in order to maintain law and order. This is earnestly hoped for.]

### Explosion Occurs on South Huangpi Road Yesterday

Seven Dead, More Than Ten Seriously Injured

According to the announcement from the Crime Prevention Section of the Judicial Department of the Police Bureau: At around 10:00 AM yesterday (the 12th), an unfortunate explosion occurred near South Huangpi Road (Avenue Bellesort) and Daxing Road (Avenue Lafayette) in this city due to an old iron shop mistakenly receiving dangerous explosive materials. Three people were killed on the spot, and more than ten were seriously injured. The details are recorded as follows:

### Iron Shop Mistakenly Receives Giant Naval Mine

At 9:45 AM yesterday, Cao Zhengbao and Xiao Bazi, two Jiangbei people who regularly engage in the buying and selling of used goods, carried a giant iron ball to Yongda Xiang Water and Electricity Used Iron Shop at 522 South Huangpi Road to sell it. The shop owner, Huang Ada, negotiated with them. Because Cao and others asked for too high a price, he offered ten yuan per catty. Cao Zhengbao, seeing that the ball was very large and might have other accessories inside, pried open a small hole from the side and found small black lumps inside. The shop owner suspected it was dynamite and tried to ignite it, but saw no effect. Thereupon, Cao Zhengbao thought the contents were pigment and was greatly excited, willing to open the iron ball and sell it together. So he and Xiao Bazi carried it to the entrance of Tianhe Lane opposite Yongda Xiang and struck the protruding part of the ball with an iron hammer.

### A Loud Noise, Flesh and Blood Flying Everywhere

Unexpectedly, with a loud noise, it suddenly exploded, with flesh and blood flying everywhere and sulfurous smoke filling the air. After hearing the news, the Taishan Branch Bureau, led by Chief Tang of the Judicial Section and Deputy Chief Goukou, dispatched detectives to investigate. Cang Xianerlang, Deputy Director of the Judicial Department of the Police Headquarters, also rushed to the scene with personnel from the Identification Section to conduct an investigation. The result determined that the iron ball was indeed a giant naval mine with extremely violent explosive power. Cao Zhengbao, Xiao Bazi, and a passerby who were killed in the explosion all had their bodies torn apart, a truly tragic sight. The upper half of one of the bodies even flew onto the roof of a nearby three-story building. At the same time, as many as seven or eight people were seriously injured, with blood and flesh scattered all over the ground, almost like a terrifying hell.

### Four More Seriously Injured Die

The 6th Joint Security Self-Defense Corps bravely dispatched rescue stretcher teams to provide emergency aid and called ambulances to send the nine seriously injured to Nanyang and Guangci Hospitals. As of 6:00 PM, four more of the seriously injured had died. It was later determined that when the naval mine exploded, the affected area was more than fifty meters wide, and the explosive force was extremely great. At that time, the wing room at 53 Tianhe Lane happened to be within the explosion force circle, causing the outer wall to be damaged and showing signs of collapse. In addition to investigating the source of the naval mine, the Crime Prevention Section is also warning citizens that they should take this as a lesson. In the future, when picking up or discovering any ownerless dangerous items, weapons, or firearms, they should immediately report it to the nearest police station and must not privately transfer them to prevent the occurrence of such unfortunate incidents that endanger life and public safety.
