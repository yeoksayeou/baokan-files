Burma Northern Front: The Truth of the Battle Situation

Fu Ren

As everyone knows, opening the Burma Road is the greatest demand of the Chongqing regime. The United States has also considered opening this road as the biggest operation and objective in the Southwest Asian theater, and has put in great effort. This inevitable demand of Chongqing and the exertion of American power has led them to carry out extremely unreasonable battles. These include the construction of the Ledo Road in the Hukawng Valley, the airborne landing operations toward Sumprabum and Myitkyina, and the crossing of the Nu River, all of which are reckless military actions that disregard strategic common sense. These adventures seem well-suited to the American taste and also meet the inevitable demands of Chongqing, and therefore their propaganda value is estimated to be high. However, unreasonable battles ultimately have no chance of success. The fate of the Chongqing Allied forces is no different than digging their own graves. The reason lies in their adventurous tactics.

The US-Chongqing Allied forces launched an offensive in a corner of Myitkyina on May 18th. This adventurous battle caused the anti-Axis front to become frenzied. However, the actual battle situation did not match the speed of the propaganda. Due to the stubborn resistance of the Japanese army, progress was slow. On June 2nd, the Southeast Asia Command's announcement also admitted that although they were attacking the city from three sides, they had not occupied even half of it. From May 18th to June 2nd, within fifteen days, why were they unable to completely occupy the not-very-large city of Myitkyina? In the face of the tenacious resistance of a small Japanese force, these fifteen days of precious time allowed the Japanese army to gain enough leeway to reverse the situation in northern Burma. Elite Japanese troops quickly concentrated around Myitkyina and assumed an offensive posture. Meanwhile, Japanese units in the Bhamo area moved directly north in a straight line, directly attacking the rear of the 4,000+ US-Chongqing troops that had invaded Myitkyina, cutting off their route. Another unit took a completely different route, moving south along the Burmese railway from the western area of Myitkyina, annihilating the airborne troops under General Lentaigne who had cut off the railway near Mawlu, allowing the railway to operate unimpeded. Before the rainy season began, this railway had already become the supply line for the large Japanese force near Myitkyina, operating actively. Moreover, the mopping-up units along this railway took advantage of the momentum and achieved another victory. That is, the airborne troops who landed and stirred up trouble in the Indaw area, intending to advance towards the rear of the Japanese forces in the Kamaing-Imphal area, were intercepted by the Japanese army east of Lake Indawgyi, and after a fierce attack, were ultimately completely annihilated.

Using Kamaing as a base, the Japanese army, having established strong positions in the east and west, strictly monitored the main US-Chongqing forces that were building the Ledo Road in the Hukawng Valley and moving south towards the Kamaing area, not allowing them to advance a single step. Another Japanese unit, taking advantage of the stalemate between the two sides, detoured west from the vicinity of Lake Indawgyi and quickly turned north, circling around to the rear of the US-Chongqing forces in the Kamaing area. In the valley area, with a large army blocking the front and the retreat route cut off by the enemy, their fate is self-evident.

As mentioned above, the recent activities of the Japanese army have been extremely active. Skillful tactics have turned the battle situation in northern Burma into a favorable position and have created a strategic posture of defeating the enemy one by one. Moreover, the rainy season has already arrived, and the air supply, on which the US-Chongqing forces solely rely, is becoming difficult. The US-Chongqing forces isolated in Myitkyina are even begging for "the dispatch of reinforcements and the delivery of supplies and ammunition." The US-Chongqing forces, who were intoxicated with the local victories in the past few weeks and made great publicity about it, have had the initiative in the battle situation seized by the Japanese army within a few days, and when they paid attention, they had already discovered that they were trapped in an unmovable encirclement. The result of their unreasonable military actions has created a fate of self-liquidation.

Each tree trunk is connected tightly by barbed wire, each trunk becoming the center of a barbed wire network, so that paratroopers descending from the air will be entangled by the wire. He also saw mines linked to tree trunks everywhere, some hanging high in the treetops, and others placed low on the ground. The comprehensiveness of the defenses is almost like a dragnet.

German Perspective on Abandoning Rome

Berlin, June 6th, Central News Agency Telegram: Reuters reports that Sonneman, Deputy Director of the German Government Information Office, explained the political significance of the German army's withdrawal from Rome to foreign journalists yesterday, which can be regarded as the view of the German government. He said that in order to save Rome from the ravages of war, the German army retreated to the outside of the city, which is greatly beneficial to the Axis forces. Therefore, the German army's withdrawal from Rome is not a military victory for the anti-Axis forces. Although Rome is a supply center for the German army, at the same time, providing food for the people of Rome is also a heavy burden for Germany. In one of the announcements on the day the anti-Axis forces entered Rome, it was stated that the German army had fulfilled the anti-Axis forces' request in order to save Rome from the ravages of war, and claimed that "Germany values culture more than military affairs."

After everyone sang the naval song, the ceremony concluded, and the meeting adjourned after refreshments.

Maeda's Address

Since ancient times, any maritime nation with a robust and strong navy and merchant fleet will have its national prestige spread throughout the seas. The Chinese Navy is still in its founding era, but under the alliance and participation in the war with our country, it is striving to build itself. I dare to say that for the future of East Asia, there is strong confidence.

The navy and the merchant fleet are like two wheels. They cannot exert their full power unless they develop in tandem. Especially during wartime, one can think of the importance of transportation. I believe that the establishment of an organization to train seamen here, and the education of naval training soldiers in the same place, has profound significance. Your responsibilities are very heavy. The responsibility for China's maritime defense and overseas development rests on your shoulders. I hope that whether you are studying or not, you must cultivate and hone yourselves, strive to cultivate the military spirit, and temper the naval soul. Each of you should guard your position and strive for progress, so as to contribute to China.

Leading Figures in Industry and Commerce Host Banquet for Mayor Chen

Over fifty-five leading figures in Shanghai's industry and commerce, including Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Tang Taomin, Dai Kuilu, Wu Zhenxiu, Guo Shun, Ye Fujie, Zhao Jinqing, Ju Zhijun, Xiang Kangyuan, Cai Shengbai, Zhu Boquan, Jiang Shangda, Wang Boyuan, and Pei Yunqing, hosted a banquet at the French Club yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM to express their respect for Mayor Chen, who was recently appointed Chairman of the National Government and has been extremely hardworking. They also invited the heads of various bureaus and departments of the municipal government. During the banquet, Lin Kanghou delivered a speech on behalf of the group, and the Mayor responded, creating a cheerful and enthusiastic atmosphere.

Mayor Chen's Speech

He briefly stated that he was very grateful for the hospitality of the members of the industrial and commercial community towards the colleagues of the municipal government. Recalling the beginning of the National Government's return to the capital, it was not established solely on the will of a few people, nor was it solely negotiating with Japan based on the status of a few people. It was based on an assessment of the objective situation that the formation of a government was necessary to promote overall peace. Knowing that the obstacles to peace cannot be removed overnight, we will spare no effort to do what should be done. This belief has remained firm and unwavering for the past four years, and will continue to be so in the future. However, the work of peace and nation-building cannot be completed by the efforts of the government alone. You are the leaders of the industrial and commercial community, and also the outstanding members of the nation. I sincerely hope that you will work diligently. I firmly believe that if peace in China is achieved, it will guarantee peace in East Asia, and even world peace. The National Government has no other purpose than to promote overall peace. Shanghai is the heart of the country, and Nanjing is the brain. There should be a close connection between the heart and the brain. Moreover, Shanghai is the economic center. If the Shanghai problem can be solved, then more than half of the China problem will be solved. When I took office as the mayor of Shanghai, it was during a time of chaos. I knew my responsibilities were heavy, and I could not shirk them, so I diligently devoted myself to the task. Until now, the difficulties and obstacles have been such that even if I can excuse myself, you can also understand. But I fear that history will not forgive me, so I am even more determined to devote myself to the task. What is gratifying is that the concessions have been recovered, and administration has been unified. Although there are still some problems, in fact, there are no restrictions from treaties. Just as a contract of sale has been canceled, how to be independent and autonomous depends on our own efforts. Whenever I think of this, I deeply hope that the leaders of our industrial and commercial community will cooperate sincerely, so that with united wills we can build a fortress. If we do it, we will surely succeed. If we do not, we will surely fail. I am only using the positions of the National Government and the Municipal Government to express the above beliefs to you, and to thank you for your warm hospitality.

Dr. Sasaki Returns to Shanghai, Expresses Impressions of His Trip to Beijing: Chinese Agriculture Needs Scientific Methods

Japanese agricultural authority Dr. Sasaki, who came to China to serve as a lecturer for the "Wartime Agricultural Technology Lecture Series," has made several speeches and held seminars in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places in recent days, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that he returned to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago. A reporter visited him yesterday and met with the doctor, who shared his impressions of the trip as follows:

"This time, I stayed in Beijing for about a week. In addition to giving two lectures at National Central University and one lecture at the Jianshe Agricultural College, I also held a seminar with agricultural figures in Beijing. In addition to contributing some of my views on China's agricultural problems, I was able to hear valuable insights from all walks of life and exchange ideas. We were all very enthusiastic about discussing issues such as the future development of Chinese agriculture and the promotion of the production increase movement. I have always been very interested in China's agricultural problems. When I worked as a teacher at Peking University in the 28th and 29th years of the Republic of China, I also conducted research on Chinese agricultural problems. I am very happy to be able to come to China again this time and hold a seminar with old friends and others in Beijing. Furthermore, I discussed the issue of agricultural production increase with Minister of Industry Chen Junlian and economic advisor Dr. Nasu for a long time. I deeply feel that China is uniquely endowed by nature and rich in resources. If we can use scientific methods to improve agricultural and animal products as much as possible in the future, the prospects are truly unlimited. Secondly, I visited the Nanjing Central Agricultural Experiment Station farm. On the way back, I visited Mr. Yan Qingxiang's New Suzhou Farm and suburban sheep farms, etc. The impression I got was quite good. China, like Japan, is based on agriculture, and there are many similarities. If we can improve the shortcomings in agriculture and devote ourselves to the production increase movement in the future, not only can China become rich and strong, but it can also cooperate with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War."

Reported at 7 O'Clock Yesterday, Minister Deibuchi Elaborated on the New Guinea and India-Burma War Situation: The Japanese Army is Exerting its True Combat Power

Minister Deibuchi of the Shanghai Japanese Army Reporting Department elaborated on the war situation in New Guinea and India-Burma at a reception for Chinese news reporters on the 6th. The main points are as follows:

When the US military landed on Biak Island in western New Guinea on May 27, Navy Day, US General MacArthur boasted that the operation in New Guinea was in fact over and made exaggerated claims that since the counterattack on Guadalcanal, the Japanese army had been defeated in the southwestern Pacific by about 250,000 troops, rendering them unable to fight again.

Fabricated Propaganda Collapses Without Attack

A week after the landing, the US military stated that they only occupied one corner and claimed that they were still continuing the fierce battle and further consolidating the bridgehead near Doneske, the capital of Biak Island. As a last resort, they recently landed on the small islands of Wai and Wendi south of the island, so the Biak Island campaign launched to end the New Guinea operation. As they said, they have encountered the most tenacious Japanese counterattacks in the past eleven months and have been pursued by a powerful Japanese army with a large number of tanks, retreating into a narrow coastal area. The operations on the mainland of New Guinea, which MacArthur boasted should have ended long ago, have been subjected to a full-scale counterattack by the Japanese army since the Tol River campaign, suffering huge losses. The Japanese army, which they called "unable to fight again," is still as strong as ever. The Japanese army, which was rumored to have exhausted its supplies and was waiting to starve to death, is even more calmly using tanks and modern weapons, forcing them to deal with it with a large amount of bloodshed. All these facts are enough to expose the fabrication of their propaganda and there is no need to argue about it here.

After the landing on Wakde Island and the landing at the mouth of the Tol River, followed by the landing on Biak Island, the enemy is eager to advance westward, but in reality, they have not gained a single victory. Only the enemy's exaggerated propaganda becomes more and more absurd and crazy with this ineffective westward advance. MacArthur's so-called landing operation on Biak Island seems to have been put on the right track and can proceed smoothly, but looking at the above war situation, their westward operation and the exaggerated propaganda they have made for it, in our view, are nothing more than a desire to achieve political effects among the residents of Biak Island and the Dutch East Indies. The purpose is not to achieve direct strategic effects.

Miserable Situation of Enemy Troops in Burma and India

Furthermore, speaking of Burma and India, although the Japanese army inevitably has a difficult war there, the enemy is in a miserable situation. The Chongqing army's crossing of the Nu River was also exposed by us long ago. It was nothing more than a desire to divert the general public's attention from the disastrous defeat in the Central China operation and to show the British and Americans the existence of the Chongqing army in Yunnan Province. It is obviously a propaganda operation, and now it will end in this way. The enemy's intention is nothing more than to achieve results in terms of propaganda. However, in front of the mighty army, they lowered their heads and retreated back across the Nu River and returned to the east. There is nothing surprising about it. As for the battlefields in Manipur, northern Burma, even if the enemy makes exaggerated propaganda, the truth will soon be revealed to the world.

As mentioned above, the Japanese army has continuously achieved great victories in mainland China, forming a vast front. Now it is beginning to exert its true combat power. In particular, the enemy forces in the South Pacific are in contact with our strong inner defense line, causing the enemy to suffer greatly from the power of our army. This can be clearly understood by looking at the counterattack on Torokina Island on Bougainville Island and the effective counterattack in New Guinea. The supply line of our army in the south is definitely not as weak as the enemy has claimed.

As for the existence of some difficulties, it is certainly inevitable. However, these difficulties are minimal. Especially as the enemy approaches our strong inner defense line, their supply line is also lengthened. The advantage of our inner defense operations can be brought into full play, and it can echo the operations in mainland China and India-Burma, forming a major turning point in the war situation. This has become

### National General Mobilization

The Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association convened its third extraordinary general meeting on June 3rd, passing the National General Mobilization proposal. They hope that the entire nation, at this time of increasingly tense war situation, should seize the opportunity as soon as possible, immediately step forward to the front lines of the National General Mobilization, in order to achieve victory as soon as possible. President Abe said that in times of war, even one person's efforts or lack thereof is enough to affect the rise and fall of the country, so all citizens must be used in production, and then can we defeat the enemy in one fell swoop. The Imperial Rule Assistance Association is a civil organization, and the opinion of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association is the opinion of the people, and the resolution of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association is a manifestation of the determination of the people. This resolution will naturally generate the greatest strength.

The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to seek the liberation of the entire Greater East Asia. The sooner victory is achieved, the sooner liberation will be completed. Therefore, all nationals in all countries within Greater East Asia cannot stand idly by, but must earnestly assist. The enthusiasm of assistance and the amount of assistance power are the main factors determining the victory of the Greater East Asia War. We can even say that

In the current situation, from the perspective of the people themselves, they should contribute all their strength to the country. The victory and defeat of the war determines the survival and elimination of the nation and the country, and the early attainment of victory can alleviate the suffering of the war as soon as possible, which is something that most people have already understood. However, victory can never be obtained by luck, especially a war of liberation cannot be successful without the joint struggle of the entire nation. In order to maintain their past vested interests, the enemy must fight us with all their might, and we must naturally strike them with all our might. Now is not the time to be stingy with energy, now is the time to fight desperately, the sooner and more we use our strength now, the longer and greater the peace we will enjoy in the future.

From the government's perspective, it should consider how to utilize the power of the people and concentrate it. If the people are determined to contribute their efforts, the government should give the people the opportunity to contribute their efforts, and even organize these forces into a great crystallized force. This is what is meant by unity between the leadership and the people. Uniting the power of the people is the sole task of the wartime government. If the power of the people cannot be united, the war will certainly not be able to win, and the government will not be able to unite the people.

The nationals of all countries within Greater East Asia must voluntarily and immediately rededicate their entire strength; the governments of all countries within Greater East Asia must sincerely and immediately concentrate all the strength of their people. This is the meaning of the National General Mobilization, and this is the only way to achieve victory.

### Japanese Troops in the Vicinity of Kohima Launch Repeated Surprise Attacks; Crush Enemy's Attempted Breakthrough and Secure Entire Line

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 6th The enemy forces on the Indian front, in order to open up the Kohima-Imphal highway, alleviate the supply difficulties on the front line, and cut off the Japanese supply line, have been launching fierce attacks on the high ground north of Kohima since the end of May, with superior forces and about 4,000 troops. However, after repeated surprise attacks by the Japanese troops in the area, their main force was repelled. In this battle, the enemy abandoned 150 corpses, but a unit of 300 enemy troops still took advantage of the dense fog in the area to advance to the vicinity of the Japanese positions and the Japanese array area, attempting to break through the battle line. The Japanese army is currently continuing its fierce attack. On the other hand, a separate Japanese unit launched a night attack on the enemy forces approaching the Japanese position on the Aragala Heights southwest of Kohima, completely repelling them. Also, in the area of â€‹â€‹Height 7522, 500 enemy troops were about to move, attempting to break through the Japanese position, but the enemy's attempt was thwarted due to the Japanese army's preemptive attack. After abandoning 100 corpses, they fled in disorder. However, the enemy troops are still trying to break through the Japanese position and cut off the Japanese rear supply line, and are currently launching repeated counterattacks, and are continuing to advance guerrilla warfare with aerial supply from the airborne commando. However, the Japanese troops responsible for the security of the supply line have completely crushed the enemy's attempt, and have secured the entire line, and have made complete preparations for the counterattack against the enemy.

Fierce Fighting on the Nu River Front

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 6th After the enemy troops crossed the Nu River, they attempted to seize the Nu River before the rainy season arrived. The elite units of the Japanese army launched a preemptive strike operation to annihilate and strike the enemy troops. The enemy troops are currently actively reorganizing their battle lines. On June 1st, the enemy troops in that area launched a counterattack with aerial supply and reinforcements. The Japanese army counterattacked on all fronts, engaging in combat with the main force of the enemy's Sixth Army everywhere, and fierce battles are being waged for days. Also, the 116th Division of the 53rd Army of the enemy troops once attacked Datangzi, and its 120th Division once attacked the Jiangjujie area. The Japanese army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy troops in the rain. In the Beilengshuigou area, the 1st Division of the 54th Army of the enemy troops once attempted to retake Wadiang Street, but was surrounded by the Japanese army, and has now fled to the east of the Gaoligong Mountains. Also, an enemy company attempted to occupy a river crossing point south of Ren Nuo on the 2nd, but was crushed by the Japanese army. The following is a record of the comprehensive battle results of the Nu River operation from the beginning of May to the end of the month: the enemy troops abandoned more than 3,000 corpses, 82 people were captured, and the Japanese army captured 16 mortars, 75 light and heavy machine guns, 412 rifles, and many other clothing materials and ammunition.

### Fortification of Defenses in the Northern Kuril Islands Area; Japanese Submarines Active in the Pacific

Central News Agency, Tokyo The enemy, the United States, is eyeing the closest strategic point for a counter-offensive route against the Japanese mainland, so the fortification of the Northern Kuril Islands is valued not only by Japan but also by the enemy, the United States. A certain staff officer of the Japanese army in the area spoke on this matter as follows: The Northern Kuril Islands, the first line of defense for the protection of the imperial country, has now become a fortress. Rabaul on the southern front has been strongly defended thanks to the tireless efforts of the Japanese army, and we are determined to defend the northern first line. We believe that once the enemy, the United States, which is trying to destroy the divine land, invades this place, they will be annihilated.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th The war results of Japanese submarines in the Pacific have been praised by the world. What cannot be achieved by surface warships and air force squadrons can be accomplished by submarines without failing their mission. As the Pacific war situation is now becoming more intense, the activity of Japanese submarines is unprecedented. Although the enemy has made exaggerated statements such as landing operations in the Philippines, air raids on the Japanese mainland, and cutting off the connection between Japan and the South, the enemy's ambitions will be shattered in an instant with just a slight activity of Japanese submarines. Under the activity of Japanese submarines, the enemy's supply route has become fragile. Recently, Nimitz stated that if the Japanese battle line is shortened, the threat that Japanese submarines pose to us will be even greater. From this, the fear felt by the enemy, the United States, towards the threat of Japanese submarines can be imagined. Currently, the enemy's defense islands in the Pacific and the US mainland are all within the range of Japanese submarines' activity. Using stealth to attack the enemy is the characteristic of submarines. During submerged navigation, enemy special aircraft carriers are especially the best targets for attack. The active tasks of submarines are to attack battleships, destroy supply routes, implement surprise operations, and reconnaissance patrol lines, and can pose a great threat to the enemy at any time and anywhere.
