### Adapting to the Current War Situation: Japan Strengthens its Domestic Structure; the Greater East Asia Decisive Battle Formation is as Solid as a Rock

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – In order to adapt to the current war situation and to seek special strengthening of the domestic structure, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo resolutely reorganized part of the cabinet on the 19th. This reorganization is a fundamental measure taken after the cabinet reorganization on April 20th of last year. As this time personnel changes are made to the three most important departments of finance, transportation, and food, it can truly adjust the cabinet’s political power and has been further strengthened. At the same time, a leap in the enhancement of war power can also be expected to be achieved. Therefore, Japan's wartime financial, transportation, and food policies are as solid as a rock, and it is truly worth looking forward to the strengthening and operation of Japan's decisive battle politics. The reason why Mr. Ishiwata was appointed as the Minister of Finance, the center of this Japanese cabinet reshuffle, is because, as the highest economic advisor to the National Government, he made great contributions to the connection between Chinese and Japanese finance and economy, and to the construction of Chinese finance and economy. Moreover, he demonstrated outstanding skills as the Minister of Finance in the Hiranuma Cabinet. His appointment as the Minister of Finance for war will surely enable him to exert his skills and complete decisive battle finance. The reason why Mr. Uchida was appointed as the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce is because the Japanese government, in view of the rapid implementation of food countermeasures under the current situation, regarded it as the most important task. As the former chairman of the Northeast Local Council, he demonstrated practical skills in dealing with the food problem, so he was appointed as the new minister this time. In addition, the new Minister of Transportation and Communications, Mr. Goshima, is a giant in the transportation and communication industry and also has outstanding administrative insights. At the same time, he also demonstrated his practical experience in inspecting wooden ships and handled it extremely satisfactorily. Therefore, this time he was appointed as the Minister of Transportation from within the cabinet.

### The Ministers of Finance and Transportation Explain their Aspirations and Promote Financial and Transportation Countermeasures

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Japan's new Finance Minister Ishiwata received a group of reporters at the official residence of the Deputy Minister of Finance at 5:30 p.m. on the 20th. In response to questions from the reporters, he explained his aspirations for the operation of decisive battle finance and finance. The record of his Q&A is as follows: Question: What are the strategies for the operation of decisive battle finance? Answer: There have been no worries about financial problems since the Sino-Japanese Incident until today. I deeply believe that the financial foundation is extremely solid. Question: What should be noted when implementing the 51 billion-yen budget? Answer: The formation of the budget is very good in terms of wartime financial conditions. The most important thing for implementing a huge budget and digesting public bonds is to increase savings. Question: How to complete the 36 billion-yen savings plan? Answer: I firmly believe that every citizen will be able to complete it with their patriotic savings. Question: What is the focus of the inflation countermeasures? Answer: I believe that if public prices can be digested smoothly, there is very little risk of inflation. Therefore, we should first increase savings and absorb the remaining purchasing power with increased taxes from time to time. The policies adopted by the government in the past have achieved great results. Question: What is the financial policy for Greater East Asia? Answer: I am quite familiar with the financial situation in Greater East Asia, so I am determined to support the financial aspirations and management of each country and ethnic group in Greater East Asia.

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Japan's Minister of Transportation, Mr. Goshima, recently issued a statement on the policy of strengthening transportation capacity during the decisive battle period, as follows: The organizational structure of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications has been prepared. Although I have opinions, it will generally maintain the status quo and strengthen its strength. Strengthening maritime transportation capacity will be promoted with the greatest emphasis. The initial step is to greatly increase the manufacture of wooden ships, so that they can be used as much as possible in coastal transportation, while steel ships will be used to meet the needs of transportation to the South. In addition, repairing wooden ships is also extremely important. I want to make one-third of the wooden shipyards in the country as specialized repair factories. The strengthening and control of port and warehouse industries has been actively handled by the former Minister of Transportation, Mr. Hatta, so it is planned to be realized quickly in the future.

### Brief Biographies of the Three Ministers

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese cabinet was partially reorganized on the 19th. Mr. Shotaro Ishiwata, Mr. Shinya Uchida, and Mr. Keita Goshima were newly appointed as Ministers of Finance, Agriculture and Commerce, and Transportation and Communications, respectively. The following is an introduction to the brief biographies of the three gentlemen: New Finance Minister

Shotaro Ishiwata

He served as the Minister of Finance in the Hiranuma Cabinet in January of the 14th year of Showa (1939). This is his second time serving as the Minister of Finance. In addition to serving as the Minister of Finance in the Hiranuma Cabinet, he also served as the Chief Secretary of the Yonai Cabinet, a member of the House of Peers, the Secretary-General of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, and the Chairman of the East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference. Afterwards, from November of the 17th year of Showa, he succeeded the current Minister of Greater East Asia, Mr. Aoki, as the highest economic advisor to the National Government until now. He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University in the 5th year of Taisho (1916) and is the eldest son of the late Privy Councilor Mr. Toshiichi Ishiwata. After graduating from the University of Tokyo, he immediately took a position in the Ministry of Finance. He entered the cabinet when the Hiranuma Cabinet was formed, and has been active in the political and financial circles ever since. His personality is amazing and admirable. He, Mr. Aoki, the Minister of Greater East Asia, and Mr. Kaya, the former Minister of Finance, are known as the three heroes from the Ministry of Finance. New Minister of Agriculture and Commerce

Shinya Uchida

He was born in Aichi Prefecture and graduated from Tokyo Higher Commercial School in the 38th year of Meiji (1905). He worked at Mitsubishi Corporation. After the outbreak of World War I, he resigned from the company and engaged in the shipping industry. Later, he entered the political world. After being elected in the 13th year of Taisho (1924), he joined the Seiyukai and gradually gained a position in the political world. In the 3rd year of Showa (1928), he served as the Parliamentary Vice-Minister of the Navy in the Tanaka Cabinet, under the Minister of the Navy, Mr. Okada. In the 7th year of Showa, he served as the Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Communications in the Inukai Cabinet. In the 9th year of Showa, he left the Seiyukai and took office as the Minister of Railways. During the National Railway Scandal that occurred in the 11th year of Showa, he was suspected of taking bribes and was prosecuted. After several difficulties, he was acquitted in the second trial in the 15th year. After experiencing hardships, he was even more valued. When the situation became critical in July of last year, the Japanese government established local councils to strengthen local administration. At that time, he was appointed as the governor of Miyagi Prefecture and made many contributions to the decisive battle administration in the six prefectures of Tohoku. He is known for his open-mindedness, shrewdness, and determination. At this time of tension, his appointment as the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce has raised expectations for his skills and strength.

Keita Goshima

His appointment as the second Minister of Transportation and Communications in Japan was expected when he served as the inspector of wooden ships last year. Judging from his experience, taking the position of Minister of Transportation and Communications is truly appropriate for his position. When the new Minister Goshima was working in the financial world, he demonstrated his talent in controlling private railways and controlled most of the private railways in the vicinity of Tokyo. Because of his execution and decisiveness, he was able to shoulder the important task of transportation administration under the decisive battle. The new minister came from the Japanese Railway Ministry, so it is expected that he will promote the consolidation of land transportation and the solution of small transportation problems. In particular, he has recently promoted the emergency production of wooden ships with the qualifications of inspecting wooden ships. Moreover, he has been in the business world for many years and understands everything, so he will definitely be able to resolve the maritime transportation network affairs such as warehouse control and port control that have not yet been resolved.

### Commending Scientific and Technological Personnel

"The Japanese Institute of Technology, in view of the fact that various scientific and technological personnel have reformed and researched various scientific and technological fields, and have made great contributions to enhancing the country's war power, in order to express the country's gratitude and commendation and encourage them... held a commendation ceremony at the Peer's Club here at 11:00 a.m. on the 11th of this month. The President of the Institute of Technology awarded medals and a cash prize of 10,000 yuan. ...This time, a total of 27 items were awarded medals, all of which are the highest achievements in the Japanese scientific and technological community. ... (See the Central News Agency's Tokyo dispatch on the 11th of this month in this newspaper on the 12th of this month)." From this, it can be seen:

The importance of scientific and technological personnel in enhancing national war power. Modern total war is originally a contest of national strength, and it is absolutely impossible for frontline soldiers to bear the responsibility alone. As for the sum of national strength, it can only be increased by scientific means, because only science and technology can save time and economy, and can use natural products to make necessary materials. Therefore, the size of national strength is not entirely based on the number of people in the nation, but on the level of its scientific and technological development.

The state should promote and encourage the work of scientific and technological personnel. The work of science and technology is mostly difficult and boring. It cannot be competent and effective without considerable intelligence and perseverance. Therefore, scientific and technological personnel who have outstanding achievements are indeed the most outstanding members of the nation and should be commended. Their special contributions to benefiting the country and the people should be fully recognized to encourage future generations.

The greatness of Japan's scientific and technological achievements during the war. War methods are most obvious on the battlefield, and war emotions are most tense on the frontline. However, if everything in the rear cannot cooperate with the battlefield frontline, there is no way to win the final victory. The proposals reviewed by the Japanese Institute of Technology this time were recommended by relevant agencies and affiliated organizations, totaling more than 700 items. Among them, 71 items were commended. On the one hand, it can be seen that Japan is prudent in its reputation, and at the same time, it can be inferred that since these 70 items are the highest achievements, the general contribution of the scientific and technological community must be ten or a hundred times greater than this. In 1942, Germany registered more than 50,000 patents (see the editorial in this newspaper on January 14). The efforts of the rear in Japan and Germany in science and technology are mutually illuminating.

Looking back at our country, since opening up to the sea and contacting various countries, we have always felt the importance of science, and we have always known how to learn from our eastern and western neighbors to make up for our shortcomings. However, what has been the effect after a hundred years? Not only is there no foundation for heavy industry, so national defense needs to be supplied by others, but also the equipment for clothing, food, housing, and transportation is nothing but imported goods, which is both pitiful and shameful. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, especially since participating in the Greater East Asia War, people with lofty ideals have deeply realized that the level of domestic science is childish, and that there is no way to survive without catching up quickly. However, the general trend of the upper and lower classes of the government and the public has no expression of burying their heads in hard work. As for speculation, hoarding, seeking personal gain, and engaging in corruption, they all do their best to exploit and plunder. Those who compete in science and diligently pursue technology are not only regarded as poor and ignorant, and are despised by others, but also lack clothing and food, and only cry out in vain. How can we talk about commendation and encouragement? I hope that from now on, our country will learn from Japan's example of commending scientific and technological personnel, be aware of the warning, and thoroughly reform the past. It is not too late to make amends. Let's get up and make plans!

### Vice President Zhou Visits Xuzhou to Inspect and Preside over the Opening Ceremony of the Central Reserve Bank Branch

Xuzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) – Zhou Fohai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, Minister of Finance, and President of the Central Reserve Bank, came to Xuzhou by plane on the 19th with Deputy President, Consultant Kimura, and a group of entourages to preside over the opening ceremony of the Xuzhou Branch of the Central Reserve Bank and to inspect the political and economic situation of Huaihai Province. Hao, the Governor of Huaihai Province, and Yuezhi, the Minister of Liaison, led military and political officials to the airport to welcome them. After Vice President Zhou got off the plane, he exchanged polite greetings with Governor Hao and Minister of Liaison, and then took cars to the official residence for lunch. At 3:00 p.m., representatives were sent to the Allied Japanese Army Headquarters, the Army Hospital, the Consulate General, the Liaison Department Military Police, and the Japanese Residents Group for visits. At 4:00 p.m., Vice President Zhou visited the Provincial Government, and Governor Hao greeted him to the VIP room. At 5:00 p.m., the leaders of various financial institutions in the city, led by Director Sun of the Finance Department, paid their respects. Vice President Zhou immediately received them and gave many instructions on the issue of expanding the circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes in Huaihai Province and the future development of economy and finance. At 5:30 p.m., he received Ma Shuying, the manager of the Central Reserve Bank branch, Shen Dingxin, the director of the Xuzhou Salt Administration Office, and Ge Zhigan, the director of the Income Tax Bureau, to listen to reports on the economic situation of the province. At 6:00 p.m., he attended the welcome speech meeting of the youth groups and primary and secondary school students in the Xuzhou Public Hall. That night, he attended a banquet hosted by Governor Hao.

### Central Reserve Bank Branch Holds Opening Ceremony

Xuzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) – Since the Central Reserve Bank Xuzhou Branch began preparations, it has been publicly constructing the site, which has now been completed. The interior layout has also been completed. This morning (20th) at 10:00 a.m., a grand opening ceremony was held. President Zhou, Deputy President Qian, Consultant Honmura, etc., all came to Xuzhou yesterday to preside over the ceremony. Those who were invited to observe the ceremony included Governor Hao of Huaihai Province and the heads of various departments and bureaus, the Mayor of Xuzhou, and the Allied side, including Minister of Liaison Yuezhi, Acting Consul General Murakami stationed in Xuzhou, and leaders of the Chinese and Japanese financial and business circles in the city, totaling about 200 people. The ceremony began at 10:00 a.m., starting with

### President Zhou's Speech

Briefly stated: Today is the opening of the Xuzhou Branch of the Central Reserve Bank. I feel very honored that so many people from the Provincial Government and the Allied side have come. In the past, the circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes in Huaihai Province has been greatly assisted by the cooperation of Chinese and Japanese officials and people in Xuzhou. I am very grateful. Since the issuance of Central Reserve Bank notes, their credit has been solid and their circulation has been increasingly widespread. They have become the only currency in Central and Southern China. The Huaihai area used the Joint Reserve Bank notes, so the Central Reserve Bank notes only began to flow in on December 1 last year. In the past, the politics and economy of the Huaihai area were unable to be unified due to this relationship, resulting in many inconveniences. The establishment of the Central Reserve Bank Xuzhou Branch this time will eliminate this contradictory phenomenon. The expansion and circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes in Huaihai Province is not only of great significance in the economic aspect. Since China's participation in the war, it has been striving to enrich its national strength and supply the important materials needed for the war. In the past, because of the inconsistency of politics and economy, the exchange of materials between North and Central China was not smooth, and the economic policies of Central China could not be implemented uniformly. After the widespread circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes in Huaihai Province, it is believed that the exchange of materials between North and Central China will definitely be smooth in the future, and the contribution to China's construction and the Greater East Asia War will definitely increase. Therefore, the significance of the opening of the Central Reserve Bank Xuzhou Branch today is significant. President Qian and I, along with the heads of various departments and bureaus and Consultant Kimura, etc., came to preside over this opening ceremony in person, which has never happened in the opening of other branches, which is enough to show the importance of the mission undertaken by the Xuzhou Branch. The Central Reserve Bank Xuzhou Branch has now become the financial center in the Xuzhou area. It will provide as much funds as possible for increasing production and purchasing materials, and will never provide funds for speculative hoarding. Based on past experience, whenever the currency changes, unscrupulous merchants take the opportunity to raise prices. The central government has paid close attention to this and hopes that the provincial government will strictly prevent it. At the same time, during the war, it is extremely important to conserve consumption and encourage savings. We also hope that the Chinese and Japanese officials will understand this and provide more assistance. After President Zhou's speech, the guests were invited to speak. Governor Hao was the first to speak, briefly stating: "It is a great honor to participate in the opening ceremony of the Xuzhou Branch of the Central Reserve Bank today. The provincial government will definitely assist with all its strength to ensure the smooth development of the circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes." Then, Acting Consul General Murakami of the Allied side gave a speech, expressing his strong agreement with President Zhou's point on political and economic unification. Finally, Manager Ma of the Central Reserve Bank Xuzhou Branch gave a reply. Immediately afterwards, tea and refreshments were served to the guests. The grand ceremony was completed.

### Finance Minister Zhou Delivers a Speech

Xuzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) – After Vice President Zhou attended the welcome speech meeting of the youth groups and primary and secondary school students in Huaihai Province and Xuzhou City, he returned to the Provincial Government VIP room with Governor Hao. At 6:30 p.m., he met with Japanese reporters and stated in his speech that he had inspected everywhere last spring. This time when he came to Xuzhou, he felt that the situation in Huaihai Province today was more progressive than before, especially the cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese sides in Xuzhou. It felt very harmonious. Since the establishment of the Su-Huai Special Zone, although the political aspect has been directly under the central government, the economic aspect has belonged to the north, and the currency has been the Joint Reserve Bank notes, which is usually unnatural. Therefore, two years ago, I planned to make the political economy of Su-Huai consistent. When the National Government participated in the war, I discussed this matter with the National Government Economic Advisor Aoki. Mr. Aoki also came to Xuzhou for inspection and expressed his agreement with my opinion. Afterwards, Mr. Aoki was able to realize it after he became the Minister of Greater East Asia. After March 1, the Joint Reserve Bank stopped issuing notes. The relationship with the Joint Reserve Bank remained the same as before, and the price remained unchanged at 100 to 18. However, every time the currency changes, merchants often take the opportunity to raise prices. The government has taken considerable measures on this, and at the same time hopes that everyone will further persuade. After the establishment of the Central Reserve Bank Xuzhou Branch, the Xuzhou financial center authority will be the Central Reserve Bank branch. All the funds needed will also be supplied by the Central Reserve Bank. The goal of the Central Reserve Bank's supply is to increase production and circulate legitimate businesses of goods, and speculation and hoarding, etc., are naturally not included in the supply.

### Stabilizing the Livelihood of the Chinese People and Strengthening the Policy of Food Self-Sufficiency

In order to win the Greater East Asia War, the people of China and Japan must understand the value of the war of liberation of the Asian people. The so-called "sharing joys and sorrows" should not just be a cliché. It must be realistically embodied in the political, economic, and cultural relations between the two countries. Therefore, the people of both countries are deeply concerned about the changes in Sino-Japanese relations. What is the impact of the new policy toward China in January last year, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty at the end of October, and the Greater East Asia Declaration, etc., on the Chinese people? The Japanese people are eager for the government to explain. In this session of the Diet, Vice-Minister Yamamoto of the Greater East Asia, at the meeting of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, talked about the impact of the Japanese government's policy toward China. The explanation is as follows:

Impact on the people

Since the implementation of the new policy toward the military in January last year, the Japanese side has been implementing the return of concessions one by one and abolishing the constraints of extraterritorial rights. As a result, the general public has gradually understood the position of the Japanese side's guidance. However, in wartime, the stability of living is threatened and restricted to a considerable extent. The Japanese military has also been promoting the idea that "Japan's new policy is all talk and no action." Especially with regard to the issue of livelihood, the general public initially misunderstood Japan's true intentions, so they did not feel a direct impact. However, Japan is not only in the treaty, but also implements it one by one, so its intentions seem to be understood. Recently, the atmosphere of trusting Japan's sincerity has become more and more common among the general public. At the end of October last year, the Sino-Japanese alliance was signed, fundamentally regulating the relationship between China and Japan. The Greater East Asia Declaration not only clarified Japan's true intentions to the countries of Greater East Asia, but also to the world. Therefore, after this, the impact on the general public has been quite good. Generally speaking, the current situation is that the strength to comply with Japan's intentions is very strong, and there is a tendency to cooperate with Japan.

Impact on Japanese residents

There are currently about 650,000 Japanese residents. Japan's policy toward China has been promoted and developed in the past with extraterritoriality, concessions, or military force as the background. Therefore, the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions initially had a considerable impact. Among the Japanese residents, there were those who criticized the new policy. However, the general Japanese residents seem to gradually understand Japan's new policy toward China. Therefore, for the sake of true Sino-Japanese cooperation and the rise of East Asia, we should cooperate and respect each other with openness and honesty. This is fundamentally necessary for the construction of Greater East Asia and the victory in the Greater East Asia War.

Food problem

From the perspective of stabilizing people's livelihood, maintaining law and order, enhancing war power, and developing resources, the food problem must be solved first. In the past, considerable amounts of food were imported from foreign countries, but today, with production declining, people's hearts cannot be grasped if the supply of food is not smooth. In the current situation, various production increase plans are being implemented in the food sector to achieve self-sufficiency. For example, in North China, we are implementing agricultural water conservancy facilities, popularizing improved varieties, improving farming methods, preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, training technicians, supplying fertilizers and seeds, opening canals, and carrying out large-scale earthwork projects to strive to increase food production. The National Government has recently hired Dr. Nasu from Japan to conduct research on various practical issues.

Price problem

After the outbreak of the war, due to the lack of materials, the cessation of imports, and the impact of other world wartime economies, prices rose sharply. Compared with the end of 1941, North China was about three times three times or five times higher, and Central China was about five times eight times or ten times higher. The rise in prices has various impacts on people's livelihood. The National Government is devoting its full efforts to curbing the rise in prices and striving to establish fair prices. Currently, the National Government is generally working on measures such as increasing production, thoroughly purchasing food, strengthening control, and facilitating transportation. Last year, it also implemented the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth as exchange materials and supplied them to various places to smooth the exchange of materials between local areas and cities. This is the key to solving the price problem. To this end, Japan is also devoting its full efforts to cooperate together. In this sense, high prices have a considerable impact on the people and the general knowledgeable classes, so we should take all possible measures. (Excerpt from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, February 4)

### Fierce Battle in the Mayu Eastern Basin; British 7th Division Surrounded

Rangoon, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from the front-line base in Myanmar: The Japanese army is currently encircling and annihilating the British 7th Division in the Sinzewa Basin east of the Mayu Mountains. Since the 12th, it has been achieving results from time to time. It has been fighting fiercely with the enemy's full force units attempting to escape for a week. The battle is currently continuing. The British army has been attacked by the elite Japanese army. The British army has been using aircraft to transport materials from the sky, but it has not been able to proceed satisfactorily. Therefore, the British army is now exhausted of food and ammunition, and its morale is low. It is driving hundreds of tanks and Indian soldiers to the front line, while the British army is supervising from behind, making the Indian soldiers sacrifice, causing the Indian soldiers to be extremely angry and have a great tendency to join the Indian National Army to resist the British army.

### Japanese Planes Bomb Nanning

Hankou, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch on the 10th from a certain Japanese army base in southern China, Japanese naval air units bombed the enemy airfield at Nanning on the morning of the 14th, and engaged in aerial combat with the enemy aircraft. As a result, two of their P-40 type aircraft were shot down, and the facilities at the airfield also suffered losses. One Japanese plane did not return.

### German and British Air Forces Bomb Each Other

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German air force carried out its fifth major air raid on London at dawn on the 19th.

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Huitong News Agency report: British planes attacked Berlin last night, and German air defense forces shot down fifty-six enemy four-engine aircraft.

### Turkish Military Expenditure Increases Sharply

Ankara, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Turkish government has submitted its budget proposal for the new fiscal year to the parliament, which will be debated when the parliament reconvenes on March 6th after the recess. The new budget totals 1,100,000,000 Turkish pounds, breaking all previous records. More than half of this is for national defense expenditure, and this item alone has increased by 30 percent compared to last year's budget. This shows the Turkish government's determination to maintain armed neutrality.

In the second round of the Shanghai League A football match, Donghua defeated the Portuguese Merchants again at Yiyuan yesterday morning. The stands were full of spectators. Donghua defeated the Portuguese Merchants 3-0 again. No goals were scored in the first half. Ah Dai was injured and only watched from the sidelines. Han Longhai took over as center forward, and Wang Xisheng played as right winger. After 20 minutes, Li Ning was injured and left the field. Zhang Linggen was moved inside, Wang filled Zhang's vacancy, and Chen Mingzhe was moved in to play as right winger. Under such a changed lineup, Donghua was still able to exert its power, which was not easy. Han Longhai's bravery was especially praised by the audience throughout the field. Nineteen minutes after the start of the game, Youliang penetrated the penalty area, and Han Longhai descended from the sky, kicking hard and hitting the center of the goal, scoring the first goal. Not long after, Li Ning was injured and Chen Mingzhe was brought in. Donghua's offense remained undiminished. Thirty minutes into the game, Longhai dribbled past three defenders, straight to the Portuguese goal, and gently passed to Chen Mingzhe, who calmly shot into the net in front of the goal. The cheers from the audience were like thunder (3-0). At the end of the first half, Donghua won 3-0.

### Last Week's Industrial, Commercial, and Financial Market Situation: The Trend of Hoarding Still Prevails

The financial and industrial and commercial situation in Shanghai last week was still hovering in stability. The private trading of Chichi public bonds has gradually disappeared after the strict crackdown by the municipal authorities. With the tightening of money supply, speculative funds are not easy to flow. The stock market was stable, and the downward trend was rare. However, merchants with ample funds, because speculative activities in the financial sector are subject to crackdown by the authorities, have turned to the attempt to acquire goods. Most of them are engaged in purchasing and hoarding daily necessities, so the price increase of goods is becoming more and more intense. Wealthy citizens, especially speculators in the financial and industrial circles, are all hoarding goods. The authorities attach great importance to this behavior and are conducting a thorough investigation. Therefore, the price increase trend continued unabated last week, until Friday and Saturday when the price increase slowed down slightly.

### Banks and Money Exchanges Stipulate Loan Principles

Overdraft facilities will not be granted to customers.  Acceptance of new mortgage loans will be temporarily suspended.  Applications for mortgage loans and loans will not be accepted if they are not for legitimate business purposes, even if the businesses are creditworthy.
