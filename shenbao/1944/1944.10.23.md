### Currency, Prices, and Control Issues

Mr. Taro Yuki, advisor to the Japanese Cabinet, the Greater East Asia Ministry, the Ministry of Finance, and the Bank of Japan, has come to China specifically to investigate the Chinese economy. Our newspaper published an open letter to Advisor Yuki on the 21st. Now, we would like to offer some specific opinions on economic issues to Advisor Yuki, which may serve as a reference for his investigation of the Chinese economy. Advisor Yuki is a leading figure in the Japanese financial and economic circles, with decades of service in the Japanese financial sector, holding an important position. Although he has resigned as the Governor of the Bank of Japan, he participates in the planning of decisive financial and economic strategies in his capacity as an advisor to the Cabinet and the Greater East Asia Ministry and the Ministry of Finance. We naturally extend a warm welcome to such an important figure coming to China for investigation. Moreover, at a time when we are facing significant difficulties in our economy, finance, and financial affairs, our expectations for Advisor Yuki are very high. From Advisor Yuki's several remarks, although brief, we can see his sincere concern for the Chinese economy. Therefore, we would like to briefly present the following three points to Advisor Yuki: Firstly, because Advisor Yuki has special experience in handling the most important currency issues in financial matters. Advisor Yuki's management has greatly contributed to maintaining the relative stability of the Japanese currency. The issue of the Chinese currency, which has an expansionary trend and is not easy to contract, is a part of the problem of winning the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, we hope that Advisor Yuki can plan an appropriate countermeasure. Whether the Chinese currency is inflated has been a subject of discussion among various parties, but due to the special needs during the war, there is a sense of expansion. At the same time, due to the instability of the political situation, the psychology of valuing goods over money has become a widespread phenomenon. As a result, prices are rising, affecting the normal progress of national finance, people's lives, and all economic matters. The impact is not insignificant. If it is allowed to continue, the danger is significant. Therefore, we ask Advisor Yuki to assist in stabilizing the Chinese currency. On the 7th, when Advisor Yuki answered questions from reporters in Shanghai, he said: "The so-called currency inflation is due to the need for currency." However, we feel that abnormal needs must be tightened and restricted. Otherwise, if prices rise, the need for chips is great, and currency is issued indefinitely to meet this need, leading to further price increases, and if this cycle continues, there will eventually be an unimaginable day. Secondly, the issue of prices has now become the core of various economic problems, and even a part of political problems. Advisor Yuki said in a speech on the 17th: "The first problem in Shanghai now is the price issue." Advisor Yuki believes that "a certain degree of price increase during wartime is inevitable. If speculation and hoarding, and other behaviors that disrupt the economy can be suppressed, the increase may not cause the people to feel great pain." We do not want to ignore the harm of speculation and hoarding. However, speculation and hoarding are parasitic. If there are not too few goods and too much currency, and if the political institutions are not sound enough, we believe that speculation and hoarding cannot stand. Therefore, while cracking down on speculation and hoarding, we must fundamentally find ways to increase production to enrich goods, contract currency to relatively suppress prices, and improve political institutions to facilitate the implementation of economic facilities. There are many areas where Japan needs to assist in these matters. Among them, increasing production is particularly important, and ensuring resources, cultivating labor, facilitating transportation, and improving public security are the basic conditions for increasing or maintaining production. Thirdly, regarding the issue of economic control, it goes without saying that control is necessary during wartime. However, the implementation of control must be reasonable and appropriate. This is an old saying, but there are many areas in China's current economic control that need to be improved. Not only do the actual environments between countries differ, but sometimes the actual environments between regions also vary. If what is done in A is forcibly applied to B, it may be difficult to avoid the bad result of failing to imitate a tiger. Advisor Yuki also said in a speech on the 17th: "Control has its limits and cannot be implemented in any situation. It must be determined according to national conditions and the times." Therefore, control measures that are not suitable for national conditions, the times, and the environment, and that excessively affect people's lives, must be thoroughly improved. Also, the current Chinese economic control, like politics, tends to be divided, which is a major shortcoming. Multi-headed control often results in mutual restraint and even mutual strife, which greatly affects the implementation of sound control policies. Therefore, we ask Advisor Yuki to make special efforts to help make control measures reasonable and appropriate, and to simplify the control mechanism. We have discussed the most important issues in China's current economy, currency issues, price issues, and control issues as above. We hope that after Advisor Yuki returns to his country, he will convey the aforementioned points to the relevant Japanese authorities and people from all walks of life and pay attention to them. ○Tokyo 22nd Central News Agency report: The Japanese Military Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on October 21st: On the 19th and 20th, the Japanese Air Force attacked enemy convoys and landing troops attempting to invade Leyte Gulf, achieving the following results: sinking one large enemy transport ship and one destroyer, and damaging one enemy transport ship, two aircraft carriers, and two battleships. ○Tokyo 22nd Central News Agency report: According to a report from the Southwest Pacific base, twenty enemy B-24 aircraft came to Davao City, Mindanao, during the day. They were intercepted by the Japanese army in the area, and a total of six aircraft were shot down. ○Lisbon, 22nd Central News Agency report: According to the Associated Press: Four American landing craft and several small boats used for the Leyte Island landing have been sunk by Japanese coastal artillery and mortar fire. It is also reported that the landing force under Krueger encountered strong resistance from the Japanese army, and the Japanese army's resistance has become stronger. British ships in the Indian Ocean suffered three air raids in Yangon. ○Lisbon 22nd Central News Agency report: According to a report, the Southeast Asia Military Command announced on the 22nd that the East Asia Fleet (including a dozen battleships and aircraft carriers) had launched operations in Nicobar City this week, attacking the islands. ○Japanese military base on the Myanmar front, 22nd Central News Agency report: On the 20th, 68 enemy P47, P51, and P38 fighter planes attacked the Yangon area for the third time. The Japanese fighter squadron and ground forces intercepted them, launching a fierce air battle, shooting down four P38 aircraft (two of which were unconfirmed) and destroying four P51 and P47 aircraft, and inflicting considerable damage on many other aircraft, driving them back. In this battle, one Japanese aircraft self-destructed, and the ground suffered very little damage.

### The One Billion People of Greater East Asia Should Rise Up and Cooperate in the War

○Central News Agency, Beijing: After the news of the enemy American forces landing on Leyte Island in the Philippines was released, all circles here expressed deep concern. They paid particular attention to the future development of the war situation in that area. Since the enemy's operation to recapture the Philippines has begun here, it is expected that they will make a desperate effort to fight. It is believed that the Japanese army in the Philippines has already made strong defenses and will be able to strike the enemy and inflict heavy damage. However, looking at the overall war situation in the Pacific, its significance and situation cannot be denied. Therefore, as far as China is concerned, at this critical moment in the war situation, all Chinese people should strengthen their efforts and enhance the system of cooperation in the war. The independence and freedom of China must be premised on the completion of the liberation of East Asia. If East Asia is still controlled by Britain and the United States, then not only will East Asia never be liberated, but even the restoration and prosperity of a country will be completely hopeless. Therefore, we can truly say that we have reached a critical juncture of survival and destruction. In order to seek the survival and independence of China, and to seek the freedom and liberation of East Asia, we must immediately devote all our national strength to closely cooperate with the countries and nationalities of East Asia, and with the determination to win, rise up and destroy Britain and the United States. Today, the battle of Leyte Island is by no means just a matter for Japan and the Philippines. It is a life-and-death battle for the one billion people of East Asia. Therefore, in addition to inflicting heavy blows on the enemy and crushing their counter-attack attempts, there is no other time to danger. All those who truly love our Chinese motherland will be able to strengthen their efforts with the righteousness of shared hatred and unwavering determination, and contribute all their strength to the country and the nation, to destroy the enemy and ensure the permanent independence and freedom of our country, thereby contributing to the prosperity of East Asia. The future of China will be determined here. We, the Chinese people, should make redoubled efforts to maintain the glory of 5,000 years of history, so that we can be permanently in the world. Ambassador Aizawa expressed his thoughts ○Saigon, 22nd Central News Agency report: After Foreign Vice Minister Matsudaira succeeded him as the Japanese ambassador to Vietnam, former Ambassador Aizawa hosted reporters at his official residence on the evening of the 21st, recalling his three years in Vietnam. He said that the embassy in Hanoi has been established for three years. When he took office, the Greater East Asia War broke out, and the area became an important base for operations and a supply base, occupying an important position militarily. Although he is not very talented, he believes that he has not made any major mistakes. The embassy's affairs are on track, and he can leave with peace of mind. He has had various discussions with Governor-General Decoux in Hanoi and Saigon, and everything is very satisfactory.

Three Points to Note for the Japanese National Movement

The Views of President Chu Fang ○Tokyo 22nd Central News Agency report: Mr. Chu Fang, Director of the Japanese Information Bureau and President of the Kizan Association, delivered a speech at the meeting of the directors of the national branch offices of the Kizan Association on the 21st. He spoke about the "National Uprising to Annihilate Britain and the United States Movement" that the Japanese government, the Kizan Association, and the Seisei Association are about to implement, emphasizing that the basis of this movement should be the realization of the spirit of the national polity. Second, when promoting the movement, they should do their best to guide the people, so that all the people can actively and naturally participate in the annihilation of Britain and the United States movement based on their spontaneous will. Third, when implementing the movement, they should do everything possible to avoid superficial forms, and then develop national business with spiritual efforts. He also earnestly hoped that the Kizan Association and its affiliated organizations would give full play to their mobility and move toward the path of accomplishing the mission.

Guilin Air Fortress Has Become a Ruin with Holes Everywhere, a Sad Sight

○Japanese Front Line, 22nd Central News Agency report: The Guilin Airfield has been automatically destroyed by the Chongqing army due to the heavy pressure from the Japanese army's ground forces. The ground is full of holes, like a wilderness, showing the end of being subdued by the fierce attacks of the Japanese army. According to the current situation seen by Japanese aircraft when they were conducting reconnaissance of the Guilin air defense fortress, the auxiliary taxiway of the Guilin No. 1 Airfield (13 kilometers southwest of Guilin City) is about 150 meters long and the width of the taxiway is about 100 meters, but at present, there are huge holes every 100 meters, which were probably blown up. From the observation in the fortress, there are no less than seven large holes. Also, the taxiway guide road or connecting road has huge holes every 100 meters to 200 meters. Also, the important taxiway that runs parallel to the sun (length) seems to have not been destroyed yet. The US Air Force seems to be using it as a mobile airfield for fighters, and this place may also be destroyed soon. The buildings on both sides of the main taxiway have been almost completely destroyed. The second airfield has been completely destroyed. There are now four large holes in the main taxiway (approximately 2,000 meters long and 200 meters wide), which are quite deep and the situation is extremely desolate. There are also holes at the end of the connecting road and taxiway. The main taxiway of Guilin's third airfield (on both sides of the second airfield) (approximately 20 meters long and 9 meters wide) also has 25 or 6 large holes. The Guilin air fortress has now been turned into a wasteland ruin.

### On the Southeastern European Front, the German Army Straightened its Lines and Launched a Counterattack on the East Prussian Border

○Berlin, 22nd Central News Agency report: Huitong News Agency: The Soviet army in the Balkans continued to break through from the east to the west to connect with Tito's guerrillas, and cut off the German army in the southern Balkans. The Belgrade area, the center of the war, is still in fierce fighting. The Soviet army seems to attach great importance to the Balkan front, and many troops are concentrated there. The Soviet army has increased pressure on the lower reaches of the Morava River, especially between Nis and the Belgrade area. The Bulgarian army is advancing southwest from the Nis area, and the fighting is taking place in the Plovdiv and Kraljevo-Kragujevac areas. There are only minor changes in the Hungarian border war. The Soviet army is advancing to the Danube River west of the Tisza River, and the German army is突进southeast of Szolnok. After the German army conducted an avoidance movement in eastern Hungary, it also began to avoid离from Warsaw south to the eastern border of Slovakia, so the Warsaw and Belgrade fronts can be straightened. ○Berlin, 22nd Central News Agency report: Huitong News Agency: A German military spokesman said that north of His, East Prussia, the Soviet army broke through. This is the only value change in the situation. The German counterattack prevented the Soviet army from expanding its breakthrough point. The large-scale offensive in the Narew area has not yet begun. On Friday, the Soviet army lost 89 tanks, which shows the intensity of the fighting.

Churchill Emphasizes Anglo-American-Soviet Friendship

○Bairon, 22nd Central News Agency report: German News Agency: The Journal Exchange reported from Moscow that before leaving Moscow, British Prime Minister Churchill met with reporters from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in the reading room of the British Embassy. Churchill said that the anti-Axis countries' opinions on the strategy of fighting against Germany have become completely consistent. Not only military plans, but also important political issues have been clarified. As for Poland, he and any politician of the anti-Axis countries do not care to make it a painful thing in the anti-Axis countries' policy. Churchill hinted in his conclusion that President Roosevelt needs to participate in another detailed meeting. According to the Journal Exchange, Churchill clearly wanted to emphasize in the report meeting that the fact that strengthening Anglo-American-Soviet friendship is the key to world prosperity. British Foreign Secretary Eden also attended the report meeting.

Canadian Troops Reinforced in the Netherlands Launched a New Offensive

○Berlin, 22nd Central News Agency report: Huitong News Agency: Canadian troops in the Netherlands launched a fierce attack between the Antwerp-Rossenthal Highway and the Turnhout-Breda Highway, and the war there entered a new stage. Generally speaking, the Canadian offensive has been blocked, and the gap is being blocked. The purpose of this Canadian offensive is to encircle the German coastal positions and expand the Nijmegen bridgehead, and at the same time echo the action to cut off the Bessarabian Peninsula. The enemy also hopes to occupy the Dutch Schediep south of Dordrecht to control the Rhine-Pusel River estuary. And the peninsula of the estuary. Suda Island, cutting off the land supply of the German army there.

### The Negro Problem in the United States

Increase of Negroes

The states with the highest concentrations of Negroes are South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas, which face the southeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. These eight states are all relatively warm lands. These eight states have

1820 1840 1860 1880 1900 1920 1930 The increase in the Negro population is the biggest threat to Americans. However, about 7/15 of the Negroes currently living in the United States can be said to be mixed with white people. In addition, Dr. Dubs took the Negroes in Georgia, the oldest Negro colony in the United States, as the center, added investigation data from other states and reviewed them. According to the report, at least about one-third of the entire Negro population is mixed with whites. More than half of the Negroes in the United States, about 6 million people. In the two states of South Carolina and Mississippi, the Negro population actually exceeds the white population. The Negro and white populations in Louisiana are half each, and their productivity is very high. The rapid increase in the US population is actually due to Negroes. The increase in the Negro population in the past 100 years is as follows: 1,771,656 2,873,648 4,441,830 6,580,793 8,833,994 10,463,131 11,891,143 blood. In short, due to climate, soil, food, and the result of miscegenation, the skin color of Negroes has gradually changed. This is a fact. When I was in the United States, I inspected the accommodation status of Japanese patients at the famous insane asylum in Nai Po, California. At that time, due to the explanation of Dr. Bratley, I saw a Negro madman. That Negro was different from the Negroes commonly seen on Negro streets. Although he had the same black face, he was very bright, with a shiny black color, a large and shiny nose, a wide and broad nasal cavity, curly hair, red lips, and large and white teeth. His name was Pebe, and he was a pure African. According to the doctor, he was of the same species as the Negroes who were previously enslaved and brought to the southern regions. Now there are very few such Negroes. Pebe was the driver for William Taylor, the famous movie director in Hollywood. Taylor killed someone, and the truth of the incident is unknown. Pebe knew the most at the time, so he went crazy. We talked to him, and he seemed to still have lingering fears, and his voice trembled when he answered.

Negro Occupations

Negroes are mostly deep in love, obedient and resigned to fate. Unless aroused by wine and lust, they do not do very cruel things, and they are not stubborn. Although they are not very intelligent, they are quite clever. And some are like primitive people, children, lacking self-control. They are easily moved and like music. Most of the Negroes in the South are engaged in cotton, tobacco, rice, and sugar.

Engaged in agriculture 1,987,839
Engaged in forestry and fisheries 31,732
Mine workers 74,973
Industrial workers 1,024,656
Workers 397,645
Technicians 183,803
Transportation inspectors 50,203
Engaged in commerce 1,576,205
Public Utilities Workers 40,549
Freelancers
Religious people
Total 5,503,535

The distribution of the Negro population is as follows:
New York 227,706
Chicago 233,903
Philadelphia 229,599
Detroit 120,066
Cleveland 71,899
St. Louis 93,580
Gyzepike 54,983
New Sistiti 43,967
Indianapolis 38,574

Discrimination in Treatment

In the states of the South, various state laws have been established that discriminate against Negroes. For example, the laws commonly known as Jim Crow laws were created to distinguish Negroes from white people on trains. New statistics are not available. According to older statistics, the occupational divisions of Negroes are as follows:

Also, the ten major industrial centers of the
Negro passengers, no matter how crowded, cannot ride on the white people's train, even if the white people's train is empty. Also, on streetcars, Negro seats and white people's seats are separated. Barbershops and taverns are also clearly distinguished, and Negroes are not allowed to stay in hotels. Marriage between white people and Negroes is, of course, strictly prohibited. Regarding this unequal law, according to what Americans say: White people want to marry Negroes, and Negroes want to marry white people, but both are not allowed, which is considered fair. However, in reality, there may be Negroes who want to marry white people, but there are absolutely no white people who want to marry Negroes, except for idiots and madmen. As a result, this is, of course, discrimination against Negroes. Originally, regardless of whether they are Negroes or white people, they are now citizens of the United States and are granted equal voting rights and the right to be elected. Therefore, prohibiting marriage between citizens is a reaction law. However, white people use various means to legalize this illegal act. As the Negroes' struggle against white people quoted at the beginning of this article, there have been many such incidents in the past. In 1917, the race war that occurred in St. Louis killed 39 Negroes and 8 white people. Also, in 1919, there were 26 incidents of conflict between Negroes and white people. The most intense of these were the race wars that occurred in Washington and Chicago in the United States. The reason for this was that the Negro troops who had returned from participating in the First European War were still being discriminated against by white people, so they expressed their indignation and suddenly launched an opposition movement.

### The Second Day of the Rally to Celebrate the Annihilation of the American and British Fleets

Speeches by President Chiang and Lieutenant Ota

The [Rally to Celebrate the Annihilation of the American and British Fleets], organized by the Shanghai Press Association, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the Citizens' Welfare Association, continued for its second day. The planned chairpersons were Mr. Funatsu Ichiro, Xu Liqiu, Chen Bin, Su Jinxiong, Bai Huangjing, Lu Feng, and the Director-General of the Japan News Agency, Mr. Im Yun-peng. First, Huang Jingzhai, the rotating chairman of the Press Association, delivered the opening remarks. Then, President Jiang Xiyuan of the Central Naval Academy and Lieutenant Ota of the Allied Nations' Fleet Reporting Department in China gave speeches, their words full of warning, moving the audience. Finally, naval battle newsreels and the new Huaying film [Reunion] were shown. The event ended at 7:30 PM. Today is the last day, still held at the Grand Theater, with speeches by Mr. Idechi, the Army Reporting Director, and Mr. Huang Jingzhai, the rotating chairman of the Press Association. There will also be a performance by the Shanghai Jiaotong Orchestra and a concert by famous Chinese and Japanese singers. President Jiang's Speech

Briefly, our enemy – America – is trying to use its naval power to fulfill its ambitions of aggression, and is arrogantly trying to approach the Japanese mainland. The Allied Japanese Navy will surely have the determination to annihilate the enemy and shatter its offensive intentions. The Japanese Navy will surely win for the following reasons: First, the Japanese Navy possesses the strategy and tactics to suppress the enemy. Second, the commanders of the Japanese Navy have steadfast and unyielding spirits. Third, the Japanese Navy is fully prepared for inland operations, and its combat power is very strong and solid. It is impossible for the enemy America to break through this solid barrier. Fourth, the main fleet of the Japanese Navy is intact and undamaged, and it is now watching for the enemy's weaknesses in order to annihilate it in one blow. Fifth, in response to the invincible spirit of the Japanese Navy, it will surely stimulate the full development of the production power of 100 million people in the rear. The American Pacific Fleet that launched this attack, the elite of the American mobile task force that America boasts about, was mostly annihilated by the Allied Navy on October 12th. It can be said to be the greatest victory since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, and we cannot help but have some feelings about this victory. In particular, the fact that we should pay more attention to now is that with the Japanese Navy's victory this time, it has created an opportunity for a so-called greater and more extreme transformation of the war situation. This point is really worth celebrating together. (Omission) However, the victory of the Greater East Asia War will definitely not be achieved by eating well and doing nothing. The struggle of the soldiers at the front depends on the inspiration of the rear. How should we strengthen the close cooperation between the front and the rear? We must use unwavering courage and supreme passion to exchange for this final victory. We must aim at the ideal of the liberation of Greater East Asia and, from now on, vow to advance fiercely in response to the victories of the Allied Nations.

### Lieutenant Ota's Speech

Lieutenant Ota gave an impromptu speech on [How to Achieve Great Victories]. The original speech is as follows: I take this opportunity to briefly discuss the great victory east of Taiwan, which is a great honor. I will first describe how the great victory was achieved and the course of the battle, and then describe several major points as follows: First, the enemy's operational purpose is to have the ambition to make Asia their colony. This is the greatest ambition of the Jewish financial groups since the First World War. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it has been about three years, and the enemy has not yet given up this ambition, and has forced its people to sacrifice their lives and consume their wealth in an attempt to achieve this ambition. Enemy Strategy

Second, the enemy's strategy to achieve the first goal is as follows: The enemy's offensive in the Pacific is planned to recapture the Philippines, and to invade China with the army and navy, in order to blockade the Japanese economy, and then to use the Philippines and China as bases, and to requisition their manpower and resources, in order to subdue Japan. And this task was ordered to Admiral Nimitz, Commander of the American Pacific Fleet, and Generals MacArthur and Stilwell. Nimitz planned to use MacArthur's forces to attack New Guinea and the Philippines, and to occupy Taiwan, invading the southeastern coastal area of China, and then to enter the Chinese mainland together with MacArthur's troops, and to use China as a battlefield for a major decisive battle with Japan. General Stilwell, in Nimitz's operations, provided assistance from the Chinese mainland, first invading the Chinese mainland by air force, and building the foundation for the colonization of China. In order to carry out the above purposes, it was necessary to have a special unit with organized and great attacking power. Therefore, the most outstanding units of the American Navy were concentrated here to form the 58th Mobile Task Force. With this mobile unit, the enemy America entrusted the greatest confidence, and it participated in the capture of Gilbert Island starting from the general counter-offensive in November of this year. The unit that attacked New Guinea was also this unit. And recently, the unit that occupied Saipan, Tinian, and Tianning Island was also this unit. Today, one year later, this 58th Mobile Task Force participated in the attack on Taiwan, Okinawa, and the Philippines. This unit is equipped with huge cannons, 1,000 aircraft, and sufficient fuel and ammunition to maintain long-range attacks, so it is called the Fleet Train, which is the strongest fleet in the world. Course of Fierce Battle

This fleet dared to launch a major attack on Taiwan since the Greater East Asia War, while MacArthur attacked the Philippines, and Stilwell waited in the American Air Force base in Chongqing. Roosevelt attempted to resolve the Greater East Asia War with this large-scale operation. This large-scale operation began on the night of October 10th. Our aviation unit discovered it on the morning of October 11th, and began to counterattack. On October 12th, the enemy attacked Taiwan with 1,100 aircraft. Our ground artillery began anti-aircraft fire and shot down 110 of its aircraft. Our aviation unit then concentrated its full attack power on the fleet at night, sinking its aircraft carriers. This fleet, which the enemy claimed to be the strongest in the world, suffered a fatal blow from our side during the attack by 3,000 aircraft on the 13th within a few hours. By the 14th, the enemy sought assistance from the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing, and 100 B29 aircraft from the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing participated in the air raid on our side. After our air raids on the 12th and 13th, the 58th Mobile Task Force, which the enemy boasted about in the world, had been annihilated, and the super-large aircraft carrier on which Commander Mitscher was riding was also sunk. The enemy's Third Fleet and 58th Mobile Task Force, after suffering injuries all over, abandoned the sunken warships and fled eastward. Our aviation unit and a part of our combined fleet continued to attack the enemy's surviving units, completely annihilating them. The enemy's 1,000 aircraft and 28,000 soldiers have been destroyed in the Pacific Ocean. This is indeed an answer to the enemy's challenge over the past year: [If the Japanese Navy has the will to fight, please come and have a decisive battle with the American Navy]. Our navy has now given its answer. This disastrous defeat caused President Roosevelt to lose the biggest propaganda material for the election, so he ordered the Fifth Fleet led by Spruance and MacArthur's troops to attack desperately, hoping that even if one soldier could land on the Philippines, it could be propagandized to his country. Originally, it was planned to eliminate the Japanese Navy with the 58th Mobile Task Force in one fell swoop and land on the Philippines, but unexpectedly, the 58th Mobile Task Force was completely annihilated, and the morale of the soldiers was in a chaotic situation. However, the United States still wants to show its strength and demonstrate the greatness of its military power. Spruance's Third Fleet and MacArthur quickly formed warships and landed in the Philippines, but there is nothing to panic about. Our aviation unit had already discovered the mobile unit and sunk and destroyed most of it. Even if they landed in Leyte Gulf, they would be annihilated by the units gathered from all sides by us. The propaganda demanded that the British fleet and the American Air Force in China be dispatched, which only proves that the American fleet has been completely destroyed. Efforts to Increase Production

During this year, our country has re-stored aviation forces in various places, crushing the enemy's dispatch, causing the entire war situation in the Greater East Asia War to change completely, and obtaining the key to our fleet's victory in the Pacific War. In this naval battle, we suffered no other damage except for the loss of 320 aircraft. This naval and air battle was the second Battle of the Sea of Japan. Because I participated in this attack with aircraft and achieved this great victory, I am specially reporting to you as above. This kind of great victory is entirely due to the strengthening of production and the excellence of our science. Therefore, the great victory in the future will also be increased due to the rapid increase in production, and the glory of victory will come to the heads of our Asian people. Although the ancient saying goes: [Building a mountain requires nine trips, but failing at the last basket]. This saying is very cautionary, so we must not fail to arouse our fighting spirit and strive to complete the goal of destroying the United Kingdom and the United States.

### The Shanghai Indian Volunteer Army Held a Parade

### Weekly Market Conditions

Market conditions in Shanghai's financial and industrial sectors hovered uncertainly last week.

Hedgehogs were searching in many ways, trending upward step by step. Silver dollar and silver ingots rose significantly, and the silver supply remained tight. However, stocks rose and then fell again. The chaotic financial situation was due to the promulgation of the "Outline for Strengthening the Business of Financial Institutions in the Shanghai Special City" by the Ministry of Finance on Friday. Small banks were severely hit, leaving them with no room to operate. Without unscrupulous disturbances, the financial situation stabilized. On Saturday morning, most speculative commodities fell. The production rate of various factories showed no signs of improvement, but because inventories could still meet market needs, no changes were seen amidst calls for supply-demand balance. Although rice and miscellaneous grains did not see a sharp rise last week, there was no hope of a fall. People are quietly waiting for the government's measures to suppress prices to take effect.

### Calligraphy Exhibition by Zheng Shiqiao and Wife

Mr. Zheng is a master of calligraphy, and there will surely be a grand occasion at that time.

### Jia Group Football League: Donghua Beats Three Provinces

The Shanghai League Football Tournament at Zhaozhou Park had three Jia group matches. At 10:00 AM, the Jewish team played the Russian Sports Association. The Jewish team was ultimately better, defeating the Russian Sports Association three to one. At 2:00 PM, the Wen Du team played the German Merchants. In the first half, the Wen Du team scored two goals. During the second half, the battle was still fierce, and the German Merchants ultimately lost one to two. At 4:00 PM, Donghua played Three Provinces. Both sides played brilliantly. Although Three Provinces lost by a score of one to three, Donghua was very alarmed. Huang Zhendong of Three Provinces provided comprehensive defense and made great contributions. Goalkeeper Huang Zhendong repeatedly saved difficult shots, showing McNeitty's style. In addition, in the Jia group football league, Huatong played Jilin at the Yiyuan Stadium at 10:00 AM yesterday. Unfortunately, Huatong narrowly lost to Jilin by a score of one to two. Both sides in this match lacked finesse, and there was no strategy to speak of. The goals scored were very forced.

### Tianjin Travelogue

— Wu Gong

From Beijing to Tianjin

The reporter took the Beijing-Tianjin express train, which departed from Beijing at 8:10 AM, to Tianjin. Taking the train in Beijing is completely different from Shanghai. Not only can you buy tickets as soon as you arrive, but you can also get on the train as you please after buying the ticket. For example, the train I took this time was originally scheduled to depart at 8:10 AM, but ticket checks began at 7:00 AM. Therefore, all kinds of crowding and queuing that I saw in Shanghai were completely absent. It really made me wonder why there are such different situations in the same country! Finding a Hotel is as Difficult as Ascending to Heaven

In this day and age, the first hardship of traveling is finding a hotel for regular travelers. This problem caused me a lot of suffering in Beijing. Therefore, I had to make proper arrangements in advance before returning to Tianjin this time. The day before I left Beijing, I asked Director Guan of the Information Bureau to call the Tianjin Huabei Xinbao to book a room for me. I thought it was foolproof. Unexpectedly, although I rushed to the Huabei Xinbao on Suma Street at 11:00 AM, after their kind efforts, they were only able to let me stay in a small room in the Dakuo Hotel, which was opened by one of their colleagues. Because I was not used to living in someone else's house, I went to see a companion who had come north from Shanghai that afternoon. With his help and the help of his friends, I finally found a military-managed hotel in the Chinese district - the New Tianjin Hotel. These friends, who all came to Tianjin from Shanghai to do business, were able to solve this difficult problem for me, and I am really grateful to them. The next day, when I went to visit the Huabei Xinbao, when they heard about my accident in finding a hotel yesterday, even these old Tianjin residents sighed in admiration! Meeting an Old Friend in a Foreign Land

Tianjin is generally the same as Shanghai, but in recent years, due to the impact of the closure of dance halls, the night market has been very depressed, and the lights are not as easily turned on as in Beijing. These modern merchants I newly met in Tianjin are very generous. Although I just met them, I felt very warmly welcomed because of the old friend. We first ate dinner at [Didi], and the beer almost filled my stomach. Then we went to the Russian General Assembly Hall for music. In the lonely journey, I encountered such warm hospitality from friends, which made me feel their greatness even more! Shanghai Artists in the Northern Country

There are many Shanghainese in Tianjin. When I was having breakfast in the cafeteria of the New Tianjin Hotel the next morning, I suddenly saw Gu Lanjun and Li Ying and his wife at the head of the table. Later, I learned from the newspaper that they were here to perform plays. Recently, many Shanghai movie stars have organized troupes to come to North China to perform dramas. There is a troupe in Beijing organized by Wei Wenhua and He Bao and others. From this, it can be seen how much the people in the northern country admire the artists of Shanghai. Even the content of the Ying Shu Xun Kan, which is published in Beijing, is mostly based on news about Shanghai artists.
