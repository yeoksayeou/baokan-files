### Calm Heads

After the British and American troops landed in western and southern France, the German army successively retreated to defend its own country. Optimists in Britain and America believed that the fall of Berlin was just a matter of time, and the European war could end immediately. Chongqing, always eager to please, even more vigorously promoted and broadcasted that after the European war was resolved, the Pacific war could also be resolved soon. Speculators in Shanghai, who are accustomed to spreading rumors, fueled the flames and fabricated many lies to deceive everyone and harm the country, in order to achieve their personal goals of making a fortune and enjoying life to the fullest. Unexpectedly, after Churchill returned to England from the Quebec Conference, he reported the results of the conference to the House of Commons on September 28, stating that in military terms, the war could not end immediately, and warning the people not to harbor illusions but to continue their efforts. All optimistic views were swept away. Since the situation in Europe was like this, there was no need to talk about the overall situation in East Asia. We don't know how the optimists in Chongqing and the rumor-mongers in Shanghai will explain this. Churchill's report is the most obvious manifestation of Germany's strength, and the most powerful proof of Germany's strength. Originally, after Germany abandoned western and southern France, it only lost contact with the Mediterranean Sea and the English Channel. Therefore, it could concentrate its army on its homeland and its navy on the North Sea. After the troops were no longer dispersed, it was naturally convenient to exert their strength, and the strength exerted was even greater. This cannot be said to be Germany's predetermined strategy, but it is common sense in military affairs. British and American people who understand this point naturally cannot issue optimistic arguments again. We often remind the people of this point, hoping that the people will use a calm head and judge according to common sense. Our purpose is only to hope that everyone will not be washed away by the waves in this turbulent world, and will not suffer unnecessary sacrifices. Only by holding firm to our ideas, working step by step, and working down-to-earth can we achieve independent self-existence. Chongqing's following the crowd will eventually only lead to [lifting a brick to drop it on one's own foot], and Shanghai's rumor-mongering will first harm the public, and eventually even oneself will not be spared. Being a citizen in a great era, being a knowledgeable citizen, and being a citizen who is beneficial to oneself, to others, and to the country, is the goal of every citizen. How to achieve this goal? The only prerequisite is whether the mind is calm or not. The current world is full of opportunism, speculation, and deception. This is a transitional phenomenon before the wartime system is on the right track. Once it is on the right track, these phenomena will naturally disappear without a trace. The most pitiful are the general public who are deceived and exploited. When the truth is revealed and it is proven that the rumors are not true, they are sacrificed in confusion. It is important to know that the purpose of the speculators and rumor-mongers in Chongqing and Shanghai is only to seek power and enjoyment for a few people. If someone echoes them, their personal plans will succeed. If no one echoes them, their personal plans will fail. But for those who echo them, there is only sacrifice, and nothing else. Those who blindly follow will inevitably embark on the road of sacrifice, which is also natural. The German mystery has now been proven by the anti-Axis Churchill, giving a great blow to the general rumor-mongers, and giving a clear understanding to the general blind people. Other mysteries and other opportunistic things cannot be eliminated immediately at present, so a calm head is even more important, and even more important for the general public.

### Peleliu Continues, Japanese Troops Defend Day and Night, Inflicting Damage on the Enemy, Philippine-Japanese Land and Air Forces Prepare to Exert Their Combat Power

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Japanese troops on Peleliu Island in the Palau Islands are bravely resisting the enemy's material offensive and continuing to fight fiercely day after day. On September 30th, a unit of enemy troops attacked Mount Suifu in the central highlands, but were repulsed by the Japanese troops after a fierce counterattack. Japanese troops on the island continue to launch attacks along the entire line day and night. Bayonet attack squads also go out from time to time, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The attack on the night of the 29th was the most intense. Most of the attack squads broke into the enemy's陣, killing or wounding more than 70 enemy soldiers in the first two groups. The members of the attack隊 still returned safely. After the突擊 campaign was implemented that night, all the enemy's soldiers were frightened. The Japanese army also captured various weapons, ammunition, food and other items. Fierce battles continue on Angaur Island in the Atbus Islands. Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a certain Japanese base in the central Pacific, Japanese troops on Peleliu Island are fighting bravely day and night, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. According to the report on the war situation of the troops, not only have there been brave戰果 days after day, but also the combat awareness of not stopping until the enemy troops are destroyed is extremely旺盛, and after a unit of elite reinforcements arrived, the combat intent is even more昂揚. After the Japanese增援 troops successfully reinforced the troops, they combined with the garrison troops and immediately went to the front line, engaging the enemy陣 in melee continuously. On the night of the 28th, they divided into several班 and sneaked into the enemy陣, killing many enemy將兵, capturing two mortars and two machine guns, and then leisurely returned to陣地. This newly銳 troops rushed into the enemy陣 on the night of the 29th, killing and wounding more than 290 enemy troops.

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Japanese military experts expressed the following views on the US military's invasion of the Philippines: The US military's invasion of the Philippines in the Pacific will become increasingly露骨. In addition to landing on Peleliu, Angaur, and Morotai islands, they are also repeatedly bombing Japanese air force bases in the Philippines, regardless of losses. However, the Philippines is by no means a small island isolated in the Pacific. A large number of Japanese troops on land are currently執戈待敵, and the Japanese air force is also waiting for the opportunity to arrive at various bases. Therefore, the enemy's企圖 to invade the Philippines is as a big冒險 as the European invasion operation, and it is a great opportunity for the Japanese army to歼敌. The enemy's success in Europe was due to two years of strategic effort, especially in the last half year, when the British and American armies战略 bombed German industrial areas, oil production facilities, and synthetic oil factories day and night. However, Japan's military industry has hardly suffered direct attacks from the enemy army, and the consumption rate of the air force unit is also extremely low. The world is wondering how much combat power Japan will exert when the final battle comes. Although the enemy army is now bombing, its scale is very small. It is neither a strategic bombing nor a tactical bombing, such as attacking naval ships, etc., and is only expecting a temporary effect.

### Weekly War Situation of the Japanese Army in Various Places

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) The weekly war situation in various parts of East Asia is as follows: ○China (Land Operations) The Japanese army's operations in central and southern China are progressing smoothly.

At the same time, the enemy army is increasing reinforcements on the island in order to launch a large-scale offensive. The total number of空母 dispatched by the enemy army in this campaign has reached more than dozens, including more than ten standardized空母.

Therefore, the Vietnamese people all hope that the Japanese army will sweep Guangxi as soon as possible.

### Good Results Achieved in Increased Japanese Mineral Production

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Military Supplies Department previously implemented a must-win production increase campaign for important minerals in August and September, seeking the rapid wartime transformation of various minerals. Since the implementation of this measure, it has achieved very good results. In order to ensure continued production increase in the future, new measures are being implemented separately to strongly promote it. Mr. Kagayama, Director of the Non-Ferrous Metals Bureau, who is responsible for this important task, specially issued the following statement: The results in August, when the production increase period began, were slightly inferior, but the situation gradually improved thereafter, and the results were extremely satisfactory. During that time, some mining areas suffered disasters due to wind, rain, and heat, but the overall results were extremely good, which is very gratifying. Although the final statistics for August and September are not yet clear, based on the recent situation, copper is about 20% higher, lead is more than 30%, zinc is 10%, and other iron ore, mercury,　, manganese, asbestos, etc., also show extremely good results.

### The Failure of the Bombay Talks Affects Britain the Most

Rangoon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Gandhi-Jinnah talks broke down on the 6th of last month. In this talk, Jinnah firmly advocated [Partition before Independence], while Gandhi advocated [Whether or not to Partition before Independence, must be decided by a people’s vote], and the British advocated [The conflict between Hindus and Muslims must be resolved first, before discussions with the British government on Indian independence can commence]. The above three points seemed to be on the same track, but the Bombay talks, rather than being a conference on the Hindu-Muslim issue between Gandhi and Jinnah, were more like a conciliation conference between Britain and Gandhi. Some even believe that it was a conference where Gandhi fawned over Britain. As for the reasons for the breakdown, although not very detailed, it can be known from Jinnah’s statement that Gandhi has always insisted that the issue of Partition before Independence must be decided by a people’s vote, and this was the main reason for the breakdown of the talks. Gandhi’s compromise plan for the Muslims was indeed very reasonable, so the Muslims outwardly expressed their joy, but inwardly they harbored strong cases that did not lead to a breakdown. Gandhi’s private proposal to Britain for the establishment of an Indian national government, although similar to the Cripps’ proposal, still had some points that stimulated Britain, so it is doubtful whether Gandhi and Britain truly reached a compromise. Gandhi can no longer be driven by Britain, but what is Gandhi’s purpose? Observing India’s reaction will immediately become clear. Regardless of whether the breakdown of this talk was a political failure for Gandhi or Jinnah’s greatest blunder, the one most affected was actually Britain. However, a part of the central political circles in India has recently been quite impatient with the compromise with Britain. With Gandhi’s wisdom, he will certainly never give up his long-cherished wish of expelling Britain from India, and will endure humiliation and compromise. However, what means will Gandhi take in the future? Judging from Spabas’ criticism, [The leaders of the Indian national movement never stop for a moment regarding their mission], Gandhi, after being released from prison, will certainly not sit idly by. However, what contribution will Gandhi make in India? The Bombay talks and other breakdowns have further revealed Gandhi’s attitude.

### Measures for Foreign Medical Personnel to Apply for Certificates are Limited to Countries with Medical Reciprocity

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - There are many foreign doctors practicing medicine in various parts of China. However, whether foreign doctors and their medical practitioners in China are issued certificates in accordance with the law, and how the situation is handled, has attracted much attention. Therefore, the reporter specially visited the Director of the Ministry of Health, Mr. Lu Runzhi, to inquire about everything, and he told us: [Those who apply for the issuance of certificates from the Ministry for foreign medical practitioners in China are limited to people from countries that have signed medical reciprocity agreements, in accordance with the Doctor Law promulgated by the National Government on February 1st of this year. The friendly country of Germany has recently officially informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the German Embassy, which has been forwarded to the Ministry, recognizing that medical practitioners in our country have the right to practice in Germany. Since that country has a spirit of reciprocity towards medical practitioners in our country, the Ministry has also specially processed applications for certificates from German medical practitioners in China. However, all application documents must be sent by the German Embassy to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for transfer to the Ministry for review. This method has already been implemented by the Ministry, which has sent the application documents to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for transfer to the German Embassy for verification.]

### Japanese Main Force Approaches Xing'an, US Air Force Acknowledges Fall of Danzhu

Guangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Chongqing, the US Air Force Command stationed in Chongqing issued a communiqué on the 1st, confirming that the US Air Force forward base of Danzhu in southern China had fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. However, the Chongqing Military Commission's announcement did not mention this, only stating that the Japanese army was advancing south along the Xiang-Gui Railway, and that its main force was currently advancing to the vicinity of Jiemeng in the northeast of Xing'an, and Lishi Square and Jiukuaida in the southeast. It further acknowledged that the crisis in Xing'an, the last stronghold defending Guilin, was becoming more and more urgent.

### Wuzhou Has Become a Pile of Rubble

Wuzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Because the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing implemented a scorched earth tactic, Wuzhou has now become a pile of rubble. According to the residents of the ruined area, the US Air Force saw that the Japanese army was attacking along both banks of the West River, and Wuzhou was in danger, so they fled first. The local officials of Chongqing strictly ordered the citizens to evacuate before the 10th of September, and those who disobeyed were beaten. The people had no choice but to obey and flee to the mountains. However, the US Air Force actually sent five aircraft on the 21st and 22nd, before the Japanese army entered the city, to drop high-performance bombs everywhere, and scattered a large number of incendiary bombs, and even strafed with machine guns indiscriminately. As a result, fires broke out everywhere in the city, and because it was dry and dry, the fire spread and could not be suppressed. It burned throughout the city for four days and three nights, and the entire city was destroyed. After the Japanese army entered the city, the citizens returned one after another, and saw the Japanese army engaging in relief work for the disaster victims in the scorched earth. They could not help but suddenly realize who the enemy of the Chinese people was. Southern China Front, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The scorched earth tactic has completely turned Wuzhou into ruins. Whether military facilities or civilian houses in the city, they were bombed several times by Chongqing-US aircraft when the Chongqing army retreated. There are almost no solid houses left. The wharf area along the West River has also been turned into rubble. However, after the Japanese army occupied Wuzhou, they immediately began construction work. The propaganda隊 and the gendarmerie隊 issued Good Citizen Certificates to the returning residents and handled other work to restore public order, and the復興 of the city, etc., are unusually active.

### Southwest People Cooperate with the Japanese Army

Southern China Base, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The large-scale operation launched by the Japanese army in southwestern China this time is a major change that has never happened before on the Chinese front. Southwestern China is the driving force behind Chongqing's war of resistance finance. In particular, the US Air Force in Chongqing has established a strong base in the area to stir up trouble. However, this Japanese army's attack will not only destroy Chongqing's anti-Japanese base, but also the forward base of the US Air Force in Chongqing. What is particularly noteworthy about this operation is that the Chongqing army's will to resist Japan has been significantly reduced, the people's cooperation with the Japanese army has become more active, and their resentment towards the US military has deepened. Since the Japanese army began its operations, it has hardly encountered any major resistance. Deqing, which was captured by the Japanese army on the 20th of last month, had its field warehouses and equipment warehouses filled with military supplies, and they were not burned or evacuated, but fled. The city was also hardly destroyed, which shows the generally low morale of the Chongqing army. In addition, the various forces of the 35th Army Group, which the Chongqing army boasts as the strongest, are only deployed in small units on the resistance line to avoid consumption, and the main forces have retreated. What is most strange is the thorough cooperation of the people in the newly occupied areas with the Japanese army. For example, during the river-crossing operation in Xinxingjiang, the local residents gathered dozens of civilian ships to cooperate with the Japanese army. These are all facts of the people's cooperation. This shows that the people have understood the true intentions of the Japanese army, and this trend has spread throughout the areas under Chongqing's rule.

### Balkan War Enters Initial Stage

German Forces Concentrate Large Army to Strengthen Defense Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) - German authorities announced on the 1st that German forces in the Balkans are currently regrouping a large-scale force, but the timing of how German forces will form a new battle line is not yet specified. Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Universal News Agency reports: A new eastern front has formed on both sides of the Iron Gate of the Danube River in the Balkans, and the combat situation there was mentioned for the first time in yesterday's German war report. The important strategic significance of the German operations in this area lies in preventing the Soviet forces from breaking into Serbia. The purpose of the Soviet offensive is to cut off the German forces in the Aegean Sea region. The battle is currently in its initial stage. Fierce fighting is taking place in the Arad and Turda areas.

### Fierce Fighting on the Romanian-Hungarian Border

Strong Soviet forces launched an offensive from Romanian territory, attacking the city of Szeged in eastern Hungary. In the past 24 hours, German-Hungarian allied forces have not only contained their momentum but have also recaptured Kis Zombor between Arad and Szeged in fierce fighting. They have also entered Mrko from the west. North of Yvarad, they have entered Hungarian territory. After the German forces reached the border, they broke through the Soviet-Romanian line. Soviet forces attempted to cross the Milches River in Szekler. Thirty-seven vessels were heavily bombarded by German artillery, resulting in many Soviet drownings. The Soviet forces only managed to establish a small bridgehead after four consecutive attempts to cross the river.

### Three Strategic Objectives of the Soviet Army

Budapest, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to front-line intelligence: The Soviet forces on the southeastern European front tend to shift to a full-scale offensive, and the work of strengthening the defensive line of the German-Hungarian allied forces is also progressing steadily. The Soviet army's goals are roughly as follows: ○ Invade Slovakia, ○ Occupy the Hungarian Plain, ○ Attack the Adriatic coast from Serbia and Macedonia, isolating the German forces in the south, ○ Subdue Greece and Turkey. The main battle locations are currently three: ○ Secure the Dukla Pass on the northeastern border of Slovakia, ○ Invade the Razsa Plain between Oradea and Makó on the Hungarian-Romanian border, ○ Operations at the Iron Gate in Serbia. However, the most important Dukla Pass in the Carpathians is still under German control. The passes in the Carpathian Mountains will become impassable due to snowfall in about a month, causing great anxiety to the Soviet forces. The offensive on the Razsa and Oradea-Makó plains will determine the fate of Hungary. On the other hand, the Soviet forces are operating in Outer Transylvania from the Bucharest area to defend the flanks of the rear lines of communication. The Soviet offensive was repulsed by German forces. The defense of the German forces in the Banat area from Makó to the Iron Gate is very strong, and fierce battles are unfolding between the German and Soviet forces. In Serbia and Macedonia, the German forces are engaged in chaotic battles with the Bulgarian and Tito forces advancing northward from Greece. The weather in this area will be severely cold in a month, making combat difficult. The above three aspects of combat are sufficient to show the rapidly escalating situation on the southeastern European front.

### German Forces Abandon Moon Island in the North

On the northern front, Soviet forces attacking between Twena and the Gulf of Riga were repulsed. Moon Island (ls. Moon), after fierce fighting, was ultimately lost due to the disparity in military strength. Apart from the operations to suppress Polish insurgents in the Warsaw area, there were no major battles on the central front.

It concluded that the transformation of the Pacific War situation is imminent. The newspaper's commentary is the same as the commentary published by [War and Labor Newspaper] on September 15 and the Pacific War situation published by [Red Fleet] on September 23. It can prove that the Soviet Union is very concerned about the recent Pacific War situation, and the Moscow diplomatic community has paid attention to this point.

### The Spirit of Devouring the Enemy

— Tokutomi Sohō

We don't need grand or heroic words at the moment; what we need is the spirit of devouring the enemy. This spirit must be a spirit shared by 100 million people. The most important of these is the spirit of the guiding leaders who are enlightened and perceptive. Especially important is the spirit of those who stand in important positions of national politics and those who shoulder important military responsibilities.

There is a popular saying now, namely, "total national armament." But what do we use to arm ourselves? The main armament is the spirit of devouring the enemy. That is, the spirit of full confidence in each issue. It is said that this spirit is ignited from below, but we believe that this spirit must be ignited from below through the guidance of the above. If the generals and ministers in power in a country wait for the spirit below to burn before taking action, this is a big mistake. In any democratic society, the masses must be guided by leaders. At the time when He Shi smashed the cauldrons and sank the boats to fight to the death, what determined the survival of the nation was even more the spirit of the leader. Ancient famous generals all said that victory or defeat depended on one person's emotions.

The general public in society says to confront quantity with quantity, iron with iron, and airplanes with airplanes. It is right for specialists to say this. For example, aircraft manufacturers, whether in terms of performance or quantity, must surpass the enemy. All are engaged in their own positions with the determination not to lose to the enemy. However, this is by no means the origin for the entire Japanese nation. If the people all believe that victory or defeat is determined by the amount of matter, then the Greater East Asia War will certainly not have occurred. Before this war was launched, everyone knew that the quantity of Anglo-Saxons far exceeded that of Japan countless times. However, regardless of this obvious and well-known fact, our Japan actually promulgated the edict of holy war. This is ultimately because Japan relies on something else, not just the amount of matter.

We will never ignore the amount of matter, nor will we despise it. However, war cannot be carried out by relying solely on the amount of matter. For this reason, please see the recent fourth American bombing of northern Kyushu, when Lieutenant Endo shot down five enemy planes with a single plane, which is enough to prove that victory or defeat does not depend on the amount of matter.

Currently, the entire country of Japan is loudly calling out that there are not enough airplanes. The slogan "Make airplanes quickly!" resounds across the world. I think this remedy is not only very effective, but also too effective. According to government authorities, Japan's aircraft production is definitely no less than the second place among the world's major powers. And the performance of the aircraft can be said to be superior to everything without shame. To take a step back, it is never inferior to other countries. The only regret today is that its effectiveness has not been fully utilized. I believe that this hidden worry will be resolved in the near future.

Therefore, what we need to emphasize again today is to promote the spirit of devouring the enemy. In particular, we should promote the spirit of devouring the enemy among national government officials and the heads of the army and navy. One person's heart is the heart of millions of people. If the authorities carry out their tasks with unwavering faith in victory, then the people will surely burn with a belief in victory like crazy.

During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05, regarding the selection of the commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, I and others recognized that it should be Admiral Higashigo of the Navy. However, Minister of the Navy Yamamoto promoted Admiral Togo, the commander of the Maizuru Naval District, who was about to retire to the reserves, and proposed him to the Emperor. Higashigo and Yamamoto were close friends. Higashigo had never dreamed of such an unexpected thing. When it finally became a reality, he went to Yamamoto's house and directly started negotiations. But Yamamoto said to Higashigo very simply: "You have a good reason to be angry. But your wisdom is excessive, and your strategies are too many. That's why I recommended Togo, who has the courage of a single wisdom." Togo was consistent and had the spirit of devouring the enemy. He reported to the Emperor his determination to destroy the enemy to reassure the imperial heart. This is by no means an exaggeration. The belief in victory, that is, the spirit of devouring the enemy, made him submit such a memorial. Masashige, when he visited Emperor Go-Daigo at Kasagi, said: "As long as Masashige has one breath left, he will never trouble the Emperor," which is essentially the same idea as Togo.

We do not believe that the amount of matter is useless. It is just that the amount of matter alone cannot determine victory or defeat. To give a very common example, people often like to talk about the duel between Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojiro. Kojiro flaunted the four-foot-long katana that everyone in Bizen knew, while Musashi, when he came to the ring from Bakan, brought a paddle that he had shaved into a wooden sword, and he took this wooden sword to meet him. However, in the official duel, the wooden sword made from a paddle killed the opponent. That's not to say that weapons are useless. If possible, naturally use effective weapons as much as possible. However, weapons are used by people, and people are not used by weapons.

Consider Oda Nobunaga's Okehazama. Imagawa's army was said to be 50,000 strong. Nobunaga's troops were at most less than 3,000. Nobunaga's veteran generals and old retainers all advised Nobunaga not to launch a reckless war. However, Nobunaga attacked Yoshimoto's headquarters with lightning speed and killed Yoshimoto. There are many such things in China. For example, in the Battle of Red Cliffs, Cao Cao's army was said to number in the millions. The rulers and ministers of Eastern Wu changed color and prepared to surrender. However, Zhou Yu, Lu Su, and others advocated a battle, and finally burned Cao's camp for eight hundred miles.

To give another clichéd example of the Greco-Persian Wars. Although clichéd, the facts are still facts. Xerxes I gathered most of the army of West Asia to invade Greece. But the small Greek army defeated them on land and sea, sending them fleeing in disarray.

Let's take another look at the Mongol invasion of Japan. Murata Seifu composed a song praising it:

May I ask, what is the heart of the people of Japan?
They beheaded the Mongol envoy Tokimune in an instant.

What a wonderfully exhilarating song! The reason why Tokimune was Tokimune lies entirely in this point. He did not initially act unilaterally to assassinate the Mongol envoys. He petitioned the court and was entrusted before beheading them. At the first cabinet meeting, it was decided not to write a reply. But later it was decided to reply. After the draft was completed, it was submitted to Kamakura, and Tokimune's opinion was solicited. Tokimune was consistent and insisted on the opinion of the initial cabinet meeting, not to write a reply. Therefore, the draft reply was kept in Kamakura and not given to the Mongol envoys. Tokimune followed the policy that had been decided by the meeting and had the determination to complete it decisively. In fact, the reason why Tokimune was Tokimune lies in the spirit of devouring the enemy. This spirit permeated from the generals at the front to the general public, and thus the entire nation burned with the spirit of devouring the enemy.

We do not have enough space to detail the history of the Mongol invasion of our country. However, far exceeding what we imagine today, the enemy's momentum was huge, while we were stretched thin and had nothing. In terms of the amount of matter, our Japan was no match. This point is explained in great detail in the contemporary record [Irihatagudōshū]. At that time, Japan had no military organization. Since the Genpei War, it was all about fighting in single combat on horseback. But the enemy had a formation. The brave could not advance alone, and the timid could not retreat alone. They advanced and retreated completely according to orders, and they wanted to encircle the undisciplined Japanese soldiers from both wings. Moreover, the enemy's weapons were far superior to those of Japan. The Irihatagudōshū has the following record:

"Although the Mongol arrows are short, the arrowheads are coated with poison, and death occurs from poisoning upon contact. The spears are long and do not loosen. They are lined up in unison. If anyone approaches, the center retreats, and the two ends come together to form an encirclement and kill them. (Omission) They are light-bodied and good at riding, strong and unafraid of death, powerful and brave, and infinitely free. The command is as desired. The general stands in a high place. If they retreat, they beat the retreat drum. If they are in suspense, they beat the drum of censure. Thus, they advance and retreat without confusion. When fleeing, they fire cannons, causing the sky to be dark and the earth to be black. The sound is loud, causing the heart to be lost, the liver to be lost, the eyes to be dizzy, and the ears to be blocked, and they are at a loss as to where to go. The Japanese army does not care about fame or profit, as if it were a personal victory or defeat. Once the armies meet in this battle, hands and feet move, competing to advance and fearing to fall behind, capturing and killing forward. In this way, the Japanese break through the mountains and the sea, rushing forward alone."

Thus, it can be seen that the Japanese soldiers not only had no weapons, but also no tactics. At the same time, Japan had less cooperation than the other side. This point is very clear in the documents written by Tokimune. That is, in July of the first year of Kenji, it can also be known from the instructions of the Kamakura general written to Ōtomo Yoriyasu, who was changed to the shugo post:

"When foreign robbers came to invade last year, it was often heard that some people advanced to the battlefield but did not fight, and some people called themselves defenders of the territory but did not rush forward, which resulted in the imposition of the crime of great treason. From now on, anyone who does not keep faith will be subject to the death penalty. I hope the people understand this and put it into practice."

Here, it can also be seen that among the lords of Kyushu, some people initially advanced to the battlefield but did not fight, and some even called themselves defenders of the territory but did not send troops to the battlefield. In other words, the army at that time could not be talked about as being loyal and brave. They defended their own territory and did not move. Even if they reluctantly went to the battlefield, they did not engage the enemy. Their attitude can be described as cowardly and conciliatory.

### Method for Restricting the Free Movement of Rice Within the Sales Line in the Urban Area Applies to Entry and Exit of the Blockade Line

The Rice Control Association issued a notice on the 27th of last month prohibiting the movement of rice grains weighing more than eight kilograms. Various sectors found the notice difficult to understand because it did not specify the area. The Central News Agency reporter inquired with relevant parties and learned that the above-mentioned restriction on the amount of transport only applies to the entry and exit of the blockade line in the suburbs of the city. The quantity of rice transported by citizens within the blockade line is not subject to the quantity restrictions in the notice.

### Drastic Price Fluctuations Authorities Conduct Thorough Investigation of Hoarding and Speculation Stimulating Rising Winds

The price of goods in the city has recently been abnormal, especially the market prices of rice and oil, which are related to people's livelihoods, have fluctuated greatly. The Central News Agency reporter recently learned from various parties that this trend is mostly caused by human factors. If there were no capitalists buying in advance and speculators hoarding, there would never have been drastic rising winds. According to reports from the Rice Control Association and the Oil and Grain Control Association,

### This Year's Autumn Harvest is Bountiful in Various Regions

The area along the Yangtze River in Central China is a rice-producing area. Except for the Jiangbei area, which is rich in miscellaneous grains, and Zhejiang Province, which produces slightly less rice, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces are areas with abundant rice production. The annual output not only enables self-sufficiency, but also can be transported to neighboring provinces for relief. Since this summer and autumn, the weather has been favorable. The rice ears are growing very well in Wuhu, Tongxian, Lujiang, Bengbu, Mingguang, and Yuxikou in Anhui Province, Jiangning County, Linghuaiguan in Jiangsu Province, and Wuxi, Changzhou, Jintan, Changshu, Suzhou, Kunshan, Songjiang, the four suburbs of Shanghai, Qingpu, Qingdong, and Punan along the Shanghai-Nanjing Line. The new rice in various regions has been appearing on the market one after another. Compared with last year's harvest, it has exceeded by 30% to 40%. The Rice Control Association has set up offices in various major producing areas such as Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and Wuhu to adjust prices, strengthen the purchase of rice grains, and enrich the needs of household rice distribution in the future. At this time when the new rice is appearing on the market, the authorities are also preparing to enrich household rice distribution. The price of rice should have fallen, but recently it has risen instead. It has been found that local farmers and merchants are controlling the price of rice and are unwilling to sell it, and Shanghai merchants are buying and storing it. According to statistics, the rice stored by Shanghai merchants can meet the needs of half a year. However, this stored rice is all in the hands of wealthy people. Therefore, although there is a lot of rice stored in Shanghai, the poor citizens are buying high-priced rice every day because they have no surplus grain reserves, and they are suffering greatly. It is hoped that the authorities will not underestimate this problem.

### Assist in Thorough Investigation of Edible Oil Hoarding

The market price of edible oil is more than half as high as it was two weeks ago. The reason for this is that the source has been scarce in recent months, but the inventory is very sufficient, which can meet the needs of the city for three months. However, general edible oil merchants falsely report the amount of inventory they have registered and refuse to sell it. The same industry mutually increases the selling price. The Oil and Grain Control Association is now actively trying to request the authorities to dredge the source of Dalian soybean oil. On the one hand, it is collecting funds to purchase miscellaneous grains, preparing to designate commissioned merchants to produce oil production, and planning to unify the transportation and production management of edible oil and miscellaneous grains. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the shortage of edible oil supply and demand in the future. Regarding the crackdown on hoarders of edible oil, the Economic Security Office will also assist in the thorough investigation. It is hoped that the general public will not panic and buy and store at will, and will try their best to suppress the rising winds.

### The Collection and Delivery of Tuition Fees by Municipal Schools is a Set Procedure

Director Dai Issues a Statement The Central News Agency reporter yesterday specifically visited Director Dai of the Education Bureau to inquire about the increase in salaries for faculty and staff of municipal schools and the collection of tuition fees. The reply was as follows: After taking over on September 1, I immediately appealed to the Mayor to increase the salaries of faculty and staff of municipal schools. The Mayor agreed to increase them in September. The bureau has compiled an estimate, which is largely completed, and will be submitted to the municipal government for approval within days. As for the collection of fees from municipal primary and secondary schools, the interim measures were originally handled by the previous Director Lin. They were submitted to the municipal government on July 1, and a notice was issued to various schools on August 16 to comply. Article 15 of the measures states: "Each school shall submit a statement of tuition fee income, along with the middle and stub blank forms of the tuition fee receipts, to the Municipal Education Bureau within one month after the start of the school year (limited to before September 25 in the autumn). Schools that fail to comply with the deadline will have their funding deducted. Funds will only be replenished after the procedures have been completed." Article 16 states: "The tuition fees collected by each school and submitted to the bureau shall be used by the Municipal Education Bureau to formulate a distribution plan, which shall be submitted to the municipal government for approval and distribution." The municipal government instructed that the above measures should be followed. As for the proposal to reserve the collected tuition fees from municipal schools for supplementing and raising the salaries of faculty and staff, according to accounting procedures, they should first be deposited into the treasury, and then a request should be submitted for approval and allocation when they are used, in order to comply with regulations. The Director personally understands the difficult lives of the faculty and staff of various schools, and the increase in salaries for the current semester is being handled. It is inevitable that faculty and staff will have loan advances, etc. Therefore, the above measures have been slightly changed. Schools are allowed to submit 75% of the tuition fees collected before the deadline, and the remainder will be temporarily retained as a loan reserve fund for employee salaries. Once the distribution plan is approved by the municipal government, each school will be notified in multiple batches according to the exact amount to be distributed. This is a factual matter. The request to the municipal government to increase teachers' salaries is one matter, and the submission of tuition fees by each school and then the receipt of funds in multiple batches is another matter. The Director only knows how to perform his duties in accordance with the law. All schools should deeply understand this purpose and comply. Furthermore, the Director has room for research on the past methods of collecting tuition fees. The Director proposes that they should be collected by government banks on behalf of the bureau, which would not only avoid troubling the schools, but also simplify the bureau's collection, delivery, and distribution. This will be submitted to the municipal government for handling next semester.

### Survey of Electricity Consumption by Factories to Begin

Since last month, the Municipal Economic Bureau has been conducting registration of the production and electricity consumption of factories throughout the city, and the progress has been relatively smooth. It is reported that the bureau has sent letters to the Public Works Bureau and the China Central Water and Electricity Company to select representatives to form three investigation teams of three people each to investigate the registered manufacturers. (A) ○ Monthly production volume, ○ Monthly actual sales volume, ○ Consumption per horsepower of each motor per hour (how many hours of work per day), ○ How many items are produced per kilowatt. (B) Types of Investigation ○ Mechanical (including metal repair), ○ Chemical (including medicines, soap, glass, etc.), ○ Food (including bread, rice, noodles, sweets, etc.), ○ Textile (textiles, sweat shirts, dyeing, etc.), ○ Cultural (printing, stationery), ○ Electrical (power poles, wires), ○ Rubber, ○ Sawmills, ○ Tobacco, ○ Laundry, ○ Other. It is reported that the members of the investigation team are all specialized technical personnel who will soon begin to investigate the production factories and provide guidance. Once the investigation is completed, they will be given an allocation of electricity to facilitate increased production.

### Police Inspection Team Departs North Yesterday

They will travel to Manchuria, Beijing, Tianjin, and other locations to inspect police administration for reference. They departed yesterday (the 2nd). During the inspection period, the affairs of the General Affairs Department will be handled by the Deputy Director, Akikazu Nakano, and the affairs of the Deputy Director of the Inspection Department will be handled by Keiroh Tota, an expert in reward and punishment inspection.

### Autumn Holiday Ends, Qianzhuang Resumes Business Today

Following the Mid-Autumn Festival settlement this year, various industries safely navigated through it. Banks, qianzhuang (traditional Chinese banks), and securities markets, having completed their holiday closures, have all reopened for business today (the 3rd).

### Overtime Business Operations: Police Department Penalizes, Iven Thye and Falence Ordered to Close

The Administrative Office of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department has been enforcing restrictions on business hours. Based on investigations by various police precinct offices, more than thirty shops were found to be violating regulations by operating past permitted hours. These shops were penalized according to regulations. It has come to light that in September, over seventy establishments, including nightclubs, dance halls, cafes, and restaurants, were found to be operating overtime. Upon verification, penalties were issued. Specifically, three nightclubs, including Iven Thye, Falence, and Argentina, were ordered to close down and cease operations. Mary Wide was fined. In the dance hall category, six establishments, including Dahua and Xinhua, were warned. In the night garden category, Dumei Night Garden received a warning. In the bar category, five establishments, including the International Bar, were warned. In the restaurant category, forty-two establishments, including the Xin San He Lou, were warned or had their electricity supply suspended. Eight other stores, including Ye Biji, were also warned. It is also reported that if any overtime operations are discovered in the future, more severe penalties will be imposed upon verification.

### Yichang Bridge Repair and Opening

The Yichang Road Bridge, spanning the Suzhou Creek, is the only transportation artery connecting the western district of Shanghai with Zhabei. The bridge's structure is purely wooden. It sustained significant damage during the Battle of Shanghai. As the city gradually recovered, the Japanese military hired workers to slightly repair the bridge and restore traffic to meet transportation needs. However, it has not been renovated in the past five or six years, leading to the increasing deterioration of its components. At the end of 1943, the Japanese Shanghai Naval Special Landing Forces sent a letter to the former First District Public Works Bureau, requesting the bridge to be thoroughly repaired. After careful consideration, the Bureau decided to renovate it. However, due to financial constraints at the time, the original wood was reused, except for parts that were irreparably damaged. Work commenced on July 20th of this year and has now been fully completed. It was reopened to traffic on September 20th, greatly facilitating travel for the citizens.

### Air Defense Authorities Establish Mobile Command Units

In view of the fact that the alarm loudspeakers installed in all public places in the city are not yet complete, and confusion often arises when alarms are issued, the city's air defense authorities are strengthening air defense operations with a firm belief. They have established mobile command units to instruct the public on the use of loudspeakers. In the future, they will seek support from the telephone company to use telephone lines to transmit unified announcements throughout the city via wired radio when alarms are issued.

### Huashan Police Precinct Reorganizes Baojia System

The Huashan Road Police Precinct has completed the issuance of residence permits. Approximately 78,416 people in six Lianbao (joint security groups) have obtained new permits. The seventh and eighth Lianbao will be processed after the application forms are received. The head of the Baojia Section of the precinct was recently transferred from the General Affairs Section of the Lujiawan Precinct, Wu Daoyi. After assuming office, Wu discovered that there were instances of hired substitutes in the Self-Defense Corps within the district, leading to numerous abuses and contradicting the spirit of service. Additionally, most of the Baojia alarm bells in the district had deteriorated over time. He believed that they urgently needed repair and that the precinct should take unified control of them. The head has reported these matters for correction.

### Increased Postage for Parcels and Small Packages

The Shanghai Postal Bureau announced the revised rates for domestic parcels and small packages: "The rates for domestic parcels and small packages were previously announced by this Bureau in Notice No. 1810 on March 3rd of this year. It is now decided that from October 1st of this year, the rates for all domestic parcels and small packages will be increased by 150% of the current rates. The surcharge per package will be increased from 2 yuan to 10 yuan."

### Supporting the Scholarship Movement

In recent years, the most successful social undertaking in Shanghai has been the scholarship movement. "Scholarship" has become widespread, vigorous, and enthusiastically promoted. On one hand, this is due to the efforts and advocacy of the Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao newspapers. On the other hand, it is due to the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life. Contributing money and effort, and cooperating in division of labor, can be said to be a model of grassroots movement. The support from people from all walks of life can be seen in the scholarship donation reports published daily in the Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao. Secondly, there are those who save on customary etiquette to donate to scholarships, and those who contribute materials or skills to help scholarships. Although the methods and amounts of donations vary, the enthusiasm for scholarships is consistent. Observing the widespread and enthusiastic promotion of the scholarship movement further feels like a reflection of the bright future of the country. Recently, Mr. Zhang Bangduo and Mr. Liu Zemin of the Linhua Bank in this city have also enthusiastically supported the scholarship movement by jointly organizing a Chinese and Western music concert with the Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao newspapers. All proceeds from the ticket sales will be allocated to the scholarship funds of the two newspapers. The concert is divided into Chinese and Western music groups. The Chinese music group will be performed by the Chinese Music Research Association on October 2nd and 3rd (today is the last day of the Chinese music performance, tickets can be purchased at the Lanxin Theater). The Western music group will be performed by the National Academy of Music on October 5th and 6th. All performances will be held at the Lanxin Grand Theater, starting at 5:00 PM each day.

### First Day of Chinese Music Performance

Yesterday was the first day of the Chinese music performance. The Mid-Autumn Festival had just passed, and it was already the bleak climate of late autumn. Although the sky was covered with clouds and it looked like it could rain at any time, the front of Lanxin Theater was crowded with people. Most of the ladies came to listen to the Chinese music performance, and at the same time, to support the scholarship movement. At 5:00 PM, the seats at Lanxin Theater were full. At 5:30 PM, the curtain on the stage slowly rose. The first person to meet the audience was Miss Wu, who introduced the program. Miss Wu is the Dean of Studies at Wanlan Girls' High School. She loves Chinese music and came to help today, introducing each program before the performance and briefly explaining the content of the program. Miss Wu not only spoke clear Mandarin but also changed into two very fashionable outfits, giving the audience a good impression and adding to the splendor of the Chinese music concert. The Chinese music performers were all dressed in blue robes and dark jackets, with white-soled black shoes. They looked dignified and carefully played their instruments. After each piece, they bowed to the audience in a courteous manner, giving the audience a good impression.

### Wonderful Performance Captivates the Audience

There were a total of ten Chinese music programs, including ensemble pieces such as [Reminiscences of the Past], [Moonlit Night on the Xunyang River], [Wild Geese Descending on the Sandbank], [Song of Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Coat], [Pu'an Charm], and [Farewell My Concubine]. The ensemble instruments included percussion, wind, and string instruments. The rhythm was harmonious, and the melodies were profound. The solo performances included the Dongxiao solo [Buddha's Ascent to the Temple] and the Seppa solo [Ambush from All Sides], both performed by Mr. Sun Yude. Sun is proficient in both Seppa and Dongxiao and is truly versatile. The Dongxiao solo was accompanied by very dim lighting. It recalled Su Shi's description of the Red Cliff: "like complaining, like yearning, like weeping, like lamenting, the lingering sound lingers on, endlessly," as if experiencing the scene. The Pipa solo [Ambush from All Sides] fully depicted the plight of Xiang Yu at Gaixia in the melody, with a tragic scene. At first, the drums and horns sounded together, the three armies lined up, the generals ordered the soldiers, the teams marched, and ambushes were set. Then, there was a bloody battle, with shouts shaking the sky. Finally, the battle was lost, and the encirclement was broken. The various scenes were vividly conveyed in the strings, as tense as ten thousand horses galloping, and as sorrowful as weeping and sobbing. Sun's pipa skills were very profound, earning him a lot of applause from the entire audience, which was by no means an exaggeration. Secondly, there were two scenes of Kunqu Opera and sword dance, both of which were rare skills. In particular, Mr. Xu Baiqiu, who accompanied the Kunqu Opera with the flute, had a clear and rhythmic flute sound. The reputation of the flute king was by no means accidental. Xu used to accompany Mei Lanfang when she sang Kunqu Opera, but he has not played for a long time. The singers of the Kunqu Opera were three young ladies from the Zhu family, whose singing voices were melodious and well-reputed. The sword dance was performed by Mr. Yao Dami and Miss Pu Yu. Yao was a direct disciple of General Li Jinglin, and his swordsmanship had reached a superb level.

### Promoting and Carrying Forward National Art

The entire Chinese music performance and the two interludes of Kunqu Opera and sword dance have reached a sophisticated level from an artistic point of view. We must promote and carry forward this kind of national art, which has a long history in culture. Unfortunately, it seems that the Chinese people's interest in Chinese music is second to Western music. Western music can certainly be studied, but Chinese music is more worthy of study. It cultivates temperament and inspires wisdom. Chinese music is not inferior to Western music. I hope that those who are interested in Chinese music will work hard for it.

### Grand Opening Ceremony of Taijiquan Training Class

The "Huizhong Fitness Class" organized by our office, temporarily setting up the "Yongnian Taiji Study" group, solemnly held its opening ceremony at 9:00 AM on the first day of the month (previous day) in the auditorium of the Zhongjiao Daoyi Association in Fengyuli, Nantong Road. More than 100 students and guests from all walks of life, including Chen Duomin, Fan Guifu, Zhang Shenzhi, Chen Weiming, Yu Jingde, Huang Hanliang, Zhou Xiangsheng, Li Dexing, Ma Gongyu, and Tang Zuxiang, a total of more than 40 people, gathered together, creating a lively atmosphere. First, Mr. Huang Jingwan reported on the origins of the establishment and the preparatory process, saying: "In this difficult period, the health of the general public is declining. A strong country must first have a strong people. This newspaper has always paid great attention to this issue. This time, thanks to the enthusiastic support of Mr. Chuan Zhongwen, the Zhongjiao Daoyi Association, and social celebrities, this plan can be partially realized. This is the first thing that should be thanked. Since the registration for this group started on the 26th of last month, the number of applicants has exceeded twice the quota in just a few days. I hope you will adhere to the training of [diligence, perseverance, physical shame], work hard and persevere." Then the instructor Chuan Zhongwen and guests delivered speeches. Mr. Chen Weiming said that the effects of Taijiquan are truly incredible. He cited two examples, saying that he had personally seen two people who had contracted lung disease to the second stage. Thanks to the power of Taijiquan, they recovered their health and were able to walk faster than ordinary people. Mr. Tang Zuxiang said that his body was the weakest and most sickly when he was young, but after practicing Taijiquan, his body became stronger day by day. He has not been sick for many years. Taijiquan has similarities with Taoist meditation. Meditation is taking movement in stillness, while Taijiquan is taking stillness in movement, so both have the effect of preventing disease and prolonging life. Mr. Ma Gongyu also said that after learning, he turned from weak to strong, and he can work at his desk all day without feeling tired. All the students were deeply moved. The ceremony ended at about 12:00 PM. Finally, Mr. Chen Weiming demonstrated Baguazhang, Mr. Yang Jie performed Luohan Quan, and Mr. Zhang Qinglin performed Taijiquan. Everyone took a group photo and ate the tea and snacks donated by Guanshengyuan before dispersing.

### Enthusiastic Support for Obstetrics

Mr. Cai Ruoyu wrote in a letter: "I have recently seen your office publishing articles about charitable people donating obstetric aid money. This move to protect human survival is truly the most meaningful, because it not only benefits poor pregnant women, but also has a profound impact on the country and the nation. In response, I am sending 3,000 yuan, which I hope will be included in the obstetric aid fund and actively promoted."

### Mid-Autumn Festival Gathering of Seniors

The Seniors Association held a dinner party at the Zhongjiao Daoyi Association in Nantong Road on the afternoon of the Mid-Autumn Festival, with poetry, music, and moon appreciation to add to the atmosphere. On the spot, Mr. Xue Zuheng donated 10,000 yuan, Shen Xieliying 1,000 yuan, Mrs. Zhu Yan 1,000 yuan, and Mr. Zhu Zhiyao 600 yuan, totaling 12,600 yuan, which was donated to the poverty relief fund of our office and entrusted to be distributed to poor elderly people. We will do so accordingly.

### Weiming Literary and Martial Arts School

Chen Weiming is proficient in literature, calligraphy, and martial arts. He once served as a compiler in the Qing History Museum and wrote a lot. He founded the Zhirou Boxing Club in Shanghai to promote Taijiquan for 20 years, and thousands of people have followed him. Now he teaches students at home and also publishes his remaining manuscripts. He has set up simple rules and fees. Anyone who has literary requests can contact him at No. 1, Lane 690, Yongjia Road, or the Dazhong Bookstore.

### Yangjingbang Sacred Heart Convent Appeals for Relief

The Yangjingbang Sacred Heart Convent, established by the Mumu of the Catholic Salvage Association, has been dedicated to educating children and relieving poverty and disease for more than 70 years. The various schools affiliated with the convent provide free or half-price education to about 4,000 students. The various clinics treated and dispensed medicine to more than 110,000 people last year. In peacetime, they either found ways to earn a living for poor families, or took in their children, providing food and lodging. They provided food and clothing, or a small amount of money, to poor people who came to their door every day. For many years, they have been supported by monthly donations from abroad, and have not publicly solicited donations. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, these donations have stopped, and the convent has no funds to use. Therefore, for dozens of months, the economy has been stretched, and they have felt great difficulty. As the future is long, what can be done? Therefore, they have no choice but to call for help, hoping that all philanthropists will generously donate, the more the better, the less is fine. In this way, orphans and weak women can continue to be maintained, and the virtue can be widely spread, and the merit is immeasurable. If you are willing to donate, please send it directly to the convent at No. 37, Tiantai Road (Old Catholic Church Street), or call 85806, and someone will be sent to pick it up. You can also send it to our office, and we can collect it on your behalf. ○ Opening of Film and Drama School: The Amateur Art Society at No. 1292, Dashanghai Road, offers courses in Peking opera, Western painting, Chinese painting, wood carving, piano, dance, violin, guitar, harmonica, and singing.

### ### Thunderstorm (9)

That night, Takao dreamed of Masato.

In the No. 6 boat sat Masato, Petty Officer Hata, and Takao. Strangely, the No. 6 boat in the submarine school courtyard suddenly started its motor and slid into the water.

"Huh?"

Takao unconsciously uttered a sound. Then Masato's eyes, as if about to pop out, said to Takao with great seriousness:

"You, what are you doing on this submarine?"

Masato's voice was so stern that Takao was too frightened to answer. However, soon Masato seemed to sense that there was no way to salvage the situation and said in a very friendly tone:

"Don't interfere with the work. Hide in a corner! It's very dangerous!"

"Just where is this place?"

"Don't talk! You'll know soon."

Masato only answered that much. And tightly closed his mouth, observing some kind of machinery.

Just then, on the sea surface above, sounds like lava from the eruption of Sakurajima rained down. The vibrations shook the hull of the boat violently. Takao looked at his watch.

"It's the sound of Japanese planes. Friendly boats are also starting to move."

Masato muttered to himself, but soon the lava-like falling sounds grew louder again.

"Don't miss the opportunity..."

Masato, biting his lower lip, showed a calm expression like water on his face. Then, after giving some orders to Petty Officer Hata, the submarine kept sinking, and finally stopped moving.

"Masato... what are you doing?"

Takao thought they had missed the opportunity and shouted loudly, but Masato smiled as usual and leisurely began to play chess with the petty officer.

He didn't know how many minutes had passed.

Suddenly, he noticed Masato jump up.

"Okay, time's up!"

He and the petty officer disappeared. The sound of the machinery started again, and the submarine tilted towards the sea surface.

Takao felt a great disaster was imminent and spat.

Soon, a violent sound was heard.

"Release!" Masato gave the order. After a second or two of silence. Suddenly, a wave seemed to roll up in the water, and a loud sound occurred. Another shot...

After a short while, Masato's face showed great joy.

"Takao! Be happy! The Allison type hit!"

"Great!"

Takao jumped up and said:

"Wait a minute! Before the military report is complete, the mission is not over."

Masato sat quietly in front of the radio station. (147)
