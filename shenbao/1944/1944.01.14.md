### Decisive Battle Imminent

January 9th of this year marked the first anniversary of China's participation in the Greater East Asia War. On this day, the mood of officials and civilians from all walks of life was extremely tense. Judging from the slogans posted everywhere, it was enough to make the general public feel the intensification of the war. Among them, the phrase "Decisive battle imminent" especially made people understand that the current environment is a critical juncture for the entire future of East Asia.

Considering the meaning of the word "decisive battle," on the one hand, it means that the war has reached the time to determine the outcome, that is, the war has reached the most intense stage. On the other hand, it means that once the war determines the victory or defeat, it can be ended and a state of peace can be restored. Therefore, it is necessary to study how to deal with the environment of "decisive battle imminent" to meet the needs of reality and prepare for future construction.

Although China has only participated in the Greater East Asia War for one year, it has been in a state of war for seven years. After participating in the Greater East Asia War, although it has made some contributions in terms of materials, in terms of the entire obligation of participating in the war, what it has done is still mostly flag-waving and cheering. Moreover, the social phenomena in the rear have not reached the level that a nation bearing the mission of war should have, which is a very obvious fact. Shanghai is one of the important towns in the rear. What is the impact of Shanghai on the war? What about the situation in other cities and towns in the rear? In a word, it is nothing more than darkness and depravity. How can the two attitudes of darkness and depravity be enough to cope with the modern peak of war? However, the Greater East Asia War has already laid a solid foundation for victory. After the victory, how will we take credit for it? If we do not take advantage of the day when the "decisive battle is imminent" to strictly rectify the rear, then once in the midst of chaos, China is regarded as one of the victorious countries, at that time we will definitely look at each other, not knowing what to do.

In these seven years, there have indeed been some reforms to the ills before the war, but there are also many who have followed the old ways and even intensified them. Before the war, China was already an industrially backward country. After the war, it was suspended in various ways. While others were born with sufficient conditions, they also made use of the war process to carry out scientific and rationalized rectification, and worked hard with their heads buried, making greater progress in all aspects. For example, in 1942 alone, Germany registered as many as 53,000 patent licenses (see "German Newsletter" published by Bikenheng Book Company), which is already visible. After the end of this war, regardless of how China wins, it will eventually seek the way of co-existence and co-prosperity in East Asia as a member of East Asia. If we do not take advantage of the day when the "decisive battle is imminent" to first strive to eliminate the accumulated abuses of the heavy industry, preserve the vitality of the people, establish the minimum foundation for construction, and establish various plans for undertakings, then there will be no way to make up for the loss, and it will be too late to take measures in the future. How can we achieve the mission that our Chinese nation should bear? "Decisive battle imminent," "Decisive battle imminent"!

### Chen Shi Speaks

Nanjing, Central News Agency, 13th. The National Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Wartime Price Control. Chen Shi, Minister of Industry and Commerce, issued a statement: Price control is the central issue of the wartime economy. The government has always carefully studied and discussed this in order to obtain a reasonable solution. The fundamental countermeasures for price stabilization, such as increasing production, unblocking sources, improving allocation, and conserving consumption, have been formulated and actively promoted, and will be implemented in the near future. As for the management of prices themselves, it is necessary to closely match the times and strive for perfection. The various price control laws and regulations previously implemented were originally temporary measures. With the sudden changes in the environment, they had to be revised. The Provisional Regulations on Wartime Price Control promulgated this time are based on this purpose. The main points of the content are briefly listed below. The competent authorities in various localities, together with relevant agencies, should organize price review committees to be able to adapt to local conditions. Relevant parties and commercial groups should participate in order to enable price review to exert great effectiveness. The categories of materials and items that should be evaluated should be limited to daily necessities first, so as to avoid a large number of categories that cannot be taken care of, and to ensure strict implementation in order to meet the purpose of stabilizing people's livelihood. For other materials and fees, the local economic bureau may consider the situation and draft items. The industry associations shall negotiate appropriate prices and abide by them together. Regardless of the officially set prices or the negotiated prices, the industry associations shall be responsible for supervising the members, so as to promote the spirit of self-governance in the business community. In addition, legal profits have also been prescribed standards, so that the evaluation in various places will not have different phenomena. Furthermore, the purchase of materials at evaluated prices shall not exceed the limit, so as to avoid competing for opportunities and reducing the number of supplies. In short, the main purpose of these regulations is to take the economic cycle as the center, promote the self-governance of industry associations in various places, and use fairness as the principle, so that wartime prices are stabilized within an appropriate range. However, this most important and extremely complex price issue, which has a close relationship with the stability of people's livelihood, cannot be solved without the cooperation of the upper and lower levels. I hope that the economic bureaus in various places will maintain close contact to keep the price changes in various places in a balanced state and jointly assume the responsibility for price control. Industry associations should supervise members to strictly abide by government orders. The general public should recognize the environment and assist in promoting management and implementation measures. If there are those who hold back, hoard, and speculate for exorbitant profits, then the laws are in place and will never be tolerated.

### Japanese Prime Minister Clarifies Key Points of Military Production: Emphasis on Enhancing Air Combat Capabilities

Tokyo, Central News Agency, 13th. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo, also Minister of Military Supplies, addressed the first meeting of the chiefs of military supply supervision on the second day (13th), pointing out that the important mission of the Military Supply Supervision Department is to promote and guide military supply production centered on quadrupling the production of aircraft. He also listed three points for the service of the military supply production administrative organs as follows: The focus of military supply production must be placed on enhancing air combat capabilities, so that it permeates the production aspect. Guide production to fully develop the spirit of struggle. Recognize the actual situation of production and strive to comprehensively develop production capacity.

### Bangkok City Bombed: Thai Prime Minister Broadcasts, Pointing out the Brutal Nature of the British and Americans

Bangkok, Central News Agency, 13th. American planes came to bomb Bangkok on the night of the 10th and dropped many incendiary bombs in the northwest of the city, but the damage was very light. On the night of the 12th, American planes attacked again and bombed temples and streets in the central part of the city. The American planes that attacked twice were immediately fled after being bombed fiercely by the Japanese and Thai armies and anti-aircraft artillery fire. Thai Prime Minister Pibul Songgram broadcast to the nation on the night of the 12th, pointing out the brutality of the British and Americans, with the general idea that: Most of the bombs dropped by the American planes this time were incendiary bombs, causing slight losses to the property of the citizens. The Thai people have now learned about the brutal nature of Britain and the United States. Because Britain and the United States can hardly win with legitimate combat methods, they blindly bomb our country. We can see the world situation. The British and American troops on the Italian front have made no progress, and the second European front has not been opened up. As for the Pacific front, Britain and the United States have made no progress worth noting, only moving on isolated islands at sea. However, these small islands are not important. Therefore, Britain and the United States shifted their gaze and paid attention to Thailand, raiding Bangkok, and ordering their propaganda agencies to make false propaganda to the world, saying, "American planes bomb Bangkok in the air every day and drop many bombs. The enemy troops hardly fought back. The American air raid on Bangkok is as easy as playing golf." However, they do not know that this brutal method is difficult to achieve the final victory. Now that they have destroyed our temples and peaceful facilities, they will one day suffer the retribution of cause and effect.

### Domestic Opposition to US Forced Labor Case

As for whether they are willing to join any labor union, it will be decided by the people themselves. It is reported that American labor union leaders Green and Mowley discussed the case with President Roosevelt on Wednesday. Mowley declared that there will be great opposition to the bill.

### Burma Reforms Local Administration: Country Divided into Four Regions to Streamline Labor and Resources

Burma, Central News Agency, 13th. The Burmese government announced on the 12th that in order to promote administrative efficiency in the spirit of the New Order construction plan, the Burmese government recently convened local officials' meetings in both Upper and Lower Burma. Many government officials attended and held consultations on various important issues. Afterwards, National Representative Ba Maw decided to divide the Burmese administrative region into three regions and appoint local regional officials respectively. In the future, county officials will not need to receive central orders directly, but will directly consult with regional officials on important cases that have a direct impact on completing the war and building a new order, so as to handle them quickly. In addition, after this local administrative reform, Burma will be divided into upper, middle, and lower administrative regions, together with the Shan State region, for a total of four administrative regions. The counties under the jurisdiction of each newly established region and the location of the regional government are recorded as follows: The Upper Burma region has jurisdiction over five counties, and the government office is located in Mandalay. The Central Burma region has jurisdiction over eight counties, and the government office is located in Bassein. The Lower Burma region has jurisdiction over three counties, and the government office is located in Rangoon.

Rangoon, Central News Agency, 13th. The Burmese government announced on the 12th that after deciding to reform the local administrative structure, Burmese National Representative Ba Maw made a statement to this effect, stating that the purpose of the government's decision to reform the local administrative structure is to highly scientize the operation of Burma's abundant labor and materials, actively mobilize human and material resources, and exert its high efficiency. In the past, under British rule, the imbalance in the operation of materials and labor in Burma had reached its extreme. Upper Burma had less material and more labor. In the past, although the British transferred the labor of Upper Burma to the submerged land in the ancient channel of the Irrawaddy River, it completely failed because it was based on exploiting Burma. Therefore, it adopted the policy of Indian labor immigration, which still leaves a hidden danger. We are now deciding on a policy based on science to avoid repeating the old mistakes. Within the scope of the same climate and customs in Upper Burma, we will enable communication between the haves and have-nots. Therefore, even in today's difficult transportation, it will be beneficial to people's livelihood.

### First Armament Conference Solemnly Opened in Nanjing Yesterday: Chief of General Staff Bao Delivers Instructions on Behalf of the Chairman

Nanjing, Central News Agency, 13th. The first National Armament Conference, which is responsible for adjusting and unifying armaments, solemnly opened in Nanjing today. The chairman of the conference is Ye Peng, the vice-chairmen are Chen Changzu and Li Yidi, the secretary-general is Huang Xi, and the deputy secretary-general is Wang Dexuan. At 9:00 a.m. this morning, all the representatives, totaling over one hundred people, gathered at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, and led by the chairman and vice-chairmen, went to Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to pay respects to the Father of the Nation. At 10:30 a.m., they returned to the venue. At 10:40 a.m., the opening ceremony was solemnly held in the sound of resounding music. The arrangement of the venue was very simple and solemn. The central military officers present included Chief of General Staff Bao Wenyue of the Military Affairs Commission, Deputy Chief of Staff Xu Jianting, Deputy Director of the Military Council Fu Shuangying, and Commander of the Capital Garrison Chen Sizhen, etc. After the ceremony, Chief of General Staff Bao first delivered instructions on behalf of the Chairman (recorded separately).

### Chairman Wang's Instructions

Nanjing, Central News Agency, 13th. Chairman Wang (Bao Wenyue, Chief of General Staff) of the Military Affairs Commission gave instructions at the opening of the first National Armament Conference as follows: Today, the Armament Adjustment Committee of this meeting convened military organs, troops, schools, and personnel in charge of military equipment in the capital to hold the first National Armament Conference, which is of great significance. Due to his busy official duties, the Chairman did not have time to attend and participate in the event, so he specially sent Chief of General Staff Bao Wenyue to deliver instructions on his behalf. Weapons are the second life of soldiers, as stated in the soldier's creed, which all our soldiers should understand. The quality of weapons is related to the strength of the army and the prosperity of the country, which is of great importance. This is why the Armament Conference was convened, and I hope that you will study and deliberate in detail, and carefully plan so as to be of assistance.

The Ministry of the Army is the competent authority for national armament administration. It has spared no effort in planning on weekdays. Considering that there are now many types of weapons in various troops, with different calibers, there are many difficulties in combat and replenishment. Therefore, the Armament Adjustment Committee has been established to concentrate the strength of the Ministry of the Army and the repair shops to unify the types and calibers of guns and repair damaged weapons. The central government has already made its greatest efforts to actively adjust and replenish. The troops should especially endure the difficulties of the times, do their best to take care of all weapons, and properly preserve them, so as to shoulder the great mission of this era. If anyone dares to neglect the law or even sell military firearms, they must know that the national law is in place and will never be tolerated, so as to warn the public.

At the height of the Greater East Asia War, ensuring security is the only mission of our soldiers. However, to ensure security, we must strengthen our strength, and we must cherish our weapons. To cherish our weapons, we must cultivate military equipment talents. Therefore, we must pay special attention to how to pay attention to the methods of weapon preservation and research, and how to recruit and train manufacturing and repair talents, and prepare for them in advance.

Since the National Government returned to the capital, all military plans, the replenishment of weapons and ammunition, etc., have been given all kinds of assistance from friendly countries. In addition to gratitude, we should also remember that in this extraordinary period, material resources are difficult, and we should especially cherish them, so as not to fail the earnest expectations. May each of you strive for it.

### Indian People Strive for Independence: Emotions Boil; Famine Severe in Bengal and Other Provinces

Burma, Central News Agency, 13th. After the Provisional Government of Free India moved to Burma, it is now advancing towards the path of defeating the British and achieving final victory. Britain and the United States are eager to launch a general counter-offensive, which is actually a fatal blow. "The time has come for the 380 million people of India to rise up and build an Indian India." The Indian people are well aware of the untrustworthy actions of Britain towards India after the Second World War. Because Chairman Jiangtela Bose arrived in Burma, their enthusiasm for independence became even more boiling, and the power to resist Britain also increased. Recently, the situation in India is extremely unstable. The British army and government have made the maintenance of public security the premise, but no matter how Britain deceives the Indian people or oppresses them in any way, the voices of liberating the people of East Asia and the realization of the Greater East Asia will surely shatter Britain's ambitions. Indian soldiers on the Indian-Burmese border are now being transferred from the front line to the second line and are being closely monitored by the British army. These Indian soldiers have long had a national consciousness, so they deserted from the war one after another. To date, the number of deserters has reached hundreds of thousands. In addition, there is a great panic over food throughout India. Judging from Assam and Bengal, the two provinces that are most anti-British, the situation of Indian people starving to death is endless, and the tragic situation is unspeakable. In Calcutta alone, by the end of last year, there were as many as 10,000 orphans who survived after their parents starved to death. Although the British-Indian government has provided some relief to the people who are on the verge of starvation, the remote areas are beyond reach. The 3,900 villages and 6,000 feeding stations in Bengal Province are hell on earth. Moreover, the British and American joint forces stationed in Bengal and Assam have repeatedly committed atrocities against the Indian people, so the Indian people are full of resentment and are extremely angry. At a time when food shortages are imminent, the Indian government has issued a prohibition order to prevent Indian people from migrating to other places to seek food, while at the same time implementing a food distribution system and forcibly purchasing food from farmers, which has aroused great resentment among the Indian people. As a result, a riot occurred in British Leicestershire, and a total of six British people were killed or injured. In recent times, this kind of riot has gradually spread to the whole of India. Recently, the frequent attacks on military rice warehouses in eastern India are particularly noteworthy. Even more noteworthy is that food transport trains in Assam and Bengal have also been attacked. The frequent occurrence of such events is now beyond enumeration. The British army is taking extremely strict measures and hanging signs with the words "Relief for Refugees" on trains and trucks to avoid attacks. The situation in India is deteriorating in this way. Jiangtela Bose's visit to Burma this time should convey the hope of independence and the situation of practicing independence movements abroad to his compatriots.

### Japan Discovers Rare Metal Mine: Important Raw Material for Steelmaking

Fukushima, Central News Agency, 13th. In order to develop resources buried underground, Japanese authorities have dispatched survey teams to survey various mountains across the country since last autumn. Recently, as a result of the active efforts of the Sendai Mining Supervisory Bureau, a large "Hortum" ore vein has been discovered near Ishikawa Town, Ishikawa County, Fukushima Prefecture. According to reports, "Hortum," like platinum and rhenium, is a rare element and an indispensable raw material for manufacturing special steel aircraft and vacuum tubes for radio communication equipment. Recently, due to the active increase in the production of aircraft, its demand has increased even more. However, in the past, it was only produced in parts of Korea and Malaysia, and there was no production in mainland Japan. Therefore, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, all sectors of Japan have been hoping that it could be produced domestically. Today, this has been realized, and the quality is very excellent. According to the survey, there are vast reserves of about tens of millions of tons near the Shinmei smoke mine that was discovered.

### Enemy Aircraft Raid Kueilin Island

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from a certain Japanese base in the Central Pacific, nine enemy Consolidated B-24 heavy bombers attacked Kueilin Island in the Marshall Islands on the morning of the 12th, carrying out fierce bombing from extremely low altitudes and strafing the island with machine guns. The Japanese garrison immediately retaliated with heavy anti-aircraft fire, repelling them. Japanese losses were slight.

### Kirovograd Region Becomes Center of Major Eastern Front Battle: Fierce Battle for Sarny

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) Huitong News Agency: The focus of the Eastern Front fighting is currently still in the Kirovograd region. Soviet troops are currently advancing towards Sarny, a vital railway hub in western Ukraine, and fierce battles are underway. Heavy fighting is also taking place at the Crimean bridgehead and north of Kerch.

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) Huitong News Agency: In the past 24 hours, the fighting has intensified in the two areas north of Kremenets Vitebsk, where the main thrust of the Eastern Front offensive is located. Northeast of Kovel, the enemy launched a fierce offensive with several infantry divisions, supported by a large number of aircraft and artillery, but failed. In the Dnieper River bend, Soviet pressure from Dnipropetrovsk has not diminished, but has also not achieved any results. Soviet troops are continuously arriving in Kirovograd, and German forces are also counterattacking incessantly. Southwest of Cherkassy, fierce fighting is turbulent and unstable, especially in the southeast and southwest of Pohrebyshche, where the battle lines are increasingly uneven. A Soviet infantry division, a tank brigade, and an artillery detachment were cut off and annihilated there. Only local skirmishes occurred west of Berdychiv and west of Novohrad-Volynskyi. West of Rechitsa, the enemy penetrated the German front line in several places, and the enemy launched fierce attacks in the Vitebsk region all day without success.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) Huitong News Agency: The German military received the latest news from the front line last night: In the past 48 hours, the Soviet offensive launched from the bridgehead northeast of Kovel has made no progress. According to German estimates, the Soviets have concentrated a large force of four or five divisions in preparation for an attack, but the Soviets have not only failed to expand their strongholds, but some areas have also been surrounded.

### Fierce Offensive and Defensive Battles in Southern Italy

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) The German Führer's Headquarters announced on the 12th: Fierce defensive battles continued west of Venafro on the Southern Italian front. German troops engaged in fierce fighting with enemy forces at Cerbara and the heights northeast of the city before withdrawing.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) Huitong News Agency: U.S. forces resumed their offensive on Monday, attacking the German mountain positions guarding the Cassino Plain and the Liri Valley. The focus of the fighting is in the areas of Cervaro and Viticuso, but Cassino. The road south of Mignano was also affected. As a result of the enemy's fierce attack on Monday, they only penetrated the German front line at one point near Cervaro. The next day, the U.S. military greatly reinforced its offensive, attempting to expand it, and finally occupied a ridge northeast of Cervaro. The German echeloned defensive line is extremely advantageous for defense. It is recalled that after the U.S. military occupied Venafro on November 6, it advanced towards the upper reaches of the Volturno River, and its battle line was no more than 25 kilometers long. However, after more than ten weeks of attacking, it still could not break through to Cassino, which shows the foolishness of Anglo-American strategy.

### Fortifications Constructed on the French Coast: 10 Million Tons of Concrete Used

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) According to Huitong News Agency: Various fortifications have been built on the west coast of France, from the English Channel to the Bay of Biscay, using 10 million tons of reinforced concrete. If the trucks transporting this concrete were lined up in a single file, they could circle the equator one and a half times.

### German Air Force Bravely Intercepts and Achieves Great Results: American Aircraft Losses in Attack on Germany Amount to One-Half

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) German forces shot down 136 American bombers in northwestern Germany on the 11th.

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from London, the U.S. Eighth Air Force Command announced on the 12th: On the 11th, more than 700 American Flying Fortresses and heavy bombers, escorted by Thunderbolts and Lightning fighters, attacked northwestern Germany. However, German defenses were extremely strong, and a fierce air battle ensued. In this battle, 59 American four-engine bombers and five fighters failed to return to base.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) U.S. long-range bomber squadrons, under the escort of fighter aircraft on the morning of the 11th, bombed the industrial areas of Halle, Magdeburg, Dessau, and other places in central Germany. The German army bravely intercepted with large squadrons of fighter aircraft, resulting in unprecedented great results. It is reported that when the U.S. Air Force bombed Schweinfurt last October, it suffered a fierce barrage of German Air Force rocket artillery and suffered a disastrous defeat, losing 120 heavy bombers. However, they still did not recognize the power of German air defenses. After the new bomber squadron commander, Doolittle, took office, he forcibly carried out this attack with a large formation of over 300 Flying Fortresses and Consolidated four-engine heavy bombers, under the cover of over 100 long-range fighters in cloudy weather, attempting to penetrate deep into German territory to carry out fierce bombing. However, the power of the weapons is increasing.

### Bombing of Sofia

Sofia, 12th A government statement said: Many buildings and residential homes and schools in the central part of Sofia were destroyed, and the embassy district was also hit, resulting in many casualties.

### General Orbay Succeeds as Turkish Chief of Staff

Istanbul, 13th (Central News Agency) German News Agency: Turkish Chief of Staff General Jamak has retired with a pension. The Turkish government has appointed General Orbay to fill his vacancy.

### Wartime German Home Front Life: Women Join the Production Ranks

Nobuhiko Ushiba, Second Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, served at the embassy in Berlin for a total of six and a half years, starting from the rise of the National Socialist Party regime in 1933. He departed from Berlin on November 13, and returned to Japan via Turkey and the Soviet Union with Ambassador to Hungary Okubo, arriving in Harbin on the 26th. He spoke about the unwavering determination of the German people recently, refuting the propaganda inciting against Allied Germany and dispelling anxieties about the European situation.

### No Anxiety About Food Supply

There is no anxiety about the lives of the German people. Price controls are a model for the world. Compared to the amount of currency, material resources are not sufficient, but inflation has been completely suppressed, astonishing the world. Speaking of food, Europe has had a bumper year this year, so there is no anxiety. The view that there would be shortages due to abandoning Ukraine is wrong. The agricultural products produced in Ukraine only meet the needs of the local troops. Moreover, the German military mainly wants the agricultural products west of the Dnieper River, so even if the German military completely loses Ukraine, there will be no impact. From the perspective of Germany's overall food supply, Ukraine is truly insignificant.

Some people are concerned about the American bombing of the Ploiești oil fields (Romania). Ploiești was only bombed once by American aircraft in the spring of this year, and there have been no continued bombings since then, indicating that bombing Romania is technically very difficult. Moreover, Ploiești's oil production capacity is now one and a half to two times greater, so worrying about the Romanian oil fields is completely unnecessary.

Price controls are proceeding miraculously well and are extremely satisfactory. The rationing of daily necessities is also very smooth. From these perspectives, we do not believe that internal collapse will be triggered in Germany. The allocation of beef has decreased slightly, but recently the allocation of bread has increased to ten kilograms every four weeks, and the allocation of potatoes has also increased by three to three and a half kilograms per week. These figures are the minimum allocation amount for ordinary citizens. Manual laborers receive one and a half to three times that amount.

Laborers are further divided into three categories: the most strenuous laborers, strenuous laborers, and long-hour laborers, each with special allocations.

### Implementing Appropriate Policies

The National Socialist Party is extremely stable. National Socialism and the people are completely integrated. The idea of distinguishing National Socialism from the people is an outdated concept. Today, Germany is able to carry out such a large-scale war because the foundation and organization of National Socialism have been established and are being properly utilized, much like the development of neighborhood associations in Japan. After air raids, the party's special forces, NSV (National Welfare Organization), take on all the work, from cooking to providing clothing. This organization is spread throughout the country.

What is most noteworthy in Germany is youth education and social policy. These two play a major role in supporting the home front. The effects of the Nazi-unique Hitler Jugend education are now also clearly visible. The emphasis on discipline, compulsory obedience, and sacrificing personal interests for the public good in this education is extremely valuable. The military training in the Jugend is also of great importance in today's war. In terms of labor service organizations, all citizens, regardless of wealth, ignite a sense of national identity. The basis of social policy is the existing social insurance system for unemployment, disasters, etc. Since the outbreak of the war, social policy has been even more astonishing, focusing on constant efforts for labor.

Information Department Chief Hirota Comments on Roosevelt's Message: American Manpower Shortages Are Now Evident

Central News Agency: Mr. Hirota, Chief of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, specifically criticized President Roosevelt's message to Congress on the 11th of this month at a regular press conference at 3:00 p.m. yesterday.

Exaggerated Propaganda and Self-Contradiction

Chief Hirota first pointed out the main points of the message's content: America's second production increase plan, ensuring domestic stability. He then said that we all consider the circumstances of President Roosevelt's propaganda for production increases to Congress and the outside world to be a spectacle. Upon investigation, President Roosevelt has always promoted that America's production power is absolutely unlimited, especially for munitions, like an astronomical quantity. Moreover, after the Tehran Conference, the US, British and Soviet plans to overturn the Axis were promoted as complete and about to be implemented. From President Roosevelt's past exaggerated statements and the message to Congress this time, it's not difficult to see the actual situation within America. That is why we are so surprised by America's urgent need to increase production now. The so-called unlimited American production power of the past is like a soldier going to the front without weapons, panicking inexplicably, which is self-contradictory. According to the large-scale propaganda launched by the anti-Axis powers, the reason is that their preparations are insufficient. In particular, in the message President Roosevelt presented, he mentioned the national service law. Originally, to maintain an army stationed overseas, the service of ten laborers would be required. Even if this is realized, it would require tens of millions of manpower. Therefore, America's domestic manpower is even more insufficient, and in the production increase cause, it will encounter extremely great difficulties. From this point of view, it can be asserted that America's manpower is insufficient.

American Offensive Gradually Declining

Regarding the South Pacific situation, the American offensive is gradually declining, and the plan to concentrate on the second front in Europe has not formally begun. The biggest reason is that America's domestic production power has declined. Therefore, President Roosevelt advocated ensuring domestic stability and warning the general public and domestic factions to unite closely as the third year of the war begins. From this, it can also be proved that internal divisions in America are quite severe. The American public has expressed antipathy towards the meaningless world war Roosevelt launched, and this situation is becoming increasingly fierce. Regarding the two proposals to strengthen production and conscript manpower, it is believed that the American people will have even stronger opposition. To prevent popular opposition, President Roosevelt made the aforementioned request for close unity. Originally, the government's policies should be well-received by the people, without the need to request it from the people. Therefore, there is considerable doubt about whether the people will accept President Roosevelt's policies. In addition, the reason for President Roosevelt's message is primarily due to the strong solidarity of Japan, Germany, and the other Axis powers, and their large production power, which worries Roosevelt, so he has no choice but to ask the people to unite to strengthen production and save the crisis. Second, President Roosevelt and the other anti-Axis leaders are employing all kinds of cunning schemes to defeat Japan and Germany. These schemes are nothing more than empty talk and will be impossible to implement in practice. We can review past situations as examples, so the strength of this so-called production increase and unity is obviously weak, and its effect is practically waste paper.

Publish relevant opinions for social review and judicial reference.

### Shen Bao Sixth Scholarship Fund Hopes to Continue Donations: Mr. Li Shiwu Donates 100,000 Yuan Yesterday

Since the launch of the sixth Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Fund, all sectors have enthusiastically responded and generously donated, which is deeply inspiring. However, upon review, the number of students applying for assistance this year has reached more than 16,000, setting a new record for the number of applicants in previous years. The total amount of the scholarship fund for this year was originally set at 3 million yuan. Calculating an average subsidy of 500 yuan per person, it can only assist 6,008 students. More than half of the students will inevitably be unable to receive assistance. Moreover, the current scholarship fund is only over 2 million yuan, making it equally difficult to allocate. It is hoped that people from all walks of life, in view of the large number of students awaiting assistance and the insufficient donations, will generously open their purses and, in addition to their own donations, also encourage relatives and friends to participate in this benevolent act. It would be most fortunate.

Mr. Li Shiwu Donates 100,000 Yuan

Following Mr. Sheng Wenyi's generous donation the day before yesterday, Mr. Li Shiwu, through fundraising, generously donated 100,000 yuan yesterday. Mr. Li is a philanthropist who is enthusiastic about social welfare. His warm sympathy for this newspaper's scholarship fund and his donation of a large sum of money are greatly admired. "Helping students is the greatest kindness, and doing good is the greatest joy." There are many kind-hearted people in society, which further strengthens the belief of the colleagues at this newspaper.

Enthusiastic Sympathy for Student Aid from All Sectors

Yesterday, the Sizheng Hall donated 50,000 yuan for scholarships, the Master of Quzhai donated 20,000 yuan, Yie Ji donated 20,000 yuan, and Song Ji donated 10,000 yuan, benefiting students and deeply admired. Mr. Zhu Ermei, a well-known Western doctor in this city, expressed deep sympathy for poor students and helped raise 20,000 yuan from Liang Yi Ji, 1,000 yuan from Mr. Tan Anhuai, and Dr. Zhu subsidized 1,000 yuan, demonstrating a deep sense of public service and greatly admired. Mr. Xia Guoliang, the Fire Chief of the Eighth District Office, has always expressed compassion for the suffering of impoverished children. He conveyed this sentiment to his colleagues, encouraging them to do their best to provide assistance. As a result, they collectively raised 1,800 yuan of national currency from their monthly salaries, which is truly sincere. Mr. Lu Jinshan wrote a letter stating that he was touched by this newspaper's repeated appeals for the impoverished. Therefore, he decided not to host a New Year's Eve dinner with relatives and friends at the end of the lunar year, given the current difficult times. He specially saved 3,000 yuan from the New Year's Eve dinner expenses and transferred it to the scholarship fund, hoping that enlightened individuals would continue to donate. Mr. Zhao Yin'nian expressed deep approval for this newspaper's scholarship program and specially donated 2,000 yuan of national currency to provide assistance. We would like to express our gratitude to the impoverished students on his behalf.

Students Who Can Afford to Study Should Not Apply

In recent days, this newspaper has received letters or telephone reports from readers, all stating that some students who have the ability to afford tuition also see it as an unexpected gain and participate in the application. Not only is their motivation opportunistic and detrimental to their character, but they also occupy the places of truly impoverished students, which is unbearable. It is deeply regrettable. The establishment of this newspaper's scholarship fund was originally intended to assist outstanding children from impoverished families who truly have no ability to study. Therefore, those who have the ability should not only not deprive those who have no ability of the opportunity to study, but should also provide assistance to the best of their ability. If one insists on taking advantage of the situation for personal gain, it will not be difficult to uncover the truth. Once an investigation is conducted or a report is made by a reader, in addition to holding the guarantor accountable, their name will be publicly announced in the newspaper as a warning to those who take advantage of the situation. Therefore, it is hoped that all students applying for assistance and their parents should carefully ask themselves before submitting the application form whether there is a need to apply. If they can support themselves with effort, they should not apply again. At the same time, this newspaper will definitely conduct a thorough investigation and accept accurate reports from all sectors to reassure the donating readers.

Scholarships Received Yesterday

The scholarships received yesterday are listed below: Li Shiwu (raised by layman Sheng Wenyi) 100,000 yuan, Sizheng Hall 50,000 yuan, Master of Qubao 20,000 yuan, Yie Ji 20,000 yuan, Liang Yi Ji (raised by Dr. Zhu Ermei) 20,000 yuan, Song Ji, Hui Ji, each 10,000 yuan, Zhang Liyun 7,000 yuan, Colleagues of the Huachen Society (savings from dinner expenses raised by Zhang Liyun) 3,000 yuan, Lu Jinshan (savings from New Year's Eve dinner expenses transferred for assistance) 3,000 yuan, Zhao Yin'nian, Jiu Ji, Ru Ji, each 2,000 yuan, all Chinese staff of the Fire Department of the Eighth District Office 1,800 yuan, Qin Yongsheng 1,200 yuan, Chen Yizu (savings from the 90th birthday celebration of his late father transferred for assistance) 1,080 yuan, Tan Anhuai, Dr. Zhu Ermei, Qiu Fenglin, Li Dezheng, Qi Wenyao, each 1,000 yuan, Zhao Kunshan (gifts from relatives and friends for the full moon of his son transferred for assistance) 1,000 yuan, Colleagues of Wu Shile's Tujing Milk Powder and Eagle Brand Condensed Milk 811 yuan, Zhang Yunsheng (gifts from Mr. Wu Shuiyuan transferred for assistance) 500 yuan, Wu Juchuan, Mr. Zhang, each 300 yuan, Landlords of two rooms each from No. 44 to No. 60, Lane 1664, Jing'an Temple Road collectively 300 yuan, Wu Zuoqing 200 yuan, Ningbo Factory Colleagues 150.10 yuan, Zi Ji Wang Yifang, Shi Xixin, each 100 yuan, Qiu Shaozhi, Qiu Tianlin, collectively 100 yuan, Pu Qiting 10 yuan, Pu Fukang, Jie Yuan, collectively 10 yuan, totaling 264,061 yuan of stored banknotes, with a remaining balance of 2,220,5809 yuan.

Comments from the Economic Sector

### Looking at it from Three Perspectives

Since the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange was ordered to resume operations, Chinese stocks have been mainly traded on a next-day delivery basis. Although there was once a plan to change to a one-week delivery system, it was ultimately believed by public opinion to be sufficient to promote speculation and manipulation, and the relevant authorities also considered it necessary to seriously consider it, so the principle of spot buying and forward selling has been maintained until now. Recently, due to the demands of various brokers, there has been a revival of the proposal to implement spot loans for convenient delivery, and there is even talk of implementing it when the market opens on January 1st. Therefore, we would like to continue from our discussion of the convenient delivery issue on November 23rd of last year and look at the future of securities trading from three different angles.

What are these three angles? They are the securities exchange, the brokers, and the public buying and selling stocks. After the implementation of the one-week delivery system, the benefit to the securities exchange is that the expansion of the trading volume allows it to collect more commissions from brokers; the benefit to the brokers is that they can handle the complex delivery matters with ease, and at the same time, they can charge customers more commissions; the benefit to the public buying and selling stocks is that they can buy a large amount of stocks by paying a small amount of margin. Although the benefits obtained from the above three angles are somewhat different from each other, they are the same in that they are benefits. However, can the stock market in the future achieve "calm seas"? I am afraid that no one can be certain! Assuming that it is not possible, the securities exchange can still impose a "sanction" according to Chapter 12 of its "Operating Rules," and brokers can still "love them and want them to live, hate them and want them to die," but the male and female public who buy and sell stocks blindly have no ability to control any environment. If they simply use gambling methods to trade stocks, the result will inevitably be one of two: either make a fortune or throw themselves into the Huangpu River? Therefore, in the future, those who do not treat stocks as an investment but as an object of speculation should be cautious!

### The Year-End Closing Period is Approaching: Silver Firms Adjust Finances, Legitimate Needs Can Apply for Interbank Loans

In view of the upcoming year-end closing period for various industries, the Bank Joint Reserve Committee, in order to adjust the finances of the same industry and stabilize the market, stipulates that member banks and firms can apply for interbank loans by providing property as collateral, in accordance with the interbank lending regulations, if they have legitimate business needs for funds. Each bank applies directly to the Bank Union Committee, and each silver firm entrusts the Silver Firm Preparation Committee to handle the matter, but it must be in accordance with the discount limit stipulated by the committee from November of last year to January of this year, and absolutely cannot exceed this limit.

### Adjustment by the Central Reserve Bank

Exchange Remittance Fee Rate to Increase by Double Starting in January: The Central Reserve Bank, as regional branches and offices are being established everywhere, and its capital is becoming more flexible, its exchange remittance business is becoming more developed. It is learned that the Shanghai branch of the bank, in view of the recent increase in telegraph fees by the telegraph bureau, is adjusting the exchange remittance fee rate. In addition to the postal remittance and draft remittance rates, which will remain the same as before, all exchange remittance telegraphic transfers will be increased by double the original rate, and all exchange remittance handling fees will be increased by double, starting this month.

### Divergent Trends in Chinese Stock Prices: Real Estate Active, Department Stores Decline

Yesterday, Chinese stocks fell sharply in the morning and did not recover, mainly due to the tightening of credit and the excessive rise in the past three days, which made new buyers hesitate. The situation stabilized in the afternoon, and within thirty minutes before the close of trading, real estate stocks suddenly showed their strength. It was rumored that Yongxing had an increase in capital with half of the shares being issued and sent, and other industry stocks followed suit and turned colorful. Finally, real estate and inferior industrial stocks fell across the board. The closing prices for the evening are recorded below.

### Social Service: A Truly Deserving Vocational Supplementary School

No miscellaneous fees or deposits are charged

The Xiuneng Voluntary Vocational Supplementary School, located in the Minli Middle School at No. 414 Weihaiwei Road, is organized by several enthusiastic young educators. The expenses are donated by several school directors. Due to limited finances, they can only rent one classroom for classes in rotation. The curriculum includes Chinese, Japanese, English, bookkeeping, and shorthand, and there are a total of more than 360 students. Bookkeeping is the most popular, which shows the urgent needs of society. They punish vocational youths for their inconsistency, and specially stipulate that three months is one semester. In order to achieve the policy of attaching equal importance to character and learning, they often invite famous figures in academic circles to give lectures on character and professional cultivation. The next semester plans to hire two university professors to serve as the highest tutors in the Chinese and English subjects, and to hire foreign personnel to teach the Japanese subject, in order to improve and enhance the efficiency of the teaching affairs. It is hoped that enthusiastic people in the community can give sympathy and visit their facilities. In addition to not charging tuition fees, the school does not charge any miscellaneous fees or deposits, truly fulfilling the two words "voluntary." ()

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang

Ambition (4)

Compared with Komori, Jinren's character of not admitting defeat belongs to the feminine. He always puts in effort secretly. Even if he was asked to run back and forth to Myoenji Temple twice, he would not talk about it to the teacher. But he also admired Komori's heroic demeanor and straightforward personality. Their group leader Komori, at the same time, Gu Yuhe, who has the same surname as Jinren, Wan Dai, who comes from a military family and is also aspiring to the army, and Takao, a childhood friend, have formed a comrade.

Jinren is welcomed everywhere, but even so, at first there were misunderstandings about his upright attitude and taciturn temperament, thinking that he was "putting on airs." But people who have actually interacted with him know that he has a very cheerful and straightforward personality, and at the same time has a special attractive force. The friendship of this group of little friends continues very closely.

When they started the second grade semester, Ambassador Matsuoka, with a tragic face, returned from Geneva. They had always thought that the policy of their home country, the Japanese government, would cooperate with foreign countries in everything. This time, they heard that they had withdrawn from the League of Nations, and the boys felt a subtle impulse in their chests. Their attitude towards Muguom was like an impression of a silent husband suddenly jumping up from his seat.

"War" is about to break out, right? "The clear-headed Yuhe, inspecting the international situation at that time, said this.

But after a long period of time, the war did not break out, and the short spring of Samo had passed, and it was summer vacation again. In the summer of the year, Jinren's mother had already allowed Jinren to swim, so Jinren felt very happy. Imitating the side stroke, he swam all the way to the "Hayato" of the Kagoshima Merchant Marine School. They ran back and forth naked on the deck, and some people were scolded by the crew for climbing on the rope.

"Good, very good!" Jinren also expressed his agreement, and he never knew that the ship would have such a great charm. Hayato is a medium-sized sailing ship with an auxiliary steam cylinder, which is far from comparable to the large ships of the so-called "sea city." But this is also enough to satisfy the dreams of young people. Jinren felt a kind of envy for Takao, who was planning to become a naval officer in the future—

"Hey, why don't you take the naval academy exam too?" Takao said this while using an unproficient side stroke.

"Don't mention me..." Jinren's voice, because he drank a mouthful of water, was not heard clearly in half.
