### Organize the Masses

Recently, whether from the Chinese side or the Allied side, there has been a considerable understanding of the strength of the Chinese people. This is a good phenomenon. Following the emphasis on the strength of the people is the issue of concentrating the strength of the people, that is, the issue of organizing the people. The Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun said on January 4th: "If the people are not gathered and organized, the National Government absolutely cannot extend its political power and implement its policies. If the policies of the National Government are not implemented, then the rise of fighting spirit and the increase of production will naturally be impossible, and therefore it will not be possible to contribute to the war." This is truly insightful! We have long believed that the foundation of the country lies in politics, and the foundation of politics lies in the people. Those engaged in politics should know that first, the people of the whole country must have strength, and then the country can have great strength. A nation without strength cannot create a strong country, and a government without the support of the people cannot become a powerful government.

Everyone says that the Chinese people are not organized at all, like a heap of loose sand. This is a fact. But the responsibility for this fact lies not with the people, but with the government. We recall that in the past, governments in general tried to destroy the strength of the people because they feared it, and tried to disperse the organization of the people because they were afraid of it. Everything, everything, just led the people down the path of inaction, negativity, and decadence. The result was the destruction of themselves, the destruction of the people, and the destruction of the country. This is the most serious disease in Chinese politics. Now, if this political disease is not treated, its impact will not only be on China itself, but on the entire East Asia; not only on the present of East Asia, but also on the future of East Asia. Therefore, the concentration of the strength of the Chinese people and the organization of the Chinese people are urgent tasks for the entire China and the entire East Asia.

The purpose of any organization is cooperation, and the purpose of any cooperation is survival. Therefore, the purpose of organizing the people, simply put, is for the people to use cooperative methods to seek the survival of the people. Survival is the desire of mankind, and seeking survival through group methods is even more a work that mankind is willing to do. Therefore, we dare to say that if the government encourages the people to organize, then organizing the people is not a difficult task. The only difficulty in organizing the people is not the people's unwillingness to organize, but the lack of strength in the people's organization. If the people's organization does not have the strength to seek the survival of the people, who would be willing to join this organization? How can a powerless people's organization organize the people?

We now dare to formally inform the authorities that if you want the Chinese people to be organized, you should first make the Chinese people's organization powerful. Whether it is the Allies or China, the government authorities should respect the Chinese people's organization and should help the Chinese people's organization seek the welfare of the people. In other words, the government should strengthen the strength of the people's organization. In this way, the Chinese people's organization will have power. In this way, the Chinese people will naturally be able to organize. The people's organization should be voluntary, not forced. The people's organization should be a cohesive group, not a mixed mob. Organizing the people is not a work that can be accomplished with a declaration and a few slogans. Organizing the people is a work of being down-to-earth, going deep into the people, and seeking the welfare of the people.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen's will guides us, "We must awaken the people and unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally to fight together." This year is the decisive year of the Greater East Asia War, and it is the most important period for us to unite with the East Asian nations to fight together. We are willing to raise this issue of organizing the Chinese people, and hope that everyone will pay close attention to it.

### Japanese Naval Reserve Officer Kino and Others Promoted Two Ranks

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - On June 23rd of last year, when sixteen enemy unified-type B24 aircraft divided into several groups and strafed Japanese warships and warehouse areas docked in Makassar Harbor, Naval Reserve Lieutenant Kino Yuji, accompanied by reconnaissance officer Chief Petty Officer Manabe Tsuruo, bravely used a single attack aircraft on the ground to break into the enemy formation, directly charging the enemy commander's aircraft from the front and shooting it down.

### Military Agreement Concluded - 3rd Anniversary - Japan and Germany Congratulate Each Other on Victory

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - Major General Grono, Air Force Attaché of the German Embassy in Japan, considering the 18th to be the 3rd anniversary of the Japan-Germany-Italy Military Agreement, went to the Japanese Army Aviation Headquarters at 10:00 AM accompanied by his assistant Colonel Nemitz to visit General Anada, Director-General of Aviation, to exchange greetings and congratulate each other on victory. The content of his speech is as follows: (Main points of Major General Grono's speech) Since the beginning of the war, the Japanese and German air forces have successively achieved the results of joint operations in the East and West Oceans. Among them, the outstanding achievements of the Japanese Air Force have made the Germans marvel. We admire your country's current aviation industry, and often praise its large production volume and extraordinary organizational progress. In terms of technology, we have seen that your country's production technicians and munitions industry soldiers are smoothly developing a technical warfare production war against the enemy with a spirit no weaker than that of the soldiers on the front line. We expect that with the progress of the war, the Japanese and German armies will defeat the common enemy, the United States and Britain, in the same battlefield. I believe that day will be the day when the two countries' invincible air forces jointly defeat the enemy, the United States and Britain. Here, I wish Japan and Germany to march towards victory under close ties, and pay tribute to the glorious development of the Japanese Air Force. (Main points of General Yasuda's reply) Two years ago today, your country and our country concluded a military agreement. In order to destroy the United States and Britain and build a new world order, Japan and Germany are now launching a shoulder-to-shoulder battle. During this period, your country's air force has repeatedly achieved victories in the European battlefield. We are truly in admiration. Your country's people are not dispersed at all under the enemy air force's brutal and universal bombing, and their belief in victory is even more strengthened. And the munitions factories, not only are they not afraid of the threat of air raids, but they are also gradually expanding. I truly feel the greatness of your country's fighting power. Your country and our country have made various exchanges on air force technology and materials based on the military agreement. This is showing its effect in the operations of the two countries' air forces, which is truly commendable. The enemy's new aircraft from the United States and Britain are no longer to be feared under the close cooperation between the two countries. I hope that the air forces of the two countries will join hands and move towards final victory.

### Philippine Government - Establishes Information Bureau

Manila, 18th (Central News Agency) - The establishment of the Information Bureau by the Philippine government was announced on the 18th.

### Japan Plans to Rush Manufacture of Radio Wave Weapons

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - As the war becomes increasingly fierce day by day, research on new weapons by the warring countries is also becoming increasingly advanced. Because this war is based on science as its essence, scientists and technicians of various countries are also exerting their power to the fullest. Among them, the maintenance and enhancement of radio wave weapons is receiving abnormal effort. The Japanese authorities, in view of the urgent needs of the current war situation, are planning to rapidly produce a large number of radio wave weapons and train excellent technical personnel. The Aviation Academy established through the agreement of the Communications Institute and other related agencies is an agency for the emergency training of such personnel. The establishment plan of the school aims to cultivate the country's technical talents and establish Japanese science and technology. The outline is as follows: The technical level is divided into three types: university level, vocational school level, and secondary level, which are carried out in parallel. Long-term and short-term personnel training are carried out to meet the needs of the present and the future. For short-term training institutions, a radio wave weapon technology training center will be established, with a training period of three months or one year.

### Beijing Correspondence - Amidst the Paper Shortage - Newspapers Implement Mergers - Yun Fei

Beijing is facing a serious paper shortage. Currently, 100 sheets of the most ordinary draft paper already cost more than ten yuan in joint currency. Even toilet paper, which cost only three, five, or six mao per bundle three or four months ago, has now risen to more than two yuan. As a result, book prices have increased dramatically. A Chinese Biographical Dictionary from the Commercial Press, which was priced at twenty-five yuan at a book stall in Dong'an Market in the spring, still felt expensive, but now you can't buy it for one hundred yuan. Under these circumstances, we can see several phenomena:

For a long time, when buying things in shops in Beijing, you have to pay extra for the paper box, and some shops don't even give you paper wrapping.

Inferior paintings from general calligraphy and painting shops have been bought up to make paper, and the price of calligraphy and painting has also risen as a result. A painting that cost no more than two thousand yuan in the spring recently sold for five thousand yuan. Recently, a collector surnamed Zhang from Shanghai came here to search for ancient paintings and bought a silk Zhao Mengfu painting from the Yuan Dynasty for one hundred thousand yuan.

The suspension of newspapers was also recently decided by the government. From January 1, 1944, only three newspapers will be published in Beijing: Xinmin Bao, Xiaoshi Bao, and Minzhong Bao. Other newspapers such as Chen Bao and Xin Beijing Bao will be suspended. This, in fact, is a proper measure, because the news published in various newspapers recently is mostly the same, and there is really no need to publish so many. The authorities also have appropriate measures for colleagues from various newspaper offices. Some of the staff have been placed in the three newspaper offices of Xin, Shi, and Min, and those who are unemployed will be distributed severance pay. It is said that the severance pay for Xin Beijing Bao is as high as 20,000 yuan. Although 20,000 yuan is a small amount, it can also show the authorities' attention. (Confidential, January 8)

### Japanese National Labor Mobilization - Emergency Guidelines Passed Yesterday - To Adapt to the Needs of the War Situation in the Decisive Period

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government held a regular cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's residence on the morning of the 18th. All cabinet members, including Prime Minister Tojo, attended. The main agenda items passed at the meeting included: Emergency National Labor Mobilization Policy Outline; Emergency Student Labor Mobilization Outline; Second Type of Industrial Enterprise Consolidation Measures Outline. At the same time, Minister of Finance Kaya also reported on loan incidents to munitions companies, etc.

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government decided on the 18th during a cabinet meeting on the Emergency National Labor Mobilization Policy Outline and the Emergency Student Labor Mobilization Policy Outline. The content of the outline, which was announced by the Information Bureau at 3:00 PM, is to comprehensively, systematically, and urgently and forcefully implement the labor mobilization of the Japanese people to adapt to the needs of the war situation in the decisive period. The outline is as follows:

### Emergency National Labor Mobilization Policy

Expand the scope of the current national registration and establish a national registration system. Expand the scope of implementation of requisitioning the people. In addition to the existing system of requisitioning based on residence, a new system of requisitioning based on war-related industries will be created. The status of those currently requisitioned and the nature of their work, as well as the methods for canceling requisition during the requisition period, will be flexibly applied to suit the environment. Regarding the labor mobilization of women, fully consider the family system, the characteristics of women, and the enhancement of national strength, and promote and expand it. Therefore, enhance the application of the Women's Volunteer Corps system, and strive to adopt a commuting system from the family aspect. Clarify the target rate of female employment in various industries, factories, and businesses, and rapidly expand the scope of female employment. For the sake of proper labor allocation, order local officials to establish labor supply and demand plans for each prefecture to seek suitable and urgently needed personnel. In order to smoothly and actively mobilize national labor, the National Service Association will be the main body to launch a national movement.

### Emergency Mobilization of Student Labor Policy

Special regulations will be made for factories and businesses where students work to consider the commuting distance, type of discipline, age, and gender. Establish the relationship between the school and the factory, forming an integrated whole. The standard working period is approximately four months out of the year, and they will continue to work for four months. The period may be extended depending on the type of school or discipline. Depending on the situation, factories can be established at the school's location or in school buildings, or materials can be supplied, creating so-called "school factories." The policy is to have students engage in production within the school.

### Tank Battle Unfolds in the Northern Part of the Eastern Front - 21 Divisions of Soviet Infantry Moved to the Front Line

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: Yesterday, the Soviet army, with a powerful tank force, attacked the area south of Leningrad and Oranienbaum, and again attempted to break through the German lines, but the German army foiled the enemy's attempt in fierce fighting. During the battle, the enemy used 100 tanks to assist, and the German army destroyed 69 of them. Yesterday, the Soviet army lost a total of 91 tanks in this battle area.

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to the Huitong News Agency, German military officials revealed that between Lake Ilmen and Leningrad in the northern section of the Eastern Front, the Soviet Union dispatched 21 infantry divisions and several strong tank brigades. Among them, there are six infantry divisions and several tank brigades north of Lake Ilmen, two more infantry divisions further north, eight infantry divisions south of Leningrad, and five more infantry divisions in the Oranienbaum area. German military experts speculate that the Soviet authorities are not satisfied with the progress of the Soviet army in the central and southern sections of the Eastern Front, so they have increased their troops to assist them.

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency military reporter Hantorius said: The winter war on the Eastern Front is intensifying. A few days ago, the Soviet army expanded its offensive range south of Velikiye Luki and exerted pressure on other war zones. Fierce fighting is currently taking place in areas where the enemy is attempting to break through. The Soviet army continues to exert pressure north of Lake Ilmen, and also launched offensives north and south-southwest of the city. The Soviet army is still stubbornly resisting the German attempt to break into the Nikopol bridgehead south of Bologoye, but the next day its offensive power weakened.

### Anti-Axis Forces Actively Preparing to Attack Europe - Braetton Appointed Commander of US Forces

The landing will take place simultaneously in several locations, approximately in the Balkans, southern France, and northern Holland, Belgium, and Norway. The world will witness the most powerful army participating in the most fierce war.

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency: General Wilson, the newly appointed Supreme Commander of the Anti-Axis Forces in the Mediterranean, declared in Algiers yesterday that if the anti-Axis forces have the opportunity to land in southern France, they will never easily let go of the opportunity.

At the same time, he admitted that the recent climate in the Balkans was quite unfavorable for the Anti-Axis forces to risk an offensive. Regarding Eisenhower's belief that the Anti-Axis countries could hope to win this year, when asked if he held the same view, Wilson replied that if fortune helped, we could hope to win this year, but whether we could end the war this year was another matter.

### Clark's Troops Approach Cassino

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency: The 5th Army under General Clark approached Cassino in southern Italy at a heavy price. Behind the city is a huge rock, as high as 1,670 meters. Some US troops have already reached the Rapido River that passes through the city. After the German army withdrew from the Trocciam Mountain ridge, which is about 250 meters high, the famous "Little Gibraltar" has fallen into the hands of the US army, but the progress of the US army is still extremely slow. The roads of the Apennines are muddy due to the melting of permanent snow, and troops and tanks are stuck in the mud, becoming obvious targets for German aircraft. The 8th Army is attempting to deploy imperial troops along the Adriatic coast, but is being blocked by German scouting teams.

### Border Dispute Between Soviet Union and Poland: Soviet Attitude is Firm, London is Greatly Agitated

Stockholm, Sweden, 18th - Central News Agency: Regarding the border dispute between the Polish government-in-exile and the Soviet Union, the former had previously issued a statement expressing extreme compromise. However, the Soviet government suddenly adopted a strong stance at noon on the 17th through TASS, greatly agitating the anti-Axis camp. In its statement, the Soviet government fundamentally denied the proposals of the Polish government-in-exile, stating that there were no diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Poland, and that the so-called border issue was entirely a tactic by the government-in-exile to deceive world opinion. Consequently, British political circles were astonished by this tough attitude of the Soviet Union. According to dispatches from London, Reuters diplomatic correspondent Neil stated that British government authorities expressed great regret over the content of the Soviet government's statement, especially as the Polish government-in-exile was adopting a cooperative attitude and taking consistent action with the anti-Axis camp, making the Soviet government's sudden shift regrettable.

### Third Route Army: Anniversary of Reorganization Commemorated: Celebration Ceremony Held in Jinan

Nanjing, 18th - Central News Agency: General Wu Huawen, Commander-in-Chief of the Third Route Army, joined the peace camp one year ago. Yesterday (18th) marked the first anniversary. The Army Headquarters held a celebration ceremony in Jinan on the 18th to celebrate the first anniversary of the reorganization. Commander-in-Chief Wu Huawen broadcast to the nation from Jinan at 7:40 p.m. that day. In addition, Minister of the Army Ye Peng also broadcast simultaneously at the Central Broadcasting Station. The broadcast speeches of Minister Ye and Commander-in-Chief Wu are recorded below:

Ye's Broadcast

The main points of Minister of the Army Ye's broadcast are as follows: Commander-in-Chief Wu Huawen is a model for all soldiers in the country. We soldiers can only achieve our expected goals by doing things diligently and having correct thinking. Before today last year, Commander Wu felt that prolonging the war was not a good plan, and was inspired by Chairman Wang's great personality, resolutely leading his troops to return and be loyal to peace. Over the past year, General Wu's troops have fought hard against the Communists in the defense area and achieved significant results. His spirit is truly admirable. In the future, I hope that Commander-in-Chief Wu's troops will strengthen their efforts and strive for peace, so as to achieve the mission of revitalizing China and defending East Asia.

Wu's Broadcast

The main points of Wu Huawen's broadcast are: Today is the first anniversary of the Third Route Army's reorganization, and it is also the first anniversary of the dedication to peace by the brothers and 40,000 comrades who have shared weal and woe for more than ten years. If we want to achieve the goal of eradicating the Communist bandits, we must follow the instructions of our supreme leader, Chairman Wang, of "three points of military and seven points of politics" to be completely successful.

The two great historical tasks of revitalizing China and defending East Asia can never be separated. The three key tasks of "purifying political thought," "ensuring security," and "increasing production" are also the same in terms of relevance. In the future, the work of the Third Route Army will follow the instructions of the supreme leader, Chairman Wang, of "resolute battle first," and follow the allied soldiers who have no retreat, with one heart and one mind, and in orderly steps, to move towards the new historical path of revitalizing China, defending East Asia, and cooperating in the Greater East Asia War.

### Legislative Yuan Passes National Construction Bond Bill

Nanjing, 18th - Central News Agency: The Legislative Yuan held its 94th meeting on the 18th, chaired by President Chen, Secretary-General Peng Ximing, (Secretary Zhang Guoren substituting), (A) Reporting matters. (Omitted) (B) Discussion matters, The Finance, Economics, and Legal System Committees of this Yuan jointly reviewed the National Construction Bond case, and resolved to approve it as amended by the review amendment. The meeting adjourned at 12:10.

South Pacific

The essence of the Greater East Asia War is the Pacific War between Japan and the United States, and the decisive battlefield in the Pacific is the South Pacific. This is not only the case now, but will also be the case in the future. Japan's war power is fundamentally based on the combination of resources from the South and the industrial power of mainland Japan. The enemy's war goal is also to break this balance. However, the Central Pacific counteroffensive targeting the industrial power center of mainland Japan is still far away at Gilbert Island, thousands of miles away. Attacks from the Aleutians in the north and the mainland China in the air cannot be ignored. Air raids alone cannot inflict a fatal blow on industrial power, as can be seen from the examples of Germany and the United Kingdom. Therefore, another element of the enemy's war effort is to cut off Japan's access to resources from the South, such as oil, aluminum, and rubber, hoping to inflict a fatal blow on Japan's war power. Breaking into the enemy's strategic circle and suppressing this movement is the Japanese triangular strategic circle, with Rabaul as its apex, connecting the Solomon Islands and New Guinea.

### Prospects for the Pacific War Situation

For the past year and a half, the enemy, the United States, has repeatedly launched attacks, regardless of the consumption of ships, aircraft, and personnel, in an attempt to destroy the Rabaul strategic circle. The enemy intends to recapture Rabaul, remove the threat to the southern supply line, and thereby erode the Dutch East Indies and other important resource areas. Currently, the enemy has first occupied bridgeheads at Cape Gloucester and Cape Gloucester on New Britain Island, and established airfields as a foothold for attacking Rabaul. Under the fierce attacks of the Japanese army, navy, and air force, they are engaged in a bitter battle with the white army garrison in the ancient forests.

However, we must know that although the enemy has landed near Rabaul, New Britain Island has towering mountains, dense forests, and it is impossible for mobile units to advance overland. The supply of this location and the attacks launched from this base must rely on sea routes. Therefore, landing at Cape Gloucester and Cape Gloucester, 400-500 kilometers from Rabaul, is not significantly different in strategic value from landing at Cape Torokina on Bougainville Island, 490 kilometers away, Torlop Island, 500 kilometers away, and Gudonaff Island. There is no need to worry unnecessarily. However, in the South Pacific, where islands are densely packed, each one becomes an air base for the other, and the circles of aerial power are intertwined like dogs' teeth. There is no one-sided air supremacy; it is a decisive battle under so-called "semi-air supremacy." Moreover, due to the inconvenience of land transportation, the replenishment and reinforcement of combat troops, with the exception of a few cases where supplies and food can be dropped from the air, cannot but rely on naval vessels, making it a special battlefield, "a decisive battle for replenishment under semi-air supremacy." This is the current situation of the South Pacific war. To win this war, the most urgent thing is to expand the air power of aircraft, and the next is ships for replenishment.

Indian Ocean

The enemy fleet has already gathered considerable strength in the Indian Ocean. According to the observation of Naval Colonel Moa-Agitz-Bebergde published in the Bosen Daily on December 17 last year, "there are 7-8 battleships, 5 aircraft carriers, 8 heavy cruisers, 8 light cruisers, and in addition, many destroyers and other auxiliary ships." Their numbers are sufficient for a sea battle. Moreover, recently, the British Air Force and the US Air Force have been unified on the Southeast Asian front, with Lee Chuck and Pias appointed as commanders, and surveillance of the northern Bay of Bengal has been strengthened, military supplies have been accumulated, and the number of ships entering and leaving various ports in the Indian Ocean has increased. The enemy's actions in this area are gradually becoming active. In this way, the war clouds in the Indian Ocean are like the silence before a storm, brewing major changes. The people in the rear should prepare for a steel-like posture and work hard in their respective positions to seek war and victory.

### Household Rice Ration to be Increased to 2.5 Sheng from Late This Month: Chairman of the Food Adjustment Committee Issues Statement

Central News Agency: Ji Hua, Chairman of the Shanghai Food Ration Adjustment Committee, issued the following statement regarding the gradual increase in rice rations for citizens: The Shanghai Food Ration Adjustment Committee is the highest management organization for the unified planning and distribution of rice for the Chinese and Japanese people in Shanghai Special Municipality. Its members include the Shanghai Food Bureau, the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Japanese Embassy, the Economic Section of the Japanese Consulate General, the Economic Office of the First District Public Office, and the Rice and Grain Control Committee. The purpose of its work is to solve the fundamental food problem of the people's livelihood and to seek satisfactory supply. Recently, thanks to the cooperation and assistance of Chinese and Japanese military officers and civilians, great confidence has been gained in adjusting rations and ensuring sources of supply. Especially as a result of the efforts of the Rice Control Committee and its lower-level organizations, purchases and transportation have made significant progress, which is a great joy to celebrate. The effect is that the household rice ration for citizens has been gradually increased from 1 Sheng to 2 Sheng since mid-January, and will be further increased to the highest standard of 2.5 Sheng per week in late January, and it will be high-quality white rice. In this new year, the people's livelihood has achieved double the joy of stability. At the same time, not only can the flour ration maintain the standard of 1 catty per week, but there is also a tendency to increase it. The Food Bureau has also distributed the overdue flour from the past, and the problem of people's livelihood has begun to be solved. I am very happy to have this opportunity to report this good news to the citizens. At the same time, I hope that the citizens will deeply understand the various difficulties in rice and grain purchase and distribution and the government's crackdown on the black market. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to practice frugality to ensure the smooth supply of materials. In addition, the quantity of rations in the future can generally maintain the current level. I hope that the citizens will work together to assist the authorities in suppressing the black market to maintain people's livelihood. In addition, the authorities also have detailed plans for the fuel problem, which is closely related to food, and the distribution and elimination of the black market will not be a problem.

Special Ration of Coal Briquettes Increased by One Month's Worth

Central News Agency: Since the end of last year, the supply and demand relationship of coal catty in this city has been slightly imbalanced. The authorities immediately implemented restrictions on coal catty consumption, causing some citizens to panic suddenly and make various speculations. However, since this year, the import of coal catty from North China has been very smooth. In addition to the continued distribution in important industries, the future of coal for general household use is also very optimistic. The authorities, considering that the Lunar New Year is approaching, and the general need for fuel should be higher, have decided to implement a special ration of coal briquettes and other fuels in the near future. For coal briquettes, in addition to the normal ration, an additional month's worth will be specially distributed. The current coal briquette panic can be greatly reduced as a result.

### Registration Certificates for Publications in This City are Issued by the Propaganda Department: Absolutely No Publication is Allowed Before Approval

Central News Agency: The publication of newspapers, magazines, periodicals, or pamphlets in this city was formerly handled by the former Concession's Public Works Department, which issued licenses. Now that the Concession has been taken over, it should be handled in accordance with the publication law promulgated by the National Government. Therefore, the Standing Bureau has decided that from now on, it will be issued by the Propaganda Department of the National Government, and the First District Public Office and the First Police Bureau announced detailed measures yesterday. A summary is provided below:

Proclamation of the First District Public Office

Shanghai Special Municipality First District Public Office Proclamation: Regarding the registration of newspapers, magazines, periodicals, or pamphlets, the former Public Works Department announced Article 4878 on October 21, 26th year of the Republic of China. It has now been decided that from now on, the first provision contained in the proclamation will no longer apply. This proclamation.

Proclamation of the First Police Bureau

"The Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Government's Xuanzi No. 571 instruction states, 'The Publication Law and its implementing rules have been promulgated and implemented by the National Government. The former Public Works Department's proclamation and the newspaper, magazine, and publication registration rules promulgated in the 26th year of the Republic of China no longer apply. The First District Public Office has been ordered to immediately announce its abolition. All registration certificates issued by the former Public Works Department and the Bureau recently should be invalidated from January 15, 33rd year of the Republic of China. The Bureau should also notify all published publications that have not yet applied for registration with the Propaganda Department to complete the application procedures in accordance with the provisions of the Publication Law before January 15 of the same year. Those who fail to do so by the deadline should be ordered to cease publication. In the future, new publications are absolutely not allowed to be published before they are registered and approved by the Central Government, otherwise they will be punished according to law. In addition to separate orders, a copy of the Publication Law and the Travel Regulations is attached to order the Bureau to comply with and report as necessary, etc.' and a copy of the Publication Law is attached. Therefore, it should be complied with. However, the deadline of January 15 has passed. In addition to requesting the Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Government to approve an extension to January 31 in order to complete the procedures on schedule, all publishers of publications are notified to comply and register with the Bureau within the deadline. In the future, new publications must comply with the registration procedures before they can be published. Do not deliberately violate this, otherwise you will be punished."

Talk by Police Authorities

Regarding the procedures for registering publications, a Central News Agency reporter yesterday visited the police authorities and received the following statement: Today, Notices No. 59 from the First District Public Office and No. 12 from the First Police Bureau announced that the registration certificates for publication registration applications were issued by the First District Public Office (or the former Public Works Department). In the future, they will be issued by the Propaganda Department of the National Government. However, when handling this registration, it must still be submitted by the First Police Bureau for verification. Therefore, those who obtained registration certificates from the old Public Works Department and the First District Public Office but have not registered with the Propaganda Department of the National Government should quickly go to the Inspection Section of the Special High Office of the First Police Bureau at No. 181 Jiangxi Road, Construction Building (intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road) on the sixth floor, Room 610 to obtain the application form. After filling it out, prepare four photos of the applicant and submit them to the Section by the deadline. Also, the former Public Works Department registration certificate has been announced as invalid, so the old registration certificate should be submitted to the Inspection Section for cancellation as soon as possible. The above is the procedure for exchanging for a new registration certificate. Those who are newly applying for registration should also handle it in accordance with the National Government's Publication Law. First, submit the application to this Bureau."

Economic Circle

### Commentary: What Should We Regard Chinese Stocks As?

Although the Lunar New Year is approaching, Chinese stocks are still showing a thriving state in a buying frenzy, which cannot be said to be a good phenomenon in the wartime Shanghai economic circle, because the prosperity of securities trading is most conducive to the prosperity of the urban economy, which is beyond doubt. However, this so-called prosperity does not refer to all the abnormal excitement in the securities market, such as the hundred-fold pumping up by stock issuers, the large-scale passing the buck by stock operators, and the chaotic snatching of hats by stock buyers and sellers. It is simply using Chinese stocks as gambling tools, which is by no means a normal indicator of Chinese stocks.

What should we often regard Chinese stocks as? Our answer is: Chinese stocks should be regarded as a legitimate way to develop national enterprises and expand production funds. In wartime, a country's war expenses and production funds are raised through many methods, but in the expansion of production funds, investing in various domestic production securities is the most appropriate way for the public to take. Its active role is to strengthen the power of increased production in wartime. And its passive role is to digest the floating purchasing power of the private sector, which can also be said to be the safest savings. This year is the year of increased production, and we enthusiastically expect it to be the year of Chinese stocks at the same time, because the normal development of Chinese stocks is closely related to the prospects for increased production.

### Silver and Money Industry Prohibits Over-the-Counter Trading of Chinese Stocks

The Silver and Money Industries Association has recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance that after the resumption of business by the Chinese Stock Exchange, all trading of Chinese stocks should be concentrated in the exchange and absolutely no private over-the-counter trading is allowed. According to the regulations, the silver and money industry may buy and sell securities on behalf of customers, but the trading of these securities must be handled by brokers of the exchange. It is reported that the two industry associations have notified their members to comply.

### Chinese Stocks Encounter Selling Pressure at High Prices: New Pharmaceutical Stocks are the Most Stagnant

The amount of circulating shares of Wing On Textile Mill felt increasingly scarce. Tongfeng Printing and Dyeing heard of new plans, and the payment was quite diligent, each rising by 2.5 yuan.

Yesterday, it was reported that he helped to raise 20,000 yuan in scholarship funds from Mr. Lan Ba Sun and 10,000 yuan from Mr. Xu Changchun. The enthusiasm of Mr. Lan and Mr. Xu for public welfare is admirable and deeply respected.

Recently, recognizing the good methods of the scholarship fund, he specially raised 20,000 yuan in national currency, and had it sent to this newspaper and the Xinwen Bao, 10,000 yuan each, through lawyer Gao Yunlv. The gentleman's family is not wealthy; all his good deeds come from savings. His noble character is admirable.

Funeral Gift Money Transferred to Scholarship Fund

Our company, mindful of the suffering of the children of barge transportation workers who are deprived of education, but only recently started business and with insufficient resources, cannot provide universal relief. The board of directors has resolved to allocate 2,000 yuan in Central Reserve Notes from the profits to be sent to your newspaper as a token of our sincerity." The company's concern for the poor and needy is admirable.

Children Sympathize with Those Deprived of Education

Ge, Jiu, Qiang, Nai Ming, and Nai Fen, five children, donated 300 yuan in cash, converted from entertainment expenses given by their parents, to the scholarship fund, sympathizing with those deprived of education, which is commendable. We hope other children will follow suit.

Renovation of Sports Fields

The former Shanghai Western Recreation Ground under the jurisdiction of this association occupies a large area, has convenient transportation, and is centrally located, making it a rare large sports field in the city center. It is now planned to renovate the existing football field, tennis court, bowling green, golf course, baseball field, and hockey field. The swimming pool is damaged and will also be repaired.

Amateur Horse Racing

Horse racing is considered a normal entertainment by countries in the East and the West, and is also a good movement.

### Hoping for the Cancellation of Restrictions on the Use of Ambulances Zifang

Policies or measures that alleviate the suffering of the public and seek welfare for society are called good governance. Good governance benefits the country and the people, and the people always enthusiastically support and assist in all facilities. The sickrooms and ambulances set up by the Fire Department of the First District Office, which are dedicated to serving sick families, have undergone years of careful research and continuous improvement. Not only are the facilities comprehensive and the service conscientious, but they can also meet the psychology of the sick family and adapt to the needs of the condition, and the attendants in the ambulance are all well-trained, treat the sick family gently and politely, and are amiable. The sickrooms and ambulances can be called the best in Shanghai. Anyone who has used the ambulance praises it.

Previously, no matter who it was, as long as it was a sick family or a pregnant woman, it was difficult to move, from home to the hospital or from the hospital back home, no matter what time, late at night, white days, a phone call would arrive quickly and easily.

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, in order to save resources, the use of ambulances has been subject to very strict restrictions. It must be summoned by a formally registered doctor and a certificate must be issued before it can be used, otherwise, it will be rejected. In this way, the general patient feels extremely inconvenient, because most of the use of ambulances must be seriously ill, unable to move, difficult to walk, eager to be sent to the hospital for treatment, no time to delay, or pregnant women with rumbling abdomens, frequent births, three-wheeled vehicles, rickshaws are narrow and unstable, and the wind blows everywhere. With a little carelessness, cold and evil will take advantage of the weakness and enter, and there is a danger of life! Moreover, when the condition is urgent and on the verge of danger, the whole family is panicked, hoping to be sent to the hospital for treatment immediately, and what time do they have to run around asking the doctor to issue a certificate, and then call the ambulance by phone, even when the ambulance arrives, the patient is probably already dead!

The setting up of sickrooms and ambulances was originally intended to benefit sick families, reduce suffering, and save people from danger, with the aim of serving society. If the restrictions are so strict that those in distress cannot use them, wouldn't this be contrary to the original intention of setting up ambulances? It is not only negligent in human life, but also not a way to enrich the citizens.

Therefore, we sincerely hope that the fire department, for the sake of taking into account the suffering and convenience of sick families, and implementing its original intention of serving the public, will quickly lift the restrictions. We must know that saving patients from danger is as important and urgent as putting out a fire! No matter what the situation, there should be no restrictions. Patients should be sent to the hospital for treatment or recuperation as soon as they are called, and should not be deliberately delayed or made difficult. If you think the fare is too cheap, you may as well increase it appropriately, but the most important thing is not to hurt the vitality of the citizens. In this way, not only will virtue be extended to the sick and reduce deaths, but all patients will also be grateful! (Que Chou)

### Navy Aspiration (8) Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

The Jisekikan of the arsenal was also destroyed, and the belongings of the common people were burned. In the midst of the great chaos of the citizens, July 2nd had passed, and on the third day, the fierce force of the wind and rain gradually subsided, and at this time, the British fleet finally began to retreat. Their path was exactly between Mt. Tenpo and the small island at sea, where Shin and Ryufu used to play every day.

There is also a battery on the small island at sea. The soldiers guarding this island, because they did not fire a single shot in yesterday's battle, were itching to try their skills. The chief of the fort here, calling himself Aoyama Foolish, was an old-fashioned Tensan-style artillery expert. Because the British ship was coming from the other side of the island, he stroked the round cannonball with his hand, "Today, I will trouble you," he said to the cannonball.

Moreover, there was also a gratifying expectation. That is, between the small island at sea and the burning cape, three electrically laid mines manufactured by Nakahara Yosuke were buried. The path of the British fleet was pointing in that direction. If they could wait a little longer, it would have an effect. But the impatient battery on the small island at sea had already begun its artillery fire. The British ship suddenly turned and retreated to the Shinse area, fiercely beginning to fight back. One shot hit and seriously injured Inoue Naoiri on the battery. Naohatsu later changed his name to Ryoka, and also received the rank of marshal.

Looking back at the Anglo-Satsuma War, it makes us feel that this war was really the cradle of marshals and famous generals. Marshals Oyama, Kawamura, Nozu, Saigo, Togo, Ito, and Inoue emerged one after another. Among them, except for three who were from the army, the rest were from the Satsuma navy. Furthermore, Rerei Kagenori, Akatsuka Genroku, Ijuin Matsuji, etc., who actually contributed to the Japanese navy, all participated in this battle. General Yamamoto Gonbei, who was only twelve years old, did not directly participate in the war, but also indirectly participated in the war by carrying cannonballs in the rear. From this point of view, the Satsuma-British War not only greatly stimulated the Satsuma clan, but also stirred up a huge wave in the Japanese people's thinking about the navy.

Leaving that aside for the moment, after the British ship retreated to the sea off Ogonezume and completed emergency repairs, it sailed to Yokohama again. Thus, the war came to an end, but the number of dead and wounded on both sides was unexpectedly small. The British side had 13 dead and 50 wounded, while the Satsuma army had only one dead and no more than six wounded.

From this result, it seems that the Satsuma side had won, but the fact was definitely not like this. Not only were the various batteries and the Jisekikan factory greatly damaged, but three steam merchant ships that Mitsu could not produce were also burned.

All in all, it was a war with no clear victor. At least in the war of warships against batteries, the Satsuma side lost. Moreover, they could not help but feel a kind of psychological pressure.

That was the surprising first glimpse of the British warships and cannons. The power of the warship of more than 2,300 tons, with a speed of eleven knots, and the Armstrong guns that fired conical projectiles, made them feel inferior to the enemy's superiority.

Social Service

### Eagerly Awaiting Enthusiastic People to Start a Night University

I am a high school graduate. Due to the pressure of the environment and economic constraints, I had to leave school and go into society. However, this is such a sad thing for me! Although I struggled several times, I always hit a wall. I had no choice but to get a job in a foreign company through a relative, doing what I didn't want to do. However, the desire for knowledge has not disappeared, so I save money every month and still have a surplus, preparing to continue to enter university, but time has become a problem. I can't give up my work, so I'm often worried about this and unhappy. I believe that there must be many young people who are also suffering from this. I hope that all the benevolent educators will have pity on these young people, think about their future, and set up more night universities, with all the courses being no different from the daytime courses. If there is not enough time to allocate, you may as well have classes on Sundays as well. I hope it can be successful soon. (Zihua)
