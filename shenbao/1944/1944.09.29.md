### Avoiding Unnecessary Suffering

Yesterday, we discussed Confucius as a great statesman whose political philosophy rested on [winning the hearts of the people]. He first sought social stability, and then he was able to achieve the complete submission of the people. He started with the two points of [not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality, not worrying about poverty but worrying about instability] to seek [equality] and [stability] in society. He further used the active spirit of [forgetting to eat when working hard, forgetting worries with joy, not knowing that old age is coming] to seek the realization of his ideas.

In fact, the way to govern is to win the hearts of the people, which has been a principle of governance in history, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. It can also be said that those who win the hearts of the people will see their country flourish, and those who lose the hearts of the people will see their country decline, which has been a law of history for any country. In Confucius' time, the state was a monarchy, centered on the ruler, but still emphasized the importance of the people's hearts, because [the people are the foundation of the state]. If the people are not valued, then a country without people cannot stand in the world, which is beyond doubt.

As Mr. Li, the chairman, said in his speech at the inaugural meeting of the China News Association a few days ago: [China is a 'Republic,' and the Chinese government is a 'National Government.' Some even say that 'officials are servants of the people.' Therefore, both objectively and subjectively, the interests of the people must be given top priority, especially the suffering of the people, which should be pointed out in detail, tirelessly seeking details, and prompting relevant parties to pay attention to improvement.] China has always been based on the people as the main body, so the interests of the people should naturally be given even greater importance. Therefore, the object of politics must be the interests of the people. The government is originally a rigid machine, but the active part is the rulers in the government. Therefore, the rulers should go deep into the people. Although they cannot always personally experience the lives of the people, they should at least always pay attention to the suffering of the people and always listen to the opinions of the people. With the feeling of "treating the drowning of others as if one were drowning, treating the hunger of others as if one were hungry," they should plan ways to alleviate the suffering of the people. This is what it means to win the hearts of the people.

However, we are currently at war. The lives of the people in a country at war cannot be compared with peacetime. The lives of the people at war mean enduring hardship and increasing the burden. Indeed, this is a natural and inevitable thing. However, we must also understand that there should be a limit to enduring hardship and increasing the burden. In order to benefit the war and strive for victory, we should grit our teeth and endure hardship in any environment. However, increasing unnecessary burdens and enduring unnecessary suffering in the name of war not only does not benefit the war but also hinders it, because unnecessary suffering is very likely to increase the resentment of the people, which invisibly reduces the potential for victory. Therefore, the rulers should do their best to avoid unnecessary suffering for the people. For example, black market rice at 12,000 yuan per stone is an unnecessary suffering. If the rulers manage the rice policy well, the black market price of rice would not be so high. Another example is the black market for train and ship tickets, where the value is several times higher than the ticket price, even though there is a nominal price, it is impossible to buy tickets. These are all unnecessary sufferings. There are countless others of this nature.

Secondly, talking about war, modern war is a total war, a war of all forces, and a war of production. In other words, every person must stick to their posts and exert all their strength to contribute to the war. Therefore, only with production can there be war, and only with production can there be cooperation in war. However, the current reality is the opposite of increasing production. Production is hindered anytime and anywhere, and even the necessities of life for the people cannot maintain the minimum needs. In that case, cooperation in the war is inevitably just empty talk.

### The Japanese Army Has Completed Interception Preparations in the Palau Islands, and the Japanese Army is Fighting Bravely with a Small Number of Troops on Angaur Island

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - The battle situation in the Palau Islands and Morotai Island is as follows: In the Peleliu Island area, the Japanese army units launched a counterattack on the US troops who had invaded the northern Japanese army positions near the airfield on the 25th. Enemy warships attacking the northeast Koskel Channel of Palau Island invaded the Rutel Wharf east of Peleliu Island and began landing since the morning of the 25th. In addition, reinforcements continued to land near the airfield. In the afternoon, enemy troops on the west coast, with 20 tanks as the vanguard, launched a fierce attack. The Japanese army units are intercepting them and engaging in fierce battles. In the skies over Angaur Island, enemy flares were continuously fired throughout the night of the 25th, and enemy naval gun fire was extremely fierce. The Japanese army on the island is fighting bravely with a small number of troops and doing its utmost to counterattack. On the morning of the 25th, the fifth large enemy hospital ship was discovered in the waters surrounding Peleliu Island and Angaur Island, and it sailed away with the enemy's dead and wounded soldiers. This is the first time that the enemy has used hospital ships to collect dead and wounded soldiers in island warfare in the Pacific Ocean, which shows the heavy losses suffered by the enemy north of Peleliu and Angaur Islands. In the Palau Islands and Koror Island areas, the Japanese army's defensive forces have completed their interception preparations, and the Japanese soldiers are in high spirits, determined to kill any enemy they see and waiting for the enemy to land. In the Morotai Island area, the results of the Japanese army's interception battle were determined on the 25th. According to survivors of the Japanese army who broke into the enemy's ranks, the enemy abandoned more than 300 corpses and more than 300 wounded. In addition, the losses inflicted on the enemy by the Japanese army who have not returned are also quite significant. To date, the Japanese side has lost 4 killed and a certain number of missing. They are continuing to make flesh-bomb attacks and engaging in fierce battles. Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - Since the night of the 26th, the enemy on Peleliu Island has been carrying out landing operations with a large number of landing craft and gradually increasing its forces, attempting to advance northward from the western sea area of the island and the vicinity of the Garderoluk Wharf. They are currently engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese garrison. A part of the enemy forces, under the cover of four tanks, invaded the northern part of the island. The Japanese garrison is currently intercepting them.

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a base in the central Pacific, the Japanese Air Force raided enemy positions on Peleliu on the 27th, inflicting heavy damage. The Japanese planes returned safely to base. The fires caused by the Japanese bombing of the enemy's landing site on the west coast could be seen even in the sky dozens of miles away. According to aerial reconnaissance, the Japanese garrison has built positions in the hills in the northwest of the island and is still continuing to fight bravely. The Japanese flag can also be clearly seen. The enemy troops gathered in the south of the airfield in the southwest corner have been shaken by the fierce bombing by the Japanese planes.

### Japanese Foreign Minister's Broadcast Address

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu made an exchange broadcast with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at 7:20 pm on the 27th at the Tokyo Broadcasting Station. The text is as follows: The world war situation has now entered a decisive stage. The people of Germany and Italy are united in spirit and are exerting all their strength to fight with the belief in certain victory. The people of Japan are full of admiration. At present, Japan is also rising up, determined to bravely advance on the road to final victory. Furthermore, the ambitions of Britain and the United States are becoming increasingly apparent as the war situation enters a decisive stage. Their demands are actually to conquer the world, dominate the world, and make themselves the masters of the world. Their intention is to establish the right to dominate, monopolize the world's resources, and obliterate the existence of the Axis powers. We are fighting to the death to realize the lofty ideals of the Tripartite Pact. Our goal is to ensure that all ethnic groups and countries in the world can find their place, which can only be realized on the basis of lasting world peace. The immense sacrifices of mankind can only have meaning if they contribute to the realization of this ideal. This is our firm belief. The enemy's counterattack is now extremely fierce, and we believe that political strategies will also become more and more important day by day. Our Japan, Germany, and Italy, together with our European and Asian allies, must further consolidate our unity, be aware of the significance of this war, and muster the determination to fight to the end no matter what difficulties we face.

### German Foreign Minister's Broadcast Address

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop made an exchange broadcast with Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu on the morning of the 27th. The text is as follows: Today is the fourth anniversary of the conclusion of the pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy and their allied countries. Fierce defensive battles are being waged on all fronts. The anti-Axis forces have now approached Germany from the east, southeast, and west, while our friendly country Japan is preparing to meet the frontal offensive of the anti-Axis forces in East Asia with powerful forces. The entry of the war into this serious stage is indeed a good opportunity to hone the soldiers and people of the three countries. Therefore, the existence of the nations, homelands, and thousands of years of traditional culture, customs, and habits of the allied countries depends on the outcome of this war. If we make a mistake, the consequences will be worse than anyone can imagine. Recently, the enemy has been loudly proclaiming that they will obliterate the three allied countries and enslave them. The only way for us to eliminate the enemy's arrogant attitude is to gather all our strength and fight them. This is a fact that the people of the three countries are well aware of. Our only path is to advance forward with a spirit of no compromise, no surrender, and fighting to the end.

### Italian Foreign Minister's Broadcast

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - Italian Foreign Minister Mussolini, in his broadcast during the exchange broadcast between Japan, Germany, and Italy, outlined the following main points: The Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy is a great undertaking to eliminate past injustices and establish a new world order, creating a new political system and a new way of life in the East and West. The Tripartite Pact was not signed to cope with temporary political situations, but was concluded in accordance with historical destiny and the highest spirit (the remaining text is incomplete).

### Powerful Japanese Forces Break Through the Border Between Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces, Invade the Yichang Area, and the Chongqing Army is Repulsed

Guangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Japanese army base on the South China front: A powerful Japanese army unit has recovered the treacherous mountainous area on the south bank of the West River, surrounded the Chongqing 35th Division, broken through the border between Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, and crushed the resisting Chongqing army, and is currently approaching a certain area.

The Chongqing army is extremely embarrassed.

Japanese Army Frontline Base, 28th (Central News Agency) - In order to disturb the peaceful area near Wuhan and contain the Japanese army's Guilin campaign, the Chongqing army attempted to dispatch the 5th and 6th war zone armies from Yichang and Jingshan in mid-August. However, after suffering heavy losses and being defeated by the Japanese army's fierce attacks, as Guilin became increasingly critical, it received strict orders from the top to deploy the 94th Army of the 6th War Zone and a large part of the other eight divisions to begin their movements again since September. On the 15th, a powerful unit of the 5th Division of the 94th Army, under the cover of the air force, crossed the Yangtze River and invaded the Yichang area. The Japanese garrison engaged them near Guanyin Bridge on the 16th and annihilated them, causing them to retreat in defeat.

### Rumors of Chongqing Restructuring Within Months

Guangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency) - Expanding on Chongqing news, there are rumors that Chongqing will be restructured within months. The most unpopular officials among the current officeholders are Kong Xiangxi among the civil officials and He Yingqin among the military officials. The motivation for this restructuring is due to the criticism at the recent National Political Council. During the session, the council criticized Kong Xiangxi of the Ministry of Finance, so the speculation that he will be dismissed seems possible. As for the shake-up of He Yingqin, Minister of Military Affairs and Chief of Staff, the inside story is likely not simple. According to another Chongqing telegram, the background of this restructuring is to share the responsibility for completing the war against Japan, so the change of the military leadership is necessary. He Yingqin is a major figure in the self-reliant resistance faction and takes a tough stance towards Yan'an, making him the target of the American-dependent faction. When the United States intervenes in Chongqing's internal affairs, He Yingqin's presence hinders cooperation between Chongqing and the Communists, and he will inevitably be eliminated.

### Three Provinces Rice Grain Marketing Regulations

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - On September 27, 33rd year of the Republic of China, the National Government ordered the promulgation of the Provisional Regulations for the Management of Rice Grain Marketing in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. The full text of the regulations is as follows:

Provisional Regulations for the Management of Rice Grain Marketing in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui.

(Article 1) The purchase and transportation of rice grains (including glutinous rice, rice flour, and broken rice, etc.) in the following areas (hereinafter referred to as controlled purchase areas) shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of these regulations. â (Jiangsu Province) Songjiang, Jinshan, Qingpu, Taicang, Kunshan, Wuxian, Wujiang, Changshu, Wuxi, Jiangyin, Wujin, Yixing, Danyang, Jintan, Zhenjiang, Liyang, Yizheng, Lishui, Jurong, Jiangning, Jiangpu, Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Yangzhong, Taixing, Jingjiang, Rubiao, Nantong, Haimen, Qidong. â (Zhejiang Province) Jiashan, Jiaxing, Pinghu. â (Anhui Province) Dangtu, Hanshan, Wuhu, Hexian. â Nanjing Special District. â Shanghai Special Municipality, Nanhui, Chuansha, Fengxian, Baoshan, Chongming, Jiading. However, the movement within the Shanghai counter-sales line and the movement in and out of the blockade line will be determined separately. (To be continued)

### Japanese Air Force Intercepts US Planes Attacking Manchuria on the MainlandâA Total of 35 US Planes Destroyedâ

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - A large formation of 80 to 90 B29 aircraft of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing again attacked southern Manchuria on the 26th. At around 1:30 p.m., its main force invaded Anshan, and part of it attacked Dalian and Benxihu. The Japanese aircraft carried out interceptions, shooting down and destroying six of them. The Japanese air force destroyed fifteen enemy aircraft along the return route over the Chinese mainland and launched an attack on the enemy base near Chengdu that evening, destroying fourteen enemy aircraft. It can be imagined that the enemy aircraft lost a total of 35 aircraft during this operation, and the strike suffered can be imagined. The skies over Manchuria that day were covered with dense clouds, and the targets were unclear, so the Japanese air force launched a fierce interception, and the enemy aircraft immediately fled in a panic without achieving anything. The Anshan Iron and Steel Works was completely unharmed. The enemy aircraft also did not have time to drop bombs at Benxihu, and only the area near the Dalian Wharf suffered minor damage. The Japanese air force attacked and shot down two (not confirmed) and destroyed four of the enemy aircraft invading dense clouds, and then repelled them. The Japanese air force in China engaged in aerial combat over Guiding and Xinxiang on the enemy's route. They shot down two enemy aircraft (one not confirmed), destroyed one over Bawangcheng, shot down three and destroyed seven near Zhangde on the return trip, shot down one (not confirmed) near Yucheng (near Shaanxi Province), and destroyed one near Xinxiang. They shot down a total of six aircraft (two of which were not confirmed) and destroyed nine aircraft for a total of fifteen aircraft on the round trip. That night, the elite of the Japanese Air Force attacked the enemy air force base near Chengdu in spite of the bad weather. Under the resistance of enemy fighters and anti-aircraft fire, they invaded the base and dropped sure-hit bombs, burning seven and destroying seven aircraft. The intensity of the interception and attack on this day was rare in recent times. However, Private Taguchi of the Japanese aircraft destroyed one enemy aircraft near Zhangde in aerial combat using a ramming tactic and returned to base injured. In this great victory, the Japanese aircraft lost only one aircraft, which is truly an unprecedented miracle.

### Shortage of Skilled Workers

Although companies are doing their best to improve the welfare of workers, in many factories, although the number of aircraft workers has not decreased, approximately 63% of the workers are women, draft failures, and the elderly. Moreover, the number of people with low work efficiency is constantly increasing. The biggest problem in the United States today is discovering skilled workers who [directly] labor, that is, people who can directly manufacture airplanes. Not white-collar office workers with stiff collars [indirect] labor. From January 1941 to August 1942, the Selective Service Bureau recruited 66,000 skilled workers from factories on the West Coast. Now, 58,000 more have been recruited. This accounts for about one-fifth of the workforce. Under normal circumstances, these 58,000 workers produce approximately 800 bombers and fighter planes each month, so the actual loss in production is enormous. Most of the people who are recruited are skilled workers, and their work must be handed over to others. And the replacements can only be women, people with disabilities, and the elderly. As a result, these people can never be as agile and efficient as their predecessors.

Douglas Aircraft Company, one of the largest aircraft companies in the United States, stated:

[The Selective Service Bureau's selection has limited the number of aircraft that Douglas Aircraft Company can build. The second round of replacement plans has further reduced production.]

Finally, it is proposed to further mechanize the current facilities to compensate for the decrease in the number of people. However, the productive capacity of machinery is also nearing its limit. In the first six months of last year, the labor time required to build an aircraft was reduced by 33%. How much labor time has been reduced in the manufacture of military aircraft is unknown. However, manufacturing new machinery also requires manpower. According to the general opinion of the Aircraft Wartime Production Appraisal Committee, which represents the artificial factories on the West Coast:

[Under the current standards of the draft plan, it is impossible to maintain the current production, let alone increase production.]

### The Plight of the Salaried Class

The May issue of the American magazine "The American Mercury" features an essay by Senator Elbert Thomas of Utah, titled "Twenty Million Forgotten Americans." This article exposes the current situation of the so-called "white-collar workers" caught between rising prices and falling incomes. These forgotten twenty million are suffering hardships worse than punishment. The Senate's Education and Labor Investigating Committee stated the following:

[We must abandon the general assumptions held by some politicians. That is, everyone except those in military service cannot abandon the idea of living comfortably during this war. Evidence of this false notion is everywhere. Theaters, restaurants, hotels, and luxurious resorts are all full. Department stores, jewelry stores, and fur merchants are extremely busy. Black market transactions involving beef patties, whiskey, rayon underwear, gasoline, etc., continue unabated. The standard of living is rising, and at least millions of people cannot live stably. This is a fact. However, the wartime profiteering of a small number of people has created widespread wartime poverty. Before the Senate's Education and Labor Committee subcommittee recently investigated the salaried class, anyone would have thought it was a dream.]

The chairman of this subcommittee is Senator Claude Pepper, and the members are James M. Tunnell, Robert M. La Follette Jr., Kenneth S. Wherry, and Thomas. Skeptics say: [Indeed, many people's situations are deteriorating. But in 1943, the total personal income and expenditure amounted to approximately 142 billion dollars. No one talks about unemployment, everyone has a good job, and there are not that many people whose living standards are declining.] Are there really that few? I have undeniable evidence here, which is that twenty million Americans and their dependents have been using their increased income since Pearl Harbor to maintain a minimum standard of living. Their income is frozen, but on the one hand, taxes are increasing, and on the other hand, the cost of food, clothing, and housing is skyrocketing. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the increase in the cost of living since the start of the war is 22.4%. Philip Murray, president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), calls it 50%. The Senate committee admits that while the exact figures are unclear, the incomes of millions of Americans have actually decreased by 25% to 50%. In major cities, a salaried person needs an income of at least $50 per week to live. A single female office worker also needs $30 per week.

### Grand Autumn Sacrifice Held to Commemorate Confucius' Birthday; Secretary-General Wu Presided on Behalf of Mayor Chen

Yesterday was the 2,459th anniversary of the birth of the sage Confucius. All municipal agencies, schools, and organizations followed the usual practice of taking a day off, and the entire city displayed county flags for celebration. At 9:00 AM, representatives from municipal government agencies and all sectors of the city held a grand autumn sacrifice ceremony at the Confucius Temple. Secretary-General Wu presided over the ceremony on behalf of Mayor Chen, with bureau chiefs and directors as assistant officiants. The Municipal Police Bureau dispatched a large number of military police to maintain strict security around the Confucius Temple, while the Youth League was responsible for maintaining order inside the temple. The details are as follows:

### Grand Ceremony

Yesterday, in addition to Secretary-General Wu representing Mayor Chen, the officials who attended the autumn sacrifice included Dai Yingfu, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau; Ye Xuesong, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau; Lu Ying and Su Chengde, Deputy Directors of the Municipal Police Bureau; Pan Da, Counselor of the Municipal Government; Liang Xiuyu, Director of the Publicity Department; Zhou Huarin, Administrative Supervisor of the First District of Shanghai Special Municipality; Zhao Zhengping, President of Shanghai University; Funatsu Tatsujiro, Chairman of the Industrial and Commercial Association; and representatives from various organizations and schools, totaling approximately 300 people. The ceremony's procedures were as follows: âAll attendees stood at attention, âThe chief officiant, assistant officiants, and participants took their places, âThe national anthem was sung (national anthem music played), âThe Showa Anthem was played (musicians), âThe most respectful salute was given to the national flag and Confucius' tablet (three bows), âMusic and dance were performed, âThe chief officiant reported the significance of commemorating Confucius, âA lecture was given (by Mr. Zhao Zhengping), âThe Confucius commemorative song was sung (Confucius commemorative song music played), âMusic was played (bells and drums sounded together), âThe ceremony concluded (photographs taken).

### Commemorative Significance

Secretary-General Wu, the chief officiant, reported the significance of commemorating Confucius, stating in brief: Confucius has been sincerely worshipped by us for more than two thousand years because his academic thought does not change with the times. Confucius' personality, thought, and scholarship were sufficient to inspire the people of our Eastern nation two thousand years ago, and even today, they still have the power to move us. Looking at the extravagant social atmosphere and the tendency of youth to fall into decay today, not only should all colleagues take responsibility, but they should also use the academic spirit of our teacher Confucius to transform Shanghai society. Representatives from all sectors of the city should also share the responsibility and work together to implement it. Next, Mr. Zhao Zhengping gave a lecture, stating in brief that China is an ancient civilized country in the world, and Confucius' doctrine is to promote China's culture more than two thousand years ago. Confucius traveled to various places before the age of seventy, collecting documents from various places. After the age of seventy, he sorted out the documents he obtained. Confucius' doctrine can be divided into three points: âExhaustively investigate the principles of all things and promote spiritual knowledge, âCultivate the spirit of "benevolence and love," âPromote world harmony. Also, it is reported that the Shandong Fellow Association held a grand autumn sacrifice ceremony at the Zhidao Tang Dacheng Pavilion of the association yesterday, presided over by Chairman Cui Jingsan, with all directors and supervisors as assistant officiants. More than 3,000 people, including members, students from Qilu primary and secondary schools, and guests, participated in the ceremony. The ceremony adopted classical methods and was extremely grand and enthusiastic.

### China Railway Increases Fares and Changes Train Schedules Starting October 1st

In addition to the first installment of gold, which was issued by the Central Reserve Bank branch starting on January 5th of this year, the first 1/6th installment of national currency principal and interest was also issued starting on April 1st of this year.

### Mid-Autumn Festival Celebration; Movie Stars and Singers Enthusiastically Participate; People from All Walks of Life Buy Tickets Very Actively

The New Asia First Restaurant, affiliated with the New Asia Company, in response to the Readers' Scholarship Fund campaign, jointly organized the "Mid-Autumn Festival Celebration" with this newspaper, the News Daily. Preparations have been completed. The movie stars and singers who will attend and sing include Zhou Xuan, Bai Hong, Bai Guang, Gong Qiuxia, Wang Danfeng, Chen Qi, Chen Juanjuan, Han Langan, Yin Xiucen, and others, as well as famous singers Yao Li, Ouyang Feilu, and more than ten others. Their singing and dancing will surely be a sensation. Such a grand event is rare in recent times. Recently, enthusiastic people from all walks of life have been very active in purchasing tickets from the Shen News and the New Asia First Restaurant. It is reported that the colleagues and directors of the New Asia Company have already purchased hundreds of tickets, which shows the company's colleagues' concern for out-of-school youth. This can be a model for other enterprises. It is understood that the Mid-Autumn Festival Celebration is purely organized by the New Asia Company in response to the scholarship movement to help out-of-school youth. The admission ticket is 1,000 yuan per ticket, and the New Asia First Restaurant will give a rich tea and refreshments and the Green Treasure Company will also add a serving of iced water. All income from the ticket sales, excluding any expenses, will be donated to the Shen News Scholarship Fund. Such a pragmatic public welfare act is a virtue of the company's service to society. However, it still requires people from all walks of life to generously contribute and actively purchase tickets in order to achieve the goal of completeness. For the price of one thousand yuan, you can not only enjoy high-quality entertainment, but also get exquisite gifts, and even help out-of-school youth. It is a win-win situation.

### Miyamoto Morio Lectures on Current Educational Issues; Third Wartime Academic Lecture Held Yesterday

The third wartime academic lecture jointly organized by this newspaper and the News Daily invited Mr. Miyamoto Morio, a Japanese youth education expert and design committee member of the Nanjing General Assembly of the National New Citizen Movement Promotion Committee, to speak. Mr. Miyamoto recently gave two lectures at Yucai Middle School and the Industrial and Commercial Association to middle and primary school teachers and university and middle school students on youth education issues. Yesterday (28th) afternoon at 4:00 PM, he again lectured on current educational issues to more than 40 university professors in this city at the Industrial and Commercial Association. The main points are recorded as follows: Miyamoto's Speech: [Today is the birthday of our teacher Confucius, and I feel very honored to be able to discuss educational issues with you here. Especially since I am also a scholar who has received Confucian education, the significance is even greater. Education is the foundation of national prosperity. I think you all have this belief. The status of Japan and Germany today can also be said to be the result of education. As for the two words "education", what do they mean? According to the Doctrine of the Mean, "What Heaven imparts to man is called human nature; an accordance with this nature is called the Path of duty; the regulation of this path is called Instruction." It can be seen that the education referred to by the Eastern people is the meaning of cultivating the Tao. However, Westerners have this explanation: "Education is the work of transmitting and expanding culture, and it is also the work of making each person a complete person in society." Summarizing these two statements, we can come to a conclusion, that is: "Education is the work of cultivating and nurturing successors of the country and nation." Because human life is limited, and the life of the country and nation is infinite, we naturally cannot ignore the work of cultivating successors. I personally have a few hopes for education, that is, it is best to be directly operated by the state, and education should not be regarded as an enterprise. At the same time, people in society should not completely push this responsibility to the state, but should try their best to ensure that our nation has the opportunity to receive education. The policy of equal educational opportunities advocated by various countries in modern times is the popular reason for the above-mentioned concept. Since the Meiji Restoration in Japan, education has been very developed. Except for those with physical defects, children have the opportunity to enter national schools, so the enrollment rate of school-age children reaches 99.3%, which is the highest in the world. Since the Nazis came to power in Germany, they also regarded equal educational opportunities as one of the twenty-five policies. In addition to enriching school education, Germany also has youth group organizations throughout the country. The rich have the obligation to donate uniforms and other expenses to the members. This not only popularized youth education, but also added a layer of concern for education to adults. I think that the distance between the rich and the poor in China is too great, and most of the rich are indifferent to education. It is really of double significance for you to run education in such a difficult environment, that is, in addition to cultivating the successors of the country and nation, there is also a profound meaning of awakening the public's awareness of education. There is a Japanese saying called "preaching to Sakyamuni." My lecture today to you actual working educators is really superfluous, please forgive me, and I wish you all success.]

### Inspection Record of the Hangzhou-Ningbo Highway

â Special Correspondent Liu Hanru

Traffic between eastern Zhejiang and the Shanghai area usually relies on the Shanghai-Ningbo sea route. People from Ningbo and Shaoxing only need to board a ship for one night to reach their destination without any difficulty. However, during wartime, transportation is inconvenient, and the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route is sometimes available and sometimes not. In view of this, the Zhejiang provincial authorities tried to rectify the eastern Zhejiang highway, hoping to supplement sea navigation with the highway and open up a main line from Hangzhou to Ningbo. The China Railway Company also operated passenger and freight transportation on the highway, which officially opened on September 3rd. In order to understand the actual situation of this highway line, reporters from various Shanghai newspaper offices formed an inspection team with the assistance of China Railway and went to inspect it. The round trip took eight days, and they gained a general understanding of the situation along the line. Here, I would like to briefly describe the reporter's impressions along the line to inform readers.

### âThe Current Situation of the Hangzhou-Ningbo Highway

The starting point of the Hangzhou-Ningbo Highway is the riverside pier on the Jiangbian side of Nanxing Bridge in Hangzhou, and the ending point is Ningbo. Starting from the riverside pier, it passes through Xixing, Dongxi Xing, Xiaoshan County, Zhuanba, Mojia Port, Yinlong Pavilion, Yaqian, Qianqing, Qinwang, Ruan She, Keqiao, Maitreya Temple, Zunyi Bridge, Xiguomen, Shaoxing, Daobu, Taoyan, Dongguan, Cao'e River Estuary, and crosses the river to Baigong, then passes through Yiting, Wufu, Mazhu, Yuyao County, Shushan, Zhangting, Ye Jia, Cixi County, Hongtang, Zhuangqiao, and other places to reach Ningbo. The entire line is 159 kilometers long. The highway passenger fare is about seven yuan per kilometer. Tickets are currently sold in four sections. The ticket price for the ten kilometers from Jiangbian to Xiaoshan is about seventy yuan, the ticket price for the forty-one kilometers from Xiaoshan to Shaoxing is about three hundred and twenty yuan, the thirty-one kilometers from Shaoxing to Cao'e River is about two hundred and twenty yuan, and the seventy-seven kilometers from Baiguan to Ningbo is about five hundred and forty-five yuan. The total fare from Hangzhou Jiangbian to Ningbo is about 1,100 yuan. There is one bus each morning and afternoon running in opposite directions between Xiaoshan and Shaoxing. In addition to the public buses directly operated by China Railway between Xiaoshan and Shaoxing, there are also small chartered buses operated by private individuals. The fare is more than double the price set by China Railway, requiring 600 to 800 yuan per person. A car can seat six to eight people, and chartering a car costs about 5,000 to 6,000 yuan.

### âThe Journey from Shanghai to Ningbo

If passengers want to take the eastern Zhejiang highway from Shanghai to Ningbo, the general itinerary is as follows: On the first day, take the train departing from Shanghai North Station at 7:30 AM and arrive in Hangzhou at 1:30 PM in the afternoon and stay in Hangzhou. On the second day, take a bus to the Zhakou Ferry to cross the Qiantang River and transfer to a highway bus to Xiaoshan. Have lunch in Xiaoshan and leave for Shaoxing by bus around 2:00 PM in the afternoon. Arrive in Shaoxing before 4:00 PM and stay in Shaoxing. On the third day, depart from Shaoxing around 8:00 AM in the morning and arrive at Cao'e River before noon. Cross the river to Baiguan, which is the jurisdiction of Shangyu County. Have lunch here and wait for the bus coming from Ningbo. Depart for Ningbo by bus around 2:00 PM in the afternoon and arrive around 5:00 PM. It takes three days. It also takes three days to come to Shanghai from Ningbo. Although there are guerrillas and bandits entrenched in various areas along the highway, travelers do not need to worry. In addition to the security teams in each area being responsible for security along the route, the Allied forces also accompany the bus along the way for protection. Therefore, no accidents have occurred since the bus started operating. The roadbed of the highway is built using the old highway and the Hangzhou-Ningbo railway roadbed. The road surface of the entire road is relatively smooth. However, the bridges from Baiguan to Ningbo are mostly temporarily built and cannot carry heavy loads. In several places, passengers must get off the bus and walk, allowing the empty bus to pass.

### âThree Points to Note

Regarding the Hangzhou-Ningbo Highway, we believe that there are three points that the authorities must pay attention to: First, the issue of security. Security along the Hangzhou-Ningbo Highway must be strengthened. Regular troops and security teams should have the full ability to guard the entire line and should not rely on Allied forces to protect the bus along the way. At the same time, the security of the counties under its jurisdiction should also be strengthened to cooperate fully to maintain security. Second, the issue of road maintenance. Building bridges and maintaining the road surface are the urgent tasks of the Hangzhou-Ningbo road. The Provincial Department of Construction should study countermeasures and order various counties to organize road maintenance teams to be responsible for road maintenance in sections. At the same time, technicians should be ordered to collect materials and build solid bridges. Especially the organization of road maintenance teams is a matter of urgency. With the complete organization of road maintenance teams, the highway can always be kept in good condition and there will be no risk of suspending traffic. Third, the issue of transportation capacity. At present, there are only four trucks, two passenger buses, and a few small chartered buses operated by private individuals on the Hangzhou-Ningbo road. The transportation capacity is too weak. After the security issue and the road maintenance issue are resolved, the Zhejiang Provincial Authority and the China Railway Company should quickly seek to strengthen the transportation capacity of this highway, allocate more vehicles, and expand transportation to meet the urgent needs of passenger and freight transportation. The eastern Zhejiang region occupies an important position in the current stage of the war. The operation of the Hangzhou-Ningbo Highway is not only of great expectation to the people of Ningbo and Shaoxing, but also highly valued by Chinese and foreigners in the entire peace zone. It is hoped that the Zhejiang provincial authorities will pay attention to it and ensure that this highway line can bear the important responsibility of land transportation between eastern Zhejiang and Shanghai and Ningbo.
