### After Reading Mr. Lin Junfu's "Letter to Chinese Journalists"

— Chen Binhe

Mr. Lin Junfu, a former reporter for the Japanese Asahi Shimbun, recently published a "Letter to Chinese Journalists" (reprinted in the September issue of "Political Monthly" and the September 2nd issue of "New China Daily"). Because we are Chinese journalists, we paid special attention to reading it carefully. We feel that what Mr. Lin Guangcheng expects from the Chinese press is exactly what we constantly urge ourselves to do.

Mr. Lin's criticism of the Chinese press, from the standpoint and experience of a Japanese journalist, is quite pertinent, which is gratifying. We believe that the worst thing for a person is to be unaware of their own shortcomings and to always hold complacent prejudices. This is also true in the Chinese press. If everyone encourages each other because of Mr. Lin's criticism, perhaps there will be bright progress in the future of the Chinese press. However, there are some points in Mr. Lin's criticism of the Chinese press that we feel need some explanation.

First of all, Mr. Lin believes that the Chinese news industry is factional, so it cannot discuss reality impartially. This is indeed undeniable in the history of the Chinese news industry. However, there are also many newspapers in China that are not factional and oppose factionalism. Taking Shen Bao as an example, for more than seventy years since its founding, it has always been objectively impartial and served the society and culture. Mr. Lin said, "Shen Bao stands on the position of a people's newspaper, and pays special attention to issues related to people's livelihoods, adding its own comments to them." This is correct; but when it comes to: "Under these circumstances, it is easy for excessive arguments to appear in the newspaper," this statement is worth considering. If it is said that Shen Bao, because it stands on the position of the people, advocates innovation in politics, advocates cracking down on hoarding and speculation, and advocates improving the unreasonable control of rice and grain, etc., is a "display of excessive arguments," then does it mean that it is impartial not to advocate innovation in politics, not to advocate cracking down on hoarding and speculation, and not to advocate improving the unreasonable control of rice and grain? We believe that: "Standing on the position of the people, conveying what the people hope for? Conveying what the people need?" This is the mission of the newspaper as we understand it. Frankly speaking, based on the above mission, our past arguments are far from "excessive," and it would be more appropriate to say that they are "too understated!" Please, Mr. Lin, criticize us frankly. After our "excessive" arguments, what kind of impact has it had? Comparing our proposals with the current situation, are our arguments "too understated"?

Secondly, we feel that there are also a few points in Mr. Lin's enthusiastic criticism and requests that need to be explained. (1) Regarding the problem of advertisements occupying too much space, this is the biggest shortcoming of Chinese newspapers. However, for some newspapers that rely entirely on advertising revenue as a source of sustenance, it is quite difficult to demand immediate reform. However, the news section of our newspaper has been trying its best to reduce the space occupied by advertisements and refuse to publish bad advertisements in the past two years. However, we do not forget that we still need to make further efforts. (2) In terms of enriching the content of the newspaper, we also know that there are various methods, and we also know that relying solely on one news agency will inevitably lead to "homogeneous newspapers." But in fact, in today's environment, what other choice do we have besides using the telegrams of one news agency? We have also tried our best to send reporters to various places, but communication is slow, and there are many difficulties. What can we interview? What can we publish? These questions seem easy for today's journalists to understand, right?

We are very grateful to Mr. Lin for providing many valuable opinions regarding the content recorded in Chinese newspapers. However, we cannot ignore the level of Chinese readers and the conventions of Chinese records. For example, Mr. Lin criticized the meeting records as being too lengthy, and talking about rice also included cooking methods. Mr. Lin believes that this is a waste of space, but we believe it is still necessary.

Finally, as Mr. Lin said: "As a guide and pioneer of society, the path of a journalist is broad, and they should listen to the dissatisfaction of the general public in society, and feel it as if it were their own encounter." These words truly grasp the duty of a journalist. Not only should Chinese journalists do this, but Japanese journalists should also do this. However, what is more important is that it is irrelevant for journalists to simply have feelings; they must use their feelings to issue a powerful "resonance" for the voices of the general public in society. This "resonance" is what is called public opinion. And, to the best of a journalist's ability, they can only achieve the level of resonance. As to whether the resonance of journalists can satisfy the voices of the general public in society, it depends, of course, on whether the authorities can value and accept public opinion. To give an example, the general public in society believes that the method of rice and grain control is bad, and our colleagues have repeatedly issued resonance, but whether it can be improved depends on whether the authorities can value and accept public opinion? Leaving aside the Chinese authorities, what about the Japanese authorities? I think Mr. Lin, with his past experience as a journalist, would have the same feeling!

### Supply War on the Pacific Ocean: Japanese Naval Minister Reveals Determination; Japanese Garrison on Wotje Island Bombards U.S. Destroyer

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) — Japanese Naval Minister Minei, when reporting on the war situation in the Diet on the 7th, mentioned the recent activities of enemy submarines, and asserted that annihilating them was a pressing issue for the Japanese military. Since February of this year, the enemy has desperately strengthened its operations in the Southwest Pacific, expanding its forward bases and air power range in that area. At the same time, it officially launched a submarine war, attempting to cut off the Japanese military's maritime communications. In addition to destroying enemy submarine tactics, the Japanese authorities must also strive to maintain the Japanese military's maritime transportation routes, and must rapidly and reliably increase all its combat capabilities. From this, it can be seen that this year's Pacific war situation is the autumn of the supply war. This supply war contains the following meanings:  Reliably transporting the troops needed on the front lines,  Importing combat materials and other living materials from resource areas and the mainland,  In order to maintain these transportation and supply lines, it is necessary to increase aircraft and submarines,  Escorting various ships,  Actively building ships, etc. Transportation and supply operations are actually the most extensive operations. However, Naval Minister Minei has revealed a sure-win strategy and the determination of the Imperial Navy.

Central Pacific Japanese Military Base, 9th (Central News Agency) — The Japanese garrison on Wotje Island in the Marshall Islands continues to bravely attack the U.S. aircraft formations that have stubbornly attacked it day after day, and its morale is becoming increasingly strong. On the morning of the 7th, a U.S. destroyer was discovered, and a fierce bombardment was carried out, hitting several shells. The U.S. ship was immediately embarrassed, and that night it laid down a smokescreen and fled in a panic.

Southwest Pacific Japanese Military Base, 9th (Central News Agency) — On the morning of the 7th, an enemy formation of about 60 large four-engine aircraft attacked the Minado area of ​​Celebes Island. Also, about 50 enemy B24, B25, and P38 aircraft attacked Kao Bay on Palmyra Island on the same day, and 10 enemy B24 aircraft were shot down by the Japanese military, and the remaining aircraft were repelled.

### Japanese Provisional Military Expenditure: Supplementary Budget Approved; Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Clarify War Aims

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) — On the third day (9th) of the 85th Extraordinary Diet session, the House of Representatives opened the budget general meeting at 9:02 AM. First, a closed meeting was held, where the government explained foreign affairs. Mr. Tsurumi Yusuke raised questions about diplomatic issues. Makino Ryozo, Kita Soichiro, Ushizuka Entaro, and Ajishima Shunji Tada raised questions about the essential national system. Murakami and others raised urgent questions about food production. Later, Prime Minister Koiso and other government ministers answered them one by one. The Recommendations Committee held a meeting at 1:00 PM and proposed positive suggestions such as free speech. On the other hand, after the House of Peers received the House of Representatives' supplementary budget proposal for temporary military expenditure, it opened the budget general meeting at 10:00 AM. Minister of Finance Ishiwatari explained the reasons for the proposal, and the Army and Navy ministers explained it. The meeting was temporarily adjourned. In the afternoon, the government listened to explanations of diplomatic issues. After that, Mr. Okawauchi Teruharu raised questions, and Mr. Mitsui Seiichiro expressed his support. After passing it, the plenary session continued to be held. The temporary military expenditure budget proposal was submitted and entered into articles. The chairman reported the progress of the committee. It was unanimously passed. At this point, the supplementary budget of 25 billion yuan for temporary military expenditure was passed and approved on the third day of the Diet session. During the Diet session, the Japanese people's trust in completing the war and the determination to win the Diet have been fully expressed.

Answering Tsurumi's Questions

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) — Tsurumi Yusu, at the House of Representatives Budget General Meeting on the 9th, raised two questions:  Clarify Japan's war aims, which are to defend itself while waging war with force;  Actively launch diplomatic offensives. Prime Minister Koiso and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu respectively clarified Japan's war aims, which are one for defense, two for liberation, and three for the establishment of peace,  A war to eliminate the monopoly system, and replied as follows:

Prime Minister Koiso

The United States' Pacific policy has always been a war of aggression. Although they occupy Hawaii and the Philippines, they still feel insufficient. They are hostile to Japan, which is located in the center of Asia. They have repeatedly suppressed Japan with the ABCD encirclement line. This is the cause of the Greater East Asia War. Japan's aim has been to defend itself as a fundamental spirit. The Emperor has repeatedly told the people that Japan has precedents for going out to conquer, but they all came from defense, and were never for the sake of Japan's own prosperity and development. The spirit of our Emperor can only be realized if all nations get what they deserve.

Foreign Minister Shigemitsu

The purpose of war lies in viewing the spirit of war. This is the spirit of gathering the people and making them tend towards Greater East Asia, which may become a great weapon for the world. The Japanese people all know that the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia are currently engaged in a war for self-preservation and self-defense. Even the enemy people are gradually understanding this point. The United States challenged Japan, causing this Pacific War. Even Britain admits that Japan's war aims have always been self-preservation and self-defense. The purpose of the Japanese Empire's war is to crush the monopoly system, so that all nations in the world can get what they deserve. The purpose of building Greater East Asia has already been clearly explained in the Greater East Asia Declaration in the five major principles, which is why we established the belief that the Greater East Asia War will be won. Regarding

The China Issue

The United States now says that it is fighting to aid China. But is it really helping China? The American military bases in various parts of China are good examples of their sacrifices. It is no exaggeration to say that they are now engaged in a colonial war. The people of East Asia should recognize this in detail and protect their own countries. The United States has always aimed to dominate the world. Here, we can more clearly recognize that the current war is a war of self-preservation and self-defense and a war of colonial imperialism. Their so-called aid to Chongqing is carried out with this kind of imperialistic ambition, but it is only a means of utilization. Nelson and Harley, who were recently sent to Chongqing, still have the purpose of aggression. Japan is completely out to

Cooperate and Harmonize With Greater East Asia

The various ethnic groups have no ambition for territory. Judging from the fact that China is now completely autonomous, it can be clearly understood that China must wait for the Chinese to decide for themselves. Today is the most important opportunity for the Chinese people. We hope to quickly promote their rise.

Korean Railway to be Converted to Double Track

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) — At the budget general meeting held by the Japanese House of Representatives on the 9th, Mr. Kogure raised a question about strengthening the Korean railway in order to quickly send materials from China and Manchuria to the mainland. Prime Minister Koiso answered as follows: Compared with maritime transport, railway transport via Korea has now been strengthened. Currently, one-sixth of the transport volume of the Korean railway is for transporting goods to the mainland. However, a part of the Korean railway is still single-track. If we want to further strengthen the transport capacity, we must convert the entire Korean railway to double-track. Therefore, it has recently been decided to transfer a part of the South Manchurian Railway facilities south of Fengtian to Korea.

Japanese Forces Strengthened on the Yunnan-Salween Front

Chongqing Expeditionary Force's Offensive is Obstructed

Salween River, 9th (Central News Agency) — The Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force is active on both sides of the Salween River. Since it has strong forces and excellent equipment, it blindly believes that it can open the Ledo Road. Since the beginning of May, it has surrounded the key points of Tengyue and Longling. For more than four months, it has been obstructed by the Japanese army's valiant fighting and solid defense, and it has suffered losses without making any progress. Recently, the Japanese army has received reinforcements. It first attacked the Chongqing 11th Army Group, which was surrounding Longling. It has now broken through a part of the encirclement network. The Japanese army at the key points is resolutely fighting head-on against the Chongqing army's offensive under the command and supervision of the U.S. military. The fierce battle continues day and night. For example, the Japanese army in Mengduo stubbornly defends with few soldiers. When ammunition is insufficient, it engages in a heroic bayonet fight with the stubborn enemy, and always defends the defense area. The Japanese army defending Tengyue has been holding on to the isolated city under the enemy's fierce artillery fire for more than two months. In addition, the enemy's 5th Division in the Longling area has been trying its best to recapture Longling since July 7, but under the Japanese army's fierce resistance, there have been many deaths, and the hope of recapturing Longling has finally become a pipe dream. The Japanese army's operations on the Salween River front are of great importance. The Chongqing army's offensive this time is mainly based on a large air supply line, relying on the air supply of the Chongqing-U.S. air force. However, due to the valiant fighting of the air force, the Chongqing-U.S. air force has suffered too many losses. In recent days, the Chongqing army's supplies on the Salween River front have entered a difficult path, and its attack power has also declined day by day. At present, the Japanese army's forces are gradually increasing and turning to the offensive. Therefore, the wavering of the Yunnan Expeditionary Force is only a matter of time.

Jiang Frontline, 9th (Central News Agency) — The Chongqing 11th Army Group, surrounding Longling, with the main forces of the 76th, 9th, 33rd, and 23rd divisions, has been blindly attacking the Japanese army at Xiaosong Mountain since the 1st. The Japanese army in that area still secures its position and seizes an important high ground on the south side of Nengling. It is currently continuing to fiercely attack the troops of another high ground.

Japanese Forces Intercept U.S. Aircraft Near Kaifeng and Zhangde

Sixteen Aircraft Shot Down

Japanese Military Base, 9th (Central News Agency) — On the afternoon of the 8th, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing used B29 aircraft as its main force to bomb Anshan and Benxihu in Manchuria, and three aircraft were shot down by the Japanese military. It is reported that the Japanese air force team chased the U.S. B29 aircraft formation for about 30 minutes in the sky near Kaifeng, Henan at 0:08 PM on the same day, destroying eight of them. Four of them caught fire and fled south. In addition, the Japanese air force team, which was waiting for the U.S. aircraft to return from bombing, also intercepted the B29 aircraft group in the sky near Zhangde, Henan Province, shooting down three of them (one of which has not been confirmed) and destroying one. The Japanese side had no losses. It is now judged that the Japanese military's results were six aircraft shot down (one of which has not been confirmed) and ten aircraft destroyed (four of which caught fire), for a total of sixteen aircraft shot down and destroyed.

Japanese Forces Advance into Guangxi Province, Occupy Dongan and Xinning

Japanese Air Force Rapidly Attacks Baoqing

Hankou, 9th (Central News Agency) — According to a message from the Japanese army base on the Hunan front, the elite Japanese troops are advancing fiercely into Guangxi Province. On the 7th, they completely occupied Lingling City. Another unit, in response, captured Dongan, a key point 35 miles west of Lingling on the border of Guangxi Province, and broke through the mountains on the border of Hunan and Guangxi Provinces, defeating the local Chongqing army. On the morning of the 8th, they occupied Xinning, a key point 70 kilometers west of Lingling. Therefore, the Japanese army's breakthrough of the provincial border is only a matter of time.

Japanese Frontline Aircraft Base, 9th (Central News Agency) — The Japanese air force, which is active on the front line in Hunan, rapidly attacked Shiqing at dawn on the 7th, destroying military facilities and airport facilities in the city. Also, at about 1:00 PM on the same day, they shot down a Chongqing B-25 aircraft in the sky near Lingling.

U.S. Aircraft Invade Xinxiang and Other Places

Beiping, 9th (Central News Agency) — The Japanese military authorities in North China announced at 9:00 AM on the 8th:  On the 8th, about 80 U.S. bombers passed through North China to Manchuria, and it was confirmed that about 46 of them flew back.  Several U.S. B-25 aircraft attacked Xinxiang, Zhengzhou, and Dezhou on the 8th, injuring more than ten Chinese and Japanese people, and several barracks were destroyed. The Japanese side shot down and destroyed one B-29 aircraft each.

Chongqing Aircraft Drop Leaflets in Guangdong

Guangzhou, 9th (Central News Agency) — Recently, Chongqing aircraft have indiscriminately bombed the Guangzhou area, and the people have suffered heavy losses, which has caused extreme anger. When bombing Xiguan, Guangzhou on the 7th, many leaflets were dropped, bearing the name "Chinese Air Force 14th Squadron," which was a letter to the people in the peaceful area. The content showed the Chongqing Air Force's resentment towards the U.S. Air Force. It said: Fellow compatriots in the peaceful area, since the establishment of the U.S. Air Force in China, the command of the air force has been completely in the hands of the U.S. Air Force. They always advocate bombing the streets of Guangzhou. Although we have opposed it several times, it has been ineffective. Therefore, we have had to drop bombs in the city, which inevitably endangers the lives and property of our compatriots. We ask for your forgiveness.

Mount Titano, which is 800 meters high, is within its territory. The mountain is located between Pesaro and Ravenna, so it is a key route to controlling the Po Plain.

### Revision of Provisional Measures for Managing Financial Institutions Approved by Central Political Conference

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) — The revised articles of the Ministry of Finance's provisional measures for managing financial institutions have been approved by the 138th Central Political Conference. The implementing rules and the revised articles of the bank registration regulations have also been prepared for filing. In the future, the management of financial institutions will be further strengthened due to the revision of these measures and implementing rules, which will definitely make a great contribution to the strengthening and stability of the financial system. The records are as follows:

Revised Articles of the Ministry of Finance's Provisional Measures for Managing Financial Institutions:

Article 4 is added: When a financial institution establishes a business location, it shall take a video of the original business license and prepare a submission stating the following items and submit it to the Ministry of Finance for approval and registration:  Name,  Allocated capital amount,  Location of the business location,  Scope of operations,  Business plan,  Business term,  Name and residence of the person in charge,  For business locations that have already started business, a submission shall be prepared within one month from the date of implementation of these measures, stating the items in the preceding paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7, and adding the latest monthly statement of the location and a copy of the approval for establishment, and submitting it to the Ministry of Finance for supplementary registration. (Reason) The establishment of a business location by a financial institution has a significant impact on local finance, and its importance is no less than that of the financial institution itself. The Ministry has always been very cautious in approving the establishment of the above-mentioned business location, and it must be approved and filed by the Ministry before business is allowed. Those who have not obtained this approval belong to unauthorized establishment and can be punished by law. However, this approval is not as good as the business license of the financial institution itself, which can be hung in a prominent place for all to see. Therefore, it is even more difficult to know whether the business location has not been approved by the Ministry and has been established without authorization. Without anyone reporting it, the Ministry has too many affairs and cannot see it all, so there is no way to ban it. The situation in Shanghai is complex, and there are many such incidents. In order to learn from the past, it is really necessary to issue a business license for the business location of a financial institution that has been approved for establishment. Therefore, it is proposed to add this article to achieve the effect of collecting and rectifying. The original Article 4 is changed to Article 5 (the rest are changed accordingly).

The original text of Article 4, paragraph 5: 5. Establishment of a business location, change of business location class or address. (Revised text) 5. Change or abolition of the business location class or address. (Reason) The main point of the amendment of this paragraph is to delete the seven characters (establishment of a business location). Since it is proposed to stipulate that a business location of a financial institution must obtain a business license, these seven characters should be deleted to avoid duplication.

The original text of Article 5: After the end of each business year, a financial institution shall prepare a business report, a balance sheet, a property catalog, and a profit and loss statement within three months and submit it to the Ministry of Finance. (Revised text) After the end of each business year, a financial institution shall prepare a business report, a balance sheet, a property catalog, a profit and loss statement, and a surplus distribution statement within three months and submit it to the Ministry of Finance. The balance sheet, profit and loss statement, and surplus distribution statement in the preceding paragraph shall be publicly announced. (Reason) A financial institution is a credit institution, and its financial status, profit and loss situation, and amount of surplus distribution should be publicly announced so that everyone knows it. There are already provisions in the Company Law, and it is proposed to add and revise this article to show its importance. (To be continued)

### American Forces Launch Pincer Attack on Liège, Germany Establishes New Defense Line on Western Border

Central News Agency, Berlin, 9th – Huitong News Agency: The German army's western front defenses have been completed with extreme speed, but this was achieved through bitter fighting. The German troops defending Boulogne and Calais are currently doing their utmost to prevent anti-Axis forces from entering the ports along the Strait. After being forced to the coastal areas by the British forces who broke into Antwerp, they are now conducting movements towards the Scheldt River estuary. The Canadian First Army is advancing southeast from Ypres in the south. There has been fierce fighting at the Lys bridge in Ghent, which was still in German hands the night before. The day before, the anti-Axis forces again attempted to forcibly cross the Albert Canal south of Antwerp but failed. The main force of the British Second Army is now in Antwerp, launching a major offensive in the east and northeast of the Leuven line, towards the Albert Canal bay between Antwerp and Hasselt, but has also failed to cross the river. Fierce fighting is currently at a standstill. The American First Army, advancing east from the Namur area, has divided into two routes to break into the northern and southern districts of Liège, seemingly in a pincer movement, in an attempt to seize this strategic location. The anti-Axis forces intend to make the Liège-Antwerp area the focal point of the war, and their goal is clearly to advance into or break into the Aachen basin from North Brabant and Nijmegen.

New German Troops Head to the Front Lines

Central News Agency, Berlin, 9th – Huitong News Agency: According to the plans of Goebbels, the German Plenipotentiary for Total War Mobilization, the new army established includes units specifically designed to deal with tank forces. These units are equipped with the latest short-range combat weapons, and their personnel consist only of volunteers between the ages of seventeen and thirty-nine. According to a German army commander who told war correspondent Ulrich: he was very pleased to lead well-equipped divisions to the front lines, including the most modern weapons that have never been seen before. The process from the formation of this new army to its deployment to the front lines was extremely rapid, setting a precedent in military history.

### Yesterday's Ninth Air Defense Day: Exercises Showed Good Results, Airplanes Dropped Mock Bombs for Evacuation Training

Yesterday (the 9th) was the ninth Air Defense Day. The Municipal Air Defense Headquarters, in view of the current sudden increase in air defense tension, expanded air defense training to ensure that all citizens could maximize their air defense spirit. The entire city entered a state of air defense yesterday morning, and the situation was very tense. Various air defense drills were carried out. The details are listed below:

Warning Training Achieves Good Results

Yesterday, warning training was carried out, but without sounding the alarm. The timing of various training alarms was pre-determined, and the alarm was sounded and the alarm was transmitted by the air defense personnel of each Bao-Jia, and the alarm was transmitted by ringing the bell. At 9:30 a.m., the precautionary alarm order was issued. The Bao-Jia air defense personnel assisted the police in directing traffic, and personnel from rescue and firefighting teams gathered at the Bao offices to prepare for emergencies. At 10:30 a.m., the training air raid alarm was issued. Traffic control was immediately implemented, and Japanese aircraft took off and flew high in the sky, dropping mock bombs. When flying over the local area, the air raid observation posts of each Bao reported. Regardless of police and Bao personnel or civilians, all went to the designated shelters nearby or lay prone on the ground, quickly entering an evacuation state. At 11:00 a.m., the training air raid alarm was lifted, and at 12:00 noon, the training precautionary alarm was lifted. The second training alarm, at 3:30 p.m., was a training air raid alarm. All districts of the city implemented traffic control and other necessary measures in accordance with the regulations of the first air raid alarm. Entertainment venues such as theaters, dance halls, etc. all suspended performances and entertainment for twenty minutes, and movie theaters showed a slide of "Training Air Raid Imminent," to inform the audience. At 4:00 p.m., the training air raid alarm was lifted, and a precautionary blackout was implemented in the evening, with the entire city entering a blackout state. At 10:00 p.m., the training precautionary alarm was completely lifted, and normalcy was restored. The warning training in each district this time achieved very good results.

Each District Seriously Carried Out Evacuation Training

Each district of the city was ordered to carry out comprehensive training in fire fighting and rescue, and to focus on evacuation drills. Regardless of Bao-Jia personnel or civilians, all participated in the training. After the issuance of a simulated air raid alarm at the prescribed time, members of the self-defense corps, police defense corps, and special self-defense air defense corps of nearby large buildings and factories were fully mobilized in full air defense gear to transmit the alarm. Traffic control was implemented in the training area, and vehicles and pedestrians were directed to shelters. Store employees evacuated into the store, and those staying at home had to evacuate into the inner room. When the sky observation post reported the approach of a simulated enemy aircraft or the dropping of a simulated bomb, all Bao-Jia personnel and civilians lay prone in an evacuation posture until the observation post reported that the enemy aircraft had gone away before standing up. After the end of the training and the lifting of the simulated alarm, normalcy was restored. During the training in each district, personnel were dispatched from each police precinct to provide on-site guidance, and corrections were made to those who were uncooperative or made mistakes. At the same time, large stores, banks, companies, hotels, restaurants, entertainment venues, movie theaters, train and ship terminals, factories, business venues, schools, etc. all automatically conducted evacuation drills.

Over a Hundred Mock Bombs Dropped

Furthermore, yesterday, in order to expand air defense training, simulated enemy aircraft flew overhead from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. During the air raid alarm, paper mock incendiary bombs (red), explosive bombs (yellow), and time bombs (black) were dropped in the prosperous areas south of the Suzhou River. Each district then carried out comprehensive training in evacuation, fire fighting, and rescue. When a simulated enemy aircraft flew overhead, the sky observation posts of each Bao often reported "Enemy aircraft are coming!" Then the messengers rang gongs and knocked on drums, and after each Bao reported, evacuation was immediately implemented. When a bomb was discovered, the relevant police precinct was immediately reported, and methods were used to extinguish and remove the bomb depending on its type. Subsequently, fire fighting and rescue exercises were carried out. More than a hundred bombs were dropped in succession. Evacuation and extinguishing techniques were very skilled. The type and power of the bombs were indicated on the paper bombs, so that Bao-Jia personnel would be familiar with the types of bombs and their explosion potential, making it easier to deal with real bombs.

### Street Photography Exhibition Starts Second Run

The second street photography touring exhibition, sponsored by the East Asia Traffic Corporation and supported by the Japanese Army Information Department, officially began yesterday (the 9th) and will be publicly exhibited in various locations throughout the city for a period of days.

### Judiciary to Prepare Crime Prevention Drama

In order to popularize crime prevention work among all levels of society and achieve the expected results, the Judiciary Department of the Municipal Police Bureau has planned to stage a crime prevention drama in the near future. It is said that the script is being written by famous writers, and famous actors from the city's film and drama circles will be invited to collaborate in the performance.

### Representatives of Various Trade Associations Held Talks Yesterday, Director Xu of the Economic Bureau Attended and Gave Instructions

In order to curb rising prices and stabilize people's livelihood, the Municipal Qing Bureau convened representatives from eighty industrial and commercial associations throughout the city at the bureau's auditorium at 2:00 p.m. yesterday for a discussion. More than fifty units of representatives attended. Director Xu of the bureau gave instructions, first pointing out that the current prices in the city have suddenly risen sharply in recent days, which has a great impact on people's livelihood. It is hoped that all members of the trade associations must recognize the environment, unanimously support national policies, and take the stability of people's livelihood as the premise, and specially put forward three questions for elaboration:

Price Issues are Paramount

Since the year of the ox, the prices in the city, especially the price increases in August, have been considered. Although merchants generally excuse the lack of raw materials and traffic obstruction, according to general goods, the sudden price increases are indeed illegal acts, especially for meat and vegetables, whose sources are all in the suburbs of the city. Therefore, it is considered that the price increase of these two items not only disregards merchant morality but also disrupts commercial standards. Therefore, it is hoped that the merchants of the city must each focus on their own position, determine the governing price, and report to the bureau at any time, and not take the opportunity to raise prices to harm others and benefit themselves.

Regarding Industrial and Commercial Registration

The bureau believes that since the municipal administration of the city has been unified, in order to unify industrial and commercial management, it has been ordered to carry out industrial and commercial registration. Since the beginning, according to statistics, there are more than 100,000 industrial and commercial enterprises in the city that have not yet registered. This has hindered the progress of controlled economic work, which is regrettable. In order to consider the difficulties of merchants, the deadline has been extended repeatedly. It is hoped that all members of the trade will no longer ignore their own interests and will abide by the law.

Liaison Issues: Due to the reorganization of the administrative structure, the bureau and the industrial and commercial circles of the city have found it difficult to maintain contact, and it is impossible to convey official documents in a short time due to the development of industry and commerce in the city. In the future, in order to truly achieve the feelings between the government and merchants, it is planned to hold a city-wide industrial and commercial dinner party every month to listen to commercial information at any time, provide it to the municipal authorities, and try to plan solutions to difficult problems. After Xu's instructions, the representatives of the trade associations reported on commercial information and various difficult problems, hoping that the government would assist in alleviating the current situation faced by various industrial and commercial industries.

### Headquarters of the Self-Defense Corps Announces Its Executives, Headquarters to Hold Inauguration Ceremony

In order to unify the city's self-defense corps, concentrate strength, and achieve close unity between the police and Bao-Jia, the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau specially established the Self-Defense Corps Headquarters yesterday, the anniversary of the Anti-War Day, with Director Chen concurrently serving as the head of the corps, and Deputy Directors Du Zhengjian, Fu Yingsu, and Cheng Deyi concurrently serving as the deputy heads. All senior officials have taken office and begun work. It is reported that the headquarters, in order to show solemnity, has set a date to hold a joint inauguration ceremony. Those attending at the time will include all senior officials and personnel of the headquarters, as well as the chief Bao chiefs, Bao chiefs, and members of the Bao-Jia committees of each district. At the same time, 50,000 basic members of the self-defense corps will participate in the inspection. The grand occasion will definitely be unprecedented and enthusiastic.

The Self-Defense Corps Headquarters of this city, under the guidance of the Shanghai Police Bureau, was officially established yesterday. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Deputy Director Du and Secretary-General Gu yesterday afternoon, and received the following statements:

Deputy Director Du

Deputy Director Du said in his statement: "The Shanghai Self-Defense Corps Headquarters was established today. This is to lead and organize the Shanghai Bao-Jia self-defense youth, so that they can fulfill their duties and cooperate in defending Greater Shanghai. Looking back, before the recovery of the concessions, due to the special environment, all terrorist crimes, Bao-Jia self-defense, spread throughout the city. Fortunately, with the cooperation of the local people, the number of criminal cases has been gradually reduced, so the effect of establishing the Bao-Jia self-defense corps in Shanghai is not insignificant, and public security relies on it to be consolidated. Last year, the Shanghai concessions were recovered, and the city's administration was unified. The city's police administration was also unified, and the city's Bao-Jia was also unified under the supervision of the Bao-Jia Department. Now, the establishment of the Self-Defense Corps Headquarters will not only enable all self-defense corps members in the city to be commanded under a unified system, but also increase their self-defense power. Under the joint police-Bao-Jia front, public security will be further ensured and strengthened. I am very excited and fortunate about the establishment of the Self-Defense Corps Headquarters today.

Secretary-General Gu

Secretary-General Gu Wu said in his statement: "The Self-Defense Corps Headquarters announced its establishment, on the one hand, to achieve the task of self-defense and self-defense, and on the other hand, to assist the police and military authorities to ensure the foundation of public security. The preparation and establishment of the headquarters is to adapt to the needs of the times. Now that the city's administration is unified, the goal of self-defense and self-defense has achieved considerable results in terms of effectiveness, such as stopping crimes, air defense, and protection, all of which have achieved good results. The service problem of the self-defense corps is that all those aged 18 or above and under 45 must serve, and the number of personnel will be more than 400,000. If they can all effectively shoulder the task of self-defense, I believe that they will not feel pain. Unfortunately, in the past, statistics, surveys, and distribution were carried out without a unified organization. Although there were those who served the public and abided by the law, it is feared that those who took advantage of the law to do evil and cheat were also unavoidable, resulting in the reduction of effectiveness. Therefore, the future work of the headquarters will focus on this point. In addition to the old, young, women, and those who are unable to work, citizens of service age should bear responsibility and should never be arbitrarily exempted. At the same time, in each Bao, in addition to the original ordinary members, outstanding members will be selected to form basic members, who will be trained to instill knowledge and skills in air defense and defense. This process is assisted by each sub-bureau and is entrusted to various specialized agencies to achieve the purpose of police-Bao-Jia cooperation and is named as a model self-defense corps member. In addition, volunteers from factories, shops, schools, institutions, and groups are welcome to receive training and provide enthusiastic service. Our people have always been like a plate of loose sand, and today it is fortunate to have widespread training, and I hope that we will all work together to serve the country and society.

### Stepping Up Epidemic Prevention Work, Taking Emergency Measures, Large Number of Epidemic Prevention Injection Teams Dispatched

Since the implementation of epidemic prevention injections in this city on May 1 this year, the results have been very good. Up to now, no real cholera has been found. A month ago, the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee learned that there was real cholera in the Fuzhou Lianjiang Changle area? It has not been reduced so far, and now it has been reported that real cholera is prevalent in Shijiazhuang in North China and Nanping in South China. The Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee believes that the traffic between South China, Central China, and North China is frequent, and this infectious disease is very likely to spread. In order to prevent it from invading Shanghai and ensure safety, the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee has written to the Japanese Embassy in this city, the Health Bureau, the Police Bureau, and other relevant authorities, instructing their subordinates to strictly prevent it. It is reported that the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee has taken emergency measures since yesterday, in addition to strictly implementing the re-examination of vaccination certificates, and dispatched a large number of injection teams.

Checking Certificates

The most likely places for the invasion and spread of epidemic diseases in Shanghai are railway stations and factories. The Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee, in view of this, sent personnel to railway stations and factories yesterday to check the cholera prevention vaccination certificates of all passengers and employees. Those who were found to be overdue were all given injections to prevent any accidents.

Injections in Each District

At the same time, because only more than one million citizens in each district have been injected in the second phase of epidemic prevention injections, the reason is that the general public avoids injections, which has slowed down the progress of the work. The authorities of the Association, in addition to hoping that the general public will fully assist the Bureau in receiving injections to ensure personal and public safety, will also re-regulate the work time and location of each injection team in accordance with the jurisdiction of each police precinct in this city from the 8th of this month, and will send personnel to secretly investigate at any time to prevent the occurrence of cheating. According to reporters, due to the prevalence of real cholera in North China and South China this time, the period of epidemic prevention work in this city will be extended.

### This Newspaper's Science Award, Second Grant, Research Funding of 50,000 Yuan for Mr. Yang Shuzu, and Incentive Award of 2,000 Yuan for Mr. Ni Gexun

The second meeting of the Science Award Committee of this newspaper decided to subsidize Mr. Yang Shuzu's research funding of 50,000 yuan and award Mr. Ni Gexun an incentive award of 2,000 yuan. Mr. Yang is a Doctor of Medicine from Nagoya Imperial University in Japan and a Doctor of Medicine from Tokyo Imperial University. He has worked at the Shanghai Institute of Natural Sciences for many years, specializing in pathology and parasitology. His research topics are as follows. Mr. Ni studies electricity in his spare time and uses electric light current to create an "electric fire starter", which is convenient for ignition. It is more durable and does not consume as much electricity as ordinary electric matches. Although it is not an invention, his dedication is commendable. The award from this association is purely to encourage research interest, and it is hoped that people from all walks of life will promote the trend of amateur scientific research.

Research on the Route of Infection of Kala-azar

Kala-azar is prevalent in our country's Huaihai Province and northern provinces, with no less than millions of patients. The causative agent, pathological anatomy, clinical symptoms, and treatment methods have been studied by many scholars and have been solved successively. However, the route of infection has not yet been resolved despite 40 years of research in the medical community. Generally, the kala-azar pathogen enters the human body through sandflies. After the pathogen enters the sandfly's stomach, it becomes a flagellate, and then the flagellate infects the human body. However, how the flagellate transforms into granular pathogens after entering the human body has not been further investigated in detail. Mr. Ishii of Japan conducted an experimental study on the cutaneous infectivity of flagellates, and the result was negative. It is planned to continue three types of experimental research: 1. The fate of kala-azar bodies and flagellates after injection into the abdominal cavity of voles. 2. The fate of kala-azar bodies and flagellates after injection into the veins of twenty-day-old mice. 3. The cutaneous infectivity of the cultured form of kala-azar bodies. This research has been ongoing for one and a half years, and some results have been reported at the East Asia Medical Conference. It is expected to be successful in about a year, and progress reports will be published successively.

### Central Government Stipulates Prohibition of Steelyard Scales

The Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce previously received a request from the Tea and Food Industry Association of this city to write to the City Bureau of Weights and Measures for an explanation of the use of steelyard scales. It is now learned that the association has received notification that "steelyard" scales are an illegal system, and the name was included in the Central Government's unified system and has long been included in the prohibition of manufacturing, selling, and using them. It is hoped that all relevant industries in this city that are still unaware of this regulation will immediately stop using steelyard scales in order to comply with the regulations. A boy named Hai, six years old, got lost at the intersection of Ningxia Road on September 2. He was wearing white shorts with black squares, green buttons, black-soled shoes, and had a flat-topped head. The child's family should go to the Children's Care Section of the Health Department at 630 South Huangpi Road (Beile Road) between 9:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. and between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. from Monday to Friday to claim him.

### Secret Story of the Ogasawara Islands

— Takeshita Gennosuke

]

Discovery of the Ogasawara Islands

The US military will boldly attack Chichijima and Hahajima in the Ogasawara Islands. These two islands are vital points south of the Japanese mainland, administratively belonging to Tokyo. Britain and the United States had attempted to occupy the Ogasawara Islands in the past but were unsuccessful. This secret story will now be revealed.

On November 21, Meiji 8 (1875), a steamship sailed out of Yokohama Port, speeding south. It had two masts, two decks, and a pure white hull, easily recognizable as the Meiji Maru (1,038 tons). It was built by the Japanese Ministry of Industry and had just returned from England in February of that year, being the most modern and excellent ship of the time for lighthouse巡回.

However, today there were no lighthouse bureau personnel on board, and it was certainly not巡行lighthouse. It had another mission. On board were many officials dispatched by the Navy, Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Finance Ministries, called the "Ogasawara Islands Recovery Committee," such as Tanabe Taichi, a fourth-rank official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Navy Lieutenant Nezu Seikichi, Tax Assistant Hayashi Masaaki, seventh-rank official from the Geography Bureau Kohana Sakusuke, and several attendants. Their destination, needless to say, was the Ogasawara Islands.

The so-called Ogasawara Islands are said to have been discovered by Ogasawara Sadayori, the great-grandson of Ogasawara Nagatoki, the lord of Fukashi (Matsumoto) in Shinano Province, in the second year of Tensho (1593). Sadayori obtained permission from Tokugawa Ieyasu and erected a sign on the island, which read:

"Japanese Country, Amaterasu-Ōmikami Shrine Land, Changyuan Ieyasu, under the admiration of Ogasawara, Fourth Rank Junior General, Minister of Popular Affairs, Source Sadayori 朝臣"(Original text)

From this, it is clear that the Ogasawara Islands were entirely Japanese territory. So, why was a special envoy of officials sent to recover the Ogasawara Islands, which were originally Japanese territory?

After being occupied and developed by Ogasawara Sadayori, the island soon became an uninhabited wasteland due to the difficulty of sea routes and the implementation of the Kan'ei isolation policy. At some point, the island was forgotten. Because it was located to the southeast (south) of the Japanese mainland, it was called "巽uninhabited island". Except for occasional mention of the island by survivors of shipwrecks, it was simply forgotten.

Britain and the United States compete for Pacific islands

During this time, British and American pirate-like whaling ships and exploration ships were constantly watching the island. At that time, they were vying for colonies in the Pacific, competing everywhere, and even appearing near the Japanese mainland. In the sixth year of Bunsei (1823), an American whaling ship arrived at Hahajima, believing that they were the first to discover the island, and named it Coffin Island after its captain Coffin. Two years later, in the eighth year of Bunsei (1825), a British whaling ship arrived at Chichijima, also believing that they had discovered it. In the tenth year of Bunsei (1827), the British government sent a survey ship there, naming it the Peel Islands, and nailed a bronze plaque to a tree at Suzaki on Chichijima, raising the British flag.

After the United States learned of this, they believed that the British occupation of those islands was very inappropriate. In the sixth year of Kaei (1853), when Perry came to Uraga with a fleet, he planned to take the opportunity to seize the island. In July, Perry himself went to Futami Port on Chichijima and raised the American flag on Mount Senpu. Subsequently, in October, he dispatched Commander Corley of the warship Plymouth, under his command, to the island. After landing on Hahajima, Corley immediately renamed Peel Island to Coffin Islands and nailed a bronze plaque to a tree northwest of Okimura on Hahajima. At the same time, he encouraged British and American people who had migrated to the island from Hawaii to organize an organ similar to a provisional colonial government; this was also Perry's intention.

When Japan learned that Britain and the United States were vying for the Ogasawara Islands, which had been Japanese territory since the Bunroku era, even the incompetent shogunate was unwilling to abandon them. In the first year of Bunkyu (1861), in December, it dispatched Foreign Magistrate Mizuno Tadanori and Hattori Kiichi, among others, aboard the warship Kanrin Maru to Ogasawara. After Mizuno and others arrived at Chichijima, they immediately summoned the naturalized islanders, informing them that the island was Japanese territory and encouraging them to develop it. They then built the Grand Jin Shrine, established a temporary遊事place, and erected a development碑inscription, entitled "Record of the New Construction of Ogasawara." At the same time, Kohana Sakusuke was appointed as the island director and sent forty immigrants from Hachijo Island to develop it.

However, soon after the維新started, the government officials and immigrants all returned to mainland Japan, and the development work was abandoned halfway. Then Britain and the United States had another chance to contend for this island. In the eighth year of Meiji (1875), an American woman named Peace came to the Ogasawara Islands, causing a stir both domestically and abroad. At that time, the British minister Parkes, who had been known to the world as an arrogant and rude diplomat since the Japanese Restoration, asked the Japanese foreign affairs authorities: "Are the Ogasawara Islands your country's territory or British and American territory?" The cunning Parkes intended to see how Japan would respond and then argue that the Ogasawara Islands had been occupied by Britain first. However, the Japanese response was very clear: "It is absolutely Japanese territory. From today onwards, we will immediately restart development!"

Thus, the Ogasawara Islands Recovery Committee was urgently dispatched to the island aboard the Meiji Maru.

British warship was one step late

When British Minister Parkes learned that the Japanese government had urgently dispatched the Meiji Maru to the Ogasawara Islands, he was shocked. The next day (November 22), he urgently ordered British Consul Robertson and naval officers to board the British warship Cariou, which was anchored in Yokohama, to pursue the Meiji Maru. Since receiving the reply from the Japanese authorities, his ambition to occupy the Ogasawara Islands had been half shattered. However, Parkes, whose heart was not yet dead, knew that Japan would definitely take steps to recover the Ogasawara Islands and still attempted to产制prevent the actions of the Japanese envoy.

However, the Japanese also anticipated this, so they strictly ordered the Meiji Maru captain, Englishman Heatorls, not to dock at Miyake Island and Hachijo Island, the planned stopover points, but to sail straight to the Ogasawara Islands. The Meiji Maru's average speed was eleven and a half knots per hour, which was considered very fast at the time. As a result, the Meiji Maru sailed into Futami Port on Chichijima on the 24th, two days earlier than the planned date.

After landing, the envoy immediately gathered the naturalized inhabitants on board and sternly stated that Japan was determined to manage the entire island from now on. At the same time, they investigated the islanders' household registrations and provided them with the necessary equipment for development. As a result, they happily obeyed the orders and engaged in development under the protection of the Japanese Empire. According to the household registration survey at that time, all the people on the island were naturalized foreigners, totaling fourteen households and seventy-one people.

It is said that the British warship Cariou, which left Yokohama a day later, had secretly communicated with the Meiji Maru's Captain Heatorls and learned that the Meiji Maru would stop at Miyake and Hachijo Islands. Therefore, it was planned that the two ships would arrive at Chichijima at the same time on the 26th. However, the Meiji Maru changed its planned route as mentioned above, sailed at full speed, and headed straight for Chichijima, avoiding the Cariou. Therefore, the Cariou was two days behind the Meiji Maru and only appeared in Futami Port on the 26th. It arrived too late; the Japanese envoy had already completed the recovery of the Ogasawara Islands.

British Consul Robertson was inevitably extremely frustrated, but the cunning British did not show their喜怒emotions. He suppressed his disappointment and put on a great show, saying to the Japanese envoy:

"I congratulate you on the speedy and successful recovery of your country. I came to this island at the request of Minister Parkes, only to correct the actions of the island's American Peace, with no other intention. The British government also believes that if it were to possess this island for the purpose of protecting the British on the island, it would have to protect the British on the surrounding islands as well, and to avoid trouble, it would be better to abandon it. Therefore, we have no objection to these islands being managed by your country today."

He stayed on the island for several days and then quietly returned to Yokohama. While staying on Chichijima, he happened to learn that the bronze plaque that the British had nailed to a tree at Suzaki on Chichijima in previous years (i.e., 1827) was being kept by a naturalized islander, so he asked for it and took it back. Besides bringing this gift back to Parkes, he probably had nothing else.

Kohana Sakusuke, a patriot who managed the South

In this way, Japan's southern gateway was finally returned to Japanese territory at the critical moment. In the same year, it was decided to develop the entire island as a directly controlled territory of the Ministry of Interior. The following year, 1876, Kohana Sakusuke, one of the members of the Recovery Committee, was appointed as the Interior Ministry権 少丞 and ordered to lead more than ten subordinates to the island to take office. In the tenth year of Meiji (1877), a branch office of the Ministry of Interior was established at Senpu on Chichijima to manage the entire island's administration. This first generation island magistrate of the Ogasawara Islands, Kohana Sakusuke, as mentioned earlier, had been engaged in cultivating the island since the time of the shogunate and was a patriot with unique insights in southern management.

In the first year of Bunkyu, he accompanied Foreign Minister Nagano Tadanori to the island. When he was ordered to stay on the island, he learned that there were uninhabited wasteland islands such as Parece Vela (currently known as Okinotorishima) two hundred miles south of the island (i.e., the northern islands of the Mariana Islands). He and Matsumoto Sanjinojo, among others, suggested to the shogunate that exploring and managing these islands could be used as a base for Japan's southern advance along with the Ogasawara Islands. Since the Meiji era, he had enthusiastically planned for key routes to recover the Ogasawara Islands and finally recovered them.

In November of the tenth year of Meiji, when he was the island magistrate, he erected the Ogasawara Islands Development Monument on Mount Naryo on Chichijima. The inscription was written by Councilor Okubo Toshimichi, and it read, "One mountain range of Izu undulates and ends here; it is our southern gate." After seeing this, Kohana Sakusuke immediately chiseled away the words "and ends." The island official did not know who the culprit was who had destroyed those two words. Kohana learned of this and explained to him, telling him that the words "and ends" were superfluous because the Ogasawara Islands were Japan's gateway to managing the South and should never "end" here, so he deliberately removed them. The island official was very impressed with his view. Like this, he hoped that Japan's southern gateway would not end in the Ogasawara Islands area and would extend further south in the future, demonstrating his spirit of managing the South.

### Playing in the Water

— Everyone

It's supposed to be autumn, but the air is always filled with heat, stuffiness, and restlessness; the flames of summer still linger, burning in the hearts of every city dweller.

A few days ago, at the Suzhou Creek section of the Garbage Bridge, there were more than a dozen wild children, bathing in the black, polluted water of the Suzhou Creek in the evening sun. One by one, they splashed water and played with each other, the water dripping from the creek as they climbed up, then jumped off the banks and桥piers, making a "plop" sound on the surface of the river; one followed another in clumsy and ugly paired swims, throwing a stone into the bottom of the river, and then diving into the water to search for this stone... The scene was lively and active, revealing childlike and innocent joy. City people were curious. Tired of the slow and refined swimming in the swimming pool, seeing these wild children's splashing and rough style was like opening their eyes, filled with an indescribable interest. So, rows of pedestrians lined the banks and桥railings, all temporarily stopping for the temptation of the children playing in the water. They watched earnestly, appreciating, but their psychology of watching and appreciating was abnormal. Sometimes a burst of laughter would erupt on their faces, even waving their hands and applauding, like the laughter caused by watching a pair of seals playing ball in a circus.

"Hey! Hey..." A gentleman-type waved his hand at the children in the water, and at the same time pointed to the highest point of the桥railing and continued: "Jump down from here, jump down from here, and I'll give him a hundred yuan..." This gentleman proudly took out a hundred-yuan bill from his pocket and waved it. Tempted by the profit, a thin child finally tried, thus winning the啧啧praise of a group of people, followed by another group of irrelevant哈哈laughter. But everyone forgot the danger of the child jumping down from a river surface more than ten feet high, or that the value of the child's life was only worth a hundred-yuan bill, even more, that they forgot that these were of the same species, and the distinction between those in the water and those on the shore created such an isolating boundary for humanity - a terrifying boundary that deviates from human nature.

I天天travel along the Suzhou River畔bank, see the towering文明buildings on both sides, the摩托cars coming and going, and at the same time the河piers issuing苦役efforts, the eighteenth-century篷棚boats on the river, and deeply feel that the city is filled with contradictions and disharmony; now seeing the children playing in the water and the living drama of watching the children play in the water, I feel even more that this human place is filled with contradictions and disharmony. Children are innocent and optimistic. Their splashing and joy when playing in the water, a mischievous相look, often pull me back to my childhood dreams. But every time I come back from my治事place in the evening and see them, it often arouses a bit of inexplicable emotion, and I really wonder where it comes from. "They are all Chinese children," I thought. "They are all hopeful, all the pillars of tomorrow's country and the cornerstones of society." I also try to imagine a deeper level. But the life they lead every day is打拾撿拾picking up, wandering, without control; they dare not even be certain that a day's life can fill their肚子stomachs. A piece of 布末布料end, a small 段段section of 香烟烟头cigarette butt, all kinds of事物things! are their working goals, the object of their lives; what they need is the问问余remainder of the world, their lives are建染built upon these 天问问余heavenly sleep remnants - naturally, even the lowest and smallest survival desire is not enough, so their eyes turn to the loading trucks coming out of the warehouse. The trucks are crowded with bags of 米毅beans, wheat, etc., all the necessary grains for humans. The trucks are like horses on a疆场battlefield, galloping past one by one, leaving behind some scattered grains, and these children争呀夺啊snatch and grab, scrambling to put them into their pockets.

### The Beauty of Imperfection

— 維新

Kushida Byakuson believed that "the beauty of imperfection" is like the mole of a so-called beauty. Indeed, without ugliness, how can beauty be highlighted? Xi Shi had a heart ailment, which was an imperfection, but it made her beauty even more apparent. A calm ocean rises into a huge wave, which is an imperfection, but it makes its magnificence even more evident. Similarly, how do we know if losing a horse is not a blessing? And if after climbing over layers of hills, we get a little rest, which is better than sitting at home in silence? It should be very clear!

The road of life is rugged and uneven, filled with many imperfections, so to seek satisfaction, one must obtain it from imperfections. Hope and desire are endless, so "life" is an endless journey!

Humanity has an endless journey, but it is also constantly evolving. The reason why humanity seeks evolution is to constantly satisfy its imperfections, but it also incessantly creates new imperfections. These are all the things that make humanity human and naturally different from animals. In this way, the world will have a revived and thriving vitality.

If everyone were like animals, just eating when they are hungry and sleeping when they are tired, with neither imperfection nor satisfaction, then what kind of situation would the world be in? Wouldn't it be a cold and desolate ruin?

Vulgar sayings from Huang-Lao philosophy, such as "A tree grows a thousand feet tall, but its leaves fall back to their roots," "Turn big things into small things, and small things into nothing," "After going a mile out the door, don't get to the house," are all plain and uninteresting, declining day by day. They fundamentally do not know "the beauty of imperfection"!

Lao Tzu's ideal is to return people to the natural state of infancy. His advocacy is to abandon learning and have small countries with few people. Why? He said, "When the Great Way is abandoned, there is benevolence and righteousness; when wisdom arises, there is great hypocrisy; when the six relatives are not in harmony, there is filial piety and kindness; when the country is in chaos, there are loyal ministers." He is a passive ascetic. His doctrine is regressive and does not conform to the principle of evolution. If humanity were to truly return to the original state of infancy, then what is the value of being human? "The Great Way is abandoned," "there is great hypocrisy," "the six relatives are not in harmony," and "the country is in chaos" are all imperfections. Conversely, "wisdom arises," "there is benevolence and righteousness," "there is filial piety and kindness," and "there are loyal ministers" are all evolutions. This is imperfection with evolution.

"Life" is an endless journey; in fact, besides God and the heavenly kingdom that our hearts yearn for, there are no imperfect people and no imperfect world. In this way, humanity will have evolution; the world will have vitality. "The beauty of imperfection" is truly so great!

We are now in an era of the deepest personal imperfections, social imperfections, and national imperfections. In other words, we are standing in the most vibrant society. If we strive tirelessly, we will surely gain the greatest satisfaction. But those who "would rather be a dog in a well-governed era than a person in a chaotic time" cannot appreciate the vitality of this era. The reason is very simple: they do not understand the meaning of "the beauty of imperfection."

Schopenhauer and Nietzsche believed that the world is evil, so they said that life is a "tragedy." Li Bai said, "Life in this world is like a great dream; why trouble our lives?" The ancients said, "The net is vast, and if you jump out of one net, you enter another." These all detest life, and I must object! No! Precisely because the world is imperfect, life can obtain true interest. Life is simply a "comedy"! As for those who do not understand "the beauty of imperfection," are they not people of the 道道way? Because they originally do not recognize the true meaning of life!

### Old Headmaster

— Ling Zuren

Having laid down the burden of "joyfully nurturing talents" and leaping into the unfamiliar industrial circle.

The "old headmaster" from my middle school days has already laid down the burden of "joyfully nurturing talents" and leaped into the unfamiliar industrial circle:——He has started working as the "Director of Factory Affairs" at our Wuxi branch.

In the past, his eyes were daily met with chalk, red ink, roll books, the thin faces of teachers, and the naive yet innocent students... Now, he has exchanged them for spindles, looms, and various kinds of woolen cloth. The people he interacts with have also changed to some rough or sallow male and female workers, and colleagues from all levels...

From "learning" to "industry," the environment has changed completely. The things around him have also completely changed in quality and form.

The sounds that once filled his ears were the loud reading and singing voices of students. Now, they are replaced by the monotonous and heavy mechanical sounds.

Regarding this, our old headmaster must feel a sense of loss!

I remember that I hadn't seen him since I left school until recently, when I finally saw him again at the factory in Shanghai.

He was still tall and stout, with a slightly balding head and a kind smile... Although these things had been separated from me for several years, I felt that they still maintained their original state. However, time is the most unforgiving, so it was not difficult to detect a trace of age on the old headmaster's face that was not there before. His complexion also seemed a bit darker than before, but his spirit was still as vibrant as ever.

At that time, I saw him and greeted him, but for some reason, I couldn't muster the courage to talk to him. I just sat silently in a corner of the office, secretly looking at his familiar, kind face and quietly listening to the peaceful words flowing from the corner of his mouth—at the time, he was surrounded by some superior colleagues—from his peaceful conversation, I immediately remembered his moving speeches at the weekly assemblies during my school days.

Now, it is still the same person in front of me, and the same mouth is speaking. However, time will never flow backward! Everything now is different from before. The "old headmaster" of now is definitely not the "old headmaster" of the past, just as a student who was once taught by him is no longer the student he once was.

The "old headmaster's" topics have now shifted from "advanced algebra" and "physics and chemistry" to 42-count double-ply yarn, "body size," "raw materials," and "business strategies"... I felt my heart entangled by an inexplicable emotion. Was it sadness? Joy? A sense of bewilderment made it hard to analyze.

The "old headmaster" also talked about "life" like ordinary people. From his slightly furrowed brows, I saw clearly that the shadow of "making a living" had universally enveloped people from all walks of life.

Several times, his gaze intersected with my gaze, which was fixed on him. I felt a slight tremor throughout my body and immediately looked away, much like when I was in school and he had exposed my secrets. However, he would never punish me now!

I temporarily closed my eyes, silently recalling everything from my school days. Although those past events have faded like smoke, they still carried a faint sense of warmth as they slowly resurfaced in my memory.

Unable to resist the urging of my heart, I opened my eyes again. I took a deep look at him. He was still sitting peacefully, a gray woolen robe wrapped around his body and mind, weary from travel. I wonder if he still had the enthusiasm he had before, wearing shorts and competing with us on the sports field for the football championship!

He looked at me several times. I thought: He probably doesn't remember this naughty student of his anymore! Yes! However, even a person with a strong memory would find it hard to remember thousands of students. However, thousands of students will definitely remember him—and of course, I am one of them.

Several times, I wanted to summon up the courage to stand up, run to his side, and have a private, heart-to-heart conversation with him. However, my "ordinariness" suppressed me. I didn't want to cause him disappointment with my "ordinariness." It was better for him not to remember me!

After that, although he stayed at the factory in Shanghai for quite a while, I never went to talk to him. I kept myself hidden in "mediocrity."

Now, he has returned to the Wuxi branch to work. Of course, he will never see this "ordinary" article written by one of his "ordinary" students! I can only silently wish this kind "old headmaster" eternal health at the end of this article!

### Dry Well

— Zhu Jingqing

Under the plane tree in front of the door,

There is a dilapidated old well; The bottom of the well is already dry, The well stones are covered with old green moss In the past years, It once reflected the moon, clouds, and stars in the sky, And it also illuminated my childhood innocence

And carefree face;

Now, the bottom of the well is filled with messy

Piles of rocks and weeds.

Ah! The dry old well,

Can it reflect the ever-changing moon, clouds, and stars in the sky again?

The vanished years, Can you give me back my past spirit and beautiful dreams?

### Review of the Three Strongest Softball Teams' Techniques: Pandas Defeated Pirates, Will Fight West Youth This Morning

The Shanghai Softball League has been going on for two months, and the strengths and weaknesses of each team are now clear. Currently, only three teams are qualified to compete for the championship: the Chinese powerhouse Pandas (Pandsa), West Youth (Y Cnbs), and the Portuguese Red Sox (Lusitano Reds). The Philippine Community Team A and the Pirates have each lost twice. Last Sunday (September 3rd), the Pandas defeated the Pirates 4-0. In that game, the Pandas players returned to normal, but there was still no improvement in their hitting.

This morning (10th) at 10:45, the Pandas will face the West Youth team, one of the three strongest teams in the league, at Jiaozhou Park. If it rains and the ground is wet, the game will be postponed. This battle will determine the success or failure of the two teams, because whoever wins will have the right to compete against the strongest Portuguese Red Sox for the championship title. Therefore, in today's battle, both sides will do their best to win. At the same time, the Pandas want to win glory for the Chinese in the softball arena, which is dominated by Westerners. Success or failure depends on this one move. Now, based on the impressions gained from recent battles among these three strongest teams, I will briefly describe them below:

The Pandas excel in fielding, but their hitting is not satisfactory

The Pandas' infield fielding was fully demonstrated in the battle against the Philippine Community Team. In particular, the shortstop of Liang Sheng, a famous player who studied in Japan, showed the most skill. First baseman Wang Nianzu has made rapid progress in the last two games, and his catching is very stable. In addition, pitcher Li Qiteng's pitches in recent games have been so fast and steep that they almost surpass those of Tombala of the Portuguese Red Sox. Mr. Li is still young, and if he works harder, he will undoubtedly be the best softball pitcher in Shanghai. Furthermore, outfielders Tang Weiye and Zhao Sen have both shown improvement. However, the most regrettable thing is that third baseman Wen Ruixiong and second baseman Wen Tianhua are both declining. Both of them are famous players who studied in Japan, but they have not performed well in the games, probably due to lack of practice. In terms of hitting, the Pandas are the most unsatisfactory. No matter how good the fielding is, it is in vain if there is no way to attack. It is said that recently, team leader E Sen and coach are guiding the players' hitting skills at the Donghua Stadium day and night, so there may be a good performance today. We will wait and see.

West Youth has average talent, with both offense and defense showing skill

West Youth is the incarnation of the giant basketball team. Such as Ao Chai Liao, Kai Kuo Mi Luo Fu, Que Li Bo Ke and others. Moreover, the Japanese famous general Ueshima is the shortstop, like a tiger with wings, this gentleman is a left-handed batter (Leff-handbatter) can be called a tiger general. However, the only weakness of the team is its lack of stamina. If they lose several points at the beginning, they will be disorganized and have no fighting spirit. This is most easily seen in the battle with the Portuguese Red Sox. On the contrary, if they win at the beginning, they will work hard to the end and never give up. This seems to be consistent with their basketball style.

The Portuguese Red Sox have the strongest offense and the best defensive outfield

The Portuguese Red Sox team, known as the all-around team, has been intimidating since winning the last championship. The soul pitcher Tombala is indispensable to the team. In the last two battles, he hit two home runs in a row. This gentleman is the biggest contributor to the team's undefeated record. Looking back at the battle against the Pandas last week, the Chinese team lost a fatal three points in the first inning because of his fierce hitting. Also, in the battle against the Philippine Community Team last week, the Portuguese team would have been hopeless for the championship without this gentleman. Because in that battle, the Philippine Community Team was still leading 4-0 in the fourth inning. At the end, the Portuguese team relied on his amazing hitting skills to tie the score. When the Portuguese team won first base in the extra inning, it was Tombala's turn to hit. This gentleman was like a god, swinging desperately. He actually hit a home run, and the Portuguese team turned defeat into victory. This gentleman should be called a hero. In the future, if the Pandas can meet this team again, this gentleman should be paid close attention to, and it is better to send him to "free first base" than to let him hit a shared ball. The outfield of the Portuguese team is the best, they catch every ball. The defeat of the Pandas is really due to this. Only today, Yan will serve the friendship and win the throne. Bai Ma will perform

### Small Football is Booming, There Will Be a Wonderful Performance Today

— Zheng Duan

The prosperity of small football this summer is unprecedented and beyond expectations. This competition could have ended earlier, but due to continuous rain, there are still games to be played in each cup, but they are all at the final stage, which is very exciting. Especially today's two scenes at the Youth Friendship Association will be a grand gathering of small football. The program is the first small football Group A finals hosted by the Shanghai Small Football Federation, where Lianyi and Huatong will compete for the throne. In addition, a performance match will be added, with the Baima team, a personification of Donghua, facing the Qiaolian team, a variant of Yijiang. In terms of the personnel of the four teams, the famous Shanghai first-rate football generals have been almost all gathered. It should be a different style for football players to try small football. Moreover, since small football is the basis of football, today's battle can be observed by the younger generation. The reporter has visited the performances of each team many times and briefly described the tactics in order to bid farewell to the first small football league, which was once extremely popular.

Lianyi and Huatong have the same style

The above two teams rely on their team members' rich experience and extraordinary skills in the first small football game, so wherever they go, they will be defeated, so they reached today's final. Both teams have the same playing style, both with brute force, so the battle between the two heroes depends on luck at that time. It is said that Lianyi's talent is ultimately superior, and the hope of victory is more guaranteed, but Huatong's small football does have its own special points. The forwards and defenders can be integrated into one, which is the highest level of small football. Moreover, Captain Liu has recovered from his injury and is on the battlefield today, so it is not necessarily that his hopes are selected less. Furthermore, the organizers of the two teams also inherited the same family, which is no different from boiling beans to burn beans. I wonder if the former can be in a hurry?

Baima is strong, how is Qiaolian?

Baima is all Donghua soldiers, and Yan Shixin, a famous general from Hong Kong, has joined the battle. If there is no more battle, then Baima will be completely Donghua. The fans praised Baima's performance in the Fuhua Cup. The skills are excellent, and the tactics can be adapted to the situation and win by surprise. Today's opponent is the Qiaolian team, which has never shown its face in small football. How are their skills? How to speculate? However, looking at its announced lineup, it is all famous people, and there are also two Yijun from Tianjin participating. Therefore, I mean that Baima's victory today must rely entirely on the magical transmission and delicate skills, and the application is abundant, so that it can succeed.

In short, these two football matches will definitely be loved by the general public. It is expected that the Youth League stadium will have an unprecedented grand occasion. The reporter is very impressed with the environment of the stadium. Today, he will definitely make an appointment with three or five colleagues, ride a bicycle, and take a trip to the suburbs. When he arrives at the stadium, it is also full of trees, and the autumn is refreshing, which is also a good pastime for the holiday.

### Sports Anecdotes

Lin Zuoshi, the main cadre of the Shantou Sports Association, was seriously injured and is currently receiving treatment. I wish him a speedy recovery!

The volleyball league has all ended, and the championship team in Group B is the Yongsanyi team. It is said that the award ceremony will be held on a selected date. This time, the prizes are one flag for each championship team. After all, prices are soaring and silver cups are also expensive, so the authorities have to do this. Fortunately, the prizes are still an encouragement. I think the teams will not care.

### Hopes for the Football Federation

— Bixian

The Shanghai Football Federation has been established for a year. Although its achievements have not been perfect in the past year, as a newly established organization, the grand and enthusiastic scenes and smooth progress of each game show that the association has worked hard and has been meticulous in its work. However, precisely because the income of the game is considerable, it inevitably arouses suspicion from all walks of life. The spread of rumors inevitably disappoints those who do the work. In fact, the association is a public organization, and its accounts are clearly listed, so why should we bother to talk about it? The writer, the golden wind is sending coolness, the season is entering autumn, and the football season is coming. The Football Federation will reorganize its organization once a year in accordance with the regulations. The last general manager, Mr. Zhou Jiaqi, expressed his fatigue. Mr. Zhou has a long history of serving the sports world and has made outstanding achievements. It is a pity that he is leaving! Now, Mr. Zhou's resignation has been approved by the highest authorities. The new organization and new candidates of the association were announced the other day.

In terms of organization, there are four groups under the Standing Committee: the first group is general affairs, the second group is allocation, the third group is ticketing, and the fourth group is finance. Each group has one director and one deputy director:

First Group Director Tan Xi Deputy Director Shen Huichun

Second Group Director Yue Xiurong Deputy Director Jin Sui

Third Group Director Ma Runfang Deputy Director Yang Ping

Fourth Group Director Tan Jing Deputy Director Huang Zhaohong

Now that the organizational structure has been updated and the candidates for each department have been carefully selected, with its complete organization and excellent personnel, the leapfrog development of the Football Federation this year can be predicted! At this time of metabolism, I wrote a few words, the paper is short and the love is long, and we really have unlimited expectations, that is, to present it to the Football Federation gentlemen!

It is also learned that the association stipulates that a welfare game will be held once a month from this season. Judging from the enthusiastic situation of fans in the past, there is no doubt that the welfare cause will be promoted.
