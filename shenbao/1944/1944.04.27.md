### Displaced Persons Resettlement

As we stroll through the streets, we often see fellow citizens with gaunt faces and emaciated figures trailing behind us, begging for alms. Upon observing their ages, many are in their prime. At the train and bus stations, there are even more idlers and vagrants, with thieving eyes, engaging in cunning schemes of extortion. Recently, those caught and arrested for robbery under the cover of darkness are mostly strong, prime-aged individuals. Upon careful consideration, it seems unlikely that these people willingly degenerate or commit crimes. A significant portion of them are driven to desperate measures due to the pressures of life, making it a primary cause. If we think from this perspective, then eliminating the causes that drive people to desperate measures requires fundamental research and implementation.

In criminology, poverty is analyzed as one of the causes of crime. If we want to prevent the increase in crime, it is crucial to alleviate poverty. Therefore, "poverty" is the cause of crime for some criminals in Shanghai. Thus, alleviating poverty is not only a charitable endeavor of benevolence but also a proactive measure to prevent crime.

Let us assume that there are three types of people in Shanghai as mentioned above, whom we shall tentatively call displaced persons, who should be rescued. The first type is the gaunt-faced beggars. The second type is the idle thieves. The third type is the violent thugs who commit robberies at night. The latter two types often evolve from the former two. Therefore, by thoroughly rescuing the first two types of people, the latter type will naturally decrease.

So, who should bear the responsibility for this rescue? Of course, the government should take the lead, and society should fulfill its duty to assist. We believe that the rescue method should not be passive sheltering but actively enabling them to produce and support themselves. Sheltering requires enormous expenses, and if it is disbanded due to insufficient funding, it will not be thorough. Only by carefully planning simple and easy-to-implement production methods, forcibly ordering them to engage in productive work, and applying strict management can we achieve lasting results. On the one hand, the displaced persons can become self-reliant, and on the other hand, the appearance of Shanghai can be improved, criminal cases can be reduced, and social tranquility can be ensured, which is a great gain.

Here, we suggest adopting the "displaced persons resettlement" method. The so-called "resettlement" here does not require large-scale economic investment, and the resettlement area is not a remote border region. We advocate opening up all the wasteland in the suburbs of Shanghai as resettlement areas for displaced persons, forcibly concentrating all beggars in Shanghai, except for the old, weak, and young. All idlers without legitimate occupations from docks, bus stations, and other places should also be forcibly concentrated, transported away from Shanghai, and settled in one or several locations, where they will receive short-term agricultural skills training and be assigned to farming. If there is not enough wasteland, they can help nearby farmers with their farming or work as long-term laborers.

We hope that the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Ministry of Social Welfare will take charge of this matter, investigate the wasteland in the suburbs, and properly plan the implementation methods. The Citizens Welfare Association will assist from the sidelines, and the police will be responsible for the forced relocation. Through division of labor and cooperation, success can be achieved.

Increasing production is already a universally accepted slogan. Utilizing wasteland to increase agricultural production and food supply is naturally a crucial measure. Ensuring public security and reforming Shanghai are the goals set by the Shanghai Municipal Government. Therefore, relocating displaced persons can reduce criminal cases in society and ensure a certain level of public security, which is a multi-beneficial measure. We hope that prompt action will be taken.

### ### North-South Exchange Restrictions to be Completely Lifted Next Month Realizing Free Flow of Funds in All Regions

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - Due to various reasons, exchange between the North and South has not been smooth in the past, and restrictions have been quite strict, which has had a great impact on the people's economy, financial regulation, and exchange of goods. The financial authorities of the National Government, aware of this, have been striving to improve the situation. Since April 1st of last year, when the Allied nations, in order to assist us in completing the unification of the currency system, resolutely stopped issuing new military scrip on their own, the authorities first determined the ratio between the Central Reserve Bank Notes and the United Reserve Bank Notes, stipulating a ratio of 100 Central Reserve Bank Notes to 18 United Reserve Bank Notes. By December 1st of last year, the Central Reserve Bank Notes were further expanded for circulation to the Huaihai region, and used concurrently with the United Reserve Bank Notes. From April 10th to April 30th of this year, it was further stipulated that the Central Reserve Bank Notes and the United Reserve Bank Notes in the Huaihai region would be fully exchanged within a limited time. In addition, the regulations for people carrying paper money between the North and South were revised, and the original quota was appropriately increased. In order to crack down on the black market prices of the United Reserve Bank Notes in Central China (especially Shanghai) and to stabilize the entire financial system, 17 banks were designated in Shanghai to handle the exchange of Central Reserve Bank Notes and United Reserve Bank Notes. All of these measures are major steps taken by the authorities to regulate North-South finance. Since their implementation, they have greatly benefited the National Government's overall financial regulation and the exchange of goods between the North and South. Now, in order to implement the established policies and promote smoother progress, the authorities have decided to completely lift the exchange restrictions between the North and South from May 1st, and free exchange will be allowed without restrictions in the future. This measure has far-reaching significance in various aspects, whether it is the government's financial policies, the people's economic activities, or the exchange of goods between the North and South. Therefore, the news has been widely spread, and the people of the North and South have placed deeper and more enthusiastic trust in the government, which will greatly contribute to the completion of the National Government's wartime economic system and the fulfillment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It is firmly believed that the implementation of this measure will achieve the following great results, which can be predicted.   The exchange of Central Reserve Bank Notes and United Reserve Bank Notes will definitely become smoother in the future, which has great significance for the credit and circulation range of the Central Reserve Bank Notes.   The people's economy in the North and South will also become more active in the future due to the lifting of exchange restrictions, which has a profound impact on the future of the entire national economic construction.   The National Government's financial regulation policies will have another expansion, reaping groundbreaking results, and completing its predetermined goals.   The exchange of goods between the North and South will also become smoother as a result, which has a more profound significance under the National Government's major premise of suppressing commodity prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods.

### ### Japanese Embassy and Finance Minister Zhou Issue Statements

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Embassy issued the following statement on the 26th regarding the exchange rate in the North China region, insisting on the ratio of 100 yuan to 18 yuan: The National Government has always insisted on the policy of 100 Central Reserve Bank Notes to 18 United Reserve Bank Notes for exchange in the North China region. This time, the abolition of general exchange restrictions to North China and the implementation of free and unrestricted exchange from May 1st will also be adopted in North China to ensure smooth exchange of normal funds between the two regions. In the past, the Japanese government has insisted on the established policy of the current exchange rate between various Chinese currencies such as Central Reserve Bank Notes and United Reserve Bank Notes and the Japanese yen, and has implemented various measures to strongly support China's currency policy. The National Government's measure this time is to adapt to the Japanese government's policy, so that the economy of the two regions of China, North and South, will become closer. It is very gratifying that it will contribute to China's economic construction and the completion of the Greater East Asia War.

Statement by the Finance Minister: The Central Reserve Bank Notes and the China United Reserve Bank Notes have long been the only currencies in the peaceful areas of the North and South, and have been deeply trusted by the people. They are particularly convenient for the circulation of goods and financial regulation. Recently, since the currency system in Huaihai Province has been repeatedly adjusted by the government and continued to be strongly promoted, all exchange transactions between the North and South have gradually become smoother. The government still insists on the exchange rate of 100 yuan to 18 yuan between the Central Reserve Bank Notes and the China United Reserve Bank Notes, so that it remains stable at all times. As for the general exchange situation, in view of the actual situation, the exchange limit between the North and South was previously raised to 5,000 yuan to meet the needs. Now, for the convenience of all the people, the previous exchange limit will be abolished from May 1st, and the ratio of 100 yuan to 18 yuan between the Central Reserve Bank Notes and the United Reserve Bank Notes will not be changed in any way, and will still be maintained. Hereafter, normal transactions on exchange will be free, and speculative capital movements will still be strictly cracked down on as in the past. It is firmly believed that the exchange of goods and the regulation of funds between the North and South will definitely become smoother in the future. Their economic relationship will also become closer as a result. I hope that everyone will understand this and assist us in achieving success. If anyone engages in speculative transactions and violates the law, the government will never be lenient, and I hope you will pay attention to this.

Therefore, it was implemented to fully exchange with the United Reserve Bank Notes at a ratio of 100 yuan to 18 yuan. In order to supervise and understand the situation of the full exchange, the Ministry of Finance previously sent Mr. Hu Yanxi, a specialist from the ministry, to the province for inspection. The official has now submitted the inspection results to the ministry.

### ### Japanese Yasukuni Shrine Holds Fifth Extraordinary Grand Festival His Majesty the Emperor Personally Visits to Worship the Spirits of the War Dead

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - The fifth extraordinary grand festival of the Japanese Yasukuni Shrine was held on the 24th with solemnity under the devout worship of Japanese officials and people. Everyone knows that the Yasukuni Shrine is a shrine dedicated to the spirits of the soldiers who have devoted their lives to the country throughout the ages and has a long history. Therefore, the architecture of the shrine is very magnificent, and the trees in the shrine reach the sky, forming a natural solemnity. At the same time, it is also the center of worship for the Japanese people. Today, as the war enters a severe stage, the Yasukuni Shrine is even more worshiped. The spirits of the war dead worshiped in this extraordinary grand festival are the brave Japanese soldiers who gloriously died in the period from the Manchurian Incident to March 21, Showa 17 after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. In order to comfort the careers of the heroic soldiers in heaven and to pay deep respect to the families of the warriors, this grand festival is even more grand and solemn. From a few days ago, the families of the warriors from all over the country gathered in Tokyo to express their condolences and gratitude to their sons, fathers, and husbands. At the same time, they also received great respect and gratitude from the general public. Slogans such as "Be grateful to the spirits of the war dead, be respectful to the families" were posted everywhere on the streets and alleys. And the slogans have been fully expressed in fact. The 25th was the second day of the grand festival. Early in the morning, the sky was covered with a layer of dark spirits, and it was raining continuously, as if the gods also expressed their deep condolences to these spirits of the war dead. At 1:15 PM, His Majesty the Emperor, accompanied by civil and military officials, visited the Yasukuni Shrine. More than 50,000 family members were lined up on both sides of the road leading to the shrine to welcome His Majesty the Emperor and pay their respects to His Majesty. They all felt the honor of the emperor. In the sound of the naval spirit music, His Majesty the Emperor, under the welcoming of the ministers and the guidance of the chairman of the grand festival committee, Zewamoto, visited the wooden ship and paid homage to the spirits of the war dead. At that time, Japanese officials and civilians also paid remote homage to the heroic spirits of the Yasukuni Shrine in their respective locations, expressing their heartfelt gratitude. After His Majesty the Emperor returned to the Imperial Palace, the general public flocked to the shrine to worship. Although it was still raining constantly, their gratitude made them unable to care about all this, so the road leading to the shrine was impenetrable. They walked to the shrine one by one and bowed deeply. The families were also worshiping piously in teams. The four sides of the shrine were piled with tributes from various officials and organizations. On both sides of the approach, there were tall murals about the Greater East Asia War and modern Japanese weapons on display, fully showing the power of the Japanese army. The cherry blossoms in Yasukuni were in full bloom. The fragments of flowers, falling on the ground and on people's faces, also seemed to be sadly falling because of the death of the heroic soldiers. In short, the Yasukuni Shrine was shrouded in a solemn atmosphere, but people suppressed the grief in their hearts and decided to continue the legacy of the martyrs and bravely move towards the path of victory.

### British Troops in Imphal Region Trapped and Isolated Japanese Aircraft Formations Bombard Enemy Artillery Positions

Rangoon, 26th (Central News Agency) - The enemy's British Fourth Corps has been trapped and isolated in the Imphal Basin, and now can only rely on aerial resupply to continue its desperate resistance. The Barel, Nungshigum, and Seibom areas, which the enemy army relied on, have already been under direct attack by the Japanese army, so the troubles of the enemy's Fourth Corps are increasing day by day. Mountbatten, the supreme commander of the anti-Axis forces in Southeast Asia, who recently went to Ceylon, is actively using air force units to try to rescue the two isolated armies of the Fourth Corps and the airborne troops, but because the rainy season is approaching, aerial resupply has become increasingly difficult. Therefore, the ground troops of the enemy army have a strong feeling that they are eagerly waiting for the air force to rescue them. Also, the enemy's air force is already feeling the danger of the Japanese-Indian Allied forces entering the forward base in eastern India, and has now moved the air force combat headquarters to Calcutta. At the same time, it is gathering military supplies and the remnants of the Seventh Division, which was defeated in the Muxi battle, to rescue the isolated army trapped in Imphal. Also, on the 21st, a group of enemy Douglas transport planes flying over a certain area numbered 51 heading east and 15 heading west. It seems that all of those heading west were transporting the wounded. In short, the Imphal Basin is now in a chaotic state on the eve of a major battle.

Rangoon, 26th (Central News Agency) - On the 24th evening, two squadrons of Japanese army fighter-bombers attacked enemy artillery positions near Imphal, causing a large fire in enemy military facilities. On the way back, they encountered enemy planes and shot down one P40 fighter and one large transport plane, Douglas B-c-B. The Japanese air force safely returned.

### ### Muslims Rise Up to Fight for Independence and Freedom The Very Reverend Archbishop Issues a Statement

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - Ibrahim, the head of the Muslim community in Japan, issued a statement saying: The Very Reverend Archbishop of Jerusalem, Feyseni, called on Muslims all over the world to rise up and cooperate with the Japanese and Indian armies to suppress the violent British and Americans. Now all the Muslims in East Asia have risen up to respond to this move, which is very noteworthy. The Very Reverend Ibrahim has long been saddened and angered by the British and American aggression in West Asia. He believes that if there is no Japan in Asia, there will be no recovery. Therefore, he devoted his life's energy to the cause of the revival of Asia. Now the Indian independence movement has a strong military organization. The Asian Muslim ethnic groups of India are now united and moving towards the heavenly path of liberation. Today's opportunity for liberation is truly cherished by all Muslims, because the Axis powers' declaration of war on the aggressors Britain and the United States is the same as the religious duty of Muslims. When we Muslims participate in the war of the Axis powers, the peace and freedom of all Muslims can be fully obtained. All Muslim compatriots in East Asia, namely Malaysia, Java, and Sumatra, have expelled the British and American forces in this Greater East Asia War and restored their hope and freedom. Muslim friends in India, please respond to the Japanese and Indian armies and fight for freedom and peace immediately. Muslim friends in West Asia, the military pressure of the Axis powers has made the British and Americans extremely embarrassed. In their panic, they entrusted the holy land of Palestine to the Jews. This holy land will be bought and sold by the poisonous fangs of capitalism. Their immorality and their internal contradictions are the terminal symptoms of their imperialism and have been fully exposed. Muslims resolutely resist their oppression of religion and deprivation of freedom. Now, when the 120 million liberated Muslims in East Asia and the 80 million liberated Muslims in India cooperate with the 100 million friends in West Asia, the liberation of the Muslim ethnic groups will be realized quickly. I am extremely happy to see the realization of the liberation of Muslims at the age of 95.

### German Observations on Opening a Second Front: Frequent Military Movements Indicate Inevitable Implementation Sooner or Later

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - Recently, the issue of a second front has been the subject of much debate, leading to increased tension in Europe. As for whether a second front will be realized, in our judgment, the anti-Axis powers, in order to ensure the continued success of the Soviet Union, must not avoid any sacrifices in creating a second front. Recently, anti-Axis troop and warship movements to and from Britain have become increasingly frequent. A large number of transport ships have concentrated in southern England, and landing craft from the Mediterranean have successively sailed to Britain. American commanders stationed in Italy with landing operation experience have also traveled to Britain one after another. Furthermore, the United States is transporting large numbers of troops and supplies to Britain daily. All of this is in preparation for a landing. Therefore, the anti-Axis forces' second front will definitely be realized, and it is not the same as the false propaganda of a year ago. However, it is necessary to study when, how, and where the anti-Axis forces will land.

Possible Landing Locations

Include the Brittany Peninsula, the French coast, and the southern coast of the Mediterranean. The purpose of landing operations in these locations is to disperse and contain German forces. The true attack on the continent must select a location closest to British territory, and therefore must utilize the Strait of Dover. This is all based on military knowledge and deduction.

Another possible landing location is southern Norway or countries like Denmark and Sweden. After landing here, an air force base could be established and a direct assault launched from northeast Germany into the heart of Germany. From a military perspective, the anti-Axis forces are quite likely to adopt this approach, which has political implications for attacking Central Europe. On the one hand, it can avoid the Atlantic coast and attack Germany from the rear, while also reducing the sacrifice of soldiers and utilizing material advantages. If this tactic is adopted, the anti-Axis forces will likely first force Sweden to join the war. As for the

Tactical Methods

The tactics used in the Pacific will also be adopted, initially with large-scale air force bombing to destroy German air force and coastal defenses, completely seizing control of the seas and skies over Western Europe. Then, landing craft will be launched in a coordinated effort, landing several divisions of troops simultaneously, along with large-scale parachute drops to secure landing points. After that, the large numbers of anti-Axis troops waiting in Britain will be directly landed, continuing to expand the landing points and developing a frontal combat situation. However, German coastal defenses have been built up dramatically over the past year. According to British air force reconnaissance, the coastline is equipped with as many as 50,000 anti-aircraft guns, making air force activity quite difficult. Moreover, all key positions are fully prepared and can continue to fight for several months without relying on external supplies. Therefore, based on common sense, seizing German coastal strongholds is practically impossible. Furthermore, a report from the US House of Representatives Armed Services Committee stated that the initial month of a landing operation would require the sacrifice of 75,000 lives, a truly frightening figure. From this perspective, the anti-Axis forces' attempt to land on the northern coast of France will not succeed without substantial military preparations.

Speculation on the Timing

Regarding the timing of the landing operation, anti-Axis propaganda claims that it will begin soon, while the German side states that German forces are fully prepared for a landing at any time and in any place. However, Spanish newspapers and Lisbon telegrams both state that the time for a landing operation has not yet arrived and may be delayed until this autumn. The reason given is that German forces still have more troops than expected, and the anti-Axis preparations are also incomplete. The anti-Axis forces must first gain air supremacy over Germany before landing. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, the anti-Axis forces focused on bombing German airfields. However, US Secretary of War Stimson recently admitted that the German air force has regained its strength. Of course, the damage suffered by the German aircraft industry is also considerable, but since last year, a decision was made to build many fire-resistant factories in various locations, and its production plan is gradually on track, with the production rate increasing more than a year ago. From another perspective, the anti-Axis landing force consists of approximately 15 to 30 divisions, which is not a small number, but the transportation of one division requires 300,000 tons of ships. This is a major problem in difficult transportation areas such as southern Italy. Therefore, although the anti-Axis forces are concentrating their efforts to prepare for a landing operation, ships are a significant issue.

### Discussion on Fundamental vs. Stopgap Solutions to the Food Problem

— Yu Nong

The people are the foundation of the nation, and food is the most important thing for the people. People's food is related to safety and security. At this critical moment of the Great East Asia War, the supply of the front lines and the stability of the rear depend entirely on sufficient food reserves. Otherwise, stability cannot be guaranteed. The population of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces is approximately 110 million. Farmers account for about 80% of the population, while merchants, artisans, and other professionals account for about 20%. Judging by the peacetime rice production of these three provinces, it was already insufficient. Since the East Asian Incident, transportation has been obstructed, and governance has been inconsistent, leading to a gradual decrease in production and an increasingly unsustainable supply. In Zhejiang Province, eastern Zhejiang is known for its rice production and must rely on supplies from Hunan, Jiangxi, and Southeast Asia. Currently, transportation to Southeast Asia, Hunan, and Jiangxi is blocked, and supplies cannot be obtained. Although eastern Zhejiang has a large rice production, there is currently no way to purchase it. Jiangsu and Anhui provinces are not entirely rice-producing areas (60% produce coarse grains, and 40% produce rice). While the 88 million farmers can cultivate and feed themselves, the 22 million merchants, artisans, and other professionals must rely on the farmers' supplies. The shortfall is self-evident. If we assume that each person consumes an average of seven *he* of rice per day, the monthly rice requirement is 2.1 *dou*. For 22 million people, the monthly requirement is approximately 4.62 million *shi*, and the annual requirement is approximately 55.44 million *shi* (each *shi* is approximately 160 *jin*, and 10 *shi* is one ton, totaling 5.544 million tons). Adding the supplies for Allied forces, which require approximately 300,000 tons per year, the total annual requirement is 5.84 million tons. However, a survey of the rice production in various areas of the three provinces under the government's control estimates that the annual production is approximately 7 million tons. After deducting the 5.6 million tons of rice consumed by farmers and the supplies for Allied forces, there is only 1.1 million tons remaining. The gap is still 4.74 million tons. If a solution is not found quickly, the coming disaster will be unpredictable. In my opinion, the solution must address both the root cause and the symptoms to ensure a sufficient supply. I humbly offer my suggestions, hoping they will be adopted.

(A) Addressing the Root Cause

Abolish various rice purchasing agencies. Since the implementation of food control, there have been numerous purchasing agencies with overlapping responsibilities, leading to inevitable exploitation and rampant corruption. As a result, the Ministry of Agriculture is facing a crisis, and the military and civilians are complaining. It would be better to abolish all of them and allow the government and the people to cooperate directly in free purchasing. The provincial governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui should be responsible for directing the county governments and local chambers of commerce and *baojia* to cooperate in setting prices and purchasing rice. The government can reduce significant administrative expenses, and farmers can reduce the suffering of multiple layers of oppression. It is expected that purchasing will be more convenient than through control agencies.

Encourage farmers to increase production. In recent years, there have been bandits everywhere, and farmers cannot live and work in peace. The heavy burden of miscellaneous taxes and levies is unbearable. Each year's harvest is not enough to feed themselves, and after the new grain is harvested, the government's low purchase price cannot cover the cost, leading to unforeseen losses. As a result, farmers are abandoning cultivation or even switching to other crops. If they are not quickly encouraged to cultivate, an artificial famine will soon occur. The method of encouragement should be to quickly provide low-interest agricultural loans, lending capital before planting to support production, or allowing farmers to freely sell to chambers of commerce after the new grain is harvested to obtain cash for turnover. If farmers are willing to pre-sell, they should be allowed to contract with the chamber of commerce at any time, allowing farmers' freedom without any coercion. However, the loaned funds must be secured by grain, and the specific measures will be determined separately.

Exempt agricultural fertilizer from taxes. Farmers rely on fertilizer for cultivation. In recent years, fertilizer prices have soared, and transportation is difficult, with overlapping taxes, leading to high costs. Poor farmers cannot afford to buy it, resulting in reduced production. If the government can issue a clear decree to allow the unimpeded transportation of agricultural fertilizer and exempt it from all exorbitant taxes, it will expand the source of fertilizer, which is also a way to subsidize farmers' cultivation and promote production.

Increase the price of rice in producing areas purchased by the government. The German agricultural policy is very thorough in protecting farmers' production. For example, if imported food costs 8 *jiao* per *jin*, the government intentionally raises the price by 3 *jiao* when purchasing domestically produced grain, purchasing it at 1.1 *yuan* per *jin*. With this guarantee, farmers are happy to cultivate, so agricultural production increases daily, and people's livelihoods improve daily. During this war, the country will not lack food because of this. During this war, if we imitate this practice, raising the price of rice in the producing areas and setting a purchase standard to notify farmers in various places, I know they will be eager to transport it.

The above points are the outline of addressing the root cause. However, it must be remembered that during the critical period of the decisive battle, the supply of military food and the needs of the people are both urgent and cannot be delayed. At this time of the year when the old harvest is depleted and the new harvest is not yet in, the rice price cannot be controlled, and the amount of grain currently stored in various places is unknown, making it difficult to allocate and plan. As a stopgap measure for immediate relief, I will list a few points for discussion.

Abolish checkpoints and allow free transportation. The price of rice in Shanghai is more than double the price of rice in the interior. For example, the selling price in rice-producing areas is 2,000 yuan, while in Shanghai it is 4,000 to 4,500 yuan, a significant difference. The reason for this is that there are too many checkpoints along the way, causing difficulties and exploitation, resulting in higher costs. Adding transportation costs and rice merchants' commissions, it is impossible to make up for the losses without increasing the rice price. If the government can resolutely abolish various checkpoints, explicitly prohibit extortion and delays, designate areas, and allow rice merchants to freely transport rice, the rice price will immediately decrease, and the rice shortage in Shanghai will not be as severe as expected.

Provide sufficient food rations to eliminate the black market. If the source of rice is sufficient, the people's panic will be eliminated, and those who hoard grain will naturally decrease because there is no profit to be made. The rationing system is a good method, but insufficient rations can indirectly promote the proliferation of the black market. Judging by the current amount of rations per person, it is not enough for ten days of sustenance. The people are forced to buy rice on the black market, and because there are many buyers, the price gradually increases, causing the people even greater suffering. The remedy is to appropriately increase the amount of rations, providing at least two *dou* per person per month. With sufficient rations, the people no longer need to rely on the black market, and the black market will be eliminated without being suppressed.

Increase the price of rice to absorb farmers' rice. In Shanghai, the normal daily sales of rice are approximately 10,000 *shi*, with a monthly requirement of 300,000 *shi*, including the rice transported to other ports by ships and passengers. Although the population has increased sharply, the amount of rice transported by ships and passengers has decreased compared to the past. This decrease cannot offset the household consumption. The total is still no more than 300,000 *shi*, which is 30,000 tons per month, with each *shi* weighing 10 tons. The total annual requirement is 360,000 tons. In order to alleviate the panic over food in Shanghai, the remaining 1.1 million tons of rice in the producing areas should be quickly transported to Shanghai by increasing the price. All the abuses of checkpoints, extortion, and delays should be eliminated. After transportation, the rice price will not be too expensive. If the amount of absorbed rice is insufficient, it can be supplemented with mixed grains to meet the daily requirement of seven *he* per person. With sufficient daily food, the people naturally do not need to rely on the black market, and the rice price will tend towards equilibrium. Since the three provinces produce 7 million tons of rice, and farmers themselves consume 5.6 million tons, if farmers are willing to sell at a good price, they can voluntarily mix grains in their own diet and sell their own rice. Through this transfer, the Shanghai rice shortage can be easily alleviated. This is the best policy.

In short, the government's purchase of rice, regardless of the time, must listen to the people's opinions and cooperate with the people. In this time of war, it is especially necessary to make the people thoroughly understand the government's national policy, wholeheartedly share weal and woe with the government, and cut through difficulties together. Then, the problems will be easily solved. Last year, when the new grain was harvested, the official price was limited to 280 yuan per *shi*, while the selling price in Shanghai was as high as 800 yuan per *shi*. Purchasing officials acted vigorously, forcibly purchasing rice. Farmers wept silently, unable to complain, while corrupt officials took the opportunity to seek profit and enrich themselves. Farmers suffered from this pain, and the cost of fertilizer was too high. The fruits of a year of hard work were not even enough to cover the cost, and there were also the disturbances of exorbitant taxes and levies. Those who abandoned their fields were everywhere. In this situation, the military and civilian food shortage is unimaginable. I still remember that after the Russian Revolution, the government's purchase of food was limited to a low price, and farmers fled in droves. Most of the land was uncultivated. Although the government had harsh laws and strict punishments, it could not force the farmers to resume cultivation, resulting in an unprecedented disaster. This is the reaction of not being able to cooperate with the people. The people's resentment is why they do not want to be subjects. Forcible purchasing at a limited price failed in Russia. It should not be repeated. Therefore, in my opinion, we should imitate the German method of protecting farmers, encouraging production to strengthen the decisive battle in East Asia. On the one hand, the government and the people should seek sincere cooperation without any estrangement. Take advantage of the time before planting to inform the farmers about the government's policies and encourage them to cultivate with peace of mind. On the other hand, promulgate measures to encourage them and eliminate the checkpoints that cause extortion and delays. Then, the current difficulties can be alleviated somewhat, and future production can also be effectively increased. This is a policy that addresses both the root cause and the symptoms.

### Mayor Chen Fetes Japanese Minister Usami: Also Delivers Welcome Speech

Japanese Minister Usami arrived in Shanghai to take up his new post. To express their welcome, the municipal government hosted a banquet at 7:00 PM yesterday (25th). From the embassy, there were Minister Usami, Counselor Okazaki, Consul General Yano, Secretary Okumura, Consul Nakagawa, Secretary Hanakada, and Secretary Nakada. From the municipal government, there were Mayor Chen, the Secretary General, Advisor Funatsu, and various bureau chiefs, counselors, and secretaries, totaling more than 30 people. During the banquet, Mayor Chen delivered a speech, saying that Minister Usami has been in China for many years and has long been a friend of China. This appointment will certainly see the implementation of new policies more actively. Since the recovery of the concessions by this city, various measures have been actively implemented with the support of the Japanese Embassy. Economic problems are particularly heavy and require increased efforts from both sides. He knows that the Minister is very concerned about this and hopes for constant guidance. Minister Usami replied that arriving in Shanghai feels like returning home, with a sense of closeness. When the Shanghai concessions were returned, he was in Tokyo and expressed his feelings by telegram, saying that China would certainly develop strongly after recovering the concessions. He is now impressed by the good results of the municipal government in all aspects. At this important time, the Sino-Japanese allies must strengthen cooperation to overcome difficulties in order to achieve common goals. He is determined to work together with everyone and asks for more assistance. After the speeches, the guests raised their glasses to wish each other health and happiness, and the party ended in joy.

### Municipal Economic Bureau Orders Submission of Details from All Factories

In order to encourage increased production and find ways to alleviate the difficulties of various factories in the city, the Municipal Economic Bureau has ordered all sub-associations to quickly submit detailed information on the factories in order to seek comprehensive solutions. The original order is as follows: "Economic measures during wartime should prioritize increased production. Recently, due to restrictions on electricity, shortages of coal, or difficulties in obtaining raw materials, various factories have been hindered in their work and production has been reduced, which is extremely detrimental to the national economy and people's livelihood and has a huge impact. In order to understand the actual situation of various factories, this bureau hereby orders the association to instruct its members to report the detailed situation of each factory in a list, so as to make comprehensive plans and find ways to alleviate the difficulties. The association is also ordered to compile and report to the bureau within a time limit, without delay." It has been learned that the bureau has ordered the following associations to comply, including coal briquette industry, alcohol industry, rubber industry, blacksmithing industry, woolen textile industry, leather manufacturing industry, silverware industry, tin printing and can manufacturing industry, paint manufacturing industry, bicycle manufacturing industry, papermaking industry, cotton textile industry, electrical appliance industry, tobacco factory industry, machinery industry, cloth factory industry, chemical industry, enamel industry, hardware industry, electric welding industry, match industry, silk weaving industry, casting industry, glass industry, silk factory industry, soap and candle industry, vacuum bottle industry, refrigeration industry, ice industry, electroplating industry, and match raw material industry. As this matter concerns the vital interests of all industries in the city, the associations are ordered to submit the information quickly.

### Municipal Government Orders Dance Schools to Close

Dance schools are rampant in this city, harboring filth and causing great harm. At this time when we are implementing the New National Movement and rectifying the wartime national life, we should strictly ban them. It is learned that the municipal government has ordered the first and second police bureaus to close all dance schools by the end of June.

### Wishing for a Unified Reform of Customs

— Chen Binhe

Social customs regarding weddings, funerals, and celebrations have long tended toward extravagance. Even during this time of war, when frugality is advocated, luxury persists, and in some cases, even surpasses peacetime levels. It is imperative that we all strive for reform and restore proper customs. My personal view is as follows:

Joyous celebrations and funeral arrangements are originally private matters for individuals and families. While offering congratulations or condolences out of friendship is acceptable, it should never focus on ostentatious displays of material wealth. As the saying goes, "It's the thought that counts, not the gift," and sincere concern is more meaningful than lavish gifts. Given the current transportation difficulties and the busy schedules of many, even the absence of a physical presence should be perfectly acceptable.

In practice, most current gift-giving customs are wasteful. For instance, flower baskets, wreaths, and banners with gilded characters are all impractical. Even the red paper used for wrapping is wasteful, consuming valuable resources. Therefore, we should advocate for refraining from sending gifts.

A more progressive approach recently adopted is to convert gifts into cash for charitable purposes. Taking advantage of festive occasions, gifts are converted into cash and donated to public welfare endeavors. This avoids extravagance and can be considered a win-win situation. However, in reality, many engage in converting gifts into cash for charity while still indulging in lavish displays. Moreover, the practice of converting gifts into cash should be subject to certain conditions. For example, it should only be appropriate for birthdays of individuals aged sixty or seventy and above, or for younger generations who have achieved success in their careers and made contributions to the country and society.

For friends facing difficult circumstances, generous cash gifts should be offered during weddings or funerals to express mutual support.

The above points are based on my personal observations of society. Especially now, as I prepare for my son's wedding, I am deeply troubled by the inquiries from relatives and friends about the date. Indulging in extravagant customs contradicts my long-held belief in wartime frugality, which is unacceptable to me in order to maintain consistency between my words and actions. Converting gifts into cash and donating them to public welfare is also inappropriate because my personal status and reputation are insufficient, and my son's wedding cannot be compared to the birthdays of elders. I dare not accept such gestures. However, the decision regarding my children's wedding cannot be made solely by me or one party. Therefore, I sincerely request that relatives and friends refrain from sending congratulatory gifts and avoid taking the trouble to visit. Even if gifts are sent, I will absolutely refuse to accept them. If you insist on attending, I will not provide any reception. This statement is made in the hope that you will show understanding and leniency.

### Residential Certificates in the Old Zhabei District to be Reissued Soon

The method for exchanging residential certificates in the First District of the city has been approved by the First Bureau and the Baojia District. Starting this month, each branch bureau and Baojia section will be responsible for handling the exchange in the old First District and the newly merged areas of western Shanghai, in accordance with the Baojia regulations. After receiving notification from the Baojia head, residents should promptly proceed to the Baojia section of their respective branch bureau to complete the application procedures such as fingerprinting for the exchange. The first batch of residential certificates for the Zhabei District Baojia section has been processed and will be issued soon. Each Baojia head will be notified to inform residents to bring their original citizen identification cards to the section to exchange for the new residential certificates. Residents must exchange their certificates promptly upon receiving notification to expedite the process and ensure smooth completion in batches.

### Municipal Grain Bureau Rewards Land Reclamation and Planting

In order to actively increase agricultural production in the city, the Municipal Grain Bureau has been ordered to maximize the development of idle and abandoned land in the near suburbs and rural areas of Shanghai. The bureau has established a task force to investigate idle and abandoned land and to encourage citizens to claim and cultivate it. With the approval of the Municipal Government, all previously uncultivated arable land, land previously cultivated but now abandoned, abandoned building foundations unsuitable for habitation, and wasteland can be claimed and cultivated by automatically applying to the Municipal Grain Bureau from today. The Municipal Government will grant priority rights to land reclamation to encourage agricultural production and increase national strength.

### Mr. Ogura, Economic Advisor, Visited Allied Military and Political Leaders Yesterday; Tea Party Welcoming Him from All Circles Today

Mr. Masatsune Ogura, the newly appointed Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, visited the Japanese Embassy and Consulate in Shanghai, as well as the military and naval authorities, after arriving in Shanghai a few days ago. This was his first official visit after taking office. This afternoon (the 27th) at 4:00 PM, a welcoming tea party will be held at the Cathay Hotel by the Chinese and Japanese authorities. It is reported that financial, industrial, and commercial organizations in Shanghai have also scheduled tea parties to welcome him warmly and exchange views on economic development.

### Authorities Absolutely Prohibit Illegal Gold Speculation to Stabilize Finance and Suppress Prices

Recently, there have been widespread rumors in Shanghai that the buying and selling of gold are unrestricted, and prices are not limited, which has aroused serious attention from the public. In the past, the soaring prices in Shanghai were caused by the changes in gold and grain prices. The prices of all commodities were transferred based on the rise and fall of gold and grain prices. Among them, speculators manipulated and suffered greater influence. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the government authorities have been cracking down on illegal transactions of gold and grain to stabilize finance and suppress prices. First, the hoarding of grain was cracked down. Then, the gold trading market was cracked down. In recent years, the crackdown on off-market gold transactions has been even more severe. The authorities of Shanghai have repeatedly detained and warned illegal gold market brokers to eliminate the gold market group, and the finance has been stabilized. Now, there is a sudden rumor that gold can be freely bought and sold, and that prices are not limited. The general public feels doubtful. According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiry to the authorities, although the government authorities have not controlled gold, they will impose stricter penalties on those who engage in illegal gold trading or speculative manipulation in order to maintain finance and stabilize prices.

### The 33rd Issue of Flour for Residents Outside of the First District Will Be Sold Starting Today

The Municipal Grain Bureau's allocation of the 33rd issue of flour per capita for all districts other than the First District has been fully approved, and will be sold from today (the 27th) until the 2nd of next month. It is stipulated that each person can purchase one market catty at a price of 11 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. After the deadline, the flour certificates for this issue will be invalid and no longer reissued.

### Temporary Cotton Cloth Rationing Will Be Implemented Uniformly in All Districts

The Shanghai Commercial Control Committee had already printed enough temporary cotton cloth purchase certificates, totaling 3,096,000, and sent them to the Municipal Government for distribution with the seal of the designated merchants. At that time, the Municipal Government had not yet shown the exact number of recent population, so it temporarily handled it based on the population statistics of 3,100,000 sent by the Baojia. Now that the Municipal Government has found that the population in all districts of Shanghai is 3,452,227, the Shanghai Commercial Control Committee has made up the shortage of 356,327 certificates and handed them over to the Cloth Industry Association to change the retailers and separately stamped them, and sent them to the Economic Bureau for distribution. At that time, all districts can be sold uniformly. The reports in yesterday's newspaper that the number of cloth certificates was printed according to the number of people in the First District and that additional printing was required were all untrue.

Economic Commentary

### Increasing the Harvest Per Mu

When the Supreme Economic Advisor, Mr. Ogura, answered reporters' questions the other day, he believed that in order to solve the problem of commodity prices, there must be two kinds of measures: one is to increase production, and the other is to reduce currency circulation. Because increasing production depends on the joint efforts of the government and the people, let's talk about increasing production.

Increasing production is naturally aimed at increasing the necessities such as food as the primary goal. Taking Europe in this World War as an example, the shortage of important food crops is being gradually supplemented every day, and what is of particular concern is to increase the yield per hectare in southeastern Europe to restore the average production of Europe. According to German calculations, if the yield per hectare in southeastern Europe can be increased to the current European average, then the food self-sufficiency of the European continent can be completed. We can put it another way: if the yield per mu in southeastern China can be increased to the current Chinese average, then China's food self-sufficiency can be completed.

However, to increase the output per mu in various parts of the country, it is only possible after obtaining sufficient labor, fertilizers, high-quality seeds, and complete agricultural machinery. Looking around the agricultural affairs in the country today, I am afraid that from now on, the yield per mu will not only be difficult to increase, but will even inevitably decrease, because a part of the labor has been transformed into "single helpers," a part of the rice and cotton seeds has been replaced by the seeds of beans and millet, and a part of the farm machinery has often been sold as waste metal to maintain life. Therefore, to achieve food self-sufficiency and increase the yield per mu, we must start adjusting from these realistic problems, and we must not ignore them because they are small.

### Enemy Forces at Imphal Become Turtles in a Jar, Says Spokesman for Japanese Army Press Department

The spokesman for the Japanese Army Press Department stationed in Shanghai, China, at a routine press conference yesterday (the 26th) at 3:00 p.m., met with Chinese journalists from Shanghai and spoke of the importance of the great encirclement battle of Imphal, and strongly condemned the enemy's absurd counter-propaganda.

### Completion of Tight Encirclement

The spokesman first said: After April 12, the military operations of the Japanese army have made more progress, completely concentrated on Imphal and Seirel, and completed the tight encirclement. The enemy forces in the heavy encirclement on all sides actually have the 17th Division, the 20th Division, the 23rd Division, and the Mechanized Brigade under the 4th Army, all of which have become turtles in a jar, waiting to be annihilated. If Imphal falls, the Japanese army can directly approach Manipur and cut off the railway from Assam to Bengal. The enemy is now relying on this railway to send reinforcements deeply to try to defend the important stronghold of Manipur. However, the speed of the Japanese army's multiple attacks was beyond the enemy's expectations. The Japanese army's powerful troops have now reached 30 kilometers from Manipur, which has greatly frightened the enemy.

### The Enemy's Propaganda is Absolutely Absurd

He then explained the reasons why Imphal had not yet fallen, saying: The Japanese army has not captured Imphal, which is the basis for the enemy's propaganda. The enemy had previously issued pessimistic views and boasted about the strong position and brave fighting of the Japanese army in Imphal and Kohima. Recently, because the Japanese army has not captured Imphal, it has come up with a new idea and made boring propaganda, saying that the Japanese army is in a state of stalemate and has lost its vigor. Therefore, some people have speculated that the Japanese army's progress in the past was rapid, and this time it was because the Japanese army had lost its vigor, or because the Anglo-American forces had strengthened their counter-offensive. Based on the military intelligence and strategic observations of Imphal, I strongly condemned the enemy's counter-propaganda as absolutely slight. Some people's speculation is purely the result of the wrong feeling after being subjected to the enemy's counter-propaganda. It is clear that Imphal and Bareil are trapped in the Japanese army's heavy siege. However, in view of the Japanese army's rapid progress in the past, it is inevitable that some enemies will slip through the net when occupying a place, so this time we are determined to annihilate them completely, without leaving a single soldier, and strive to eliminate the enemy's entire army. Therefore, this time we carefully and closely arranged the encirclement.

### Japanese Army Adopts New Field Tactics

The enemy's main body is the mechanized brigade, equipped with quite excellent equipment. The Japanese army is mainly infantry, and mechanized units and artillery units are auxiliary. Therefore, all parties observe that Imphal is not easy to occupy. As a result, the Japanese army quickly occupied a part of it, and then quickly mobilized a large number of mechanized units. Now all the military equipment has been arranged, and Imphal will be captured in one fell swoop in the near future. The Japanese army uses field warfare to capture the fortress, deploys field warfare around the Imphal area, and arranges the encirclement like an iron barrel. The so-called encirclement is an ideal tactic, that is, outside the encirclement line, the enemy forces that escape from the part establish a new encirclement line. In this way, no enemy soldier will escape, and they will wait for the entire army to be annihilated. The Japanese army's patience this time is for a one-time solution, which has great significance in military and political terms. Occupying Imphal can be a stage for the Indian Northern Operation, and establish the foundation of the Free Indian Government. This time, the Japanese army's attack on Imphal is like a fisherman catching fish, quickly seizing the opportunity, carefully spreading the fishing net, quietly restraining the movement, and then it is not difficult to get a big fish easily.

### Method for Applying for Sublease License Should Be Improved

— Wen Jingxian

The First District Office announced that the sublease license for second landlords should be obtained. If the deadline of April 15 is exceeded, a fine of one yuan per day will be imposed. I live in the western district, and my family are all women and children, and I have a job myself. Because the house I live in has a sublease relationship, in order to comply with the authorities' announcement, I have to ask for leave to handle this procedure.

I immediately filled out the application form and took the spring housing donation ticket to No. 1 Fanhuangbo Road (old Jessfield Road), the Western District Donation and Tax Office, designated in the announcement, to obtain the sublease license. About four or five hundred people lined up every day, but they were rejected for no reason for several days and were not allowed to issue the license, which was countless. There are so many people applying for licenses there every day, but the number of licenses issued is very small, only about ten or twenty or thirty numbers, and then it is announced that the licenses have been issued and stopped. Until the last day of the fifteenth, the doorman suddenly claimed that starting tomorrow, a fine of one yuan per day would be paid, and no more licenses would be issued here. When asked where to apply for it in the future, he ignored it. It really made people waste many days of precious time and ended up with nothing.

Checking the meaning of fines is to punish intentional or negligent behavior. If people abide by the law and go to get a license every day but cannot get it, they will be punished instead. It is not fair. The authorities should reconsider this kind of license issuance procedure and formulate a proper and convenient method. Or set a deadline, and at the same time, publish the application form format and paper size in the newspaper (or have the Baojia head check and forward it), so that the second landlord can write it according to the format, send it to the audit office by registered letter, and then the giving office will issue the date according to the arrival, and order the second landlord to come to collect the license. If there is a letter of request for those who do not come beyond the time limit, they will be punished and pay the fine according to the rules. In this way, people can be spared from traveling every day, and save the trouble of spending time, and can also prevent the staff from making things difficult and taking advantage of them.

### Navy

— By Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang

A real person seemed unable to accept such disturbances and stood alone on the deck at the stern of the ship.

That day's emotions surfaced again.

(That year, that month, armed and returned, show it a limit!)

This may be the emotion harbored by all cadets, but the real person's heart, although similar to this, is different.

He was recalling the imposing fleet of the United States at that time. When he stared at that fleet in the car, he felt an unspeakable joy, that his side's spirit was far superior to it. In the eyes of a real person who had the honor of being a second-dan in Judo, the other side had a big "defect."

(If that's the case, what's there to be afraid of?)

He deeply remembered this in his heart. However, he did not ask anyone. In fact, it was not something to tell others.

Now he is on the verdant sea, secretly recreating the impression of that day in his heart. His mind is as cold and transparent as ice, while the fire in his heart is burning fiercely.

Suddenly, in front of his eyes, a faint black shadow appeared again in the waves. Sharks were swimming again. A big fish about two fathoms up and down, with a silver belly on the left and right, was flying violently. The real person counted the number of sharks with his eyes. Some seemed not to be counted and dived into the water, but there were nine sharks. He seemed to forget everything and only stared at the sharks. Then his body was slowly dragged into the water. The surrounding area turned into an emerald green world. He saw the light blue and white fine sand on the seabed. He turned into a shark. The sharks lined up in a team, quietly and silently, and moved forward towards the pearl -

Suddenly, he noticed that his body was still on the deck. After the illusion disappeared, the sea surface was only floating with endless traces of waves. I don't know when, this ship has already started to move.

### Liu Kuizhong's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition

— Wu Weng

This spring, Shanghai's traditional Chinese painting circles have been particularly full of flower painting exhibitions. After Wang Yachen's "Goldfish" exhibition, there was the exhibition of Bailongshanren Wang Yishi's son, Ji Mei, who also won with flower paintings. From the 25th, Liu Kuizhong's exhibition was held at the Chinese Painting Gallery.

Traditional Chinese painters are often calligraphers, because the use of brushstrokes and bone structure in traditional Chinese paintings must come from the training of jinfa. Therefore, those who are good at calligraphy must be able to write, which has become a common principle. Mr. Liu is a flower painter and a calligrapher at the same time. The reason for his success cannot be an exception to the above. If you don't believe it, look at his works this time, isn't he a genius in both medicine and painting?

After studying Zhongding Seal Script, Mr. Liu obtained the foundation for using brushstrokes, and then went on to write Han and Wei steles. He obtained a strong momentum. Therefore, the style of freehand brushwork composed of sparse and upright, old and simple lines is naturally used on the painting.

His flower paintings do not win by delicate workmanship, neatness, beauty, or density. Although it is related to his medical skills, his unique personality, a kind of heroic temperament of a northerner, cannot be compared with the gentle endowment of a southerner. This can be seen in his calligraphy and can be proved in his paintings.

Starting from this point of view, Mr. Liu, in the process of traditional Chinese painting creation, does not tend to the first-class of the court style meticulous brushwork, but immerses himself in the style of the masters of the Qing Teng Baiyang to Li Futang Wang Chaolin, which is not accidental. The styles of these masters of the Ming and Qing dynasties originated from Chinese literati paintings, and they are also the essence of Chinese flower paintings.

Among the exhibitions this time, such as "Rose", "Nandina", and "Machine", not only are they unrestrained and refined, and bold and unrestrained, but also in the realm of brushwork, ink, and composition, they have created a new path.

### Should Students' Parents Pay the "Anatomy Classroom Fee"?

Recently, the Southeast Medical College, in order to "restore the anatomy classroom," has collected a fee of 1,000 yuan from each student's parent and must be paid within ten days, otherwise they will not be allowed to participate in the exam. Since the incident, the school's equipment has been destroyed and simplified, which has an impact on educational efficiency. Moreover, anatomy is the main course of medical science, so it is not a bad thing to raise funds to rebuild the classroom to benefit students' experiments. However, at a time when prices are soaring and life is difficult, it is not easy for parents to bear the cost of their children going to school. Compared with the extra cost, except for a very few wealthy parents, it is difficult to bear. Moreover, the "restoration of the anatomy classroom" was originally the school's own problem, and students' parents have no obligation to bear this fee. Even if the school is close to the economy and has to discuss it with students' parents, it should also send someone to explain it and add donations according to the parents' ability and week, but it cannot specify the amount and send it within a time limit. Therefore, I hope that the school authorities will take into account the difficulties of the parents and find other good strategies, then the students will be fortunate and the parents will be fortunate. (Respectfully submitted by parent Wu Guangxin).

### Clearing Accumulated Water in Streets and Alleys

The drains in the areas of Yanhai Road, Shipi Lane, Menghua Street and Da Shun Li Main Street in Nanshi have been silted up for a long time, and water has accumulated in the streets and alleys, forming canals. It is now summer, and the stench is unbearable, making it extremely easy to breed mosquitoes and flies. Each household sent a letter to Chengyi Accounting Firm, but there was no solution. Therefore, I hope that the health authorities will pay attention and find a way to dredge them as soon as possible to prevent the spread of cancer and emphasize hygiene. (Tenant Hao Ji)

### Charity Association for Child Welfare Donation Deadline at the End of the Month

The China Child Welfare Association's fundraising campaign for this year's orphaned children's education and care expenses has already received over 1.5 million yuan in donations. This amply demonstrates the enthusiasm of people in society for caring for children, which is truly admirable. As the current fundraising campaign of the association is coming to an end on the 30th of this month, with only a few days remaining, and the donations are still 500,000 yuan short of the target, the association earnestly hopes that all sectors of society will continue to assist in fundraising, so that the work can be completed, and the benefits to the orphaned children will be truly significant.

### Lost Borrowed Items

If any upright gentleman knows their whereabouts, please kindly inform me, and I will be extremely grateful.
