### Rapid Establishment of a Central Representative Body

Just as the National Government declared its participation in the war on January 9th of the 32nd year [of the Republic, 1943], the editorial of this newspaper, "On Participation in the War," first proposed that the primary condition for actual participation in the war must be "respecting popular will" and "concentrating national strength"; the January 10th editorial, "Establishing a Wartime Political System," specifically advocated "expeditiously establishing a genuine organ representing popular will." For the past year and eight months, we have been constantly calling for and consistently advocating that only through close cooperation between popular forces and government forces can the National Government be genuinely strengthened and national policies be effectively implemented. However, if there is no representative body to mediate between the government and the people, it will be impossible to realize the above ideals, no matter what. It is true that the people know that today's government is by no means a warlord government, nor an autocratic and dictatorial bureaucratic government. However, on what basis can the talented people of the populace cooperate with the government? And on what basis can the government cooperate with the strength of the populace? Although the National Government may recruit some talented people from the populace, such as Mr. Zhang Yipeng, this is ultimately accidental. The government's vision is limited, and the talent of the people remains unused. In reality, this cannot be considered cooperation between "government strength and popular strength." Only by swiftly establishing a genuine representative body, with unity between the government and the public, can the ideal of strengthening the government be truly realized.

The so-called representative body seems to have existed in the short history of the Republic of China for over thirty years, but none have yielded good results. From the Parliament in the early years of the Republic to the Political Council under the Chongqing regime, there has been a series of so-called "representative bodies" of various colors. In essence, the government authorities either used them to realize the ambitions of a few warlords and bureaucrats, or merely to decorate the facade of the regime to appear "democratic and republican." At the same time, the people rarely sincerely used the representative bodies to contribute strength and unite to save the country. In the end, they were merely tools manipulated by a few disgruntled and unsuccessful politicians and bureaucrats, contributing little to the nation and the people. The representative body that we urgently demand today is certainly not this kind of hypocritical and formal "representative body."

What we urgently demand today is a genuine representative body. The first basic principle of a genuine representative body must be that it is a pure organ that concentrates talent from the populace. Those who participate in the representative body must be genuine talents from the populace, truly leaders and experts from all levels, occupations, and aspects of the people. It should not be like the Chongqing Political Council, which is composed of government-appointed, government-approved talents and celebrities. We are not saying that government-appointed figures or government-sent figures are undesirable. We firmly believe that there are many talented individuals among those sent by the government who can cooperate with popular forces and exert great effectiveness. However, if it is entirely composed of government-sent people, the representative body will lose the principle of popular will and become one of the government's own organs. How can we then talk about concentrating popular talent and enabling cooperation between the strength of the populace and the strength of the government?

The second basic principle of the representative body urgently demanded today is that it must be endowed with definite powers. Within the scope of its powers, no party should be allowed to infringe upon it under any pretext. When exercising its powers, no party should be allowed to obstruct it under any excuse. Because if this is not the case, it will not be able to become a powerful representative body, nor will it be able to concentrate the faith and strength of the populace, nor will it be able to spur and assist the government, nor will it be able to create a new atmosphere and a new environment in collaboration with the government, and therefore, it will not be able to strengthen the government and implement national policies with the strength of popular society. In the end, it will merely have the name of a representative body without the substance. Like in Chongqing, it is utterly meaningless to waste manpower and money to select hundreds of councilors, merely to be a ceremonial display. Conversely, the organization of the Great Political Aid Society in Japan, under the spirit of "Great Harmony and One Governance," unites the people around the government precisely because it is endowed with definite powers and given absolute respect.

However, we must also understand that we are currently in the stage of the Greater East Asia War, and we are a participating country in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the third basic principle of the representative body urgently needed today must be a representative body that truly represents the entire nation. Specifically, its organizational composition must include powerful figures from all aspects. Assuming that the number of members participating in this representative body is sixty, its distribution should be as follows: the ruling party should account for one-quarter, the opposition parties and political groups should jointly account for one-quarter, leaders and experts from the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors should account for one-quarter, and the remaining one-quarter should be experts and leaders from the fields of education, journalism, culture, academia, and religion. As for the selection of candidates, it is best that the above-mentioned parties, levels, and social organizations independently elect them, and the preparatory organization should quickly send them to the government for careful research and, within the shortest possible period, approve and announce them, and quickly establish a formal representative body.

We called for the swift establishment of a representative body as early as the first day of the National Government's participation in the war. Unexpectedly, even today, in the twenty-first month, we still have to make the same call! Given the seriousness of the current situation, even if it is realized immediately, it is inevitable to lament that it is too late. However, if it can be quickly realized according to the three points we mentioned above, it is still not too late, and the effect will not be too small. As long as there is unity between the government and the people, and progress is made based on these principles, it will definitely be possible to bridge the gap with the populace, eliminate the divide between the government and the people, and promote full and thorough cooperation between popular forces and government forces, thereby overcoming the difficult times, and leading China and East Asia onto a bright path. For the sake of China's unification and rejuvenation, for the sake of the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, and for the sake of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, we eagerly look forward to the early birth of such a representative body.

In addition, we feel that our views are limited and our thinking is incomplete. We eagerly hope that those in the government and the public who are enthusiastic about this issue will express their high opinions and provide us with grand essays. This newspaper is willing to publish them in order to gather ideas and benefit from collective wisdom.

### The Eighty-Fifth Session of the Japanese Diet Scheduled to Officially Convene Today to Exclusively Deliberate on Additional Provisional Military Expenses

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Eighty-Fifth Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet is scheduled to be held on the 6th. This session is the first since the establishment of the Koiso Cabinet. Its greatest objective is to gather the strength of the nation. During this session, the government will not submit any bills to the Diet requesting a review of various policies, but will exclusively focus on the deliberation of additional provisional military expenses necessary for the completion of the war. Therefore, Prime Minister Koiso's policy speech at this session is extremely important. To meet the expectations of the people, the government has specially suspended the financial speech by the Minister of Finance and the diplomatic speech by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and instead, the Prime Minister alone will thoroughly explain the entire national policy and the strategy for overcoming national difficulties, persevering through the hard times, and defeating the United States and Great Britain. After the Prime Minister's speech, Minister of the Army Sugiyama and Minister of the Navy Yonai are scheduled to report on the true situation of the war since the Eighty-Fourth Session of the Diet, frankly disclosing the conditions of the Army and Navy, and calling on the people to thoroughly rise up. Subsequently, in the plenary sessions on the 8th, both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives will begin specific deliberations. According to the government's instructions, the key points are to thoroughly understand the true situation of the war and to recognize the current situation, and to unite the total strength of the nation with clear and open-minded discourse. Both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives, with the Yokusankai led by the new President, Mr. Kobayashi Seizo, as the center, are enthusiastically engaged in establishing countermeasures for decisive victory. Therefore, the discourse in this session is practical and enthusiastic, and it is truly an unprecedented development since the start of the war.

### Infiltrating Government Resolutions and Policies into All Levels of Society

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – Japan will convene an extraordinary session of the Diet on the 7th. The special characteristic of this session is to broadly infiltrate the government's resolutions and policies into all levels of society. Regarding bills, in addition to the bill on additional provisional military expenses, there are no other legal bills scheduled to be submitted. However, the session will be slightly longer than previous extraordinary sessions, lasting a total of five days. This was at the request of the Yokusankai, and the government approved it. The government recognizes the Yokusankai as the center of popular representation and grants it the power to organize this, so that the government and the people can be as close as water and milk. When the Koiso Cabinet was established, it declared its policy of freely expressing popular will, and this can be seen as a sign of that. Furthermore, this time, the system of allowing Diet members' representatives to question the Prime Minister's policy speech, which had been abolished since the Seventy-Seventh Session of the Diet, has been restored. It is reported that two representatives have been designated to ask unreserved questions about the Prime Minister's speech. Therefore, even before the Diet session has begun, the Japanese political world has already been experiencing an unusual situation that has not been seen for a long time.

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The President of the Japanese House of Peers, Mr. Matsudaira, is currently in poor health and may not be able to attend the extraordinary session of the Diet. Therefore, it has been decided to appoint a temporary president. According to precedent, Vice President Sasaki will recommend Duke Tokugawa Kuniyuki, Chairman of the House Committee, to serve as temporary president.

### The Yokusankai Completes Work on Participating in the Diet Session

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – In view of the upcoming Eighty-Fifth Extraordinary Session of the Diet scheduled to be held on the 6th, the Japanese Yokusankai is urgently seeking to determine the personnel of the Diet officers. Important personnel in the Yokusankai who will attend the Diet session are actively preparing. On the 4th, in addition to convening a General Affairs Committee meeting at 11:00 AM and a House of Representatives Departmental meeting at 1:00 PM, a Representatives' Meeting was also convened at 2:00 PM. Those in attendance included President Kobayashi, General Affairs Committee Chairman Shigemitsu, various department heads, House of Representatives Departmental Chairman Oka, House of Representatives Departmental Vice Chairman Naisaki, former Minister of Transportation and Communications, Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Shimada, Minister of State Machida, Director-General of the Legislation Bureau Miura, and more than 300 others. President Kobayashi first gave a speech, outlining the Yokusankai's policies toward the Diet, saying that "We should all work together to implement the policies of the Supreme War Guidance Council. For all important policies, we should answer those who have questions and correct those that need to be corrected, so that we do not cause the people to lose confidence in politics. I hope that you, the representatives who are attending the Diet, will always have the spirit of stepping forward in the face of danger." After the speech, the reports began. First, the General Affairs Director of the House of Representatives Department, Manabe, reported on the results of the Diet Liaison Council's consultations, the Chairman of the Political Affairs Research Council, Matsumura, reported on the results of the Political Affairs Research Council's meeting, and Takahashi reported on the situation of the national movement. After the reports were completed, the meeting began and the following two items were decided: (1) The Yokusankai Diet members will submit the proposed bills to the Diet officers. (2) Candidates for imperial ordinances and standing committee members will be determined by the Diet officers. With this, the Yokusankai's preparations for participating in the Diet session were completed, and the meeting was adjourned at 3:30 PM.

### Fighting in Northern France Expands to Belgian Territory, Fierce Fighting Near Brussels

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency quoted German official war reports stating that German forces in northern France fiercely resisted enemy forces yesterday, and the fighting has now expanded to Antwerp (Antwwrp) and the Brussels area. The intensity of the fighting is constantly increasing. German long-range heavy artillery again carried out effective [bombardments] on British southern port barracks and artillery positions.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reported that the center of gravity of the fighting on the Western Front on Sunday was in the Valenciennes-Maubeuge district. A group of British and American forces there advanced to the northeast, their aim being to cut off the German forces' rear lines of communication. The town of St. Pol, northwest of Arras, was lost after several hours of fierce fighting on Sunday evening. On the same day, Canadian troops reached the Lille district, and another enemy force reached Hal (an industrial area in Belgium). Anti-Axis tank reconnaissance teams advanced from there to the southern suburbs of Brussels. The German forces' operations in southwestern France and the Rhone River valley continue according to the original plan, despite the enemy's strong pressure at several strongholds.

### More Than Ten Chongqing-Based American Planes Night-Raid Guangzhou

Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) – From 9:40 PM on the 31st to 1:40 AM on the 1st, more than ten B-25 aircraft of the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing raided this city. The Japanese air defense forces were already prepared. As soon as the enemy planes entered the city, they were subjected to heavy fire, and the enemy planes were unable to succeed. During the air raid, several enemy planes dropped bombs on residential areas in Henan, destroying dozens of civilian houses and injuring more than fifty civilians. The moonlight was beautiful that night, and the enemy planes were able to discern where the military facilities were and where the civilian houses were, but they deliberately dropped bombs on densely populated areas, which shows how brutal the actions of the American Air Force are.

### Bulgaria Announces the Cancellation of the Anti-Comintern Pact and Increases Friendly Relations with the Soviet Union and Turkey

Sofia, 5th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reported that the new Bulgarian Prime Minister Muraviev announced last night that the Bulgarian government has decided to dissolve the Bulgarian Parliament, because the Bulgarian Parliament is responsible for most of Bulgaria's participation in the war. Bulgaria will restore the people's constitutional rights and freedoms, and will grant amnesty to those who opposed the dictatorship and those who opposed Bulgaria's participation in the war. As for foreign policy, Bulgaria has decided to adopt a policy of absolute neutrality, and will follow this policy to deal with the German forces stationed in Bulgaria. If the German side resists, Bulgaria will not hesitate to sever diplomatic relations with Germany. Under these circumstances, the Tripartite Pact will not be effective for Bulgaria, and the Anti-Comintern Pact will also be abolished. The Bulgarian government will also take all measures to restore peace with the United Kingdom and the United States, and to increase friendly relations with Turkey and other neighboring countries. The Bulgarian government's main desire is to develop friendly relations with the "fraternal nation of the Soviet Union." This relationship has already existed and will continue to grow, so that it will become even closer.

### Japanese Troops in Hunan Occupy Changning, Chongqing Troops' Counterattack on Yichang Fails

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the Japanese military base on the Hunan front, Japanese troops attacked Changning from the east on the 1st, and by the night of the 3rd, they had completely occupied Changning, which was defended by the main force of the Chongqing army, and are currently fiercely pursuing the defeated remnant Chongqing troops as they retreat westward. Changning is a crucial point in the Chongqing army's defense, 50 kilometers south of Hengyang.

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) – According to an Associated Press report from Chongqing, the recent offensive of the Japanese troops on the Hunan front is as follows: Japanese troops are attacking southwest from various places northwest of Hengyang. One force has now reached a point more than 100 kilometers west of Hengyang, 45 kilometers east of Qiyang in reality, and encountered Chongqing troops, but [they are continuing] to advance westward. The Chongqing military authorities said in a war situation bulletin that Changning was lost on the 3rd, but they later corrected it and said that Changning was still in the hands of the Chongqing troops. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese troops have bypassed the county town and have now reached a place 29 kilometers east of Qiyang, a key point on the Hunan-Guangxi Railway. Fierce fighting is currently taking place there. Also, fighting is also taking place on the outskirts of the county towns of Laiyang, Anren, and Chaling. The three cities on the east side of the Xiang River within the Japanese forces' sphere of influence are all important strongholds.

A certain Japanese military base on the front lines, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army's encirclement and attack on the large Chongqing-American force west of Hengyang has been extremely smooth since it began on the 1st. The force attacking southwest of Hengyang reached Changtang Street (25 kilometers from Dayingshi) on the 3rd. At the same time, they also attacked Hongqiao, Baihep, and Baishanling. They are currently continuing to advance.

A certain Japanese military base, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Chongqing military authorities were deeply surprised by the rapid progress of the Japanese troops in the Hunan operation, and ordered the various front-line units to actively counterattack. In particular, they strictly ordered the Fifth and Sixth War Zones to recapture [lost territory]. The troops of the two war zones in central Hubei, on the 12th of last month, drew out six divisions of troops from the 32nd Army, the 59th Army, the 30th Army, the 75th Army, the 66th Army, and the 77th Army and dispatched them to the Yichang area. And three divisions were drawn out from the 41st Army and the 45th Army to advance into the Jingshan (50 kilometers northwest of Yingcheng) area, attempting to launch a general counterattack. The Japanese garrison in Yichang immediately launched an encirclement and annihilation battle against the Chongqing troops in these two areas. Since the beginning of this month, they have continued to attack fiercely for two weeks, annihilating most of their counterattacking forces, capturing 700 Chongqing troops, and seizing a large amount of military [supplies] and ammunition. By this point, the Chongqing army's plan to counterattack north of the Yangtze River had failed. Also, the fighting in this battle was extremely fierce, and the Japanese troops in the Yichang area also suffered some losses. Currently, annihilation battles are still unfolding in the southern section of the Hunan front.

### The Japanese and American Armies on the Mainland Have Entered the Decisive Stage

A Central News Agency report states that the Japanese army, reportedly with its elite forces concentrated in the Hunan area, has launched another major offensive. Following the fall of Hengyang, the Chongqing forces gathered southwest of Hengyang, including armies from the Sixth, Seventh, and remnants of the defeated Ninth War Zones. To regain American trust and restore face after losing Hengyang, they repeatedly proclaimed preparations to retake Hengyang, hence the frequent troop movements in the aforementioned locations. Furthermore, to prevent the Japanese from attacking Guilin, they linked Qi Qing, Qiyang, and Changning, completing the first line of defense for Lingling and Guilin. However, the Japanese army, reportedly with its elite forces, has completed full preparations. Taking Hengyang as its axis, it launched fan-shaped attacks against the 200,000-strong fishing armies in Qi Qing and Qiyang. The Chongqing Military Council announced on the night of the 3rd that the Japanese army, advancing south along the Hunan-Guangxi Railway from Hengyang, had reached a point 37 kilometers northeast of Qiyang. In conjunction with this, the Japanese army advancing northwest from Hengyang had advanced to a point 45 kilometers from Qi Qing. Another unit of the Japanese army advanced to Changning area west of Laiyang. Based on this, the fan-shaped formation of the Japanese army from the left, right, and center has been completed. The outer defensive line relied upon by the Chongqing army is on the verge of collapse. According to a Chongqing correspondent, the Japanese operation is similar to the phased operations in Henan and South Anhui, dividing its forces on both sides of the Hunan-Guangxi Railway to continue the attack. Furthermore, Reuters, Associated Press, United Press, and other foreign correspondents stationed in Chongqing unanimously declared on the 3rd the importance of this Japanese operation, showing concern about the progress of the war. Chongqing also realizes the seriousness of the situation, and to prepare the final defensive line, specially appointed Yu Jun, Deputy Chief of General Staff, to take on the heavy responsibility of defense. Guilin is an important stronghold for the life of Qi Qing and an important base for the U.S. Air Force. If the defense fails this time, the American counter-offensive against Japan will suffer a considerable blow. Therefore, the American and Chongqing allied forces have launched fierce attacks. Regarding this point, the Chongqing Associated Press reported that the Japanese army is using the best weapons in this operation, directly challenging the U.S. Air Force. The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing is determined to fight to the end to maintain its reputation. Judging from these words, the Japanese and American armies on the Chinese front have entered the decisive stage.

### Gu Zhutong's Troops Retreat to Fujian Province

A Central News Agency dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in Hunan on the 5th reports that Gu Zhutong's troops, the 24th Division, a brigade of the Third War Zone Army of Chongqing, numbering about 150,000, are unable to attend to the defense of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces due to the Japanese army's northward offensive along the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, and can only defend their own war zone. Previously, during the Hunan campaign, the main task of the Third War Zone Army of Chongqing seemed to be to defend Jiangxi Province. However, recently, due to the Japanese attack on Quzhou and the recent capture of Lishui, the Fujian region, which was completely spared from the flames of war, has now become the main base of the Third War Zone of Chongqing. In the future, the movements of Ni Mi, who is spying on the southeastern coast of China, deserve special attention.

### Tense Air Defense Situation - Continued Training Implementation - Air Defense Headquarters Holds First Press Conference

The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters is actively implementing air defense training to promote civil air defense knowledge, arouse public concern for air defense essentials, and adopt air defense opinions. From this month onwards, a tea party will be held for reporters on the fourth of each month. Yesterday was the first reception meeting, and Secretary Sun first delivered a speech.

### Cooperatively Establish Iron Wall of Air Defense

The general idea is: Shanghai's air defense has entered the combat phase from the preparation phase. It is hoped that the citizens of Shanghai will not be too ignorant and have the mentality of the past concession era, thinking that the downtown area is special and that enemy planes will only bomb the suburbs. If this kind of thinking is not broken, it is very dangerous. We can all recall that enemy planes dropped bombs in the Huangpu River, and they were also discovered in the Wusong area. Therefore, we cannot guarantee "no bombing of the Shanghai urban area." Moreover, bombing by the enemy in Europe has become "arbitrary slaughter." This kind of cruel behavior must be strictly prevented, so training is urgent. At present, the most important organizations of the Air Defense Headquarters are the police defense, fire protection, health, and work departments, which cooperate to achieve the establishment of an iron wall of air defense.

### Air Defense Exercise on September 9th

Next, Yamamoto Shinichiro, the head of the Air Defense Section, reported, stating that the current air defense situation is becoming increasingly tense, so efforts should be made to improve the air defense measures for citizens. In the past, during various air defense trainings, the general public often stood by and watched, even clapping and cheering. It can be seen that the air defense configuration of the whole city is not perfect, which is regrettable. The biggest goal of this ninth Air Defense Day (scheduled for September 9th) air defense training is to focus on evacuation and refuge training. All police, Baojia, self-defense team members and the public must participate in the exercise, so that every citizen is familiar with the meaning of refuge and emergency measures.

### Regulations on Training Alert Times

On September 9th, the first training alert alarm will be issued at 9:30 a.m., the training air raid alarm will be issued at 10:30 a.m., the training air raid alarm will be lifted at 11:00 a.m., and the training alert alarm will be lifted at 12:00 noon. The second training air raid alarm will be issued at 3:30 p.m., the training air raid alarm will be lifted, and the training alert alarm will be turned on at 4:00 p.m., and the training alert alarm will be completely lifted at 10:00 p.m. However, all training alarms on this day will not sound sirens, but will only use newspapers and radio reports. When the specified time arrives, the Baojia members and police team will convey the alarm and implement various air defense measures. If a siren is issued, it will be a formal alarm, and citizens should pay attention to it at any time.

### Western Air Defense is Well-Organized

Furthermore, Noguchi, the Director of General Affairs, reported that the organization of the department is very meticulous, stating that the Civil Air Defense Headquarters has a Minister and a Deputy Minister. Mayor Chen serves as the Minister, and Secretary-General Wu serves as the Deputy Minister. There are also councilors and an advisory board. The councilors are Du Zhengjian, Lu Xiang, Su Chengde, and Tai Jiandong. The advisory board is undecided. Sun Lifu serves as the Chief Secretary.

### Economic Authorities Negotiate to Ban Illegal Price Increases

Recently, the prices of various daily necessities in this city have been rising sharply again, especially for imported goods and general daily necessities. The reason for this is obviously the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, who are raising prices privately, again and again, in an attempt to obtain illegal profits. The livelihoods of ordinary people are severely threatened. Xu Tianshen, Director of the Economic Bureau of this city, is paying close attention to this. In addition to negotiating with Goto, the director of the Economic Security Department of this city, to severely crack down on illegal activities, he also plans to convene representatives of trade associations from all over the city on the 8th of this month to discuss ways to stop the price increases.

### Economic Advisor Nasu Hiroshi Talks About the City's Food Problem - Must Strengthen Industrial Productivity

Dr. Nasu Hiroshi, the economic advisor of the National Government, recently returned to Shanghai after consulting with various aspects of the Japanese government on China's internal affairs after returning to China in July. He made the following remarks on the food problem: Central China is a rice-producing area, and there is absolutely no reason for a shortage in quantity. In the past, imports from abroad were only more profitable in terms of procurement. However, today, due to the fact that purchasing, transportation, and distribution cannot be carried out smoothly, Shanghai's food has become a problem. The main reason for this is the activity of speculators. I believe that to solve the Shanghai food problem, Shanghai itself must strengthen its industrial productivity, and then seek to exchange agricultural products with the mainland. As for the fact that the shortage of materials and various other difficulties have been overcome and progress is gradually being made, the Yili project near Danyang has now been completed, and rice will definitely increase next year. The Veterinary Plague Prevention Serum Manufacturing Plant will soon be established in Shanghai. This equipment will be of considerable benefit to livestock breeding. In addition, agricultural technicians are being trained in various places. All of this is a step forward in China's agricultural progress.

### Deputy Director Lu Talks About Strengthening County Police Affairs

In order to strengthen the police affairs of various counties, the Municipal Police Bureau has appointed Deputy Director Lu Ying concurrently as the director of the county office, and the internal organization has been adjusted and renewed. The police work of the seven counties is closely related to the security of Greater Shanghai. Deputy Director Lu gave a speech on the future direction of county police work, stating that the County Police Office was originally directly under the former Second Police Bureau and was supervised by him. Later, as the municipal administration was about to be adjusted, the administration of the seven districts had not yet been determined, so Deputy Director Secret Shao Jieren concurrently served as the director. Now that the municipal administration has been unified and the seven districts have been officially changed to counties under the direct jurisdiction of the municipal government, the police affairs of the seven counties and the two administrative inspector's offices urgently need to be strengthened. Mayor Chen also instructed him to take over the post. He believes that the police affairs of the seven counties are actually a security barrier for Greater Shanghai. Therefore, the police work of the municipal and county governments should be equally emphasized and closely linked and flexibly applied. In addition to assigning inspectors to visit and supervise the counties at any time, he is also willing to visit the counties in person to provide on-site guidance whenever the opportunity arises. In short, he will follow Mayor Chen's instructions, follow the established direction, and work diligently to achieve the task of consolidating the security of Greater Shanghai.

### Secretary-General Wu Talks About Recent Administration - The Consumption Special Tax Agency Will Be Reorganized

Since the re-division of the administrative area of this city and the unification of the administrative agencies, the municipal government has made important innovations in the Baojia administrative system, the consumption special tax agency, the staff service regulations, and the public works. Central News Agency reporters were told by Secretary-General Wu of the municipal government yesterday about the above-mentioned administrative measures as follows:

### Confirming the Baojia Administrative System

After the administrative area of this city was re-divided on August 1, the municipal government also clearly formulated and decided the following principles regarding the Baojia administrative system of the whole city: The Baojia of this city is divided into three parts according to general administration: the urban area, the suburban area, and the county area. The Baojia of the urban area is still managed and transferred by the Municipal Police Bureau, and a Baojia Office is established to be responsible for handling it. The Baojia of the suburban area is handled by the directors of the various district offices, and an office is established to be concurrently served as the director by the directors of the district offices. The Baojia of the county area is handled by the county magistrates, and an office is established to be concurrently served as the director by the county magistrates. The Baojia Committee of this city is the highest executive body of the Baojia administration of the whole city, and directly governs the Baojia offices of the various counties and suburban areas. The activities of the Baojia shares of the suburban police sub-bureaus will be stopped immediately. The Baojia Office of the Municipal Police Bureau is the executive body of the Baojia in the urban area. In principle, it should be directed and supervised by the Baojia Committee, and it should also obtain contact at any time in terms of affairs. In addition to the Baojia Office, the Police Bureau may hire local people to form the Municipal Baojia Zengyi separately, and may not use the name of the Baojia Committee to avoid confusion. The organizational rules will be determined separately. The former seventh district of the Municipal Baojia Committee, and a part of the new theater area of Jiang, Hubei, Huxi, Pubeibei, and Pudongnan districts, are all allocated to the Baojia Office of the Municipal Police Bureau for management, and the Hunan Office is cancelled. After the Baojia of the urban area is allocated to the Baojia Office of the Municipal Police Bureau for management, the Shanghai Special Municipal Baojia Committee will be subsidized by the Municipal Government on a monthly basis. After the above measures are decided, the Municipal Government has ordered the subordinate agencies to know.

### Consumption Special Tax Agency Reorganized

Since the Central Consumption Special Tax was opened in February of this year, the number of monthly receipts from the Finance Department of the former District 1 has been increasing. After the unification of the municipal administration on August 1, after the merger of the Finance Department and the Finance Bureau, it was necessary to adjust the tax collection agency. Recently, after the case of the misappropriation of corruption by Zou Zhaoji, the head of the special tax division, and other staff members, all parties paid close attention to it. The Municipal Administration Advisory Committee also paid close attention to this matter and made important suggestions. In view of this, the municipal authorities decided to change the original special tax division into a consumption special tax office immediately, and appointed Chen Junde, a secretary with a simplified appointment, as the director of the office to take full responsibility. It is heard that the office is still under the jurisdiction of the Finance Bureau and will be formally established soon. How to improve the collection system and methods is being carefully considered and prepared. The day of reform is not far away.

### Revised Staff Service Rules

The service rules for the staff of the former District 1 Office were still based on the rules and regulations set by the former Public Works Bureau in order to adapt to the environment at that time. After the former District 1 Office was merged with the Municipal Government on August 1, in order to comply with our national system, the Municipal Government separately formulated staff service rules, which will be implemented from September 1. The main points are as follows: The interests enjoyed by the staff of each agency before August 1, 1933 of the Republic of China, such as retirement savings and pensions, will still be guaranteed and maintained. The service rules apply to foreign staff of the former One-Eight District Office. The content of the rules is detailed, and the points that the staff should pay attention to in their duties are clearly stipulated. As for the service rules for Japanese and French staff, they will be handled in accordance with the regulations of the original rules.

### Salvage the Sunken Pier on the Bund

Pier No. 13A on the Bund opposite Nanjing Road suddenly sank in early May due to disrepair. The former First District Office ordered the Public Works Department to find a way to salvage it. After the department was merged into the Public Works Bureau on August 1, the bureau implemented the salvage project on August 9 and actively carried it out, and it was salvaged on September 3.
