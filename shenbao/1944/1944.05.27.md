### Facing the Battle Calmly

Every year on May 27th, the Navy Day of our ally Japan, always reminds us of Marshal Togo's great decisive battle in the Tsushima Strait, which laid the foundation for the victory of the entire war. And the reason Marshal Togo was victorious lies entirely in his calm response, truly embodying the spirit of "still as a virgin, swift as a rabbit," and "does not cry out, but when he does, he startles the world." These phrases perfectly describe Marshal Togo's fighting spirit.

A calm person does not panic, does not act recklessly. When the mighty Russian Imperial Baltic Fleet sailed from the North Sea around Africa toward Japan, its number of warships and the equipment of the fleet were superior to those of Japan. But the Japanese fleet under the command of Marshal Togo waited quietly with fearless spirit. Marshal Togo's attitude was relaxed, calm, and cautious, until the enemy fleet reached the Tsushima Strait, only then did he issue the historically famous order: "The fate of the Empire rests on this battle," and with all the personnel of the fleet united, the enemy fleet was annihilated, and the war ended.

A calm person is prepared. As the saying goes, "Preparedness ensures success, lack of preparation ensures failure." The effort of preparation lies in calmness. Zhuge Liang said: "Tranquility leads to far-reaching influence." Tranquility is calmness. Marshal Togo was a most simple and honest person. From the time the Baltic Fleet set out in October 1904 until it reached Japanese waters on May 27, 1905, Marshal Togo never uttered a word. He simply thought quietly, planned silently, worked diligently, and carried out his preparation work until the most critical moment, when he finally implemented his strategy, awaiting the enemy at leisure to strike with one blow. Only then did the world realize that seven or eight months of calmness were all for preparation work, waiting for the right time to launch.

A calm person is strong, resolute, and decisive. Marshal Togo said, "When the time comes to act, do not hesitate, but do it decisively, to demonstrate the resolve of the Japanese people for the sake of the Empire." This is the spirit of decisive action. Determination can be made in a day, but the courage to make a decision must be cultivated over a long period of time. Mencius spoke of cultivating one's vast, righteous spirit, and cultivating spirit lies in calmness. If one can cultivate spirit in ordinary times, then one will have courage, decisiveness, and perseverance in times of crisis.

A calm person does not covet fame or fortune, and is loyal to the country. For himself, he maintains detachment. Marshal Togo was the most simple, kind, and honest person. He only knew to work hard for the country and did not seek fame or fortune. Especially after his triumphant return, he still lived a plain life, not boasting of his achievements, truly the demeanor of a famous general. In addition to lecturing the Crown Prince for many years, he still maintained his quiet and ordinary demeanor. A person who single-handedly turned his country into a first-class world power, and then lived in detachment after achieving meritorious service, is truly a model for famous generals in the world.

Now is another period of great decisive battles, whether on the European battlefield or the Greater East Asia battlefield, all aspects are at a critical juncture. However, in the end, whoever remains calm will be able to achieve the final victory. As we commemorate Navy Day, we must emulate Marshal Togo. We must be prepared, have determination, and be loyal to the country. The power of calm determination is the greatest. Using a calm spirit to face the battle, the result of the war will inevitably be the final victory.

### The Entire Country of Japan Raises National Flags to Celebrate Navy Memorial Day; Director of Information Kurihara Gave a Broadcast Speech Yesterday

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): May 27th is the 39th Japanese Navy Memorial Day. Recalling the past sea battle, the late Navy Commander-in-Chief Marshal Togo once raised a battle flag on the masthead of his ship, saying: "The fate of the Empire rests on this battle." Now, the situation in the Pacific war is just like that. The future decisive battle in the Pacific will also determine the survival of Japan and the rise and fall of East Asia. To make this decisive battle a second Japanese naval battle, Japan and the Greater East Asia countries are exerting all their efforts to contribute to the war. On this day, the entire country of Japan will suspend all celebratory activities and only raise the national flag to show their wishes. As for the factories of Japanese agencies, in order to increase combat power and adapt to the current situation, they are making their greatest efforts to fulfill their duties and meet the needs of the war.

Unfolding a Battle for Survival and Self-Defense Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency): Colonel Kurihara, Director of the Navy Information Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, gave a speech on the current situation on the 26th at 7:00 PM from the Tokyo Broadcasting Station, titled "Navy Memorial Day Under the Decisive Battle," to strengthen the determination to defeat the British and Americans and to encourage the people to unite, as the 39th Heavy Memorial Day on the 27th. The main points are as follows: Nearly thirty-nine years ago, on the 27th, a great naval battle concerning the rise and fall of Japan was launched in the Japanese Sea. Our combined fleet defeated the Baltic Fleet and achieved an unprecedented victory. After the victory of the Russo-Japanese War at that time, our country was able to stabilize its position in East Asia and further promote its national prestige to the world. This Greater East Asia War was caused by the United Kingdom and the United States, which considered themselves the world's largest power, threatening the existence of our country, so we had no choice but to rise up and launch a battle for survival and self-defense. Its reasons for war and motives for war are exactly the same as those of the Russo-Japanese War. The point concerning the survival of the country is also exactly the same as that of the Russo-Japanese War. However, in essence, the Greater East Asia War is more profound in meaning than the Russo-Japanese War. The Russo-Japanese War can be called a ten-year war of lying on firewood and tasting gall, while the Greater East Asia War can be said to be a forty-year war of lying on firewood and tasting gall, starting from the time when Japan's immigrants were rejected.

The Time for a Decisive Battle Has Matured. The Greater East Asia War and the Russo-Japanese War are essentially the same, only their character is different. The details can be seen by observing the war expenses of the two wars. The total military expenditure of the Russo-Japanese War was 1.7 billion yuan. The amount of additional temporary military expenditure for the Greater East Asia War in Showa 19 alone has reached 380 million yuan. In modern warfare, the air force should be the first to be the decisive force. The air force is the core of the battle and the weapon of attack. Its consumption of bombs and other items is far greater than that of naval gun battles in the past. Modern warfare is a great consumption war, and the amount of consumption is great, and of course, the required supplies are also huge. If you want to supply, you have to produce in large quantities. Therefore, modern warfare is a great consumption war, a great supply war, a great production war, and a great science war. In essence, this is why it is called the national total war. The Russo-Japanese War was mainly a physical war. The army and navy fought for the people, and the people only supported from the rear. It should be known that the Greater East Asia War is a total war in which the people are completely deployed in battle. Now the situation in the Pacific War is becoming more and more severe, and the time for a decisive battle is about to mature. The enemy is actively launching an offensive, aiming "not to give Japan ample time," and they are also advocating the slogan of "destroying Japan." However, we must not regard this as a mere exaggeration. In essence, the Greater East Asia War is a national war between the Japanese nation and the Anglo-Saxon nation to win "prosperity." Therefore, the result of this war has a very important impact on the rise and fall of national ethnicity. A victory can liberate the Japanese people and enable them to face any strong country's bullying with the utmost determination. This is not enough to prove in our country's history. However, relying only on the idea of divine help and the indestructibility of the divine land to seek a victory is not enough. To truly win, we must have thorough preparations, detailed plans, and the spirit of defeating the enemy before stopping. At the same time, we must keep in mind that the determination to defeat the enemy and the spirit of national hard work are the foundations for winning victory. The mission of the Greater East Asia War is not only to seek self-defense for Japan, but also to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and to build a new moral order in the world. If we want to realize the ideal of Hakko Ichiu, we must first expel the British and American forces from East Asia and crush their ambitions. If our country can defeat the United Kingdom and the United States, then the nations of Greater East Asia can break away from the shackles of the United Kingdom and the United States and gain liberation, and the task of building a new order can also be achieved. Now is the time for 100 million people to give full play to their courageous and bold spirit. I hope the people will seize the opportunity, give full play to their strength like the soldiers on the front line, and jointly overcome national difficulties.

### A Certain Unit Commander of the Japanese North China Dispatch Army Talks About the Course of the Japanese Army's Operation in Henan

Zhengzhou, 26th (Central News Agency): A certain unit commander of the Japanese North China Dispatch Army recently gave a speech on the course of the operation on the front line in Henan, the weakness of the Chongqing army's resistance on the first line, and the impact of this operation on all parties. The talk is as follows: This operation began with crossing the Yellow River. The first step was to occupy the bridgehead of Ba Wangcheng, which was quite beneficial for the operation. At the beginning of this operation, the Japanese army disregarded the enemy's artillery fire and launched a long period of sleepless and tireless struggle. The bridgehead, which was about 3,000 meters long, was completed in a very short time. This difficult task can be called a great achievement of the technical troops. In front of Ba Wangcheng, the enemy used a cliff dozens of meters wide and spent two and a half years building a solid position. However, the Japanese army occupied it in just one day, and then launched a thorough large-scale maneuver war. The first-line troops and the rear supply troops all launched sleepless and tireless activities. The miraculous movement of the Japanese army caught the enemy soldiers off guard, and they implemented a segmented breakthrough operation against the enemy's position, dividing and encircling the enemy soldiers. What is particularly noteworthy is that Tang Enbo, the famous general who was admired by the occupied party, and the elite army of about 20 divisions under his direct command, were all defeated and dispersed in this operation. Their situation of being surrounded and defeated everywhere was really pitiful. In Luoyang, there were more than a dozen divisions under Jiang Dingwen, as well as the reinforcements from the Eighth War Zone, with a force of two or three armies. The purpose of the Japanese army's operation in this area was to eliminate the enemy's army, so they only used a very small number of troops to monitor the Luoyang area in advance. Furthermore, the powerful corps of the Japanese army in Shanxi suddenly crossed the Yellow River, causing the enemy army to be attacked from both sides, which made them even more chaotic. The enemy was directly retreating from Luoning and Lushi. In order not to miss the opportunity, the Japanese army launched an offensive, either encircling the enemy or cutting off the enemy's retreat. Some of the enemy's troops abandoned their weapons and ammunition and fled into the deep mountains. The Japanese army, even more, did not want the five thousand years of Chinese history and culture to be turned into ashes, so they repeatedly postponed the attack time, hoping that the enemy would take the opportunity to reflect. There were about three divisions of enemy troops inside and outside Luoyang City. After the Japanese army occupied the outer city of Luoyang, they issued a letter of advice to the enemy troops in the city to preserve Luoyang. Unexpectedly, the enemy was still obsessed with their mistakes, so the Japanese army immediately launched an attack and successively occupied it, causing this war to destroy part of the ancient Luoyang site. For the sake of Eastern Han culture and the Chinese people, it is really hateful. The enemy's First War Zone army was completely defeated in just one month. More than 40 divisions of the enemy army participated in this operation, and most of them have been defeated. Tang Enbo's defeated and remnants of the enemy soldiers seem to have escaped into the mountainous area south of Songxian and west of Lushan. The impact of this operation on all parties is self-evident. First, the anti-axis camp must recognize the Japanese army's great strength. Second, Chongqing's military and political conspiracy in the peaceful area was completely destroyed, which greatly stabilized the people's hearts. Third, they gained a base for attacking and established a state of controlling Chongqing's fate at any time. Fourth, the opening of traffic north and south of the Yellow River has contributed greatly to the economic exchange between North China and Central China, and to the prosperity of the peaceful area. During this operation, the US-驻逾空军 often appeared on the front line. The people of Chongqing must have expected this very much. However, the activities of the US planes are not worth paying attention to at all. The Japanese army's operations were not affected in any way, and only the US planes that were shot down by the Japanese army's ground artillery fire have reached more than 18. The damage suffered by the enemy has increased instead. What is most noteworthy in this operation is the cooperation of the Chinese people, such as the automatic organization of security maintenance associations, cooperation with the Japanese army in building roads and laying iron pipes, which is enough to show that Chongqing's resistance intention has been detached from the people and is now controlled by a small number of people in the upper class. In addition, the captured and surrendered Chongqing army added resistance-style to the defeated and remnant enemy soldiers, or seized weapons and clothing, which shows that the general public's resentment and antipathy towards Chongqing's resistance are very obvious. The Chinese people's understanding and choice between peace and resistance are now a matter of fact. Chongqing's leaders will not be able to continue to be obsessed with their mistakes.

### Enemy Planes Air Raid Oshima Island; A Total of Thirty-Two Planes Were Shot Down; The Japanese General Headquarters Announced Yesterday Afternoon

### Japanese Army Progressing Steadily on the Nujiang Front; Yuan-U.S. Allied Forces in the Fugong Area Are Also Retreating

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency), The Japanese army's war in the Nujiang area is progressing steadily with the support of the air force, crushing the enemy's attempts to attack everywhere. Recently, the Yuan army in Lengshui, Datangzi, and other places intended to rise again and reorganize the 36th Division and the 116th, 120th, and 198th Divisions, which were defeated by the Japanese army in the Nujiang operation last autumn, and were active in front of the Japanese army. The powerful Japanese army in the area launched a fierce surprise attack against them. On the morning of the 19th, they launched a courageous offensive. The Yuan army suffered a disastrous defeat, with more than 700 bodies left behind, and then retreated to the northeast. On the same evening, they were ambushed by the Japanese army north of Datangzi, leaving hundreds of bodies behind by the morning of the 20th, and the morale of the army was greatly shaken. On the other hand, the Yuan-U.S. Allied Forces in the 　　 area dispatched one battalion of the newly formed 22nd Division on the right bank of a certain river on the 12th, with 30 tanks in front, attempting to break through the first line of defense of the Japanese army. The Japanese army immediately rose up to respond, destroying many enemy tanks in this battle. The enemy forces on both fronts failed successively, and there have been frequent cases of Yuan officers and American majors turning against each other.

Yangon, 26th (Central Agency): Yuan troops in the South attempted to rescue the American airborne troops in the Nuoshen and Kayu areas along the Indian border and establish contact with them. They crossed the Nujiang River in six places to counterattack, with a force of about 1,200 people, and were defeated by the Japanese army. One of the most powerful of these armies, advanced to the Lengshui Valley area, and after crossing the Nujiang River, launched a fairly stubborn attack, but finally, on the morning of the 19th, it was repelled by the Japanese army's fierce artillery fire, abandoning more than 200 bodies and fleeing to the east. Now, the army that crossed the river has no other way but to abandon everything and retreat in defeat.

### Minister of Judicial Administration Zhang Yipeng Returns to Beijing and Announces His Impressions of Inspecting North China

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency), Minister of Judicial Administration Zhang Yipeng departed on the 10th of this month to inspect the judicial situation in North China. After half a month, he returned to Beijing on the 25th. To understand Zhang's trip, the reporter visited Zhang at the Ministry of Judicial Administration today (the 26th), and he was received and briefly told: I departed on the 10th and passed through Beiping. Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, 蚱埠, and other places, spending nine days in Beiping, one day in Tianjin, three days in Jinan, one day in Qingdao, and one day in 蚌埠, and returned to Beijing yesterday (the 25th), with a journey of 16 days. The judicial situation in various places is best in Qingdao, which is also the most complete. There are no unsolved cases, and civil cases can be more effectively mediated. Of the 100 civil cases, more than 60 are mediated and no longer filed. Regarding mediation, there is a mediation committee. For each case, a judge and two 　　 members try their best to persuade, and only when it is unavoidable, they will not allow it to be 　　. This point is the biggest feature of the judicial community in Qingdao.

### Celebrating Allied Naval Day, Naval Minister's Speech: Should Emulate Japan in Building China's Navy

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - Today, the 27th, is the 39th Naval Memorial Day of Allied Japan, and also the third Naval Memorial Day since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Its significance is self-evident. Navy Minister Ren Yuandao specially issued the following statement: Thirty-nine years ago, it was the time when Japan was rising in the world. Especially the Japanese Navy, during the Russo-Japanese War, under the leadership of Admiral Togo, fully demonstrated the traditional spirit of naval officers and men, and achieved the brilliant victory of defeating the entire expeditionary fleet of Imperial Russia, and thus leaped to become the most powerful naval power in the world. This kind of great traditional spiritual power really inspires our infinite respect. Over the decades, the Japanese Navy has strived for self-improvement and continued to endure arduous and fierce training, thus establishing the foundation for today's inevitable victory in war. This is by no means an accidental gain. When we study the reasons for Japan's repeated naval victories, we cannot but respect the great spirit of regarding death as home, the love of the monarch, fierce training, and the active cultivation of internal naval strength. Japanese soldiers can be forged into brave warriors who fight bloody hand-to-hand combat and disregard their own safety, while generals are selfless. I remember that at the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War, Admiral Yamagi, the Japanese Naval Minister who commanded the Japanese Navy and grasped the great power of military administration and strategy, once firmly said, "Half of Japan's warships will sink and half of the soldiers will be killed or injured, but the remaining half will surely destroy all Russian warships." This remark is the Japanese traditional spirit, that is, the suicidal tactic.

As for the internal strength of the Japanese Navy, on the one hand, it actively cultivates naval cadres and talents, and on the other hand, it strives for the effectiveness of the quality of warships. Therefore, the number of Japanese naval talents and the excellence of combat technology are far beyond the imagination of the enemy. And the tonnage of Japanese warships and the speed of construction are beyond our ideal. This is definitely not comparable to Britain and the United States. This Greater East Asia War is the final battle of the world's great changes. At present, Allied Japan has controlled the entire combat waters of Greater East Asia. Japan is in an internal combat position. The large and small islands in the Pacific are solid fortresses, and the navy is responsible for protecting its transportation to the mainland. Based on this, attacking the bases of Britain and the United States is also the task of the navy. Therefore, the current task of the Japanese Navy is far greater than that of the Russo-Japanese War. Now half of the naval power of Britain and the United States in the Pacific has been wiped out, and they can only conduct guerrilla-style activities and make false and exaggerated reports to deceive their own people. Because of the loss of British and American naval power, they cannot make various counter-offensive attempts. Although the war has not yet ended, it is inevitable that victory will not belong to Britain and the United States. The Eastern Asian people can win this Greater East Asia War. We admire the power of the Japanese Navy and the old bravery of its naval officers and men. China and Japan share the responsibility of defending East Asia. Looking at the spiritual strength of the Japanese Navy, our naval compatriots should also use it as a mirror for military training. For decades, our country's naval construction work has almost completely stagnated. After the National Government returned to the capital, it actively built the navy. Although this is a very difficult task, there will be no great achievements in the short term, but as long as we persevere and constantly strive, there will always be a day of success. The history of Japan's naval construction is the same as ours today in its early stage. This is our good example. In the future, in addition to actively seeking to strengthen and develop the quality of ships, we must also accelerate the training of a large number of naval cadres and talents in terms of cultivating human resources, so that all of them can be used by the country, so that they can give full play to the power of our navy in this holy war and bear the responsibility for the victory of the war. Recently, in order to train competent naval personnel, the Ministry of the Navy, in addition to the original Central Naval Academy, has specially recruited the first class of merchant marine students, with the aim of training merchant marine crew members to work hand in hand with the navy. Judging from the enthusiasm of those who have signed up, it is enough to prove the ardent expectations of the compatriots across the country for the construction of the new China and the new navy. In the future, the Ministry of the Navy will continue to organize it, and I hope that the outstanding young people from all over the country will actively apply for the examination, so that the naval power of our country can be strengthened. On the occasion of the 39th Naval Memorial Day of Japan, we sincerely wish Japan a complete victory in naval battles, the prosperity of East Asian national fortunes, and jointly look forward to the arrival of the final victory. Army Minister Ye Peng's Broadcast Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - To commemorate the Allied Naval Day, the Propaganda Department held a special broadcast. On the evening of the 26th, Army Minister Ye Peng gave a speech entitled "A View of the Past and Present of Japan's Naval Victory." He briefly stated that the same points in Japan's naval battles in the past and present were: First, sinister conspiracies aroused a desperate struggle. The Japanese Navy's desperate struggle in the Russo-Japanese War was aroused by sinister conspiracies and espionage. Second, the improper way out must be beaten. Third, waiting for work at leisure will surely win. Fourth, recklessly claiming to be naval predecessors will surely be defeated by underestimating the enemy. Fifth, relying on strong armor and sharp soldiers will surely be destroyed. Since Japan's naval battles in the past and present have many of the same points, we can learn from the past and look at the present, and we can predict that Japan's victory in this naval battle will be the same.

Thus, the unified front line of the German army can be completed. The advantages of this cannot be determined at present, but the front line is greatly shortened, which is beneficial to the German army. The German rearguard strongly resisted the attacking American troops everywhere, and fought back with knives, making the enemy's response more cautious. Another important move is that the British attempt to land north of the Nettuno encirclement on Tuesday has been destroyed, and its landing troops, totaling several regiments, have been wiped out.

The enemy army in the areas of Pontecorvo and Piedmont dispatched a strong tank force and made some progress. As a result, the German rearguard had to retreat to the Melfa area.

### Special Edition of the Allied Nation Japan Navy Day, No. 7

Greeting the 39th Navy Day - Colonel Matsushima's Preface

Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, we are once again greeting the third Navy Day. Observing the trend of the war situation, the enemy's counterattack, which began in August two years ago, has become more intense year by year. Now, the US Pacific Fleet led by Admiral Nimitz and the British-American joint forces commanded by MacArthur are cooperating and echoing each other, trying to advance rapidly from the central breakthrough line across the Marshall Islands, Truk, etc., and the southwestern breakthrough line from the Solomon Islands, Bismarck, and New Guinea northward, in an attempt to break our country's counterattack formation, seek improvement in the war situation, and seize a good opportunity for a decisive battle, with the aim of fatally wounding Greater East Asia. This is the current situation.

In addition, the clamor for opening a second front in Western Europe, which was sung to the skies, has now turned from shouting into reality. Thus, the fate of our Axis nation Germany, like ours, stands at a critical juncture of life and death. This means that the outcome of the war will inevitably reach a decisive stage in the first half of this year.

At this critical moment, greeting the 39th Navy Day has infinite significance. We deeply imprint in our minds the instructions of the predecessors in the Russo-Japanese War, and inherit the glorious achievements of today's foundation of our country's war power. With the traditional spirit accumulated over more than 30 years and the technical power of winning every battle, we must resolutely and severely strike the enemy's general counterattack in order to determine the fate of the Imperial Country and seek the further clarification of Greater East Asia construction.

The following is a brief description of the information provided to our compatriots for reflecting on and understanding the current situation.

The Significance of the Battle of the Sea of Japan and the Changes in Modern Naval Warfare

"Upon receiving the alarm that enemy ships have been discovered, the Combined Fleet immediately set out to sink them. The weather is clear today, but the waves are high." "The fate of the Empire rests on this battle, everyone, strive hard!" Such telegrams and signals that will forever be recorded in history are still vibrating in the eardrums of our Japanese people and impacting our hearts.

The Great Battle of the Sea of Japan on May 27 and 28, 1905, has become a good source of inspiration and encouragement for the Japanese people, strengthening their determination to die for their country. The naval battle at that time, like the Battle of Mukden on land, was the so-called decisive battle that determined the fate of the Russo-Japanese War. I think there is no need to elaborate on this point!

The legacy of the Combined Fleet, which received the Imperial Edict from Emperor Meiji, "Because of your loyalty and valor, you are not ashamed before the spirits of your ancestors, therefore I am very pleased," is immortal and will forever shine in history.

As a result of the naval battle at that time, our country had absolute control of the sea in the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea area. Our country's land army supply line was secured, so the land army's operations proceeded without any anxiety. As for Russia, due to the collapse of the navy, direct combat became impossible, and the morale of the people declined, so they abandoned the idea of continuing the war.

The significance of the Battle of the Sea of Japan is indeed so great, and it had a decisive impact on the construction of the Russian navy afterwards, which is easy to judge even from today's situation.

Because for naval construction, from building warships to training sailors, many years are needed, and it cannot be expected to be achieved by hastily throwing together a crew.

However, with the development of modern science, the structure and performance of naval vessels and weapons have become increasingly complex and sophisticated. At the same time, epoch-making progress and development have been made in terms of application, strategy, and tactics. Moreover, the development of aircraft and submarines has become an essential element of maritime power, thus making the battlefield on a wider scale increasingly complex and malevolent. Under what form will the large fleets engage in battles? This is precisely the question that the world is racking their brains over. In such a period, the Greater East Asia War closely followed World War II and was born.

In Europe, the German navy is relatively inferior to the British and American navies. Therefore, the strategy adopted by Germany is the same as in the previous World War, avoiding decisive battles with the main forces as much as possible and focusing on disrupting communication lines or mobile warfare. The Allied Powers of Britain and the United States mainly adopt a blockade strategy. The importance of protecting sea control has not changed now. The sea control of the Mediterranean Sea has already been lost. Looking at the results caused by the wars in Africa and the South Seas today, it is not difficult to imagine. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the great change in naval tactics has been the position of aircraft in naval warfare.

The naval battles in Hawaii and Malaya gave the British and American main fleets a decisive blow in the Pacific. At the same time, the power displayed by aircraft in later naval battles caused Britain and the United States, especially the United States, to change their naval strategy to aircraft-first doctrine, and the formation and strategic form of their fleets were completely changed, with the ideal of air power omnipotence as the foundation for reform. The great navy that the United States had painstakingly built for the past two decades suffered a fatal blow. Now, in order to recover from the setback, they are exerting all their efforts and have successively drafted three expansion plans since the beginning of 1943. Their core goal is to greatly expand aircraft and submarines, because at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, Britain and the United States suffered a series of defeats, mainly due to the lack of aircraft. Therefore, President Roosevelt planned to produce 50,000 aircraft per year in his 1940 Congressional message (this number was reached in 1943), with a target of producing 60,000 aircraft in 1942 and 125,000 aircraft in 1943.

At the same time, maritime operations have abandoned the principle of decisive battles with large fleet battles centered on large, heavily armed battleships. Now they focus on mobile warfare with ever-changing aircraft carrier groups, and even temporarily suspended the construction of battleships and focused on the construction of aircraft carriers. Furthermore, in order to make up for their shortcomings, they converted cruisers into escort aircraft carriers, so the United States currently has as many as 45 aircraft carriers.

The operation mainly with aircraft is to conduct decisive battles under air supremacy. Therefore, in addition to engaging in battles with aircraft carrier groups as mobile units, it is also necessary to use air bases to advance operations, the so-called frog-leap operations or island-hopping operations. In this way, since February 1942, the counterattack started in the Solomon Islands and has continued to intensify to this day.

The question we should pay attention to here is whether a decisive battle between all fleets, like the Battle of the Sea of Japan, will occur in future naval warfare.

Everyone knows that water has no constant form, and war has no constant strategy. Therefore, it is really difficult to guarantee under what circumstances a great naval battle of cutting off all means of retreat like in the past will occur. However, we can at least say that the operation method currently adopted by the US Navy focuses on using several aircraft carrier groups to conduct mobile warfare in a ghostly manner, using the strategy of luring the tiger away from the mountain to lure out our country's fleet, and then mainly using the power of aircraft to carry out a method of defeating them one by one. This is an obvious fact.

In the current situation where the progress of aircraft is endless, except for special occasions such as night battles, the victory or defeat of naval battles is mostly determined by the superiority or inferiority of aircraft. Therefore, the future decisive battle is to lure the enemy's main fleet into the maximum utilization circle of our own land-based air bases, and at the same time, we will maximize the use of our naval air power to annihilate them. This point can also be admitted from the perspective of the operational tendency adopted by the US Navy today!

Secondly, what should be noted is that maritime power is only meaningful under the condition of ensuring sea control, and sea control must have value under the premise of ensuring air supremacy. In today's situation, no matter how much the role of maritime power is reduced, the idea that maritime transportation only relies on aircraft is an exaggeration. In short, do not forget that long-term sea control and the transportation of large quantities of materials and troops still rely on ships as the main body.

Due to the development of aircraft and submarines, whether large and expensive warships such as battleships are still necessary in the future has become the focus of controversy. However, since the enemy has a large number of battleships, we certainly also need to maintain a large number of heavy ships. This is to prepare for the ever-changing state of naval warfare.

In short, taking the Greater East Asia War as an opportunity, the state of naval warfare has changed to the form of aircraft-centricism - the form of air combat as the main focus. Therefore, the value of air bases or bases has increased, and at the same time, in order to ensure the base in the outer ocean and guarantee the actions of the fleet, the securing of the replenishment route is becoming increasingly important. Therefore, it has now become a popular period for the use of submarines and anti-submarine warfare methods.

On the one hand, as is prevalent on the European battlefield, the importance of aircraft in protecting commerce or disrupting commerce is increasing. In addition, the emergence of radio wave weapons, magnetic mines, and "rocket" bombs has made naval warfare gradually become a competition of scientific culture and fighting methods. The Current Stage of the Greater East Asia Maritime Operations

On April 10 this year, US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral King shamelessly said in the House Committee: "In the next six months, the American people must know that there will be great sacrifices in the war against Japan." He also said: "Since the beginning of the war, the US Navy's ships and materials have only now been replenished, and the Japanese Navy will fully realize this in the next few months."

Recently, the US Navy has dispatched mobile units and has twice bombed Truk Island since mid-February this year. In addition, it has attempted to invade Polao Island and Ponape from the air. On the other hand, it also wants to land at Hollandia on the north coast of New Guinea.

According to a Washington telegram on May 10, US Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Nimitz recently met with Southwest Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Halsey and US Fleet Commander Admiral King in San Francisco. The Navy Department's public announcement said that the three giants decided that if there is an opportunity, they hope to completely defeat the Japanese Navy and start an offensive with all their strength.

Such reports are indeed the same old talk of intimidation and rumors. However, many recent promotions have shown the direction of US operations. According to their propaganda and the actions of the fleet, the US Navy intends to conduct a desperate and all-out decisive battle in the near future, and a large-scale attack is imminent. This can be clearly seen.

Why is the United States so eager to seek a decisive battle? The reasons are as follows: First, without a definite war goal, there is no central goal to raise the national war spirit, and the domestic situation has become unsuitable for a protracted war. The repeated strikes in many factories and the exposure of the plan to assassinate Roosevelt fully prove that the situation is not suitable for a protracted war.

Second, domestic production labor has reached its maximum limit. It is not easy to maintain high production this time. According to the statement made by Aircraft Production Minister Wilson, the production rate of US aircraft decreased in April compared to March. In March, 8,730 aircraft were produced. It can also be inferred that the production capacity of the United States will decrease.

Third, observing the form of the war on the India-Burma border, even if we stand on the strategic position of Chongqing and India, there is a need to quickly assist the Asian continent.

Not long ago, part of the US mobile unit participated in the air raid on Sabang in northern Sumatra, which may also contain the intention of this policy.

Fourth, in terms of President Roosevelt's election policy, it is also necessary to achieve a decisive victory before July.

Based on the above analysis, the fundamental reason for not giving Japan time has arisen. Therefore, regardless of everything, they are only eager to pursue a decisive battle. This is an obvious fact.

What is the strategic direction of the US plan? This point, of course, has been openly stated in countless telegrams. Judging from today's trend, it is not difficult to imagine that one route is to pass through the Marshall Islands, Truk Island, and Polao Islands and rush towards the Philippines; the second route is to point directly at the Philippines from the north coast of New Guinea. These two directions are most worthy of attention.

The intention of the United States is to cut off the communication line between the Japanese mainland and the resource area by securing the war contact line from the Philippines to China. In addition, they will advance from the Chinese mainland and launch a decisive attack on the Japanese mainland. This is also a self-evident fact.

In any case, what they rely on is superior aircraft warfare, followed by the landing operations of the surprise attack troops, and then consolidating the base and rushing to the next stronghold. There is no doubt about this tactic.

Recently, the US Air Force on the Chinese mainland has transported a large number of aircraft from India through air transport and expanded its aircraft base, which will cooperate with the attack of US aircraft coming from the ocean.

Therefore, the Pacific Fleet under the command of Nimitz, based in Hawaii, and the US-Australian Allied Forces under the command of MacArthur, with Australia as a springboard, are accumulating strength and sharpening their swords, preparing to advance on the invasion route.

Naturally, do not forget that in parallel with this, there is also a containment battle in the north or through the central Pacific to invade the Japanese mainland.

Recently, the Southwest Pacific Fleet under the command of Halsey was defeated in the war and suffered great losses. Therefore, it was finally dissolved and placed under the direct command of Generals Nimitz and MacArthur. Halsey himself was transferred to be the chief of staff of the Pacific Fleet. However, the plan of Halsey, who is called the admiral of the battleship navy, can be imagined to have considerable schemes.

The enemy's blind offensive, the more ripe the time is, the more they will come to invade at any cost. This is what we should know today. At the same time, it is not difficult to imagine that the enemy will launch a large-scale decisive battle in the second half of this year. We can only use the long-standing spirit of Great Japan and the strategic posture of winning every battle to crush the enemy's attack.

The Characteristics of Modern Warfare and Enemy Propaganda

As mentioned above, modern naval warfare mainly uses aircraft and submarines. Another point that needs to be kept in mind is that in conducting wars in such a vast theater, the victory or defeat in a local area is a common occurrence for military strategists. The main thing is that our side has far-sighted plans to defeat the enemy's main force and strive for comprehensive victory. This goes without saying. The enemy uses flowery and false propaganda to deceive the sight and hearing of people all over the world. The propaganda headquarters in London, Washington, Chongqing, and Ceylon are all performing the ugly態 of croaking cicadas in unison.

However, one point needs to be noted, that is, a lie told three times will be considered the truth. At the same time, propaganda that is similar to the war situation can sometimes have a surprising effect.

The fact that the enemy's propaganda is full of falsehood can be seen more clearly from the list of lost submarines in 1942 released on May 10, which shows their contradictions. However, their efforts in carrying out propaganda and the ingenuity of their methods are becoming increasingly sharp with the development of the war situation.

In some cases, they propagate our side's disadvantages in order to depress the people's will to fight.

This kind of propaganda technology requires more intelligence than the power of aircraft and warships, and attacks our country. From the rear far away from the battlefield, its power will directly affect our lives. This point is most worthy of attention. In addition, in parallel with propaganda, there are also so-called strategic wars such as assassination, conspiracy, spreading poison, and sabotage.

### Talk by Commander Kondo of the Japanese Fleet in China: Promoting the Traditional Spirit of the Japanese Navy

Commander Kondo Sotake of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China gave a speech on the occasion of the 39th Navy Day, reflecting on the brilliant significance of the Battle of Tsushima and urging the Imperial Navy to imbue the spirit of that battle into the decisive battle in the Pacific, while urging all ethnic groups in East Asia to rise up together. The content of his speech is recorded below:

Glorious Achievements of Senior Soldiers

I am pleased to meet the 39th Navy Memorial Day during the Great East Asia War. Remembering that the fate of our country was tied to that battle, I am deeply moved by the military achievements of the senior generals and soldiers who fought bravely and defeated strong enemies in the Sea of Japan, deciding the overall situation of the Russo-Japanese War. The great achievements in the naval battle were of course due to the prestige of His Majesty the Emperor and the advice of successive gods, but the Imperial Navy was able to overcome any difficult situation and exert skillful strategies, which cannot be diminished.

The success of Lushun and Incheon at the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War was a great prelude. Subsequently, the Combined Fleet blockaded the enemy's main force in Lushun, echoing the mobile operations of the Urakan Fleet. On May 15, 37th year of Meiji, most of the ships lost once below Chika Island. In the Yellow Sea naval battle on the 10th of the following month, they pursued and fought hard. Today, remembering the ancient hearts of the generals and soldiers of the fleet at that time, makes me feel admiration in my heart. After the Baltic Fleet sailed from the coast, until the capture of Lushun, the whole country was worried, and the cooperation of the army and navy resulted in repeated hard battles, not hesitating major sacrifices, and capturing the Lushun fortress in a short period of time, destroying the enemy fleet there, which was also the main reason for the great victory in the Battle of the Sea of Japan.

The War Situation Has Entered the Decisive Battle Stage

Looking ahead to the current war situation in the Greater East Asia, the British and American counterattacks are becoming more and more fierce. Even if we do not mention the words and deeds of enemy leaders such as MacArthur and Nimitz, the foolish temptation of the enemy's mobile units in New Guinea and the southeastern seas of Ogasawara can also be clearly judged as the enemy's counterattack. The enemy has relied on its material strength and adopted the so-called island-hopping tactics, but they are silent about the heavy damage they have suffered, trying to conceal the failure of the decisive battle. Today, they feel that the prolongation of the war is most unfavorable to them, and they intend to form a second battle line in Western Europe as a desperate measure.

From the enemy's movements, anyone can feel that the current war situation has entered a decisive stage, but our Japanese Navy will use the footprints left by our predecessors in the Battle of the Sea of Japan, and the many difficulties and tactics experienced in the past, as the key to reducing the enemy and completing the posture of being unperturbed in the face of danger.

Important Times, Rise Up Together

The Pacific War situation will determine the future fate of Greater East Asia. Our 100 million Japanese people should rise up together to restore Greater East Asia to its original state. The Republic of China and other East Asian allies, under solid unity, are advancing towards the thorough implementation of the operation, and the day of achieving our goals is not far away.

Japan's combat power, such as the production of aircraft and the construction of warships, has made great progress in all aspects, and is making rapid progress in defeating the enemy. This is of course a manifestation of the Japanese people's spirit of serving the country, as well as the direct and indirect support and cooperation of the peoples of allied countries. I would like to express my deep gratitude here, and I hope to give even greater cooperation. At this time of great turning point in the world, the time is right to promote the youthful spirit of our East Asian nations. I hope that the people of the allied countries will not be deceived by British and American propaganda, and will be self-reliant and go to this important situation together.

Football Tournament, the team will be sent by the liaison office to fight against the Three Provinces. It will be held at the Bian Country Stadium at 5 pm. At that time, the city government and the Secretary-General will be invited to give the opening speech, and Mr. Zuo Tan, the Minister of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, will hold the opening ceremony to show solemnity. The First Police Bureau Band will also be present to play music to enhance the elegance. After the competition, Mr. Wen Lanting will be invited to hold the award ceremony.

According to the battle between the Liaison Office and the Three Provinces, the Liaison Office has returned from the Northern Expedition with a reputation, and its strength has increased. It should be able to give the audience a very good impression. The soldiers of the Three Provinces have been improving their skills in recent years, and they are now encountering

Basketball and Ping Pong, Starting at 5 pm, basketball, volleyball and ping pong performances will be held at the West Qiao Youth Association. Mr. Lin Kanghou will be invited to deliver the opening remarks, and Mr. Yuan Chengdeng (ping pong match), Mr. Shen Zhanliang (volleyball match), and Mr. Zhao Zhengping (basketball match) will present the awards respectively.

### Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Calligraphy and Painting: A Forest of Famous Works: Commander Kondo and Others Visit the Exhibition

The Second Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Calligraphy and Painting organized by the Continental New Report and this newspaper, in celebration of Japanese Navy Day, was held at the Nan Hwa Mao Hotel on Nanjing Road. It has already been held yesterday morning and those who went to visit were in an endless stream. In the afternoon, Commander Kondo of the Allied Japanese Fleet in China, Naval Attaché Kondo, Chief of the Fleet Reporting Department Colonel Matsushima, and Salt Field Daizuo visited the exhibition. President Oizumi of Daiichi Shimbun, Special Director Akamatsu, and President Chen of this newspaper personally received them. Although only 200 pieces of paintings are displayed this time, they are all precious collections of maritime collectors, as well as carefully crafted masterpieces by modern masters. The ancient supervisors range from the Song Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, and all have famous works, such as the landscape pavilion map of Wang Wei in the book Dynasty, the Lihua Magpie Map of Huang Quan in the Five Dynasties, the Ancient Wood and Bamboo Stone Map of Ni Yunlin in the Yuan Dynasty, and the Autumn Mountain Xiao Temple Map of Wang Shuming, all of which are extremely valuable works, which are not easily seen outside. The exhibition period is for one week, until the 29th.

### Reader Scholarship News: Practical Calligraphy Competition

The Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Committee believes that the calligraphy of general students is poor. When they first enter society, the writing is ugly and unsightly, or the writing is too slow, which hinders service efficiency. Therefore, it specially holds a "Practical Calligraphy Competition" to create guidance. However, this competition focuses on the word "practical," with neatness, affection, agility, and the ordinary calligraphy competition are different. The following are the simple rules:

Participants in the competition are limited to the current aided students in the senior primary school and junior high school groups. Participants should prepare a piece of white paper 12 inches high and 8 inches wide, divided into 8 lines, regardless of horizontal lines, and write the full text of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, in regular script or running script. The competition is divided into two groups, Mao Pen and Pen, and participation is free. (You can participate in both groups.) On the left, write the school, grade, name, age, and registration number of the scholarship in this session, and the teacher should ask for help to prove it. The solicited methods must be sent to the "Shen Bao Let Scholarship Office" before June 4, and will be invalid if overdue. The solicited calligraphy will be reviewed by this office. The first round will select 15 people from each grade, and they will be notified to come to the second round to avoid cheating and observe their speed. Ten people will be selected from each grade and given awards on a regular basis to show encouragement.

Mingzhe School Health Speech, The school health speech sponsored by Mu Chu will be held tomorrow (Sunday) at 10:00 am. The first speech will be given by Mr. Chuantong, "The Scientific View of the Universe." The location is at Xinzha Road Elementary School. I hope that aided students above high school will come to listen with the tickets. In addition, due to postal delays, those who have not received the lectures can arrive early.

### Broadcasting Association Holds Music and Film Conference to Celebrate Allied Navy Day

In order to celebrate the Allied Navy Day, the China Broadcasting Association and the China Film Company jointly held a grand music and film conference at the Majestic Theatre yesterday (26th) at 1:30 pm. More than 2,000 people from the Allied Fleet Reporting Department Salt Tian Dajie, Shanghai Broadcasting Station Director Chen Zhengzhang, and all walks of life came, and the grand occasion was unprecedented and the feelings were enthusiastic. Shanghai Broadcasting Station broadcast the event on the spot. First, Chen Zhengzhang, Director of Shanghai Broadcasting Station, delivered an opening speech, followed by Yan Tian Dazuo's speech entitled "The Time for Decisive Battle is Approaching, We Must Decisively Obtain the Final Victory." The Shanghai Symphony Orchestra then performed famous songs, and the film "Ambition Lingling" was screened at the end. The film fully demonstrates the spirit of sacrifice of the Allied Navy, and the audience was deeply moved.

Yan Tian Dajie's Speech

Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, it has been the third Navy Memorial Day. At this memorable time, I am very honored to have the opportunity to talk about the current situation of the war, organized by the China Broadcasting Association and the China Film Company to celebrate Navy Day.

Unprecedented 40 Years Ago

Forty years ago from now, General Togo of our country, Japan, led the Combined Fleet and attacked the Russian "Baltic" Fleet in the Sea of Japan, winning an unprecedented victory in the history of the world war. Of the enemy's fleet of 38 ships, only two sailed to "Vladivostok", and the remaining 36 were either sunk by us or captured by us. More than 6,000 prisoners were taken, starting with the commander. At this time, our losses were only three torpedo boats. There are of course various reasons why we were able to achieve such a victory. Now let me talk about them.

The first is to break Russia's ambition to dominate East Asia and preserve our right to survival. The second is that the people of our country, Japan, can fully understand that the victory or defeat of this war can determine the prosperity or decline of Japan, so they concentrate all their strength on this war from top to bottom. The third is that every soldier is filled with the spirit of dying for the country. This state of Japan forty years ago is the state of Japan today. The only difference is that the enemy is not Russia, but Britain and the United States. The battlefield is not Manchuria, but the vast Pacific. But the purpose of the war and the determination of the people are the same. The ambition of the enemy, Britain and the United States, to make trouble is extremely clever compared to the stupid Russia. The scale is as large as it can be. Judging from history, the modern history of Asia is also the history of our ancestors excluding the forces of Britain and the United States with blood. Since the beginning of the modern colonial movement in Britain, for 300 years, our ancestors were their slaves and were driven by them, just like the occupation of India and Burma, and the Treaty of Nanjing, the Treaty of Beijing, and the Treaty of Tianjin. If we intend to count the history of the invasion of Asia by the British and Americans, we will never be able to count them with ten fingers. Unfortunately, we Asians have not realized that we have great power, and we have also been tricked by the enemy, turning our lives into opium and gradually eliminating ourselves. In this Greater East Asia that is gradually heading towards extinction, Japan eliminated the Russian fleet and won a great victory, thus awakening the nations of Greater East Asia from their dreams. From then on, Greater East Asia began a spiritual struggle against Britain and the United States. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said: "Since Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War, all Asian nations have wanted to establish an independent movement to break Europe. The place where this trend is going will probably be the union of Asian nations." Since the Battle of Tsushima, the Japanese Navy has taken on the important task of monitoring the British and American invasion of East Asia from the sea based on historical inevitability, so the war between Japan and Britain and the United States became a historical destiny forty years ago.

American Ambition Completely Exposed

However, Japan had to avoid war for the sake of world peace, so after preparing everything properly, it sent two representatives, Nomura and Kurisu, to the United States for the final peace negotiations. However, the United States treated us as congenital slave nations, believing that the United States' invasion of East Asia was a matter of course from the perspective of world peace, and threatened us with their American-style views. As a result, our efforts were in vain and the talks broke down. Based on the above points, Japan's war goals are clear and obvious. It is indeed a heaven-priced defense operation, and it is a so-called just war to free Greater East Asia from the British and American pirate colonial policies. Japan's war goals cannot be attacked by anyone, but why are the British and Americans fighting? The enemy soldiers said: "The object of the war is very clear, but why do we need to fight?" The biggest goal of the enemy's scholars is to turn Greater East Asia into South America, and they use slogans such as "for democracy," "for humanity," and "for freedom" to force the people to die in battle. But it is doubtful how long this situation can continue. The collapse of hegemony is obvious in history, and the United States' ambition to dominate the new world is no exception. The kind American people, watching the reality of their country, have fully understood what American democracy is and what American humanity means. Therefore, there is now internal strife in the United States and the United Nations. Racial antagonism and frequent strikes in the United States are real examples. Even in the United Nations, there are issues such as the Americanization of British territory, the silent war between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the mutual suspicion between Britain and the Soviet Union. The American leadership, which has no war goals, continues to be in internal strife.

Sacrifices Major, Counterattack Begins

However, because the United States is a country that exaggerates material strength, it was temporarily stunned after the defeat at Pearl Harbor and the loss of various bases in the Pacific at the beginning of the war. Since January of the year before last, it has used all its strength to reorganize the navy and began a major counterattack against Japan. Now let's talk about the enemy's counterattack. The American Navy is from Hawaii, through the Marshall Islands, Torac, Guam, Manila, to China, that is, so-called central New Guinea, the so-called South Nymity, and the commander of the United Joint Forces in the Southwest Pacific, MacArthur, wants to use the mobile units of the aircraft carrier group to occupy each stronghold in turn, and when possible, he intends to use the so-called leaping war to fight a decisive battle with our country, Japan's fleet in one fell swoop, and then invade China, using China as a battlefield. However, the enemy's operation has only occupied a few small islands after a year and nine months, but the damage they have suffered in terms of personnel and materials has been a great sacrifice. Since January 30 last year, the enemy has been shouting the Nimitz offensive, regardless of the great sacrifice. According to the estimate, the number of books the enemy has suffered in terms of people, even if only looking at the sea, is as many as 298,000. In terms of naval warfare, they have suffered a defeat, and a part of New Britain and the Solomon Islands are still in our possession. All the land forces are concentrated in New Guinea, and their operations cannot be carried out according to plan, but have become a good target for our air force. Looking at the Indian Ocean, the British General Mountbatten and the American General Stilwell abandoned the Burmese counterattack due to disagreement on operations, and moved the headquarters to Sikkim, but for the sake of their own face, they sent a part of the mobile units to Sumatra, so there is simply nothing to say about the enemy's tactical intent in this regard. As mentioned above, the enemy wants to fight a decisive battle with Japan regardless of the great sacrifice. What is the reason why the American army insists on its own desired operations, even breaking the operations methods of other joint chiefs? This is a very interesting question.

Four Reasons for Urgently Wanting a Decisive Battle: I think the reasons why the United States is so eager for a decisive battle are:

First, because there is no firm war goal, there is no central goal to boost the national will to fight, so the prolongation of the war is easy to cause turmoil in the United States, just like the continuous strikes in the factory, and the incident of planning to kill Roosevelt. These are all signs of domestic unrest, and because of the great sacrifice of American soldiers, the conscription of young people has become a reason to fuel the war atmosphere. Due to the destruction of the countryside and the relocation of many people of different races, various social problems have arisen. As a result, the people have seen clearly the current war situation and simply do not believe in the slogans of "for justice" and "for democracy" shouted by the leaders.

Second, domestic production has reached its maximum limit, and there is no hope for future increases. The loan of weapons, and the reduction of the loan of weapons, can become the reason why the United States cannot win over the United Nations, so it must win immediately.

Third, from a political and legal point of view, Chongqing and India must be prevented from defecting from now on. As far as possible, a connection route with the mainland should be established as soon as possible, because this is also the reason for controlling Greater East Asia in the future.

Fourth, Roosevelt hopes to be elected for the fourth time when the president is elected this autumn, so he must win a major victory to change the national interest. From a military point of view, anxiety is the most cautious thing, and anxious people will fail. The United States initially announced that it would take a long time to defeat Japan, but now it hopes most for a time war.

The enemy hopes for short-term operations. Then the enemy's engine has increased several times, and this heavy industry is continuing to be established in the south. Third, the bases occupied by Japan are extremely fortified and strengthened month by month. The long-term war will only increase the sacrifice of the United States. Fourth, Japan maintains its human power and waits for the consumption of American troops before launching a counterattack. Fifth, the recent international situation is even more subtle, and it is simply unpredictable to study why the changes are so rapid. Sixth, Asia is gradually moving towards unity. Based on the above reasons, the enemy is eager to fight a decisive battle with the Japanese fleet, but in fact it is the Japanese Navy that holds the key to the decisive battle. When the Japanese Navy gives them the opportunity for a decisive battle based on their wishes, then the United States will suffer a major defeat, just like the Battle of the Sea of Japan forty years ago. I have said before that the ultimate goal of the United States is to conquer Greater East Asia, and its central goal is actually China. The plan of the United States is to advance to China first and use China's conditions in terms of personnel and materials to defeat Japan. At the same time, it monopolizes post-war China, just like monopolizing the Chongqing Air Force and taking over the guidance power in Chongqing. These are all to achieve his plan.

Confident of Victory

Colonel Kana of the US Army said in his book "American Attack Operations": "If there is no real base in Asia, the United States cannot maintain its position in the Far East." Now let me briefly explain what methods the American leaders use to deceive the people and make the people care about Greater East Asia. From a historical point of view, the American people must care about Europe, and in order to make the people's concern turn to East Asia, they sing the song of defeating Germany first. The people of Britain and the United States think this is a matter of course, but Chongqing and Australia and New Zealand have launched fierce opposition. Of course, the leaders of the American conquest of East Asia have long anticipated this opposition, which is what they want. On the one hand, the US government sent the diplomatic delegation Wilkie to Chongqing to promote the importance of East Asia to the people. After the completion of this plan, Roosevelt declared that the Pacific must be valued, held the Quebec Conference, and invaded China according to the plan; now it is expelling the forces of Britain and the Soviet Union and creating a solid force in Chongqing, as explained above. We have established the historical destiny of fighting against Britain and the United States forty years ago, and this historical destiny has now become a reality, and fierce battles are being fought everywhere. But we should re-recognize why the enemy is so eager to fight a decisive battle and why they are advancing into China. In this decisive battle period, the main fleet of the Japanese Navy is silently waiting for the maturity of the opportunity for a decisive battle. We have full awareness that in this decisive battle, we will definitely win and break the innate superiority of the British and Americans as Asian fighting peoples. I am now reintroducing it to you.

### Navy Memorial Day Special - Continued from Page Two

When the war situation is temporarily unfavorable, this kind of propaganda can have the effect of dry wood meeting a raging fire. Looking back at the examples of the last World War, as well as the Netherlands and Belgium in this current war, proves that this theory is not absurd. Moreover, when the feeling of lacking essential necessities of life arises, it becomes easier to accept enemy propaganda.

American Concepts of Espionage and Military Strategy

Lieutenant Colonel Gannett of the United States Army and military commentator, once said the following in his book "The Offensive Operation of the United States":

"The day Japan launched the September 18th Incident was the day the United States made its final decision on whether to maintain or relinquish the Philippines as a naval and air base. If the United States had decided to maintain it, it should have immediately expressed a firm determination to suppress Japan. That was the time when the United States could have truly striven for a foothold on the mainland in the Far East. If war had been declared with Japan at that time, the United States would have easily defeated Japan. As a result, China could have become a protectorate, and China could have been developed with a continental spirit. Aircraft factories and military airfields could have been established throughout the Far East, and strategic raw materials could have been accumulated on the Chinese mainland base. At least 300,000 American troops could have been stationed in China." He also said, "If there is no true mainland base in Asia, the military position of the United States in the Far East cannot be maintained at all."

Even without looking back at the past of Theodore Roosevelt and John Hay, it is not difficult to imagine what kind of ambitions the United States has for the Far East and China.

However, do not forget that when realizing these ambitions, they are filled with the blood of their pioneer ancestors and possess a tenacious character.

They always regard seizing the world's largest land area as glorious, which is their consistent tradition.

Do not forget that they use strength, effort, and perseverance to strive for their own happiness and prosperity. During the Civil War, they burned to the ground the homes, fields, warehouses filled with food, and pastures filled with livestock of the Southern army in the Virginia area of the same nation, and inflicted extreme cruelty on killing the old, young, and women. In short, their nature is that any sacrifice is worth it for their own happiness and prosperity.

Lieutenant Colonel Gannett said, "There is no absolutely unbreakable battle line in the world, and there is no navy that cannot cross the ocean." Then he added:

"If the United States abandons its defensive strategy of being bound hand and foot, it can begin to implement surprise attacks with a sense of reality, and will not be bound by pre-printed operational plans. At any time, it can seize fleeting opportunities, use America's abundant internal resources, and create ingenious and flexible operational techniques to attack the enemy wherever it is advantageous. Only offensive operations under the guidance of an offensive spirit, and America's abundant material resources, are the path to victory."

Regarding the situation when the book was published on January 2, 1942, he concluded: The war has already reached the stage of stopping ineffective offensives against the Axis powers, and should adopt a decisive offensive stage.

The possibility of taking a decisive offensive against the Axis powers is based on the democratic nations acquiring maritime and air supremacy.

Taking maritime and air supremacy as the basic conditions, consolidating their own firm foothold on the continent, and resolutely adopting an offensive war policy, this is the only way for the American offensive strategy advocated by Gannett.

Based on this, when judging the current situation in the Pacific War, we must bear in mind that their fierce attacks on us will be a hundred times more cruel than the savage behavior of plundering the American continent.

Discussion

The Greater East Asia War has already approached the decisive battle stage.

The purpose of the Greater East Asia War, as indicated in the declaration of war, is to "ensure the stability of East Asia and the peace of the world." Today, based on the long history of our nation's founding, "cherishing friendships with all nations and sharing the joy of co-prosperity with all countries," according to the fundamental principles of this imperial diplomacy, as declared by His Majesty, it is a sacred war to "develop and expand the legacy of our ancestors."

As indicated in the teachings of Emperor Jinmu, it is nothing more than His Majesty's wish to "respond to the virtues bestowed by the gods of heaven and earth, and to promote the righteous heart of the imperial grandson."

Spreading justice to all nations, establishing the national policy of Japan, allowing all nations to be in their proper places, and restoring East Asia to its natural beauty, this is the bright and just goal of this holy war that will be recorded in history forever.

We are in this aerial war drama launched in the year 1601 of the imperial era, according to the spirits of the various nations that have been passed down by the Japanese people since Emperor Jinmu, determined to establish a permanent foundation within the Greater East Asia region during this greatest leap forward.

Compared to England and the United States, which are enslaving the East Asian nations and exploiting the East Asian ideals for their own ambitions and prosperity, there is a fundamentally different point. A prodigal son who spends his time drinking and indulging in pleasure, squandering his ancestors' inheritance without any ability, and doing anything for his own selfish desires, and the self-destructive madness of despair, are completely different from us Japanese.

Therefore, we Japanese who "stand upon the spirits," every move we make is a manifestation of divine will, and at the same time, the unwavering national determination and the firm belief in victory to kill the enemy are all based on this.

Thirty-nine years ago, the tenth descendant of Otomo Mononobe, who carried the fate of the imperial nation on his shoulders and engaged in a desperate battle, is now in a time of nationwide all-out effort to cut down the strange island demons that attempt to cover the world with their giant wings, holding the divine spear and unsheathing the sword.

"The rise and fall of the nation depend on this one battle."

We must each fulfill our greatest responsibility as citizens in our respective professional positions, and ensure that the purpose of the holy war is thoroughly achieved.

Marshal Togo's qualifications and words say: "Do not fear the great enemy, do not insult the small enemy, do not constantly hope that the enemy will not come, but be prepared to deal with them at all times, and never allow the enemy to take advantage of us. Negligence is a great enemy; even for a brief moment, do not be negligent in vigilance." He also said: "The gods only bestow honor and favor on those who devote themselves to peacetime training and win without fighting."

Shine brightly on the Yamato Island in the grassland, when the time comes, slay the demons.

### Marshal Togo - Collection of Golden Sayings

Victory or Defeat Lies in the Spirit of the Commander

In essence, if the fleet battles are to be conducted one by one according to orders, it is bound to be circuitous and misguided. The entire army must look up to the attitude of the commander and follow his example to achieve a great victory. The commander is the guide and beacon for the entire army, not merely a loud-mouthed commander. I hope that those who command our main forces will serve as models for the entire army in their duties.

Enemy in Dire Straits

In wartime, we must have the concept that even if the enemy is many times stronger, they will still be in dire straits. Ancient strategists used this as a basis for a "seven-three" approach to battle, meaning that if you think of it as seven parts for the enemy and three parts for us, in reality it is five parts for each.

Constant Warfare

The life of a warrior is a continuous war, differentiating the importance of their duties by the battles they fight in peacetime. When things happen, exert military force; when things are calm, cultivate yourself; be consistent from beginning to end, and just strive to fulfill your duty.

Constant Training and Cultivation in Peacetime

Victory is in the mind. Peacetime training and determination are most important. You must always remember that peacetime training and constant cultivation are the most important things.

One cannon that hits the target one hundred times out of one hundred is better than one hundred cannons that hit the target once out of one hundred.

Belief

The gods surely bestow honor and favor on those who devote themselves to peacetime training and win without fighting; as for those who are content with a single victory and rest easy in times of peace, they will immediately be deprived of it.

Negligence is the Greatest Enemy

Do not be afraid of the great enemy, do not insult the small enemy, do not always rely on the fact that they have not come, but wait for them at all times, and there will never be anything that cannot be discovered.

Negligence is the greatest enemy. Even for a brief moment, do not be negligent in vigilance!

Invisible Strength

Military strength is not only about rations, troops, etc., but also about utilizing these invisible strengths.

Aggressive Offense is the Best Defense

Once battle has been joined, there is no need for defense. An aggressive offense is the best defense.

Certain Victory and No Defeat

The concept of victory or defeat is something that comes before the battle. Once bayonets are crossed, you must never think about victory or defeat. Those who think of defeat are sure to lose. (End of Full Text) (Ji Qing)
