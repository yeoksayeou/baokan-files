### On Employing Personnel

Our heartfelt and sole proposition for national politics is the rule of law. Because when the government abides by the law and the people abide by the law, the nation embarks on the path of the rule of law, and politics naturally becomes transparent and clear. However, in the thirty-plus years of the Republic of China, the laws we have created and the laws we have adopted from foreign countries are countless, yet the Republic of China remains not a nation of law. The biggest reason lies in personnel; as the saying goes, "There are laws but no one to govern." Therefore, we have sincere requests and hopes regarding the government's employment of personnel from time to time. Recently, the central authorities have paid close attention to employing personnel, which is the most optimistic phenomenon in China. We would like to offer a few more "humble and insignificant" opinions.

Dismissing Redundant Staff. Redundant staff are the biggest waste in national finances; everyone knows this. However, the greatest harm of redundant staff is not this. The greatest harm of redundant staff is obstructing work. Observing Chinese politics over the past thirty-plus years, we can decisively say that any organization with many redundant staff fails to produce decent results. From a small section or department to a large division or ministry, none can escape this common rule. This is because the tension and struggle of a few cannot withstand the decadence and laziness of the majority. Over time, it can make tense people unable to be tense, and struggling people unable to struggle. The impact is that the entire staff is corrupted, and there is no reason why the entire organization should not be corrupted. The causes of redundant staff are mostly the placement of private individuals or perfunctory requests. We hope the authorities understand that placing private individuals and perfunctory requests are not only a waste of public funds but also sufficient to hinder the progress of the enterprise, affect the future of the entire organization, and further affect the faith of the people of the whole country in the governing authorities. Speaking of the redundant staff themselves, developing lazy habits ruins their whole lives. Speaking of those who make requests and introductions, they mislead a friend and mislead an organization. Speaking of the authorities who employ redundant staff, they lose the faith of the entire nation due to the corruption of an enterprise and further bury their entire personal future. As the saying goes, "One wrong move, the whole game is lost." We hope everyone pays attention.

Engaging Capable Talents. Zeng Guofan said, "The strength of a country depends on obtaining talent." He also said, "Revival depends on obtaining talent." The so-called "talent" refers to those who are loyal to the country, are down-to-earth, and work hard. However, capable talents are not like mediocre talents, let alone those who can be "summoned at will." Especially in China, with Confucian thought as the center for thousands of years, the self-esteem of capable talents has shaped the traditional spirit of society. Therefore, the engagement of capable talents has created the most noble social custom and is considered the greatest achievement of the government authorities. And after capable talents are hired, their selfless struggle, even unto death, is considered the highest honor for the country and the individual. Anyone who has read "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" (the book "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" has a huge impact on the national psyche) knows about Liu Bei's "Three Visits to the Thatched Cottage" and also knows about Zhuge Liang's "Giving His All Until His Heart Stops." Because of Liu Bei's "Three Visits to the Thatched Cottage," Zhuge Liang was able to wholeheartedly "Give His All Until His Heart Stops." "A scholar dies for his confidant" is the cultivation and aspiration of a scholar. In the current extraordinary environment, we hope that the capable talents of the entire China will no longer play Zhuge Liang's "Sleeping in Retirement at Longzhong," because there is no Longzhong now, and it is not the time to sleep in retirement. However, we hope that the government authorities will all have the spirit of "respecting the virtuous and condescending to the scholars" and all be like Liu Bei, who "thirsts for talent."

### Chief of the Coast Intelligence Department Broadcast Speech

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Embassy in China, Chief of the Coast Intelligence Department, gave a broadcast speech at 9:20 p.m. on the 9th, titled "Anniversary of the National Government's Participation in the War." The gist of it was that the National Government's participation in the war was completely based on an independent position and arose from an irresistible inner demand, because overthrowing Britain and the United States, restoring China, and defending East Asia were all original goals of the Chinese revolution and were consistent with the common requirements of the Greater East Asia War. The Chinese people should fully appreciate the significance of the Greater East Asia War and fully understand the true meaning of Japan's new policy toward China. Japanese residents in China should regard China as the most trustworthy comrade-in-arms, support each other, and strive for the victory of Greater East Asia.

### Anniversary of Our Participation in the War – China, Japan, and Manchukuo Exchange Broadcasts – Encouraging Each Other to Advance Toward a Common Goal

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Yesterday, the 9th, was the anniversary of our country's participation in the war. China, Japan, and Manchukuo jointly commemorated this day. Our Premier Wang, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo, and Manchukuo State Affairs Minister Zhang exchanged congratulatory broadcasts. The text of Premier Wang's broadcast is as follows:

Premier Wang's Broadcast Speech Vigorously鞭策 and Practices the Declaration

Today is the first anniversary of China's participation in the Greater East Asia War. We welcome this anniversary with full enthusiasm, and we are determined to make greater efforts to contribute to the final victory this year. Recalling that since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States have been successively defeated by the Allied Japan, but their ambitions have not died, and they are barking and counterattacking. The so-called counterattacks in the past year have only increased their consumption of manpower and material resources, and the Greater East Asia front has not been shaken in the slightest. Here, I would like to express my greatest respect to the loyal, brave, hard-working, and sacrificing spirit of the officers and soldiers of the Allied Japanese Navy and Army. Allied Japan has not only established great achievements in military affairs but has also sought to unite the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia with one heart and one mind to complete the construction of independent development and common prosperity in politics, economy, and culture. Since the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance, China and Japan have re-established the foundation of permanent friendship. Since the promulgation of the Greater East Asia Declaration, the countries of Greater East Asia have obtained a common goal of advancing together and striving upward. Mencius's so-called "Heavenly time, geographical advantage, and human harmony" have all been combined. In this year of final victory, the countries of Greater East Asia have full confidence and belief. From today onwards, we must be more vigorous,鞭策 ourselves with the three major guidelines of rectifying thought, ensuring order, and increasing production, in order to fulfill China's responsibility and share the obligations of a member of Greater East Asia. Regarding the沦方, we have repeatedly given advice and hoped that they would reflect. However, since the so-called Cairo Conference, the渝方 has been sinking deeper and further astray, which is truly regrettable. However, I dare to conclude that the closer the渝方 is to Britain and the United States, the further it is from the people of the whole country. Because the recent statements of the渝方 are tantamount to clearly telling the people of the whole country that the渝方 is no longer fighting for China but for Britain and the United States. In detail, for the sake of satisfying the ambitions of Britain and the United States to invade East Asia and even the whole world, the渝方 does not hesitate to be the pawns of Britain and the United States, guiding Britain and the United States to use Chinese land as a place for bombing by airplanes, and does not hesitate to go a step further to make Chinese kill Chinese and make Chinese kill East Asians. The self-destructive and rebellious behavior of the渝方 will definitely not be tolerated by the people of the whole country. Today, we can only cooperate with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Declaration, to answer the false propaganda of the渝方 with victory, and to prepare for the construction to receive the displaced people after the collapse of the渝方.

Japanese Prime Minister's Broadcast Speech Wishes Allied Nations to Make Greater Efforts

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – In Prime Minister Tojo's broadcast speech, the main points are as follows: "Today last year, the National Government of the Republic of China declared war on Britain and the United States, and at the same time declared that it would cooperate with Japan to complete the war. Over the past year, the National Government has been very beneficial to the Greater East Asia War by practicing this. The Japanese government hereby expresses its gratitude. In the year since China's participation in the war, from Japan's point of view, agreements on the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights have been successively implemented, and the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty was fundamentally revised last October, and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was signed to establish the fundamental relationship between China and Japan. This is nothing but a concrete manifestation of Japan's founding spirit. I believe that this will achieve the common mission of China and Japan and realize Sun Yat-sen's ideals. Looking at the entire Greater East Asia, Burma first became independent last August, the Philippines also became independent in October, and the countries of East Asia jointly held the Greater East Asia Conference in November and issued the Greater East Asia Common Declaration, declaring our common beliefs to the world. The five major guidelines in the Declaration are the great charter for the construction of East Asia in the future. On the anniversary of China's participation in the war, I would like to address you and hope that the Allied Chinese people will embrace common ideals and make further efforts towards the final victory under the belief of certain victory.

Manchukuo Prime Minister's Broadcast Speech is Determined to Cooperate to Complete the Mission

Xinjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Manchukuo State Affairs Minister Zhang delivered a broadcast speech, the main points of which are as follows: "On the occasion of the Greater East Asia War achieving brilliant results, and on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Republic of China's participation in the war, I feel heartfelt joy. Recalling that the Republic of China declared war on Britain and the United States on this day last year, at the same time, the relationship between China and Japan has changed from sharing joys and sorrows to sharing life and death. I greatly admire the resolute attitude of the Chinese National Government. Since the Republic of China's participation in the war, Burma and the Philippines have successively become independent, the natives of the South have gained the opportunity to participate in politics, and the Provisional Government of India has also been established, which shows that the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia have each obtained their place, and the foundation of Greater East Asia Co-prosperity has been completely established. The ideal of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere is about to be realized, and our position of certain victory and invincibility is also completely established. This is something that can be celebrated with my fellow Asians. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Manchukuo felt the importance of its own responsibility even more. In order to practice the great meaning of the joint defense of Japan and Manchukuo with one heart and one mind, we are determined to follow the Emperor's edict, devote ourselves to strengthening our combat power and guarding the northern border, and advance with the Allied nations of East Asia towards the path of completing the holy war. China, Japan, Manchukuo, and the various countries and ethnic groups of East Asia must unite more closely, embrace the belief of certain victory, overcome all difficulties, and thoroughly defeat Britain and the United States.

Director Iguchi Delivers a Speech Elaborating on the Significance of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – Director Iguchi of the Japanese Information Bureau met with the Chinese journalist delegation on the 8th and delivered a speech, the gist of which is as follows: "This month's 9th is the first anniversary of China's participation in the war. This is not only the most memorable day in Chinese history but also in East Asian history. From the Japanese side, January 9th last year was the beginning of Japan's promotion of its new policy toward China. The fundamental purpose of Japan's policy toward China is to assist China in raising its international status and at the same time establish a close partnership and cooperation between China and Japan to seek coexistence and co-prosperity. Therefore, Japan's new policy toward China has not changed in this regard. However, before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan could not fully advance toward this fundamental goal because there was a strong British and American force in China. Britain and the United States used all kinds of schemes to hinder Sino-Japanese cooperation, and Japan was sometimes forced to take this path in order to deal with Britain and the United States. Therefore, China sometimes misunderstood Japan, which was caused by this. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the power of Britain and the United States in China was eliminated, and Japan was able to fully implement its policy toward China, that is, to eliminate the power of Britain and the United States on a new foundation based on Japan's righteous diplomacy. In this year, Japan has been consistently implementing its new policy according to this established policy. Japan's new policy toward China reached its peak after the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty in late October last year. Here, I would like to elaborate on the historical significance of the treaty to arouse the attention of the general public. The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and its attached protocol laid the foundation for China's unification and the development of a modern nation. As Chairman Wang said at the time, the Sino-Japanese relationship has opened a new era in East Asia. At the Greater East Asia Conference held in early November last year, the 1 billion people of East Asia decided on the basic principles for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. At this time, Greater East Asia showed a brilliant dawn. The basic spirit of the Greater East Asia Declaration has been concretely expressed in the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. If China is in a semi-colonial position, then Japan cannot prosper independently. If Japan is defeated, then China cannot be completely independent. The fate of China and Japan is historically and geographically one. Therefore, Japan's new policy toward China is based on this fundamental fact. Sun Yat-sen, the father of the Chinese nation, and the National Government led by Chairman Wang had fully recognized the fundamental facts of the Sino-Japanese relationship before China's participation in the war. Therefore, when the Greater East Asia War broke out, Chairman Wang declared that he would share the joys and sorrows with Japan, indicating the path China would follow. However, if China is in a neutral position, the recognition of a shared destiny cannot be thoroughly expressed. Some say that the Greater East Asia War is only a war between Japan and Britain and the United States. However, in fact, China and Japan are in a relationship of sharing life and death. If Japan is defeated by Britain and the United States, then China will inevitably be reduced to destruction. The development and prosperity of China depend on whether the Greater East Asia War can be won. China's participation in the war is sufficient to prove that China has a thorough awareness of this. China has now cast off the shackles of unequal treaties and stands in the position of an autonomous, equal, and completely independent country. This further proves the future of China's participation in the war and the results it will achieve."

### Germany Actively Strengthens Western European Fortresses

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) – It is reported that Marshal Rommel had previously inspected German defenses in various places in detail and agreed with General Renthe-Fink, commander of the German forces stationed in Western Europe, to establish comprehensive measures to defend Europe in order to prepare to intercept the Axis armies' attempt to attack the European continent. German military authorities met with international journalists on the morning of the 7th. The German army has built thousands of fortresses and strongholds along the Atlantic coast, the Strait of Dover and the North Sea coast, installed more than 6,000 85-millimeter long-range cannons and laid millions of mines on the coast. More than 1,700 cannons have also been installed on the Norwegian coast, forming fortresses everywhere. At present, the European Wall, which extends 4,500 kilometers along the coast from the Pyrenees Mountains to Narvik, has been completed, and a complex defense organization has been constructed behind the fortress line. No matter where the Anti-Axis armies land, the German army can use the advantageous terrain of internal line operations to intercept them. Moreover, no matter when, the German army can directly dispatch powerful mechanized units to the enemy's location. The Anti-Axis air force is attacking the above-mentioned German positions day and night, so it is expected that they must have already understood how strong the German defenses are.

### Large-Scale Tank Battle on the Old Polish Border

Stockholm, Sweden, 9th (Central News Agency) – Since the Soviet forces under Vatutin launched a fierce attack in the direction of Kiev, they engaged in fierce counterattacks with German forces around the city of Rakitno, 12 kilometers west of the Polish border, on the 6th. The Soviet forces suffered heavy casualties. The Soviet forces' goal in the attack was to recapture the transportation hub of Korosten. According to front-line news, in order to support the Soviet forces in that area, they have launched offensives in the direction of Novograd-Volynsky. A large-scale overnight tank battle is currently underway on the Volyn-Ponnoe front from the eastern border of Rovno to west of Zhitomir. Because the front line has moved to within the old Polish border, a new ripple has been created in Soviet-Polish relations. The Soviet side has always insisted on the position of incorporating the territory into Ukraine in 1939. The Soviet Information Bureau referred to the battle as the West Ukrainian Front in its report on the war on the night of the 7th.

### United States and Soviet Union Conclude Post-War Agreement

Stockholm, Sweden, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters report from London, London economic circles remain skeptical about the reported post-war agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union worth $1 trillion.

### Anniversary of Joining the War - Grand Public Assembly - Mayor Chen Attends to Deliver Instructions

(Central News Agency) Yesterday (the 9th) marked the first anniversary of the National Government's entry into the war. The citizens of Shanghai held a special municipal public representative assembly at the Great Light Theater at 10:00 AM. Details are as follows:

The Venue is Decorated Solemnly and Grandly

On this day, the assembly venue was decorated solemnly and grandly. The national flag and a portrait of the Founding Father were hung high in the center, with the National Government's declaration of war placed below. Golden-lettered red silk banners were hung on both sides and above, with slogans such as "Correct Thinking, Strict Living," "Increase Production, Strive for Savings," and "Guarantee Security, Cooperate in Air Defense" to enlighten the public on their understanding and responsibilities regarding the National Government's entry into the war. They were eye-catching, moving, and deeply meaningful.

Officials and Guests Arrive One After Another

From 9:00 AM onwards, officials and guests arrived one after another. From the Chinese side were Mayor Chen Gongbo, Chief Secretary Xiu Yu, Director Xi Peiwen, Bureau Chief Su Chengde, Section Chief Gu Jiwu, and representatives of the presidium: Yuan Ludeng of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Zhou Hualan of the Municipal Education Association, Liu Yangshan of the Municipal Party Department, Xu Liqiu of the Press Association, and Qu Zhonglun of the Municipal Women's Association. From the Allied Japanese side were Intelligence Director Hirota of the Embassy's Shanghai Office, Vice Consul Fukuma, and over two thousand public representatives from the entire city. The atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic, and the grand occasion was unprecedented.

Performing the Ceremony and Delivering the Opening Remarks

At precisely 10:00 AM, music was played to commence the meeting, and the ceremony was performed as required. Chairman Lu Deng read the National Government's declaration of war and led everyone in silent tribute to the fallen soldiers, and in prayer for the recovery of the wounded and sick soldiers and for victory in the Greater East Asia War. After the silence, he delivered the opening remarks: "Today is the anniversary of our country's participation in the Greater East Asia War, a day of great significance. Looking back, East Asia has been subjected to foreign aggression for more than a century. Now, fortunately, we rely on our allies to uphold the righteousness of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and we cannot help but admire them. As for us, standing in the position of citizens, we should also take responsibility for this war. What responsibility? That is, each of us should do our best in our respective positions, without being decadent or romantic, sticking to our posts, advocating thrift, and accumulating all our strength and spirit, directly and indirectly, for the war, for the use of the war. This is our responsibility. I hope everyone will work hard to achieve the goal of the Greater East Asia War."

Director Hirota Rises to Deliver a Congratulatory Speech

Mayor Chen then delivered instructions (the text of the instructions is recorded separately). Following this, Allied guest Intelligence Director Hirota of the Japanese Embassy delivered a congratulatory speech: "Today, on the occasion of the first anniversary of China's participation in the war, it is a real honor to be able to say a word of congratulations at this time. Looking back, one year has passed since China resolutely rose up and declared war on the long-time enemies of Asia, Britain and the United States. During this time, we have achieved many glorious war results, and based on the self-awareness of the various races in Greater East Asia, we have created a record of leapfrog construction, which can be imprinted on the history of Greater East Asia. Japan has long advocated the phrase "Awakening of Asia." Now, in addition to Burma and the Philippines, which have already become independent, the Provisional Government of Free India has also been established, and the participation of the Indonesian people in politics has also been realized. In this way, the true freedom, independence, and liberation of the hundreds of millions of people in Greater East Asia will be realized. At the same time, the Asian people who have been abused under the hundred years of exploitation and oppression by Britain and the United States will be able to see the sunlight of freedom. The Greater East Asia Declaration, issued in early November last year, really shocked the world. However, this is the expression of the desire and will of the hundreds of millions of people in Asia to break away from the shackles of Britain and the United States after a hundred years under the Greater East Asia War, and to seek the construction and unification of the original Asia. Moreover, it shows a new path of civilization and peace to all mankind in the world. Article 2 of this joint declaration states that "The countries of Greater East Asia shall jointly ensure the stability of Greater East Asia and build an order of coexistence and co-prosperity based on morality." Compared with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's saying that "to realize Greater East Asianism, we must use our inherent culture as a foundation, and inherent culture is morality, benevolence, and righteousness," these two ideas have almost the same meaning. On the one hand, taking the relationship between the new China and Japan, since the establishment of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty on October 30 last year, the relationship between the two countries has become even stronger. At the same time, China and Japan are in the central position of the Asian Independence War, that is, the Greater East Asia War, and are united as the center of the Greater East Asian people. In this way, the determination to live and die together has become even more profound, and they have become one, striving forward and completing the war. Seeing this situation, I feel particularly happy. Taking the Chinese side as an example, China has recovered the sovereignty that has been invaded by Britain and the United States for many years. Regarding this, the Japanese side, based on the spirit of righteousness, is helping as much as possible. You all know about this. If we work harder in the future, we will be able to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideals, and the creation of the new China will gradually be realized as the Greater East Asia War progresses. This is beyond doubt. Therefore, we will further cooperate to bring the relationship between China and Japan to a close and fulfill our responsibility as a powerful ally in protecting East Asia. Therefore, I believe that the revival of China is the forerunner of the revival of Asia. The Greater East Asia War has entered its third year since it began, and the war situation has become increasingly tragic and fierce. However, the victory or defeat of modern warfare is not determined by temporary luck, but by the combination of the overall strength of the country. Now, hundreds of millions of Asian people have risen up. Therefore, the combination of the strength of this Asian people will create a solid force that can ensure the inevitable victory and invincibility of the Greater East Asia War. I believe that the glory of victory lies in the joint construction of the entire Asian people's group."

### Yesterday Marked the First Air Defense Day - Comprehensive Training and Air Defense Exhibition for Various Air Defense Measures

In order to arouse public awareness of air defense, the Shanghai Special Municipal Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters held the first "Air Defense Day" yesterday (the 9th), holding air defense broadcasts, air defense exhibitions, air defense exercises, and other activities. The air defense broadcast was given by Mayor Chen (Deputy Director-General of the General Affairs Department).

Comprehensive Training Held in Various Districts

All districts in the city held various comprehensive air defense training sessions yesterday, presided over by the police defense section of each police precinct.

### Mayor Chen's Instructions at the Public Assembly Commemorating Participation in the War

Gentlemen: Today is the anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war. It is also our Shanghai Air Defense Day. I would like to take this significant anniversary to say a few words to you.

The Purpose of Participating in the War is to Liberate East Asia

The Greater East Asia War has been going on for more than two years, and we have been participating for one year. The situation in Greater East Asia has been constantly victorious on the front lines, and our strength has been increasing day by day in the rear. This is something we all know. But today, we must also know that this war is one of awe-inspiring duration. Although the battles on the war front continue, the goal of winning the war has been fully achieved. The purpose of Japan's launching the Greater East Asia War and our participation in the Greater East Asia War is primarily the liberation of the peoples of East Asia. Now China is completely free and independent, and all unequal treaties have been abolished. The Philippines and Burma have also been liberated from oppression and established independent nations. The people of Malaya and Java have also implemented political participation. Even India, which is still under the control of Britain and the United States, has established a provisional government. This proves that the purpose of the Greater East Asia War has been fully achieved. (To be continued)

### Applications for Scholarships Reach Over 10,000 in Two Days - Mr. Yoshida Tosuke Agrees to Advocate for Assistance

Yesterday was the second day for the distribution of scholarship application forms by this newspaper's correspondent. The applicant students waited in front of the Cathay Hotel gate from as early as 3:00 AM. Their eagerness for assistance is truly deserving of sympathy.

### Quick Sketch of the National Common Sense Exhibition

— Tian Xing

It has been a year since the National Government joined the Greater East Asia War. At the current moment when we are gradually entering a decisive stage, it is necessary for every citizen to have a clear understanding of the nature and trends of this war. At the same time, in order to further enhance everyone's understanding, Shen Bao specially organized the "Greater East Asia War National Common Sense Exhibition" on this anniversary of participation in the war.

A Glimpse of the Venue

The venue is located on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel. As soon as you enter the venue, the first thing that catches your eye is the national flags of the seven countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, hanging high on the beams, solemn and splendid. It is awe-inspiring. The order of the exhibition is first the large-scale maps and photos of the Greater East Asia construction that has been leaping forward in the two years since the start of the war. From here, you can see the war results of the Greater East Asia's brave battle. China's leap forward and the new construction of the entire Co-Prosperity Sphere, including the Philippines, Burma, and Thailand. There are more than a hundred photos that systematically show the progress. Turning into another section, a series of giant paintings make us even more aware of how the Allied Japan is strengthening its national power and intensifying its mobilization to win the Greater East Asia War, and how their people are working hard, enduring hardship, and bravely advancing to contribute everything to the country. This tense and exciting scene, after thinking about it, how about us? Are we also tense? The most interesting thing is the models of airplanes, warships, and tanks displayed on the table, each with about five or six different types. Because they are exquisitely made and the appearance is exquisite, they are exactly the same as the real ones.

Overview of Shen Bao's Business and Scholarship Funds

At the end of the venue, there is another section, which is the Shen Bao's special publication situation that was held at that time. The 70-year-old Shen Bao is no different from a history of the progress of China's news industry and printing and editing. In addition, there are books, yearbooks, maps, monthly publications, etc. published by Shen Bao over the years, filling two long tables, especially the books published during the Qing Dynasty. Shen Bao has long been striving to promote the cultural publishing industry. Next to it is the academic performance of the scholarship recipients and the process of running the school. Because Shen Bao's Sixth Reader Scholarship Fund is issuing application forms, students can visit and collect them at the same time, which is very crowded. The number of visitors is very enthusiastic. It is estimated that more than 3,000 people arrived on the first day. Colonel Matsushima, the reporting director of the Shanghai Japanese Naval Wupan Team, and Captain Kamita, all visited the venue. Mr. Yoshida Tobo Mitsuo, a "Friend of China," also visited the venue yesterday. He expressed deep sympathy when he saw the large number of students applying for scholarships and promised to provide assistance on the spot and do his best to promote it on behalf of the Mingbang personnel to arouse sympathy. This kindness is so precious! After receiving the application forms, the students also carefully read through the entire venue, especially the students' academic achievements. They carefully observed. After they had fully browsed the exhibits in the entire venue and received the application forms, they all walked out of the venue with smiles on their faces in an orderly manner.

### Coming from Behind, Friendship Defeats Portuguese Merchants - Portuguese Merchants Resist Tenaciously - Three to Two

The Class A friendly football match between the Friendly Team and the Portuguese Merchants took place at the Yi Yuan Stadium yesterday morning at 10:30, with referee Shen Huichun. Although the Friendly Team won 3-2, it took a great deal of effort. The Friendly Team's lineup in the first half was obviously weak, with Cai Sheng stationed at the center forward, causing the central defensive line to lose its flexibility. Qu Bingfu served as the left winger, so there was no help for the forward, and there were frequent missed opportunities. In the second half, the lineup was adjusted to increase the attack. Lan Niu Li Yichen was transferred to the defense, Wu Qixiang abandoned the defense and went on the attack, and Xu Wenkui and Yongfu remained in their original positions, which immediately showed improvement.

### Stable Trend in Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions Last Week

Financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions in Shanghai stabilized last week after experiencing sharp fluctuations. Due to the approaching Lunar New Year, businesses are rushing to finalize their accounts, and credit is tight. On the one hand, the bureau's efforts to maintain people's livelihoods and stabilize prices have been effective. Both hot red stocks and public bonds have declined, and interbank interest rates have risen to 20%. The prices of daily necessities such as rice, coal, and daily necessities have fallen. The Rice Control Committee decided to increase the amount of rice rations per household from this month, restoring the previous situation of three rations per month, with two liters of rice per person per ration. There is a large supply of coal, so people's hearts are greatly stabilized.

### The Life of Major General Shibasaki

Major General Keiji Shibasaki, who led 4,500 Japanese naval landing forces defending Tarawa and Makin Islands, died a heroic death on November 25th last year. This spirit of complete self-sacrifice is worthy of eternal remembrance. This article introduces the life and deeds of Major General Shibasaki.

Born on April 9th, Meiji 27 (Western calendar 1894), as the sixth son of Hirohachi Shibasaki, a non-salaried nobleman. This was Major General Keiji Shibasaki. His family was wealthy, having been involved in agriculture and finance for generations. In Kamihigashijo Village, his family was one of the most prominent. In a sense, the Major General was perhaps fortunate, but he was not raised in pampered comfort.

The young Keiji was forged into a strong body through the strict teaching of his father, Sekihachi, and the loving care of his mother, Kusu.

"Although he was a mischievous and disobedient child, he was definitely not an unruly child." In the memories of his nephew, Kanosuke Shibasaki, there is also a faint suggestion of the energetic fighting spirit of young Keiji. Before entering elementary school, he never played with the children in the neighborhood, but once he started school, he suddenly became a "social butterfly", noticed and loved by all his classmates.

With an innate handsome appearance and the upright character inherited from his parents, he often looked down on those who were weak and decadent. Just as the Russo-Japanese War had just ended, during the Meiji era, the games that children loved most, such as "forming ranks" and "battles," were where he showed his skills. Especially during school breaks or after school, this handsome young man Keiji was always the protagonist in extracurricular games. Even when his energy was exhausted, he would not give in. As for his studies, he was of course unwilling to fall behind and was always at the top of his class.

Elementary School Life

His only confidant during elementary school, Ichitaro Yamamoto (49 years old), the current vice-chief of Kamihigashijo Village, recalled the past, saying: "His Excellency was always unusually energetic in games, and he was the protagonist among his classmates. But in academics, he was also an ambitious person who never admitted defeat. Whether in academics or sports, once he started something, he would definitely see it through to the end. That's the kind of character he had."

His father often said to him, "Don't think about getting rich and famous in your childhood. If you accumulate too much money, you won't become a great person."

However, his father entrusted the family's special assets early on to the young Keiji: 5,000 yen in savings and 1 cho 2 tan bu (approximately 110 ares) of land and mountains. The young Keiji was one of the outstanding talents in the village. In April 1907, he entered the Hyogo Prefectural Ono Middle School with excellent grades.

Middle School Life

After graduating from elementary school in his hometown with excellent grades, the young Shibasaki entered Hyogo Prefectural Ono Middle School in April 1907. Ono Middle School, established by taking over the domain school of a former feudal lord, was the only prefectural middle school in the eastern Harima region at the time. The location was quiet, and the school spirit was simple, so children from prominent families in Himeji and Akashi all gathered here.

Ono Middle School was four ri (approximately 12 kilometers) away from young Shibasaki's hometown of Kamihigashijo Village. If it were now, he could of course ride a bicycle or take some other kind of vehicle to school every day. However, at that time, when transportation was inconvenient, anyone who lived more than eight kilometers away was a boarder. Therefore, young Shibasaki also moved into the middle school dormitory, bathed in the clear waters of the Kakogawa River, and spent five years of middle school life. Before he knew it, he had absorbed the spirit of Ono Middle School, the "Dragonfly Spirit." After entering middle school, the impression that young Shibasaki gave to people was that of being loyal and vigorous. In academics and sports, he was a model student who excelled in both. This was unanimously praised by his classmates at the time. In addition, he was skilled in sports such as kendo, judo, tennis, and gymnastics. He studied kendo under the former feudal warrior and instructor, Mr. Nagamoto. He was always the first to arrive for winter training and was the most outstanding. According to reports from the front lines before his heroic sacrifice on Gilbert Island, he built a tennis court on the island to encourage the soldiers to exercise. In middle school, tennis was his favorite game. Whenever he had free time, he would compete with his classmates on the tennis court next to the dormitory. So, what motivated young Shibasaki to join the navy? The clear stream of the Kakogawa River, combined with the elegant plains and wilderness, was the place where warlords fought for hegemony during the Warring States period and was also the base from which Toyotomi Hideyoshi conquered China (the name of a region in mainland Japan). He often heard these kinds of local stories, which aroused his yearning and admiration for soldiers in his young heart.

In addition, the field exercises of the Himeji Division soldiers often appeared before young Shibasaki's eyes. Moreover, the Aono Plain nearby had excellent training grounds, so soldiers from various places often gathered there. Their imposing and heroic appearance often flashed through young Shibasaki's mind. In particular, Major General Ono Kyakushin, the brigade commander of Himeji, and Lieutenant General Tsuchiya Mitsuharu, the division commander of Zentsuji, often rode alone, demonstrating the heroic posture of generals on horseback, visiting the area. Thus, a mark of admiration for soldiers was deeply engraved on the minds of the middle school students. Not long after the Russo-Japanese War, a kind of short-tongued student cap that imitated military officer caps became very popular among the students of Ono Middle School. This was also a manifestation of their admiration for military officers. If young Shibasaki had continued to develop this mindset, it would of course have prompted him to join the army. However, in his second year, Kobe held a grand naval review, and he personally saw the elite of the Imperial Japanese Navy, such as the Mikasa battleship, which made him determined to join the navy. According to the recollection of Mr. Gunji Maeda, a former director of the Ono Middle School Dragonfly Association and a classmate of Major General Shibasaki, at that time, 300 students, led by Principal Noseta, traveled to school early in the morning, walked 16 kilometers to Tsuchiyama, and then took a train to Kobe, staying in various temples. The original plan was to watch the naval review from a flat-bottomed boat towed by a motorboat, but at that time, it was the capricious month of November, and the sea was rough along the way, so many of the students who grew up in the mountains became seasick, and as a result, they returned halfway in disappointment. Although it is not clear whether young Shibasaki was also seasick at the time, it was almost inevitable at the time.

The next day, they had to view the majesty of the Imperial Japanese Navy from land. Due to a slight change in the weather, the original intention was abandoned, which was a great disgrace for Japanese men from a maritime nation. The teachers also specifically talked about the importance of the navy to Japan, which further strengthened his determination to join the navy. From then on, young Shibasaki studied desperately and rested to break the past naval records as his only goal. In order to exercise hard to strengthen his body and mind, he didn't even wear underwear in the piercing wind. Regarding academics, he would thoroughly solve one problem before starting to study another. This spirit of perseverance was truly admirable. Usually, it was not uncommon for him to work until one or two o'clock in the morning. In his third year, General Tsuchiya Mitsuharu came to the school to visit and told me many stories about the "prosperity of Prussia." He said that the prosperity of the country depends entirely on military strength. Thus, the general's words, even every single word, were deeply imprinted on young Shibasaki's heart.

When Shibasaki entered the dormitory, Lieutenant General Takarotaro Iwai (who was a fifth-year senior student at the time), who also died at the hands of the American army in the South Seas, was the room leader, and he received much guidance from this senior. But when young Shibasaki became a senior student, he was also elected as the room leader. Principal Noseta was absolutely strict with the school's atmosphere and discipline. Anyone who violated the school rules or had poor grades was ordered to withdraw from the school, and sometimes they were demoted. Each year, there were about 90 students in a class, but only about 30 students remained at graduation, which was already a common occurrence. But when young Shibasaki was elected as the room leader, he always reprimanded the students who didn't know what was good for them, saying: "Students should act like students, and you must keep to your own duty." Because he himself was a man of few words but many actions, all the students in the dormitory listened to the words of room leader Shibasaki, who was so diligent in studying and resting. Thus, young Shibasaki became the driving force of the entire school. Although he was a strict room leader, when he returned home on Saturdays, because his family was a sake brewer at the time, he never forgot to bring back rice cakes made from sake rice for all the students in the dormitory to eat when he returned to school on Sunday nights. In this way, he was also a very emotional young man.

Naval Academy Era

The Naval Academy at that time was gathering talented students from all over the country. It could truly be said that there were many talented people. As for the excellent students who graduated from rural middle schools, "I must bring some glory to everyone," so he participated in the entrance exam. He boldly broke through the difficult entrance exam, which really brought glory to Ono Middle School. At the same time, the elders of the village considered him a genius. This naval student, Major General Shibasaki, who devoted himself to both literary and military pursuits in the beautiful natural surroundings of Etajima, quickly made a name for himself soon after entering the school. In his dignified and imposing physique, he was also in an excellent academic environment that cultivated talents and strengthened character, and he was also guided by senior instructors who were both kind and strict. Thus, his innate qualities were further developed and expanded.

His grades at the school, like in the past, were always at the top. Even the praise from his classmates, "What a smart guy," shows how good his grades were. He not only had superhuman intelligence but also an indomitable perseverance. He can truly be said to be a person of both intelligence and courage. The Major General was born with outstanding talents and worked hard himself. He knew how to hone his skills, so it can be said that he added flowers to the brocade and was an unparalleled talent. He not only had a strong physique but also quick and decisive talent. He was proficient in kendo, judo, archery, sumo, etc. Even during the two or three hours he spent returning home to visit his family, he would run to the backyard to clean up the archery range and practice archery diligently and silently by himself. The Major General was especially feared for his mountain-pressing style in kendo.

After spending three years in Etajima like this, his indomitable and hard-working spirit helped Shibasaki develop the qualities of a military commander with both literary and military skills.

The Major General never showed any signs of fatigue in guiding his juniors. While he was studying at the Naval Academy, he returned to his alma mater, Ono Middle School, to visit and brought many photos of life in Etajima and actual combat photos of the Great Japanese Army's occupation of Shanghai to the school. However, now, only these sad relics are preserved at the school, and the Major General died at the hands of the enemy. All the young people in the village are willing to follow in the footsteps of the Major General, following the blood of the martyrs, and kill the enemy. In his later years, the Major General served as an instructor at the Naval Academy. Mr. Kenzo Kobayashi, a famous naval professor who also served as an instructor, said the following about the Major General's character. "He was a very calm and indifferent person and never scolded students casually. I always wanted to imitate this attitude. Perhaps his heart was burning like a flame. During his time as an instructor, he had a son who died, but his grief never showed on his face. If someone offered condolences, he would only reply that he himself was weak and unable to bear it, and then he would immediately return to normal. I repeat, people who don't like to talk much will do amazing things when it comes to a critical moment. In ordinary times, the Major General didn't look like a great man at all. Even his admiration for Daikokuten (Kusunoki Masashige) and the fact that he was a martial arts master, I wouldn't have known if I hadn't read the newspaper."

In his later years, he served as an aide-de-camp, staff officer, and commander. There was no position that he was not able to perform happily, and he demonstrated decisive skills. It cannot be denied that this foundation was laid in Etajima. Even in the end, on a small island in the South Seas, he ambushed an enemy more than ten times his size, engaged in a decisive battle to the death, and charged in hand-to-hand combat, finally dying heroically and becoming a protector of the Great Japanese Empire. This could only be cultivated in the life of Etajima. Now, at a time when the flames of war in the Pacific are becoming more and more intense, he was able to die in battle and fully demonstrate the traditional spirit of the Marine Corps. While praising the Major General's immortal merits, we must also unite the sincerity of 100 million people to (Asahi Shimbun, 15th)

### A Lonely Story

— Hong Ying

The wind roared angrily outside, just whooshing, whooshing, as if devouring everything in the world. There were no stars in the sky, nor a moon, just a thick, gray-black expanse.

Finally, it gradually darkened, like the face of an old man covered with white spots. It gradually became indistinguishable in this darkness.

"Click," Old Wang struck a match and lit the oil lamp. A faint yellow light filled the small room, often mixed with a nauseating oily smell.

Old Wu straightened his loose chest clothes and then, very skillfully, pulled out a smoking pipe less than two feet long from his chest. He squinted his eyes at the faint yellow light and started smoking, as if immersed in deep thought. White smoke puffed out of his mouth, mouthful by mouthful.

Suddenly, he opened his eyes and looked at me, as if only now realizing that there was another person, me.

"It's very cold, isn't it? Little kid," he said to me kindly, and then blew out another puff of smoke.

"And very lonely," I said to him in a lonely tone.

"Oh, you understand loneliness too. Good, I'll tell you a lonely story now."

"That was a long, long time ago, in a winter when I was in my twenties. Look, I'm already fifty-eight years old this year, wasn't that a long, long time ago?"

"In the North, the weather is even more frighteningly cold. Riding on a horse along the winding mountain road, the wind is like a blade, scraping across your face. Does it hurt? Actually, it's already hurting so much that you've lost all feeling."

"The sand and stones outside the Great Wall are also blown over by the wind. Wherever there's wind, there's also dust. Needless to say, your face is already covered with a thick layer."

"Clear snot constantly drips down. It's too cold to bother wiping it away, so you just let it flow. Then the dust comes and forms two straight, chain-like streaks hanging down from your upper lip."

"But I wasn't afraid of the cold. When I was twenty years old, I was a strong young man. Haha, when I stretched out my arms, my biceps were as big as a fist. Cold? What's cold? But it's useless now, I'm old, now it's your world."

"At that time, I was in the North, working in a yamen, as a messenger who delivered official documents. Riding on horseback, with the document bag slung across my back. Thinking about it now, it was very... "

"One day, it was an extremely cold winter day, but I was still sweating. Even my horse was sweating on its cheeks."

"I kept whipping the horse, urging it to run forward. My heart was as anxious as an ant crawling on a red-hot iron pot because it was getting dark and I still had to travel fifty li to get to the place where I needed to deliver the documents. But the sky was gradually darkening, and the sky was a thick, gray-black expanse. But it didn't know my anxious mood, especially since I was carrying a document on my back that the master had told me to handle with the utmost care."

"Finally, it got dark. Riding on horseback, I kept thinking about what the master had told me in the morning about bandits often appearing on this road."

"At this moment, I was afraid. In such pitch-black darkness, there were no stars in the sky, nor a moon. For the howling of the wind and the startled flight of the night birds, I always thought that more than a dozen robbers were standing out of the darkness, ready to use force against me."

"But nothing happened until I stopped at a small inn halfway up the mountain. Although I was only thirty li away from the place I needed to reach, I no longer had the courage to continue forward. Even thinking about it now, it was a terrifying thing to be riding on horseback alone on a dark mountain road, with no stars, no moon, at night."

"I washed my face with a basin of water and called the innkeeper to bring another basin, but the water turned black almost immediately. Wow, my face was really covered in ash. I didn't bother calling for another basin."

"Alone with an oil lamp, it was really lonely. Didn't you say you're lonely now? But this doesn't count for anything. That day, I was really lonely."

"The light gradually dimmed. I turned it up a little, but it soon dimmed again. It turned out that there was no more oil in the lamp. I called the innkeeper, but he was fast asleep. After calling for a long time, he woke up, filled the lamp with oil, and also brought a bottle of wine and a bowl of snacks to go with it. So, I started drinking alone. Everyone in the inn was fast asleep, only I was drinking wine by myself under the dim light. How..."

"The wine gradually ran out, so I prepared to go to sleep too. But I couldn't fall asleep, no matter what. Was it due to the excessive fatigue of the journey or the intense stimulation after drinking? I don't know."

"I just stared at the papered wall and saw mice running across my bed. At this time, outside the house, the wind was roaring, just like today, just whooshing, whooshing, as if it wanted to devour everything in the world."

"Under the dim yellow light, I was completely lost in deep thought!" (To be continued)

### The Fortune Teller

— Zhao Yang

In a corner of the bustling city, in a place that is not very noticeable, a blind old man, like a dead tree branch, sits there alone.

The small, broken, low wooden stool has been his seat for more than a dozen years. The days, rusted as if they are, pass by day by day.

Who knows what kind of person he is? Does he have sons? Maybe...

He tightly closed his dull eyes, feebly, mysteriously, shaking a pair of weathered wooden cylinders. The four characters on them - "Divine Class for Women's Life" - have changed from vermilion to gray-black, and some of the "divine marks" have been polished to a shine by his hands.

His viscous saliva flowed from his wrinkled mouth, advertising his business to passersby: "Divination for travel directions, lost people, marriage, no accuracy, no money..."

But from morning to night, not a single person would come to find him. He fumbled for the few corner bills and a hungry belly in his torn pocket: "Should I buy a sesame seed cake to eat?...”

"Alas, what kind of fate is this? Let me divine for myself!"

Thinking this, he devoutly shook the wooden cylinders. The small bamboo sticks vibrated, and he used his trembling right hand to reach in and touch some of his old friends:

"Sixty-sixth Sign, Lower, Lower: This sign is ominous for the master."

"Major misfortune, major misfortune, alas, unlucky things!"

He quickly threw his old friends back in, tears streaming from the corners of his eyes, dripping onto his clothes...

Several days passed.

Still, in that not-so-noticeable place, the fortune teller lay there, covered by a torn mat. Tears would no longer flow from the corners of his eyes. A fly was resting on his feet, rubbing them. The broken cylinder also lay beside him...

Just waiting for the labor points in the first round. Here is a review and commentary on the matches of the previous two days. Let's start with the match at Yih Garden yesterday morning. The Chinese giant, Luen Yee Football Club, faced the Portuguese businessmen. The Portuguese businessmen had requested a change of schedule because several official team members had to serve in the air defense exercises that day. However, the request was not approved by the authorities, so they put together a team with second-team members, Spice, and reserve players. On the other hand, Luen Yee Football Club had a full team. From this perspective, Luen Yee Football Club was certain to win. However, the opposite happened, so I would like to comment:

Poor Roster Adjustment - Luen Yee Football Club Made a Big Mistake

Due to the lack of talent on the left wing, Luen Yee Football Club tried Qu Yongfu in that position in this match, and made a big mistake by putting Cai Shengmiao in the center back line. Qu has served as the center back line with Song and Zheng, responding in unison and once being considered the best defense line in East Asia. Although that's an overstatement, they were still considered a standard center back line. Later, with Cai taking over the position, the response was not effective, and the center line was broken. How could they attack? Moreover, Qu's attempt at left wing was unsuccessful. This was not his fault but a mistake in scheduling. In the second half, they restored the original roster, which showed improvement. Finally, Li Yichen was not in his element on the front line, so he switched with Wu Qixiang, which led to a comeback victory. This showed adapting to reality and being able to respond to the situation. Without this, it would not have been successful. Individually, Wu Qixiang was the most outstanding. As a defender, he was all-around and had no loopholes. As a midfielder, he was able to break through the defense. It was not easy to win in the end. Secondly, Xu Wenkui's footwork was skillful and clear, which was commendable. It's a pity that a good flower has no supporting leaves, so he was out of place. Yu Zhenyue scored after 35 minutes in the first half, when Gao Baozheng, in the crowd, received a pass from Li Zaichen. Five minutes later, the Portuguese businessmen's left scored from a corner kick by Bao Hugh. Both were tied.

In the second half, at 20 minutes, Prada advanced on the right wing, and Liu Xianhan was helpless. The Portuguese businessmen took the lead with two goals to one. Luen Yee Football Club, having won first and then lost, refused to give up, so Wu Qixiang and Li Yichen switched positions. Wu Qixiang lived up to expectations, breaking through the defense and returning with success. With only ten minutes left in the game, Luen Yee Football Club's luck turned around. Yu Zhenyue was inspired and scored off a pass from Gao Baozheng. Luen Yee Football Club was able to win narrowly with three goals to two. It was extremely dangerous!

Volunteers Joined Kiangwan Joint Association - The Audience Was Greatly Disappointed

The match between Kiangwan Joint Association and the police last Saturday afternoon at 3:30 PM in Kiaochow Park was a scene from the second round of the Football League. Nine volunteers from Kiangwan Joint Association participated in the battle, which was eagerly anticipated. Kiaochow Park was crowded with people, and the atmosphere was no less lively than other important matches. However, the police won a major victory with five goals to one. The one goal scored by Kiangwan Joint Association was also a penalty kick. Kiangwan Joint Association was so battered and exhausted that the fans who supported them sighed. The police team maintained its consistent style, attacking and defending well. However, they didn't show any particularly outstanding performance. Only goalkeeper Punik showed improvement and progress. This shows that things depend on people, and there's only concern about not striving for improvement. Kiangwan Joint Association's goalkeeper, McNeety, missed three saves in a row, and his luck ran out. Vella DiBanna on both wings was slow and ineffective! The whole team advanced slowly like snails. What can they achieve? If they don't seek physical activity again, the future of the volunteers is unimaginable. Police striker Robert Stoff was still the soul of the team, and Ampulaev, who occasionally appeared, unexpectedly scored the first and third goals, which was due to good luck. It was also the result of hard work. Center backs Mikhailov and Yu Lihua were willing to run and compete, assisting the front and taking care of the back, which was commendable.

In the first half, the police scored two goals within 20 minutes, becoming invincible. McNeety left the field due to injury.

In the second half, Little Yellow Hair scored the fourth goal, and Rodi was slightly injured. Then, Luo Xulai committed a handball penalty, which Salati converted, breaking the duck egg record. Before leaving, Little Yellow Hair scored another goal, making it five to one. The police returned triumphantly. The score was the same as the first round. (Mei Jie)

### West Tsing Jia Group Situation Clarified - Hua Lian Pharmacy Can Always Win - Oriental Giants Follow Behind

This magazine has systematically recorded the West Tsing Basketball Jia Group competition. Due to space limitations and temporary stops, the previous two issues were not published. Here is a table of the current situation, followed by a brief review of the matches of the past two weeks for the reference of fans.

On the night of the 20th of last month, Shantou team won over San Shu, and Oriental lost to Ta Hua, which was in line with the strength of the teams. The battle process was plain and unremarkable. But the two battles on the evening of the 22nd were unexpected. Hua Nan's defeat by Monnak was all due to bad luck, not a war crime. Hua Ying's loss to San Lun had two reasons: first, Hua Ying's guidance was inadequate, advocating more chaos, and second, San Lun's Dong Chun Chuan Xiang Rui came in succession, resulting in Hua Ying's crushing defeat. The 25th was a rest day. On the evening of the 27th, the Giants captured Ren Yu, who lacked shooting talent, which was their fatal flaw. The Giants are normal, with little progress but no decline, maintaining a normal team. Oriental rejected Nak, which was quite thrilling. Fortunately, Xu Wenkui was spiritual, hitting all his shots, and Bao Songyuan worked hard both inside and outside. The young players could not stand it. In another game, Ta Hua resisted the Giants, and although they lost, they were able to outwit their opponents.

Last Week's Battle

Shantou team beat Tong Ren, which was the battle on the night of the 3rd. According to the Shantou team, the young generation is doing well, and the reporter has repeatedly encouraged them. However, judging from this battle, the generals have not made progress, and they are also arrogant. Chen Qingjiang and Chen Guang prefer to play tricks, which is why they have not reached the peak. Some say this is a phenomenon in the process; now I hope to improve it as soon as possible, otherwise it will be difficult to achieve great things. Tong Ren team misunderstood Zhang Banglun, and the five Xuan brothers were serious to the end, doing their best to show their skills. Except for their slightly poor physical strength, there is no flaw to attack. Victory or defeat is not counted. The score was fifty-seven to forty-two, Shantou team won.

For the rest of the game, Ta Hua requested - a change of schedule. - The first game of the A group battle on the 5th. The former military spirit was scattered, so I don't need to criticize it too much!

At the end, Hua Ying defeated Tong Ren, which everyone said was a upset, but it was not. Before, Hua Ying had also defeated Tong Ren in the Paramount, because the two teams had the same skills. And Hua Ying is taller. Tong Ren is the opposite. This victory or defeat is based on the fact that Hua Ying's Qian came to the scene in an orderly manner, which boosted the military's morale. This is another reason for the victory. Forty-five to thirty-eight, Xiang is in the ideal state with seven points.

In the two battles on the 7th, Hua Nan faced Amateur, and the latter requested another change of schedule. They abandoned their rights the night before. This time, they changed the schedule again. Is there any compelling reason?

Hua Lian Pharmacy won Monnak in overtime. In this battle, Hua Lian Pharmacy was able to cheer up at first, but then became chaotic. Kong Guangyi was too angry, Xi Xilin was too fancy, and Zhang Jin liked to play tricks, all of which should be changed. Monnak also relied on his familiarity with the territory, skillful shooting, and sufficient energy, and the more he fought, the more courageous he became. It is a capable team. The statutory time was twenty-nine to twenty-nine, which shows how tight the process was. In the five-minute extension, Hua Lian Pharmacy won by seven! One win, the total ended at thirty-six to thirty. Hua Lian Pharmacy maintained a constant victory (Bi Xian)
