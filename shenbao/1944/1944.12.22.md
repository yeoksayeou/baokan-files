The main points of Japanese Prime Minister Koiso's broadcast speech are as follows: "I take this opportunity to express to all citizens of your country… Seeking the revival of East Asia and a world based on justice, may you forever understand Japan's righteous intentions and realize that this Greater East Asia War is to defend your country's revolution, that is, the completion of independence and autonomy, and that we have no choice but to fight to the death against Anglo-American aggression and exploitation. With Prime Minister Apaiwong as the center, the entire nation is united, overcoming all wartime difficulties with a spirit of certain victory, and completing the mission of war. I deeply express my respect and gratitude for this. However, as you all know, the war situation has become increasingly severe and has entered a decisive stage. The rise and fall of Japan and Thailand, and the fate of a billion people in East Asia, all depend on today. We, the Japanese people, following the example of the brave warriors of the Special Attack Forces, are united as one in the front lines and the rear, vowing to drive the arrogant enemy out of East Asia. Whether in the decisive battle in the Philippines, or in production in the front lines and the rear, we are engaged in the struggle with an indomitable spirit. Over the past three years, thanks to the valiant fighting of the Japanese army and the efforts of the people of our allied nations, we have established a certain and invincible position. Now, we are gathering the total strength of all of East Asia to fight together for victory. I am confident that we have the confidence in our war aims and strength, and that we will be able to overcome all difficulties and achieve final victory. On this third anniversary of the signing of the Japan-Thailand Defensive Alliance Treaty, I am very fortunate to be able to once again express Japan's determination to complete the war and to sincerely support your country from beginning to end."

### 日外相官邸　紀念晚餐會　賓主均表明戰爭決意

Japanese Foreign Minister's Official Residence: Commemorative Dinner Party, Guests and Hosts Express Resolve for War

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Japanese Foreign Minister and Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu held a commemorative dinner party at his official residence on the evening of the 20th. Those attending from the Thai side included Ambassador Ukit and other members of the embassy. From the Japanese side, those attending included Marquis Tokugawa Yoshitada, Vice-Minister of the Army Shibayama, Director of the Army Affairs Bureau Sanada, Director of the Navy Affairs Bureau Tada, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Sawada, and Vice-Minister of Greater East Asia Takeuchi. During the dinner, guests and hosts expressed their determination to complete the war and engaged in frank and sincere discussions, which ended joyfully at around 8 PM. What follows is a summary of the speeches given by Japanese Foreign Minister and Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu and Thai Ambassador Ukit:

Shigemitsu's Speech

The Japan-Thailand Alliance is an important pillar for the construction of the Greater East Asia. The cooperation between Japan and Thailand is a major driving force for carrying out the Greater East Asia War. My policy towards Thailand is based on the alliance treaty, and we must respect its independence and sovereignty, seek the welfare of the Thai people, and provide support. In this common war to uphold Thailand's independence and liberate East Asia, we have completed our important mission, which is well-known to both the Imperial Government and the public. If we, the allied nations, can cooperate even more closely with an ever-growing trend of certain victory and invincibility, and carry out the war with all our strength, then there is no doubt that the final victory in this righteous war to revive East Asia will belong to us.

Ukit's Speech

Three years have passed since the signing of the Japan-Thailand Alliance Treaty. During this time, both countries have fought together against the enemy, and both countries are still carrying out great tasks. The current task is only to strive for victory. Today, all the nations of East Asia have gained independence and have escaped the suffering of being affiliated with Britain and America in the past. The enemy insists on liberalism, and cannot achieve victory in this great and arduous battle. We are currently engaged in battle in an atmosphere of complete harmony and mutual trust. On the other hand, Britain and America are struggling in an environment of anxiety and doubt. Therefore, the enemy will inevitably be exhausted sooner or later and will ultimately fail. The recent situation on the European front can prove this point. The Thai people believe that Japan will surely win and are proud to be allied with Japan.

### 敵對日本上　無大規模空襲可能　趕島大佐發表見解

No Large-Scale Air Raids Possible on Mainland Japan; Colonel Keshima Expresses His Views

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Colonel Keshima of the Japanese Army Aviation Headquarters published an article in the Mainichi Shimbun here entitled, "The Recent Situation of Enemy Aircraft Coming to Attack Air Bases and the Impossibility of Large-Scale Raids." The main points are as follows: "The B-29 type aircraft based on Saipan Island to bomb the Japanese mainland have been making wave-like attacks in small formations of about a dozen aircraft in the past. In fact, there has not been a single large-scale air raid like those on the European battlefield. Their purpose is nothing more than to make our people spend longer in shelters under air raid warnings, so as to reduce production capacity. It is what is called a war of nerves. The reason why it is difficult for enemy aircraft based on Saipan Island to carry out large-scale air raids is that the base is small and unsuitable for the takeoff of large formations. In order to form a large formation, each aircraft must take off one after another from the runway. However, the runway there is narrow, and only one aircraft can take off from the runway at a time. If a large formation is formed, the aircraft that take off first must wait in the air for a considerable amount of time, which wastes a lot of fuel. For example, at a cruising speed of 450 kilometers per hour, waiting for an hour or so will consume about one-tenth of the fuel stored in the fuel tanks. Also, according to enemy intelligence, the enemy aircraft that bombed the Japanese mainland on the 13th encountered a tropical storm unique to the South Seas on their way back, which forced them to delay for 20 minutes. It is said that within this short period of time, several aircraft were forced to land on the water due to fuel exhaustion. From this fact, it can be seen that the enemy aircraft that have recently brought bombs to attack the Japanese mainland, when chased by our aircraft, although they spare no fuel to escape at maximum speed, can only return to Saipan as a result, and their fuel has no surplus. If a large formation is formed, the large fuel consumption will certainly be beyond the enemy's capacity to cope with. Therefore, normally, they can only attack Japan in formations of one or two aircraft, or one squadron at a time. The recent small-scale wave-like attacks are for this reason. If preparations for air raid disasters can be made, according to past experience, there is nothing to worry about."

The above matters were announced by the Japanese Army Ministry on the 21st.

Philippine Island Base, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Air Force discovered an enemy transport convoy in the Camotes Sea on the evening of the 18th and launched a fierce attack, resulting in the destruction of one cruiser and one ship that appeared to be a medium-sized cruiser. At the same time, on the same night, a Japanese submarine discovered an enemy transport convoy at the eastern end of the Sulu Sea and sank two of its ships.

Philippine Island Base, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Air Force bombed the enemy landing positions on the west coast of Leyte Island on the evening of the 17th, resulting in the destruction of several enemy positions. On the evening of the 18th, they bombed the enemy landing sites on Pandan Island and their nearby positions, resulting in the sinking of one enemy coastal boat and the destruction of another, and the burning of several enemy land facilities. In addition, on the evening of the 19th, they attacked the enemy military supply unloading point in San Jose on Mindoro Island, resulting in the sinking of four enemy torpedo boats and the burning of several of their land facilities, one of which experienced a major fire that burned for several hours.

Editorial

### 嚴格執行擾亂經濟罪的刑律

Strictly Enforce the Criminal Law for the Crime of Disrupting the Economy

Yesterday, this newspaper published a conversation with the local police, using the Special Criminal Law for Wartime. In addition to elaborating on the purpose of the promulgation of the Special Criminal Law for Wartime, it also provided a brief overview of the content of the special law, divided into political crimes, crimes related to air defense, crimes hindering important industries and public undertakings, crimes disrupting the economy, and crimes of profiting from the enemy.

The Special Criminal Law for Wartime was promulgated on May 10th of last year. The main purpose is, in a passive sense, to prescribe severe penalties in order to reduce the motivation for crime and ensure wartime security. In a positive sense, it is to eradicate crimes and establish a wartime system, so that the people can work together in their respective positions and cooperate in completing the task of participating in the war.

Since the promulgation of this law, more than a year and a half have passed, and the number of criminal cases handled by citing this law is extremely small. We can observe this phenomenon from two perspectives. On the one hand, it is indeed because there are very few criminal cases, so there is no opportunity to cite the special criminal law. On the other hand, it is because criminal cases are not completely non-existent, but because of the result of favoritism and perversion of the law, it has not been cited. The former is a good phenomenon, and the latter is a malignant political disease.

However, let us try to examine it. Just taking the crime of disrupting the economy as an example, just taking the Shanghai region as an example, in this year and a half, has there been no opportunity to cite the special criminal law? Or has there been an opportunity but it has not been cited? Among the crimes of disrupting the economy and profiting from the enemy, the first item is: "Speculating, manipulating, hoarding, and profiteering in military supplies and daily necessities shall be punishable by death or life imprisonment." Then, we dare to say that Shanghai is the general mechanism for manufacturing rumors, the source of speculation, manipulation, hoarding, and profiteering, and the leader in triggering rising prices. Of course, these crimes are not committed by all the people of Shanghai, but by a selfish group of Shanghai people who pursue exorbitant profits. Think about it, every time prices fluctuate, which time is it not that speculators first hoard goods, and then stir up rising prices by spreading rumors? This group of people who pursue exorbitant profits is organized and planned, and a small part even has status and prestige, so they have connections everywhere, and can commit crimes while still living a comfortable life as wealthy people, taking pride in making the majority weep while a few laugh.

Not to mention the distant past, just taking the recent skyrocketing of rice prices, which has triggered a general rise in prices, is also the crime of this group of profiteers. We have pointed out in stern terms in the three editorials on rice countermeasures that if this cancer of society, this cancer of the wartime economy, this cancer of the victory of the Greater East Asia War, is not eradicated and eliminated, one day the problem will become so great that it will be difficult to deal with. We say with deep sorrow that only when this group of profiteers reaches its doomsday will the day when society begins to be clear, the day when the wartime economy begins to get on the right track, and the day when the victory of the Greater East Asia War is ensured. Shanghai is an important base in the rear during wartime, and a major stronghold that dominates and leads the wartime economy. How important it is to ensure military supplies and stabilize people's livelihood in the wartime economy. How important is the stability of the wartime economy in the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War? Therefore, the economic dynamics of Shanghai, which are related to the safety of the Chinese wartime economy, are even more important. It must not be allowed to let the rampant profiteers forever disrupt Shanghai's economy during wartime.

Now, the local police authorities in this city solemnly emphasize the importance of the Special Criminal Law for Wartime. We are very pleased with the authorities' intention and can also understand the authorities' determination. However, we believe that the effectiveness of the law still lies in the soundness of politics. It cannot be denied that the political institutions and personnel of the past have not yet reached the stage of soundness. Therefore, we hope that for the effectiveness of the law in the future, we should first improve politics in order to cooperate.

### 桂省民衆　協力日軍建設　華南日某部隊長談話

Guangxi People Cooperate with Japanese Army Construction; Talk by a Unit Commander of the Japanese Army in South China

Continental Front Base, 21st (Central News Agency) - A certain unit commander of the Japanese army, who directly participated in the South China operations this time, gave a talk yesterday, saying: "The most worrying thing at the beginning of the operation was the trend of the people of Guangxi. However, in fact, wherever the Japanese army went, it was greatly welcomed by the people. Even the people in the anti-Japanese centers such as Guilin, Liuzhou, Wuzhou, and Nanning still admired the Japanese army and gradually returned. This is because Guangxi is controlled by the Greater Guangxi faction of Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, etc., and is not directly ruled by Chongqing. Therefore, Guangxi's self-defense is neither for Chongqing nor for Yan'an. The people of Guangxi are extremely angry at the despicable behavior of the Chongqing-US air force bombing. According to the confession of American prisoners of war, they would strafe as soon as there was any movement by the Japanese or Chinese armies. In short, there are no Orientals in their eyes. The people who were forced to build the Southwest US air force base and sacrificed in its bombing and strafing cannot remain silent about this American atrocity. On the other hand, the Japanese army has strict military discipline. The people, witnessing this fact, are of course excited to return. These people are now rising up together under Japan's warmth in order to build peace in Guangxi."

### 日議會將審議台鮮参政问题

Japanese Diet to Deliberate on the Issue of Political Participation for Taiwan and Korea

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - The 86th Japanese Diet is holding political deliberations on bills under the serious war situation. In addition to the budget, there are other important issues to be deliberated. First, there is the issue of political treatment for Korea and Taiwan that was not resolved in the previous Diet, that is, the issue of political participation in the two regions. Although the government's specific plan has been disclosed in the Diet, the internal problem of the political arena is that Korea and Taiwan are now implementing a conscription system, but they have not been given political rights. Therefore, most people in the political arena support the government from a political standpoint. Second, there is the purely political issue that follows the evolution of the war situation, that is, the implementation of measures to strengthen combat power to fully guide the Philippine war situation. Therefore, they advocate decisively changing some of the top personnel. Third, there is the issue of establishing political power. This issue is currently being discussed in the party-political arena. There is much talk that although the Political Association is now called a political group, it has not advocated important political programs and policies. In order to break this situation, it must further become a political organization that can take charge of the current situation and start with a new face. However, the problem that arises here is that if the above form is taken, it will be divided into several political groups. Therefore, the future policy seems to be to still adopt the single form of the Political Association, make the connection with politics closer, and gradually assume the heavy responsibility of the political situation.

### 機擊滿泰　轟炸俘虜營

Air Raids on Fengtian and Thailand Bomb Prisoner-of-War Camps

More Than 200 Killed or Injured

Xinjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - When the Chongqing-US air force attacked Fengtian and Dalian on the 7th, they dropped bombs on the prisoner-of-war camp, causing as many as 55 prisoners of war to be killed or injured. Therefore, when the air raid alarm was issued, the prisoners of war were evacuated to a safe zone under the command of the warden. However, because the enemy aircraft dropped bombs indiscriminately, several bombs fell on the camp, killing or injuring as many as 55 British, American, and Australian prisoners of war. As a result, the prisoners of war were all indignant. An injured American air force sergeant said about the indiscriminate bombing by American aircraft, "I didn't expect this aircraft to come from my home country and injure my right shoulder and chest. I really didn't think that what my home country would give me would be so cruel. Also, several of my friends were injured or killed in this air raid." Also, Major Thompson Geenke of the US Army, a prisoner of war, also expressed his feelings as follows: "This camp is set up for prisoners of war, so it is easy to distinguish it from other military buildings. In this air raid, dozens of people were killed or injured. The aircraft were from my own country and fought for the country, but why did they bomb us? It is puzzling."

Bangkok, 21st (Central News Agency) - On December 8th, enemy aircraft attacked the central region of Thailand and dropped bombs indiscriminately. After investigation, the evacuation shelter for British prisoners of war was bombed, killing 56 people and injuring 141.

### 當局勸煙民　從速戒煙

Authorities Urge Smokers to Quit Smoking Quickly

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - Since the government implemented the anti-smoking policy in April of this year, the results have been exceptionally good, and the expected effects have been achieved. However, many smokers in various places clearly understand the government's anti-smoking policy and have voluntarily quit. However, there are also smokers who not only do not voluntarily quit, but also avoid being transferred by the anti-smoking bureau, which violates the government's ban and the intent of the anti-smoking policy. Therefore, it is hoped that smokers in various places can encourage themselves to quit at local anti-smoking hospitals. Otherwise, those who have not quit opium after the expiration of the anti-smoking plan will be severely punished according to the law. It is hoped that smokers will not play with fire and harm themselves.

### 國定教科書　實施保管制

National Textbooks Implement Custody System

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - In view of the current shortage of paper materials and printing difficulties, the Ministry of Education has decided to implement a "National Textbook Use and Custody System" from the end of the current semester, instructing all primary and secondary schools across the country to collect all textbooks purchased by students at all levels. As for how students should use textbooks during the holidays for revision, and how to pay for the textbooks, these are detailed in the measures. At the same time, according to the person in charge of the Ministry, in addition to the fact that the China United Publishing Company is doing its best to rush to produce the textbooks for the coming spring semester, the number of textbooks will be increased as much as possible in the future to ensure that primary and secondary school students each have all the textbooks they can read under the difficult conditions of paper and printing.

### 法派賈德魯　任駐蘇大使

### 希特勒指揮反攻已克服本年危機　德戰車與步兵繼續挺進

Hitler Commands Counter-Offensive, Overcomes Crisis of This Year; German Tanks and Infantry Continue to Advance

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities announced the German offensive on the Western Front on the 20th as follows: The German offensive on the Western Front is an operational plan personally planned by the Führer Hitler, and the Führer also directly serves as the commander-in-chief. He has cut the US First Army into two parts. The US Army is now mobilizing more than two divisions of reserves to change the situation. The German army is fully prepared under the command of the Führer Hitler, so the German offensive will not be weakened by this.

Stockholm, 21st (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: The German army has overcome this year's crisis with great strength and tenacity, and there seems to be no danger at present. The German army has not only maintained its front lines, but also its scientists and industrialists have supplied the German army with many new weapons. The ground forces of the anti-Axis forces no longer have the advantage to defeat the German army. The day of the end of the war still seems to be far away.

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: According to the German official war report, as a result of the German offensive, the number of prisoners of war captured by the German army has exceeded 10,000. On Wednesday, the German army seized 43 enemy tanks and armored vehicles, and 50 heavy artillery pieces, and destroyed 136 enemy tanks. In the focus of the battles on the Western Front, the enemy continued to carry out ineffective offensives with weak forces.

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) - Transocean News Agency: Well-informed sources revealed that more than 100 hours have passed since the German army began its offensive in front of the Eiffel Mountains and fought the US Army. The German army has superb weapons. Before the German soldiers arrived at the front lines, they passed through German towns and villages that were bombed and destroyed in western Germany. They were exceptionally motivated and eager to fight the enemy army that indiscriminately bombed German civilians.

German Army Has Crossed Luxembourg

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: A German spokesman declared on Thursday that the German army on the Western Front, after annihilating and capturing US troops behind the Hechelscheid-Eifel Mountains, continued to advance forward. Most of the battles are currently being fought in Belgium. The German army has invaded the Ardennes (on the border between northern France and Belgium) and has crossed Luxembourg.

Geneva, 21st (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: According to a Reuters reporter in Paris, German mechanized units and infantry have made a wedge-shaped incursion into important cities within Luxembourg within 52 hours of the launch of the general offensive. So far, there has been no news of them being stopped. The German army may make further progress. The generals of the anti-Axis forces are currently devising countermeasures to the war situation, but the bad weather prevents them from obtaining strong air support. The German army seems to have achieved considerable success.

Eisenhower Hastily Transfers Reinforcements

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) - Transocean News Agency: Eisenhower is still looking for the center of gravity of the German offensive, but it can be seen from the chaotic reports he has issued that he has completely failed. This surprising factor will be more conducive to German operations. Eisenhower has now hastily transferred a large number of operational reserves to deal with the German offensive. Whether he can transfer them to the area where the German pressure is greatest is still in doubt. The actions of the German army will surely be able to quickly change the center of gravity of its offensive and make it difficult for the enemy army to grasp it. Although the anti-Axis forces can use their strong air force to take the defensive, it is difficult to say whether Eisenhower can stop his offensive in the southern and northern sectors and gradually concentrate his forces to repel the German advance. However, the German offensive has not yet developed to its peak, and the final battle is imminent. After the first phase of the offensive, the second phase will follow. The German army, from top to bottom, is now determined to hold on to this initiative.

### Municipal Government Winter Relief Committee Discusses Specific Relief Plans; Decides on Soup Kitchen Measures and Establishes Shelters for the Cold

### New Year's Gifts from All Sectors: Please Convert to Cash and Allocate to Scholarship Fund

Today is the "Winter Solstice," the day after tomorrow is "Christmas," and in another eight days it will be the "Gregorian New Year." These ten days are filled with consecutive festivals. According to Shanghai customs, relatives and friends will inevitably exchange gifts. But what kind of gifts should one prepare? Nothing more than food, things to use, clothes to wear, and things to play with. But haven't you thought about it: the person receiving the gift may not lack food or clothing. Sending it may not be to their liking or bring them joy. It would be better to turn this difficult problem into a very meaningful good deed: donating to the "scholarship fund." For example, if you plan to give a gift worth 20,000 yuan, you can write down the names of the recipients, form a team, and send them a formal receipt. Publish it in the newspaper the next day, as if this selfish gift has been made public to society. Transforming private into public, the recipient enjoys the fame of supporting education, and the giver invisibly sows a solid seed that will bloom into beautiful flowers and bear solid fruit in the future. Wouldn't that be a win-win situation for fame and fortune? Whether you are an individual or an organization, you can follow this method when giving gifts. Even if the gift has already been given and must be reciprocated, you can estimate its value and send the cash to this office, forming a team for the recipient. How generous and wonderful! I think if this can be promoted widely, the effect will definitely be great. On a small scale, it will change social customs; on a large scale, it will lay the foundation for national education. Isn't it worthy of advocacy?
