### Only Swear to Kill the Enemy

— Tokutomi Sohō

Our sincerest hope and prayer for the new coalition cabinet of Koiso and Yonai is that it will truly embody the principle of "change brings progress." If the cabinet, after so much effort and upheaval, remains the same as its predecessor, exhibiting no real change, it would not only negate the purpose of its formation but also render the entire process superfluous. I believe that a cabinet change should bring about a renewal of spirit, a clearing away of the stagnant and impure, like guiding stagnant water into a bottomless abyss. It should harness all new vigor and energy to prepare for victory against the enemy. Only with such resolve and conviction can it fulfill the initial mandate given to Generals Koiso and Yonai. We, the one hundred million people of Japan, deeply believe this and eagerly await the results.

It is unlikely that anyone who heard the news of Army General Koiso and Navy Admiral Yonai being appointed to form a cabinet did not feel a surge of unusual excitement. Since the first Itō cabinet in 1885 until today, there have been forty-one cabinet changes. Among them, only the Ōkuma-Itagaki cabinet of 1898 and this one have been formed by two individuals. In other words, only twice in forty-one cabinet changes. However, the reason Ōkuma and Itagaki were jointly appointed was that the opposition parties led by Ōkuma and Itagaki merged and jointly criticized the Itō cabinet. As a result, Itō proposed that the two form a joint cabinet. Unfortunately, that cabinet was short-lived, lasting only four months. The reason was that Ōkuma and Itagaki each pursued their own agenda from beginning to end, appearing united but being estranged, and engaging in mutual suspicion and infighting, which ultimately led to its downfall. While the average tenure of previous cabinets was one and a half years, the Ōkuma-Itagaki cabinet lasted only one-quarter of that average. This time, Koiso and Yonai must not only carefully consider the positions of the Army and Navy but also deeply recognize that the Army and Navy are the true Japanese Imperial Army under the command of His Majesty the Emperor. Therefore, they must be united and act in concert, like the snake of Changshan, with head and tail corresponding, swift support in times of urgency, with one heart and one mind, from beginning to end. This is our earnest hope.

What we expect from the new cabinet is that everything be dedicated to the war effort. If someone asks, "What is this cabinet for?" the answer should be, "It is a cabinet for war." If asked, "Why are we fighting?" the answer should be, "We are fighting for victory." A war that cannot be won is a useless war. Once a war has begun, it must be carried through to the end. In other words, this cabinet must be one that absolutely completes the Greater East Asia War. Regarding this point, our one hundred million people must wholeheartedly support the policies of this cabinet and must assist the cabinet.

Furthermore, we must reflect on one thing. Saigō Nanshū once said, "Give credit to others, take the blame yourself," but unfortunately, today's world and human nature are the opposite. People even snatch others' merits for themselves, and they are skilled at shifting blame to others. This is the style of the general public today. If this is the case, it will be extremely difficult to complete the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, all citizens, including military officers and civilians, must take this opportunity to emphasize the necessity of self-reflection. Today, there are captains who commit suicide because they damaged a ship, and technicians who take their own lives because they failed to complete an invention on time. When it comes to the soldiers of the Imperial nation, there are countless officers and men who value their responsibilities. This truly makes us bow in deep respect and gratitude. However, while there are such noble and self-disciplined Japanese men, there are also those who disgrace the Japanese name. Therefore, those in positions of authority must lead by example and constantly examine themselves.

Generally speaking, what is most needed today is harmony among people. Mencius also said, "Heaven's timing is not as good as earth's advantages, and earth's advantages are not as good as harmony among people." In extreme terms, what is needed today is not so much increased production of weapons or food, but rather increased harmony among people. If harmony fills the entire nation, then weapons will naturally increase in production, and food will naturally increase as well. But if harmony is lacking, then no amount of supervision or encouragement will be effective. To make people work, one needs power and wealth. But if one cannot make people willingly and sincerely submit, then no matter how much money is given or how strict the laws are, it will not be effectively implemented. The most important thing is to make people willingly and sincerely submit. In other words, to gain harmony among people. To achieve this goal, the first thing for those in power is to trust the people, the second is to respect the people, the third is to listen to the voices of the people, and the fourth is to stop bureaucratic politics and implement people-oriented politics. These four points are by no means newly invented fabrications, but rather the traditional political essence of the Japanese Imperial nation. Even Hōjō Yasutoki, a traitor who was criticized by the world, still regarded gaining harmony among people as an urgent task. Kitabatake Chikafusa in his "Jinnō Shōtōki" (A Chronicle of Gods and Sovereigns) praised it extensively. To give a current example, if munitions factories, etc., were to work more diligently, there would definitely be room for increased production. I believe that the new Minister of Munitions, Fujiwara Ginjirō, knows this better than anyone else. However, there are often many people who ignore that this is a business that is closely related to the survival of the nation, and only pursue profit as their motto. If this is not corrected, no matter how much the industrial warriors are encouraged, no matter how many young men and workers are mobilized, the desired goal will not be achieved. To achieve this goal, empty talk is useless, and those in power must lead by example.

Finally, it must be pointed out that the new cabinet must strive and persevere to the end. Victory depends on time. Regardless of victory or defeat, it is important to stubbornly persist. Just as Marshal Foch said, "My left wing is retreating, my right wing is collapsing, and all we can do is attack." Regardless of the circumstances, they must show the nation a strong determination that only an attack can bring victory. If those in power show weakness, the impact on the nation and its allies will be immeasurable. Therefore, we hope that those in authority will show the people of our country a strong determination. Furthermore, Prime Minister Tōjō has navigated through two years and nine months of long-term turbulent waves, and this is something that no one can fail to admire and respect. As for his achievements, opinions vary, but his hard work is universally acknowledged. We will not talk about the Tōjō cabinet, but about Prime Minister Tōjō. He himself was always full of enthusiasm and had a spirit that demanded victory. I believe that the newly appointed Koiso-Yonai cabinet will definitely inherit this.

### Comprehensive War Results of Japanese Army and Navy Units in July: A Total of 1,030 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down

Tokyo, 12th (Chūō Tsūshinsha Dispatch) - The Imperial General Headquarters of Japan announced at 3:30 PM on the 12th that the comprehensive war results of Japanese Army and Navy units in attacking enemy air forces and engaging in interception operations in July were as follows: Enemy losses: 81 shot down and 60 destroyed in the South Pacific; 154 shot down and 112 destroyed in the Central Pacific; 3 shot down and 2 destroyed in the North Pacific; 80 shot down in China (17 unconfirmed), 475 burned and destroyed; 19 shot down and 44 destroyed in Burma and the Indian Ocean, totaling 1,030 aircraft. Japanese losses: 34 aircraft not returning from self-explosion missions, 105 aircraft damaged on the ground, totaling 139 aircraft.

Tokyo, 12th (Chūō Tsūshinsha Dispatch) - Since the enemy attempted to launch invasion operations, the air battles in various regions of Greater East Asia have also intensified, and the forces mobilized by the enemy air force in various theaters have also increased sharply. According to reports, the enemy mobilized approximately 72,000 aircraft in mid-June and 36,500 aircraft in July, which is clear evidence that the enemy, relying on British and American resources, is using air combat as a future operational strategy. Conversely, the Japanese army, with its isolated forces, either attacked or defended, bravely fought back, and destroyed enemy aircraft, achieving significant results. In mid-June, 1,460 enemy aircraft were shot down or destroyed, and in July, 1,030 aircraft were shot down or destroyed. Although the results in July decreased by 430 aircraft compared to June, they were still 120 aircraft more than in May. The Japanese army lost 369 aircraft in June and 139 aircraft in July, a decrease of as many as 230 aircraft. This is the result of the arduous struggle of the Japanese air force units. In addition, the total number of enemy aircraft attacking various theaters increased to approximately 15,000 in July due to the increased offensive in the Central Pacific at Nimitiz, which is 700 more than in June. From this, we can see the intensity of the enemy's attack on the Mariana Islands. In China, there were 3,600 aircraft, and in Burma, there were 5,500 aircraft. The size of their air force is evident from this. In particular, the Japanese air force in China repeatedly bombed the forward bases of the U.S. air force stationed in Chongqing, such as Guilin and Liuzhou, destroying 555 enemy aircraft in July and inflicting a fatal blow on the enemy air force. However, the supply of the enemy's air routes in China and India seems to be greater than we expected and should not be underestimated. Looking at the trends of the Chinese war and the tension in the Pacific war, we can see the great significance of future operations in China.

Central Pacific, Japanese Army Base, 12th (Chūō Tsūshinsha Dispatch) - On the 10th, during the day, 19 enemy heavy bombers attacked Yap Island, and one of them was shot down.

### Announcement by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters: Recent War Situation in Burma, Linking Lines to Prepare for the Next Operation

Tokyo, 12th (Chūō Tsūshinsha Dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters announced on the 12th regarding the recent war situation in Burma, stating: Since the rainy season began in Burma, according to ordinary military common sense, the actions of both sides should be hindered by the weather. However, in reality, the Japanese army has been able to overcome natural conditions. The British and American allied forces attempted to open the Ledo Road to enhance their ability to fight against the Japanese army. The Japanese army has consistently fought bravely against them with outnumbered forces, enduring all unfavorable conditions. The war situation in various locations is described as follows: Southern Indo-Burmese Front: The Japanese army has linked strategic strongholds in the Buthidaung and Maungdaw areas, maintaining an iron-bow formation. There have been no major changes in the war situation. Central Indo-Burmese Border: The Imphal operation, which began in mid-March, has seen only advances and retreats since May, with no major progress. The Japanese army's active offensive has crushed the enemy's attempt to retake Burma, achieving the main objective of the operation. In August, the Japanese army voluntarily withdrew from the Kohima and Imphal areas to important defensive lines on the Indo-Burmese border to prepare for the next operation. Northern Burmese Front: Since the Yu-American Allied Forces attacked the northern Burmese border, the Japanese army has engaged in fierce battles in the Hukawng Valley area. Because the enemy relied on their supply lines, they had crossed the mountains on both sides of the Japanese army's position and advanced south. The Japanese army, in addition to inflicting heavy blows on them, gradually retreated to a new position on the north side of the Burmese railway west of Mogaung, confronting the enemy. The enemy forces in that area consisted of two divisions of the Yu army, one brigade of airborne troops, and two brigades of the West Indian army. The Yu army has suffered heavy losses due to the heavy blows from the Japanese army. In the Myitkyina area, the Japanese army fought bravely in isolation under the encirclement of superior enemy forces for as long as two months, and finally broke through the heavy enemy encirclement on the night of August 2nd and 3rd and retreated to the rear. At that time, the commander of the Japanese garrison ordered a junior officer to command the withdrawal operation, while he himself led a small number of subordinates in a final battle with the enemy, finally dying a heroic death. The fighting spirit of the Japanese Myitkyina garrison deeply moved the enemy camp, and Chiang Kai-shek used this to encourage his subordinates. The Japanese army on the Nujiang River front continues to secure key points on the west bank of the Nujiang River, thwarting enemy attacks, and continues to crush the enemy's attempt to open the Yunnan-Burma Highway.

### Japanese Air Force Raids Ankang Airfield

A Certain Chinese War Plane Base, 13th (Chūō Tsūshinsha Dispatch) - The Japanese air force raided the US Air Force forward base in Ankang Airfield, Shaanxi Province, in northwestern China, on the morning of the 11th. A total of 13 small fighter planes caught fire and 5 were destroyed. In this operation, a total of 18 Yu-American planes were destroyed, and all Japanese planes returned safely.

Chinese Base, 12th (Chūō Tsūshinsha Dispatch) - Around 9:30 PM on the 10th, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing raided the Guangzhou area. However, due to the Japanese army's strict air defense system, they were unable to penetrate the area and its vicinity and immediately withdrew. It seems that the Yu-American planes' move was a containment tactic to attack the Japanese mainland by air.

### Numbers of Yu-American Aircraft Losses

Hunan Front, 12th (Chūō Tsūshinsha Dispatch) - The air battles between the Japanese and American air forces were extremely fierce during the Hunan operation and the defense of Hengyang. From May 27th to August 9th, the Japanese air force shot down or destroyed a total of 654 Yu-American aircraft (7 of which were unconfirmed). In other interception battles, 215 aircraft were shot down or destroyed. During this period, the Yu-American air force actually lost as many as 869 aircraft.

### Yu Army Counterattacks Hengyang, Suffers a Heavy Blow from the Japanese Army, Yu-American Plan Completely Crushed

A certain base on the Hunan front, 12th (Chūō Tsūshinsha Dispatch) - The Yu-American forces in the Guilin area, using mechanized units transported by the Yu-Indian air route, began to gather and encircle the vicinity of Hengyang on the morning of the 9th near Yingpo on the Baoqing-Hengyang road in order to retake Hengyang. The mechanized units were based on 4 tanks and had a force of more than 7,000 men. In order to crush the Yu-American forces' stubborn counterattack, the elite of the Japanese army began operations from noon on the 9th and are now fiercely attacking the mechanized units of the Lu-American forces in the western area of Hengyang, pressing to Shiqing, 90 kilometers west of Hengyang.

Lisbon, 12th (Chūō Tsūshinsha Dispatch) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing military authorities recently announced that on the eve of the fall of Hengyang, Fang Xianjue, commander of the Tenth Army, telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek to say goodbye. The Yu army authorities released his text as follows: Chiang Kai-shek received a report from Fang Xianjue, commander of the Tenth Army defending Hengyang, on the morning of the 8th. The report was sent at 7:00 PM on the 7th and was jointly signed by the army commander Fang Xianjue and three division commanders. The content was as follows: "The Japanese army broke into the center of the city today and is now engaged in street fighting. We are determined to fight to the last soldier and coexist with the city of Hengyang, fulfilling our duty as soldiers. This report may be the last report."

### Leizhou Japanese Army Attacks Yu Army Stronghold

A Certain Base of the Japanese Army in Southern China, 12th (Chūō Tsūshinsha Dispatch) - After defeating the 55th Division of the Yu Army, the 463rd, 464th and 465th Regiments on the 4th of this month, the Japanese Southern China Expeditionary Force on the 9th strongly attacked the bases of the Yu Army Southern Route Commando Unit and the 455th National Security Regiment (about 800 men) which continued to operate on the Leizhou Peninsula - Anpu and Hengshanxu, defeating the above-mentioned Yu troops. The Japanese army took Anpu and Hengshanxu at 9:30 in the morning. The significance of this operation is great because the Yu army had used Anpu and Hengshanxu as bases to gather military supplies using civilian ships and continuously engage in improper activities. The crushing of these Yu army units has enabled the residents of the Leizhou Peninsula to live in peace and engage in their livelihoods. In addition, more than 20 members of the Guangdong Provincial Government Propaganda Team were dispatched to the front line, which is a most noteworthy fact. As for the results of this battle, 70 Yu army soldiers were captured, 108 Yu army bodies were left behind, and the Japanese army seized a large number of heavy and light machine guns, rifles, and ammunition from the Yu army.

### Concentrate National Political Power, Grasp People's Hearts, Follow National Policy - Japanese Prime Minister's Speech at the Yokusankai Meeting

Tokyo, 12th (Chūō Tsūshinsha Dispatch) - Prime Minister Koiso delivered a congratulatory speech at the general meeting for the election of the president of the Yokusan Political Association on the 11th, which stated in essence: Today, our country is facing unprecedented national difficulties. The way to overcome these severe national difficulties is to unite the officers, soldiers, and people as one, and to do everything possible to increase our strength in manpower and material resources to crush the enemy British and Americans. Therefore, all national policies must be focused on this path. However, the most urgent issue at this time is that the government, in accordance with the will of His Majesty the Emperor, reflect on where the people's hearts lie, and then grasp the people's hearts, so that they will willingly and sincerely cooperate with the government. The prerequisite for this is to gather the political forces of all circles and all aspects. Only by gathering political forces can we integrate and establish political leadership to comply with national policy. Only in this way can the people's will to fight be promoted, and only by promoting the people's will to fight can productivity increase day by day. Therefore, the mission of the Yokusan Political Association is to gather the political power of the entire country as the first priority. At this time, the importance of the Association has increased. Therefore, the inauguration of Mr. Kobayashi Ichizo as the new president is a cause for celebration for the Yokusankai Political Association and for the nation.

### Post Office Raises Postage Rates, Construction Department Disapproves

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Construction of the National Government, citing the heavy losses in postal economics in recent years, submitted a request to the authorities on May 11th of this year for permission to increase postage rates by 20%. This was implemented on May 16th and has been in effect for just over two months. The Postal Administration has again requested the Ministry of Construction to approve an increase in postage rates to 200 times pre-war levels, citing the need to increase employee salaries. This would mean an increase to ten yuan per letter for regular out-of-town mail. The Ministry of Construction believes that other state-owned enterprises, such as water and electricity, have only increased prices by 30 to 50 times pre-war levels, and that current postal rates are already high compared to the price increases of other utilities. Therefore, the authorities plan to disapprove the Postal Administration's proposed new rates, as they would not only increase the burden on the people but also stimulate other commodity prices.

### China Railway Implements New Measures to Prevent Black Market Train Tickets; Purchasers Must Show Residence Permit or Citizen Certificate

Since China Railway stipulated passenger trains, the crowding in front of Shanghai Station has become even worse, and black market train tickets are even more rampant. The China Railway authorities have finalized measures to avoid overcrowding and prevent black market ticket sales. It has been decided that starting August 15th, residence permit numbers will be recorded on train tickets to prevent resale. At the same time, tickets will be sold every other day to reduce crowding and prevent black market sales. The main points are as follows:

Recording Citizen Certificate Numbers

Citizen certificate numbers will be recorded on train tickets. When purchasing tickets, Japanese nationals must show their consulate's residence certificate to the ticket seller, and Chinese nationals must show their residence permit or citizen certificate. The number will be recorded on the back of the ticket. When boarding, passengers must present both the ticket and the aforementioned certificate for inspection. If the certificate number does not match the number on the ticket, it will be considered a black market ticket and boarding will be refused. When military police purchase tickets, a "military ticket" stamp will be added. Unless in uniform, the ticket cannot be used. The same certificate number will also be recorded on tickets sold by the East Asia Transportation Corporation. According to the above measures, those who purchase tickets from others at a high price will not be allowed to board. Please take note. In addition, if the ticket number does not match the certificate number when checking tickets on the train or at the station, the ticket will be invalid. In addition to purchasing a new ticket, a fine will be imposed.

Military Tickets Sold One Day in Advance

Ticket sales at the station were previously limited to the same day. Now, tickets will be sold the day before, but only at Shanghai Station. The method is as follows: Sales begin at 10:00 AM on the day before departure, but sales will stop when the quota is full. The trains sold are: "Beijing-Shanghai Line" departing at 8:00 AM (third class to Wuxi), departing at 8:30 AM (first, second, and third class to Nanjing), departing at 9:50 AM (second and third class to Nanjing), "Shanghai-Hangzhou Line" departing at 7:30 AM (second and third class to Hangzhou).

To give preferential treatment to long-distance passengers other than military personnel, government officials, and public employees, those taking the 8:30 AM train from Shanghai are limited to stations above Wuxi, those taking the 9:50 AM train are limited to stations above Changzhou, and those taking the 7:30 AM train are limited to stations above Jiaxing. These passengers can purchase tickets the day before. However, short-distance passengers will still follow the original procedures. The East Asia Transportation Corporation will also sell tickets every other day from now on. Passengers must travel in the class specified on the ticket. Those who violate this rule must purchase a new ticket and pay a fine. In addition, tickets cannot be returned after the train has departed.

### Household Flour Rationing to Be Doubled This Month; This Year's Wheat Purchase Results Are Excellent

Household rice rationing in this city resumed on the 10th of this month. At the same time, the flour ration will be doubled starting in August. According to this year's wheat production in Central China, the yield is expected to increase by about 10% to 20% compared to previous years. Since the Flour and Wheat Control Committee actively promoted the purchase work, the results have been excellent. To date, it has reached 20% of the target, so this year's food prospects are very optimistic. The original flour ration for each person per month in this city was three catties. Due to the good wheat crop situation mentioned above, it has been decided to increase it to six catties starting in August. The price will still be 20 yuan per catty for first-class flour, 18 yuan for second-class flour, and 10 yuan for third-class flour. Since household rice rationing was suspended for the past two months, residents of this city have felt that there was insufficient food. Starting in August, not only will household rice be restored to six sheng per person per month, but the flour ration will also be doubled. In addition, employees in important industries and public employees will also have a special allocation of 4 to 15 kilograms of rice, so there will be enough daily food. The serious food problem in this city can also be solved as a result. It is believed that the general price level will gradually decline under this influence, which will greatly benefit people's livelihoods.

### Money Exchange Industry Holds Members' Representative Conference Yesterday

The Shanghai Money Exchange Industry Association held its 11th Members' Representative Conference at the Beishi Guildhall at 2:00 PM yesterday. Attendees included Mr. Hao Zhuowu, Section Chief of the Municipal Finance Bureau, and 187 representatives from member money exchanges. The presidium consisted of Pei Yunqing, Lu Shuchen, and Wang Huailian.

The following matters were then reported: (A) Report on association affairs, (B) Report on the association's income and expenses, (C) Report on various affairs of the money depot. Subsequently, the following matters were discussed: amending the money depot's charter, amending the industry regulations, approving the association's budget for the next term and discussing increasing membership fees, discussing reforming the association's patrolman system, establishing a money exchange society, adjusting the funding for Qianyao elementary and secondary schools, and amending Articles 46 and 47 of the association's charter. All of the above proposals were passed. It was also discussed to increase the limit on money depot call loans, and it was decided to change it to one million yuan. Temporary motions: The daily deadline for returned checks is 7:00 PM, and Saturdays is 4:00 PM. In the future, all member exchanges must have the seal of the nominee when reorganizing or re-electing directors and supervisors in order to be legal. After the discussion, the directors and supervisors were elected. The association selected Lie Yunxiang, Lu Shuchen, Wang Huailian, Zhu Xuchang, and 17 others as directors, Fu Zhi and eight others as alternate directors, Wang Bingcheng and six others as supervisors, and Xi Jinrong and two others as alternate supervisors. The money depot selected Xu Wenqing and 14 others as directors, Ding Sangui and two others as alternate directors, Zhou Chuqin and four others as supervisors, and Liu Zhipu and two others as alternate supervisors.

### Business Control Committee Studies Control Plans

After its reorganization and establishment, the National General Business Control Association immediately began studying plans for the control of goods, especially rice, which is the most important commodity and is of concern to the general public. The entire society and people's livelihood depend on the supply and demand of rice and whether the control is good or not. Therefore, the first thing that the association focused on was the smooth determination of the rice control plan. In order to simplify the control work, the association has followed the instructions of the Executive Yuan and applied to transfer materials such as rice, flour, wheat, cotton, cotton textiles, and beans in the grain ration to the respective control committees for handling. Other matters related to the movement of controlled materials other than rice, cotton, cotton textiles, flour, wheat, and beans will still be handled by the association's Materials Movement Application and Permit Office.

### Restriction on Electric Light Usage Time; Police Bureau Strictly Enforces; Orders All Branches to Conduct Thorough Investigations and Corrections

The municipal government authorities, in order to conserve electricity, will restrict the usage time of electric lights and have established provisional measures. For household electric lights, whether indoor or outdoor, the use of electric lights is strictly prohibited from 12:00 midnight to 5:00 AM (except for those who need it for professional reasons or for the care of sick people, lying-in women, or infants). Regulations for the use of electric lights for business purposes have also been established and are detailed in yesterday's newspaper. As for hotels, restaurants, movie theaters, and other hospitality and entertainment venues, their business hours are limited to 10:00 PM. All lights, whether indoor or outdoor, are strictly prohibited after 11:00 PM. The Administrative Division of the Police Bureau has already followed the order and instructed the administrative sections of each branch to strictly enforce the above measures, starting from yesterday (the 12th). Police officers will be dispatched to conduct strict investigations and corrections in their respective jurisdictions, especially paying attention to and monitoring the business hours of entertainment venues. If any violations are found, a warning will be given. If they dare to persist, the electricity supply will be cut off, so that citizens will be encouraged to lead a wartime life.

Start Inspecting Vehicle Equipment

In order to adapt to air defense light control and sound control, the Shanghai Police Headquarters has now started to inspect the light-shielding equipment of vehicle lights and the sound control of horns for vehicles such as cars, trucks, and motorized bicycles at the Racecourse from the 7th to the 18th of this month. Announcement No. 26 was published in the newspaper on the 3rd of this month, stipulating the inspection date and the license plate numbers of vehicles to be inspected. It is reported that if these vehicles are not inspected after the deadline, or if the vehicle owner or driver deliberately modifies the vehicles after passing the inspection, exceeding the controlled range, once discovered, the vehicle and driver's license will be detained and punished. All kinds of motor vehicles with numbers above 30,000 in the newly merged areas will also have their inspection dates and locations announced before the end of this month.

Supervisors Completed Training Yesterday

The Supervisory Office of the Municipal Police Headquarters, in order to strengthen the city's supervisory work, convened all 80 of its supervisors for training. It has now been completed. The director of the Supervisory Office, Mr. Guo Shaoyi, summoned all the trained supervisors at 3:00 PM yesterday to give instructions, saying: The staff of the First and Second Police Bureaus should be united and cooperate with each other. The supervisory work should be unified. Strengthening the supervisory work is the premise for consolidating the city's police administration. After the completion of this training, we should set an example so that we can correct the discipline of the city's police officers. For investigating cases, we should use swift and agile means to obtain accurate results of the cases. I hope that you will work hard at all times and not neglect your duties.

### Public Reply Regarding the Teachers' Subsistence Allowance Issue

This newspaper recently received a letter from Xu Chengqing and other primary and secondary school teachers, asking how the subsistence allowance for primary and secondary school teachers collected on behalf of this newspaper would be distributed. The collection of the teachers' subsistence allowance on behalf of this newspaper was entrusted by the Municipal Government and the Social Welfare Bureau. It was originally planned to transfer all the funds after the end of the collection, but the intention of the authorities was to keep it in temporary custody, so the donations were deposited in the Tailai Money Exchange for easy withdrawal at any time. Later, the primary school principals' association sent representatives to inquire about the distribution issue, and preparations were made for the transfer. However, the authorities intended to discuss the entire distribution method, so they asked for temporary custody. At that time, the police consumer cooperative went to Wuhu to purchase rice, so they agreed with Deputy Director Su and Manager Ding of the cooperative, and agreed to purchase the rice on their behalf. As soon as the rice is delivered, it will be handed over to the primary school principals' association together with the authorities to clear the procedures. I hope this will be clear to the public.

### Health Bureau Strictly Bans Unhygienic Food and Beverages

Recently, the Municipal Health Bureau has found that small vendors along the streets are selling unhygienic food and beverages, and cut fruits, etc., which are easily prone to cause epidemics when citizens buy and eat them. These unhygienic foods are the source of epidemics. In order to protect the health of citizens, a ban has been issued. However, there are still some unscrupulous vendors who ignore the law and only seek private gain, and still appear on the streets and alleys after 5:00 PM, specializing in this unhygienic cold drinks and cut fruits. In order to thoroughly ban these things, the Health Bureau sent personnel to various places on the afternoon of the other day to strictly ban them. They seized more than 2,500 catties of cut and rotten fruits, sour plum soup, cool powder, and colorful water, as well as many unhygienic beverages and dirty utensils. The bureau sent these unhygienic beverages and rotten fruits to the rendering plant for destruction, and all the dirty utensils were confiscated as a warning to others.

### Municipal Propaganda Office Rectifies the Content of Small Newspapers

In order to urge the small newspapers in the city to thoroughly improve their content, eliminate bad habits, and meet the needs of the times and conform to the wartime cultural propaganda policy, the Municipal Propaganda Office specially convened the persons in charge and editors of various small newspapers at 10:00 AM on the 10th at the conference room on the second floor of the Municipal Government for an open discussion. More than ten people attended, including Hai Bao Tang Tiaohe, Li Bao Hu Ligeng, Social Daily Chen Tingchao, Oriental Daily Deng Gaixian, Fanhua Bao Mei Shuangdai Wang Xuechen, Ji Bao Lang Shibing Yao Luding, Ningbo Public Report Zhou Xiaozai, Drama Daily Lin Yiyun, Drama World Liang Zihua, and Robin Hood Report Qiu. Director Tian Liang personally presided over the meeting, and Inspector Zhang Ting from the News Inspection Office also attended to assist in the guidance. First, Director Liang gave instructions, explaining the significance of convening the discussion and pointing out in detail the impropriety of various bad habits of the small newspapers, which should be improved as soon as possible. At the same time, he also elaborated on the points that the authorities expected. Subsequently, the persons in charge of the small newspapers gave detailed reports on the current situation and future plans of each newspaper, followed by research on the improvement plan. The Municipal Propaganda Office specially formulated the "Instructions for Improving the Content of Various Small Newspapers" and put forward specific instructions point by point, including: increasing the proportion of current affairs news, assisting in publicizing government policies, not adding opinions on civil and criminal cases that have not been judged, the writing of special interviews for social news should be serious, texts attacking private individuals and damaging their reputation should not be published, clearing up decadent and pornographic texts, eliminating the records of strange and absurd superstitions, avoiding the publication of texts promoting improper businesses and gambling-related entertainment, and being careful about publishing news about black market prices and industrial and commercial information. The persons in charge of the small newspapers all expressed that they would comply and decided to start preparing immediately, implementing it from September 1, and stipulating that the three months from September to November would be a strict assessment period. If the assessment results show that there is still no self-examination and no positive improvement performance, the Municipal Propaganda Office will consider stopping its publication.

### Broadcasting Association Thoroughly Investigates Impersonation of Investigators

The China Broadcasting Association has found that recently, unscrupulous people have impersonated the name of the association's radio investigators, inspected prohibited radios, and threatened and blackmailed listeners, which is hateful. The formal investigators dispatched by the association all have badges, employee cards, and armbands for identification. Listeners can ask to read their documents at any time if there is any doubt. It is hoped that all listeners will cooperate with each other, strictly abide by the rules, and never privately transfer equipment to uphold the law. In the future, if any of the above situations are discovered, they can be reported directly to No. 133 Sichuan Road (telephone 15173) for verification.

### Special Consumption Tax in This City Is Being Actively Reorganized; Director Yuan of the Finance Bureau Issues a Statement

The special consumption tax was universally implemented by the government on January 16th of this year in order to meet the needs of the wartime economy. This income has a profound relationship with both the country and the locality. Even the former First District Office took this income as the main source of tax revenue. When I was ordered to concurrently serve as the Director of the Finance Department on February 1st of this year, because the Finance Bureau itself was also planning to improve various taxes, I had no time to fully reorganize this special consumption tax. Now that the municipal government agencies have been unified, they are being completely planned for reorganization. Recently, newspapers in Guansi published news of dissatisfaction with the personnel handling the special consumption tax. If the content is true, it is my lack of supervision, and there is no way to deny it, and I am extremely ashamed. However, I have always advocated openness in tax matters. I have now temporarily adjusted the internal personnel and am planning to establish the special consumption tax as an independent institution, and hire well-known social figures with tax experience to preside over it, so that they can carefully study and improve the methods and thoroughly reform them. As for the rumors of corruption recently published in newspapers, I have now been ordered by the superior authorities to send personnel to conduct a thorough investigation. What the facts are will soon come to light.

### A Suggestion for Using Old Books to Lend Books

— Zhu Rongyuan

At a time when raw materials are scarce, general manufacturers are doing everything possible to turn useless things into useful things and make full use of them. General users also know that material resources are difficult and expensive to purchase, so they save as much as possible. In terms of culture, which is closely related to the future of the country, if we want to promote its prosperity and strengthen the country and its people, so that the people can read, know the country, know their families, and understand themselves, we must popularize education and develop culture. If we want to popularize and develop it, we must make it affordable. However, now a sheet of white paper costs as much as a piece of high-quality silk material before the war, so a thin book can cost tens of yuan. Please explain why:

The paper produced by various paper mills in Shanghai mainly uses waste paper, old books, rags, waste flowers, and rice stalks as raw materials. Wood pulp and other materials have long been expensive, so they are not used. The manufacturing process of rags is more complicated, and there are electricity restrictions, so fewer people use them. Generally, waste paper and old materials are used as raw materials. I have a slight relationship with the paper and waste paper industries. I often see that old books contain famous works that have been out of print for decades or are extremely difficult to buy in society, as well as textbooks from various bookstores (the most), either brand new and unused, or used with many annotations, or incomplete, accounting for 60% of the waste paper. Old paper shops earn this valuable book at the price of waste paper and sell it to paper mills. The paper mills use female workers to tear up this good book to facilitate pulping. In this way, although the papermaking industry transforms useless waste paper into various usable papers, it must add alkaline materials, bleaching powder, rosin and other raw materials to become the desired paper, and then sell it to the printing industry to print various books. However, the quality of old paper after being transformed into new paper is not as strong as the original, and with other secondary raw materials, material manpower, coal and electricity expenses, it can become new paper. The printing industry then adds printing costs and various expenses, so the cost is high. Recently, electricity restrictions have been added, and the paper and printing industries cannot manufacture and print as much as they want, so it is no wonder that paper is expensive and books are expensive.

At this time of difficult life, parents of general students want to cultivate their children into useful people with all their might, and serve the country and society in the future. Therefore, those with insufficient strength apply for student loans. According to reports and what I have seen, there are not a few general students who are eager to learn, who have obtained loans but still cannot buy books and continue their studies, because a thin book costs tens of yuan. If it is a book for a middle school or university, it is not surprising that a book costs hundreds or tens of yuan. However, the school stipulates a certain book (assuming that there is no such thing in the national book). Taking the last semester as an example, there are many cases where a class cannot buy all the books even after traveling all over Shanghai. Then, it is difficult for the teachers to teach, and the students have no clue. Therefore, I will describe the general situation above, and ask Shanghai paper mills and waste paper industries, who are originally cultural elites, to move this book to student loans, or sell it to loan students at the price of waste paper plus a reasonable profit. Philanthropists and people who are enthusiastic about rescuing out-of-school students can search for books from the two industries mentioned above, and then entrust Shen Xin Er Bao or directly lend them to poor children. In this way, we can avoid the complexity of cracking and printing, save electricity and materials, and benefit students, which is also a method of rescue.

### Analyzing Three Types of Letters: SOS! Expose! Payment! Hope for Full Assistance from All Sectors of Society and School Authorities

Recently, in the past ten days, we have been continuously receiving letters from students applying for assistance, ranging from over a hundred to twenty or so per day. Of course, we cannot bear to discard these lovely missives and have organized them one by one. Roughly sixty to seventy percent are from those who failed the entrance exams and are pleading for special consideration; ten to twenty percent are exposing classmates or acquaintances who, despite having comfortable family circumstances, also seek assistance funds, some even after passing the exam; and another ten to twenty percent are requesting early disbursement of assistance funds, otherwise, the school will not allow them to enroll. Among them, the first type of letters is written with every word a tear, being the most earnest. Generally, those who study diligently tend to have better grades, so their letters are filled with genuine emotion and are deeply moving! As the ancients said, "Do not be arrogant in victory, nor disheartened in defeat." If you failed this time, you will surely succeed next time. Moreover, we have been appealing repeatedly, hoping that wealthy gentlemen will generously donate funds. If there is an unexpected gain within twenty days, you may also receive assistance funds. For now, please wait. The second type of letters exposes those who are not genuinely poor and try to pass themselves off as such, thereby encroaching upon the places of truly impoverished students. Ask yourselves, how can you be at peace? We are grateful for your good intentions in exposing them, and we will dispatch personnel to secretly investigate. If it is true, we will immediately cancel their assistance and publicly announce their names. Regarding the third type of letters, those who have been admitted but whose assistance funds are insufficient to cover their expenses may inform the school, stating that the assistance funds have not been received and request permission for deferred payment. We also request the school to understand the plight of poor students and allow them to postpone payment. In summary of the above three points, we sincerely hope that all sectors of society and school authorities will give us full assistance and sympathy, for which we are extremely grateful.

Zhonghua Book Company's Frugal Assistance to Education

A letter from Zhonghua Book Company states: "On the 5th of this month, our publishing house resumed business at its original location. Initially, we dared not engage in any extravagant activities in the interest of frugality. However, we received generous kindness from various sectors and colleagues, offering significant gifts and suggesting that they be converted into cash to assist education. Unable to refuse this gesture of goodwill, we have combined the monetary gifts received on that day and the expenses saved from tea and refreshments by our company to form a substantial sum, which we are transferring for the purpose of aiding impoverished students. We are now contributing Central Reserve Certificates worth 20,000 yuan as your newspaper's educational assistance fund, which we kindly request you to publish."

Huaiwen Middle School Accepts Half-Fee Students

Huaiwen Middle School has established two programs, half-fee and full-fee exemption, to admit students who were not accepted in this year's entrance exams. Their sincerity is deeply appreciated. A letter states, "We are writing to inform you that our school is run by teachers from the Provincial Songjiang Senior High School. We have devoted ourselves to educating talents for many years. This year, ten of our senior students were admitted to Jiaotong University, which has drawn the university's attention to our school's history. We, the colleagues of our school, are pleased and eager to follow the spirit of your newspaper's educational assistance. We are willing to accept fifteen half-fee students each in the first year of junior high school and senior high school, and ten half-fee students each in the second and third years of junior high school and senior high school. For students with extremely impoverished family circumstances and excellent academic performance, full-fee exemption will be granted. We respectfully request you to solicit and select students from among those who applied for assistance funds but were not selected to assist them. We hope you will consider our humble request."

Assistance Funds Received Yesterday: Zhonghua Book Company, 20,000 yuan; Xi Jianping (funds transferred from a frugal birthday celebration), 10,000 yuan; Rong Renben and Lu Qing, combined, 10,000 yuan; Shudtang Sheng, 5,000 yuan; Wu Daosheng, 3,000 yuan; Xu Renguan, 1,000 yuan; Gu Mingwen, 500 yuan; Shan Fangshi, 400 yuan; Lu Yuanyuan, 200 yuan; Chen Cuiwen and Sheng Ji, 100 yuan each; Pu Jiting (in memory of teacher Hua Xingcun), 80 yuan; Pu Fukang and Jie Yuan, combined, 20 yuan.

### Record of the Aerial Battle over Omiya Island

On June 11th, after receiving reports of the enemy's mobile fleet approaching, our air force units on standby immediately took off and began aerial patrols. At 0:00 PM, dozens of enemy Grumman fighters appeared in the distant sky. Our patrolling fighters, upon seeing this, launched a simultaneous attack from the clouds. The enemy also dispersed their formation, and a chaotic aerial battle ensued. Ground artillery simultaneously opened fire on the enemy planes invading the airspace above 〇〇 Island. A pomegranate-like barrage shattered the deathly silence, surrounding the fleeing enemy aircraft. The attacking planes landed from time to time to replenish fuel and ammunition. Maintenance personnel worked tirelessly under enemy fire to resupply fuel and ammunition. By 0:00 PM, the enemy retreated, and calm returned.

In this aerial battle, Ensign H shot down as many as three enemy Grumman fighters. Unfortunately, he had to land due to a fuel fire, and at the same time, his aircraft burst into flames, turning into an inferno. According to his account:

Perfect Weather

Never had there been such perfect weather for an attack. It was a pity that the fuel caught fire. Just as I was thinking of bailing out mid-flight, the aircraft was already burning. Right there, I saw enemy planes in the sky, and I used a dive bomb to shoot them down from the clouds. Furthermore, I saw enemy planes escaping through the gaps in the clouds and shot down three of them, but it was a pity that the fuel tank caught fire.

Reporters on a high platform, watching the aerial battle, shouted "Ah! Smoke is coming out!" "Another one is going down!" whenever enemy planes spewing black smoke plunged into the distant water, shouting "Banzai!" On June 12th, at 0:00 AM, more than ten enemy Grumman fighters attacked again. Subsequently, fighter-bomber squadrons (carrier-based fighters) continuously bombed, and the airfield and positions were engulfed in ash and dust. Our anti-aircraft guns and machine gun positions fired on the enemy planes, shooting them down one after another. The enemy dropped mostly 30 kg and 60 kg bombs and incendiary bombs. Sometimes, 250 kg bombs were also dropped. More than half of these bombs were time bombs, mostly set to explode after two to six hours. The incendiary bombs weighed about 5 kg, and seven to eight were bundled together and dropped simultaneously, piercing roofs and floors and landing inside rooms. Soldiers waiting in the shelters near the dormitories immediately came out to cover them with wet mats and pour water on them to extinguish the fire, so the damage was always very minor. Some houses were only pierced through the roof, and a few houses were burned down due to delays, but it was nothing to be afraid of.

A Sea of Fire

The most annoying thing was that incendiary bombs caused wildfires. Once the dry tropical grass was ignited, one side of the mountain would turn into a sea of fire, which could only be extinguished by the unique rain of the South Seas.

On the third day, from 0:00 AM to just past 6:00 AM, large formations of seventy to eighty planes attacked, using dive bombing at angles of forty to fifty degrees. However, the skill of the crew was mostly immature. According to the prisoners, among the fighter crew, some had only eighty hours of flight time. Almost none of the bombs hit the intended target. After the fighter-bombers had dropped their bombs, Grumman fighters followed up with machine-gun fire.

On June 〇, a telegram with the instructions of the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet was written on the blackboard:

"Commander of the 〇 Unit, our air force has begun a general offensive."

Kill All Enemies

Upon seeing the telegram from the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, the unit commanders clenched their fists even tighter and flushed with excitement: "Good! Let's do it! We must kill them all!" In the evening, the battle headquarters below the unit commanders received the good news that our fleet's attacking fighters had landed at the airfield in the evening. The guide lights for night landing were also fully on standby. At 0:00 PM, the waiting 〇〇 planes, one by one, leisurely flew into the runway and immediately reported the results to the unit commanders. The squad members next to the unit commanders were also boiling with enthusiasm, their faces flushed red as they reported the battle situation. The command post was filled with bloodthirst. The reports from the pilots returning one after another were even more exciting, and they shook hands with each other to celebrate. After a short nap, the heroes who had made meritorious contributions set out again for the dawn attack. Seeing this state of attack, the reporter silently wished for lasting military fortune. In this way, due to the continuous twilight and dawn attacks, the torpedoes that hit the mark, and the results achieved, as announced by the headquarters, behind them are always the precious blood and sweat and lives of the sailors.

Seeing the attack of this enemy mobile fleet, it seems that the enemy lacks quite excellent crew members. (Translated from the July 24th Mainichi Shimbun)

Japanese Warriors' Fierce Attack

The battle on Omiya Island is still extremely fierce. The enemy forces landing at Akashi Bay in the central part of the island's west coast and at Showa Bay in the southwest are being significantly hampered by the Japanese army's brave counterattacks.

Fearing the Japanese army's fierce night attacks and dawn battles, the enemy forces often lead with several tanks, with infantry timidly following behind. At night, they immediately lay mines in preparation for Japanese night attacks. However, by the 23rd, they landed on the peninsula between the two places, and on the 24th, they began to land in Ainamicho on the opposite shore of the island, rapidly strengthening their forces. Moreover, there were often five or sixty planes flying in the sky above the battlefield, preventing the Japanese army's daytime attacks.

In response, the Japanese army has been continuously conducting night attacks and dawn battles since the 21st—disrupting the enemy's landing points and inflicting great damage. In particular, on the 23rd, they lured five enemy tanks from the Japanese army's right-wing positions in the Showa Bay area to very close range and launched a fierce counterattack, destroying three and disabling the others. On the 24th, the defending troops, in cooperation with infantry and artillery, resolutely intercepted the enemy who attempted to land twice on the Kurohama area on the south coast of the Omote Peninsula. In the first attempt, one landing craft and eleven amphibious tanks were sunk out of two landing craft and twenty amphibious tanks. The second time, their landing attempts were completely crushed.

Furthermore, at 5:30 PM on the same day, a 10,000-ton-class transport ship anchored in Showa Bay was spotted, and artillery fire was directed at it, hitting it twenty-seven times. The ship was immediately surrounded by thick smoke, heavily listing, and fled far away from the harbor. Although its sinking could not be confirmed, the power of the artillery raid was unleashed without regret, and morale was boosted.

Responding to the enemy's invasion operations in the Central Pacific, they are also stirring in the Indian Ocean. On the 25th, the enemy's mobile fleet approached the waters off Sumatra. The enemy's attack on Sabang was the second since April 19th. Their forces were greatly strengthened compared to the previous time, and their invasion attempts in that area became even more intense. On the 25th, several cruisers, destroyers, and submarines approached the waters off Sabang Harbor, and twenty-nine carrier-based aircraft flew into the sky, carrying out bombing while the ships shelled. The local Japanese army bravely repelled the attack, sinking two destroyers and one submarine, destroying one destroyer, and shooting down most of the attacking enemy planes, thereby repelling the enemy forces.

The damage from this enemy attack was minimal due to the fierce attacks of the frontline warriors, but vigilance must be maintained regarding the situation in the Pacific and the enemy's invasion attempts in that area. (Translated from the July 27th Newspaper)

### Omiya Island's Climate and Customs

Mr. Huang Jiajiang, leaving Mr. Xiaoping, stayed on Omiya Island for about a month and a half in May and June of the year following the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, personally experiencing the island's climate and customs shortly after its occupation. Upon hearing that the headquarters had announced that enemy troops had begun landing on the island in two divisions, he recalled his memories as follows:

"So the enemy has finally come? Not to mention our soldiers, I am sure that the resident expatriates are also fighting to the best of their ability!"

Speaking of Akashi Bay, it was where the Japanese army morally landed on December 9th, the day after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. There stands a commemorative stone tablet written by a certain commander at that time, "The Land of the Imperial Army's Landing." There is also a "Battleground" stone tablet in front of the American government building. There were only about thirty expatriate men, all of whom had come to the island thirty years ago. Some had farms, and others ran businesses, achieving considerable success, which was passed on to their descendants. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, they were all imprisoned in jail with resentment. Within a few days, they were liberated due to the Japanese army's arrival. Their joy could not be expressed in words. Having been suppressed for a long time, they now felt fortunate to be Japanese. They rose up and welcomed our soldiers with sincerity. Mr. Shimada was the chairman of the Japanese association, and Mr. Shimizu was also a prominent figure on the island. I once saw an old woman named Sawada, about fifty years old, who forgot sleep and food, rewarding the Japanese army, from serving tea to washing clothes, without being negligent. Now that enemy troops have forcibly landed, these people will surely be unwilling to give up their lives and property and will cooperate with the imperial army. Most of the islanders are of mixed Spanish and indigenous descent, speaking American English, but their temperament is very straightforward. After the imperial army occupied the island, they became very close to the Japanese soldiers, and the children often played in the guardhouse. They also memorized Japanese words and phrases, sincerely wanting to be friendly with the Japanese. These children, who had received American-style education for a long time, also bathed in the imperialization of Japan. When the enemy invades, they will share the same hatred and anger as the Japanese army! (Translated from the July 24th Asahi Shimbun)

### Three-Dimensional Warfare on the Western European Front

German soldiers and war correspondents are returning to Paris from the Western European front in increasing numbers, quickly contacting their work. Reporters have sought to meet with these brave men each time to learn about the front lines. The following is a collection of firsthand reports.

The British and American navies are now using Portsmouth and Southampton as advance bases, controlling the sea within the quadrilateral area from Cherbourg in the west to Le Havre in the east. Their flank defenses consist of the British navy's "Warspite," "Ramillies," and "Nelson" battleships, each of the 30,000-ton class, as well as five or six cruisers such as "Glasgow" and "Orion," and fifteen destroyers, forming a defensive wall. The waters of the text, on the other hand, are occupied by the American fleet, which includes the battleships "Nevada," "Arkansas," and "Texas" of the 30,000-ton class, as well as cruisers and destroyers, with strength roughly equal to the British navy, forming an iron wall on the east and west sides. In the middle, from the British mainland to the currently invaded area's coast, the enemy brazenly floats buoys and builds twelve supply lines, freely transporting ships, which is now the lifeline of the enemy forces advancing in the invasion operation.

The Atlantic Wall is not intended to absolutely prevent enemy invasion, but rather to cover the concentration of friendly forces in the early stages of the operation after the invasion, so as to allow for the deployment of attacks. For this military purpose, the German navy has fulfilled its mission to the fullest extent. The counterattack of the land forces has now reached its tenth stage. The explosion of meteor bombs in the British mainland is the signal for the start of this battle. With the goal of destroying the enemy's supply, the coordinated offensive of the navy must unfold with a tactic that is reversed in time.

The enemy planned to annihilate the German navy, which had no battleships, in three days after the start of the war. To this, Germany responded with a surprise attack tactic of high-speed boats, establishing war results everywhere.

If viewed in terms of naval power, the disparity in strength between Britain and the United States and Germany is enormous, no different from a battle of 30,000 tons against 1,000 tons, that is, a battle of 35-inch guns against 4-inch guns. But the German army fights fiercely, and under these conditions of great disparity, they engage in mutual fire. The German coastal batteries of the Atlantic fortress often engage ten British cruisers in one fortress.

Land Counterattack

The land counterattack has been in a rather difficult situation for the past two weeks because the power of the enemy fleet often dominates the land. The enemy gained experience in the landing operation in Italy, that is, in establishing a bridgehead successfully within the range of naval guns. In the Le Havre area, German tanks were threatened by the enemy when they were two kilometers from the coast and had no choice but to engage in artillery battles with the enemy cruisers, thus falling into a difficult situation. The land forces in northern France responsible for defending the Atlantic fortress have 30-inch shells from warships flying south of Caen and Bayeux, and in fact, large artillery battles cannot be conducted.

But now Germany has invented meteor bombs that fly across the English Channel and strike at the heart of the British mainland. This news has shaken the world. Germany may conduct surprise attacks simultaneously, which is quite noteworthy. According to well-informed sources, in the future, the enemy's new offensive may tend towards the area between the Seine River and the mouth of the Somme River.

Aerial Counterattack

In terms of the air force, German units have launched bombing raids on London again, and good news is frequently reported. The camp of intercepting enemy aircraft and achieving victory is becoming stronger. The reporter often visits the train anti-aircraft gun positions in a certain suburb of Paris. These positions are composed of mobile trains. What is interesting is that they were transformed from a German-owned place in France during the First World War.

Moreover, the speed of anti-aircraft shells has increased by 20% from the start of this war to today. The current speed is said to be three times 300 meters per second, that is, 900 meters per second, while the speed of a fighter is only 600 kilometers per hour, or 160 meters per second. Therefore, German anti-aircraft gun positions have produced a theory of hitting the target every time. (Translated from the June 27th Asahi Shimbun)

### Past and Present of Normandy

The coast of England is a cliff, and northern France also has many cliffs, making it difficult to navigate. Choosing to land on the sandy coast of the Seine Bay may be common sense for strategists, but the side that is targeted will certainly be fully prepared in the sandy area. Therefore, the two sides have launched an unprecedented battle, and its future is still difficult to predict.

Normandy on the 6th is picturesque, with apple blossoms in full bloom. Especially after the gloomy winter has passed, for half a year, the blue sky is clear, and the tender green is clearly reflected in the sunlight, making people drowsy. This beautiful Normandy is now reduced to a battlefield of life and death. The swallows returning from the south, longing for Normandy, do not know where they will rest and nest.

Longing for Normandy,
My birthplace…

This is a world-famous folk song.

The so-called "Normandy" is named after the Normans (Northern Danes) who lived there. Around the tenth century AD, the Normans, along with the Nordic Vikings, went south, launching crazy riots. They then settled down, practiced intermarriage, and Britain and other countries elected the Danish crown prince Knut (chief of the pirates) to the throne, implementing good policies, which was quite famous in history.

In the fourteenth century, the Hundred Years' War began. The King of England, Edward III, in order to conquer France, sent 10,000 archers and 1,000 boats to bravely carry out a landing battle, in 1346. The landing point was in La Hogue (near the present city of Caen). At that time, there was internal strife and turmoil, and the residents of Normandy did not know how to defend themselves, allowing the English army to ravage them. As a result, the English army occupied the Port of Calais. For the next two hundred years, England controlled the two ends of the shortest distance between England and France, securing control of the sea over the Strait of Dover. The tragedy "The Burghers of Calais" originated from this. Rodin's masterpiece "The Burghers of Calais" is located in the present city of Calais, and the feeling of increased hatred has a long history.

After the end of the Hundred Years' War, King Henry V of England followed in the footsteps of his grandfather, attacking with a large army of 30,000 at Harfleur, west of the present Le Havre, at the mouth of the Seine River. The location is the same as this landing battle.

The residents of Normandy have not yet renewed the brave legacy of the Nordic peoples endowed by their ancestors. Most of the residents are engaged in multiple occupations. The people crossing the stormy waves of the North Sea to fish in the deep sea are all Normans. Naval personnel and sailors are also mostly Normans.

The central city of Normandy is Caen. The great playwright Corneille of the 17th century was born here, and the literary giant Flaubert of the 19th century was also born here. It is truly a city that commands the present. Flaubert's masterpiece "Madame Bovary" uses the city as its subject.

Maupassant, who was born in Normandy, loved Normandy, and whose novel subjects were mostly Normandy, is also unforgettable. Born in the Caux region, he chased after the children of peasants and fishermen in the fields as a child, or went boating at sea, happily forgetting to return. When he grew up, he lived in Paris, practiced writing on a floating boat on the Seine River, and became famous by learning from his teacher Flaubert.

### The Third Child

— Zhu Lin

With great difficulty, Ah Jin endured until quitting time. Covered in fluff, she lumbered out of the factory gate with her large belly, mixed in with the large group of female workers.

Fatigue mixed with dizziness and back pain caused her to fall behind her companions, and she happened to bump into Ah Zhao from the coarse yarn section who was vying to get ahead.

"Zhao Di! It's not going to work!" Ah Jin raised her weak hand for help towards Zhao Di.

Ah Zhao supported Ah Jin's hand and slowed her pace.

"Ah Jin, elder sister, I think your time is near. You should rest for a couple of days until the baby is born!"

"I eat for the day I work. What will I eat if I stop?"

"Who told you to be so intimate with Cai Fu?" Zhao Di made a face and pinched Ah Jin's arm.

"You little rascal!" Ah Jin couldn't help but force a smile and scold her lightly.

Ah Jin dragged her heavy belly into the house and slumped onto the three-legged chair that leaned against the wall. She began to feel a sour ache in her waist that shot straight to her lower abdomen.

She tried hard to straighten her back, which seemed to make her feel a little better, but after a while, an even more intense pain came, like waves in the ocean, one wave surging after another.

The pain of childbirth had been tormenting Ah Jin for the third time since she married Cai Fu. Ah Jin could endure suffering a bit for childbirth, but she hated her husband's heartlessness. Cai Fu had never agreed to let her keep the little child she carried in her womb. Cai Fu always said, "I can't even take care of myself. Don't let another little wretch live to suffer too!" So the first two were thrown away in a piece of tattered cloth next to some trash can as soon as they were born, before Ah Jin could even tell if they were boys or girls. Thinking of this, Ah Jin felt that she was enduring this pain in vain.

She clenched her teeth and said voicelessly, "This time, I must keep it."

In the dim twilight, Cai Fu also returned from the machine factory carrying a lunch box. He understood what was happening when he saw his wife lying on the bed.

"Is it soon?"

"Does it hurt badly?" It was such a trembling low voice.

"Let me go get the old woman!" (The old woman was a traditional midwife)

"No, wait a bit."

Ah Jin opened her eyes and looked at her husband's face, which had long lost its smile. She really couldn't bring herself to say that she wanted to keep the child. An even more intense, gut-wrenching pain struck again.

"Aiyo!" Ah Jin screamed miserably and straightened her back with effort.

Cai Fu looked at his wife, who was suffering in agony, and couldn't help but feel pity. He sat down next to her on the hard wooden bed and stroked Ah Jin's disheveled hair.

"Jin Di, let me go get the old woman?"

"No, Cai Fu! Are you willing?"

"Don't dream!" Cai Fu remained silent for a long while before saying coldly, "Just blame them for being born into the wrong family. Poor people can't afford to raise children."

"Do a good deed! Just let me keep this one. I won't have any more children next time."

"What will we feed him? I haven't become rich. I'm a copper worker (i.e., a machine worker). Be clear about that."

These heartless words sounded extremely cruel to Ah Jin. As for Cai Fu himself? He also felt that it was too unfair to Ah Jin to throw away her child for the third time. The first time was a baby girl, and he casually threw her away. The second time was a baby boy, fair and plump, and even he felt a bit reluctant when he threw him at the alley entrance. Perhaps it was because Cai Fu was already thirty years old this year. Shouldn't a thirty-year-old have a little toy to keep him company? And so, the small face of a child appeared before him, a pair of small, black, round eyes, red and wide cheeks...

A faint sense of emptiness swept across his heart.

But his wife's cries reminded him. Cai Fu raised his hands to support his head and caught sight of the pale thigh exposed through the hole in Ah Jin's torn pants. This made him think that life was like enduring the tight sting of a whip. The two of them had to work more than twelve hours a day just to barely fill their stomachs. How could they possibly afford to keep a child? Moreover, if they kept the child, could Ah Jin still go to the yarn factory to work? Even if someone said that they could sneak the child in for a bit of money, an extra mouth meant extra expenses. Besides, they couldn't raise the child naked.

"Oh dear!" Ah Jin was struggling again, straightening her back. Cai Fu looked at his wife, who was writhing in a heap, sighed, and went out.

While Ah Jin's stomach pain turned from shouting to moaning, and from moaning to shouting, only able to use all her life's strength to twist the tattered cotton quilt, Cai Fu finally brought back Mother Zhou.

Mother Zhou placed a bundle of bitter herbs on the table and reached out to feel Ah Jin's belly, only muttering, "It's coming soon."

"Hasn't the water been heated yet? Hurry!" Mother Zhou ordered.

Cai Fu blankly lit the fire in the mud stove.

After three hours, the child was born. Ah Jin finally saw a blood-red, plump baby boy, but she was too tired and could only half-open her eyes to watch Mother Zhou clean up the baby.

"Quick, boil bitter herb water for her to drink," Mother Zhou said to Cai Fu with a nod.

But Cai Fu ignored her at first and pulled out a pair of tattered pants from under the bed.

"Cai Fu!" Ah Jin struggled to call out to her husband, but it seemed she didn't even have the strength to speak. Helpless, she turned her head away, her face half-pale and weary, her chest rising and falling rapidly, replacing her protest.

"Have pity on me!" Like a faint thread of a voice, "I've already lost two. Can you bear to lose a third? It's a boy!"

Cai Fu was stirred by this soft murmur, as if he was moved. But when he caught sight of Mother Zhou's face, waiting for the delivery fee, he quickly squatted down to move the little life as if making a huge decision. Originally, he hadn't even thought about where he should get the delivery fee for Mother Zhou.

"You..." Ah Jin barely managed to lift herself up to stop him, but she didn't even have the strength to move.

"You... so... cruel..." She collapsed wearily, only slightly raising her head.

Cai Fu ignored her. He hurriedly wrapped the bloody flesh and went out.

Ah Jin wanted to cry, but she felt that she couldn't shed tears. It was as if thousands of needles were piercing her chest, tightening her heart.

"Living is just suffering."

She deeply tasted this.

### The Old Drunkard

— Ling Zuren

"A universe in his sleeve, sun and moon in his bottle!"

"Fan guan,... Fan guan,... words really violate guan, clan becomes... ascends the stage... vomits violating guan, wait to hear me... white tongue connects root... speaks a..."

When Old Zhang approached us humming that little tune of the Ningbo olive seller that we were already tired of hearing, we knew that he had filled up on old wine again today!

If, on any day, that little tune didn't come out of his mouth, then we all had to be careful, because at this time Old Zhang was often very likely to find something to vent his anger on!

But: he didn't necessarily lose his temper when he hadn't had enough old wine, but even when he had filled up on old wine and the little tune of the Ningbo olive seller was getting old, he could still lose his temper!

Because: we couldn't predict when he would lose his temper, so we all had to be careful - not to provoke him and get a punch.

Old Zhang, filled with yellow soup, was very brave! He feared neither heaven nor earth. If he had a knife, he would definitely kill someone. Therefore, whatever engineers or staff in the factory... had to stay away from him.

I remember when the foreign soldiers hadn't left Shanghai yet, one day he mistook a foreign soldier for an acquaintance after drinking, and went to tell him a lot of drunken words. As a result, that "foreign soldier" rewarded him with a few kicks of "foreign ham," but Old Zhang also "refused to show weakness" and respectfully returned his fist that was like a wine bowl. And so he had a big fight with that "foreign soldier." In the chaotic ending, the "foreign soldier" broke his high nose, bleeding all over his face, and was injured. Old Zhang was also confined to bed for a few days.

When Old Zhang didn't lose his temper, he was quite amiable! He smiled and was very polite to everyone. He often affectionately ran to my side, patted me on the shoulder and said, "Young brother, sigh! When are you going to invite me to your wedding banquet?" He always made me blush, and then he ran away with a loud laugh!

Old Zhang was almost fifty years old, but he was in good spirits! He even added a little boy last year! I remember I once teased him:

"Hey! Old Zhang! People get old and lose interest! You're still raising children in your old age!"

He shook his head and said, "Mmm: there's no way to avoid it!" Six little monkeys are really going to gnaw my old bones clean."

Indeed, the weight of Old Zhang's family's "life burden" was really not light! Therefore, life controlled his hands and feet, keeping them going non-stop. When there was work in the factory, he would go to the factory to work. When there was no work, he would secretly run to the rivers around Shanghai to cast nets and fish, earning some money to make ends meet. Otherwise, he would go to saw firewood for people, earning a dou of rice money... In short, he would do anything as long as he could earn money!

His hands, feet, and strength were his "three great treasures" for survival, but in addition, an "old wine bottle" was also his inseparable treasure. If Old Zhang lacked it, then he would definitely not have the strength to earn a living. Therefore, Old Zhang regarded it as his "tool for eating."

Truly, "a universe in his sleeve, sun and moon in his bottle." So we all called him "Old Drunkard," and he accepted it with a smile and without complaint!

"Fan guan,... Fan guan,... words really violate guan, clan becomes... ascends the stage... vomits violating guan, wait to hear me... white tongue connects root... speaks a..."

The "Old Drunkard"'s little tune of the Ningbo olive seller is ringing out again, so he has filled up on old wine again today: we have to be careful again!

Don't provoke him!

### A Chapter of Floating Life

— Hu Shengquan

Perhaps life was too boring, so a few days ago Jin and I agreed to go see the prison, to see how people isolated in another world were spending their days. The next day, he called to inform me, asking me to go with him on Saturday. Suddenly, I thought of a poet who felt empty despite having a full life, and wrote him a letter, asking him if he wanted to "inspect" the prison? Not long after the letter was sent, he ran to my house breathlessly.

"Wouldn't it be better to visit on our ancestral home day?"

I couldn't give him a definite answer. I wore a smile on my lips: dear friend, do you know how insignificant I am, what can I decide for myself?

The poet was sensitive, and he sighed. He said that he had recently joined a publishing house and was embarrassed to ask for leave on his first few days. Although he wanted to go, but... He was one of the more "content" ones among my friends. Even content people have their own hardships!

But being discontented is even worse. I have a pair of friends, one who has made money in business and wants to be a noble "cultural person"; the other who has made money writing textbooks and wants to be a shrewd merchant. Ideals are always beautiful, so they feel very painful both spiritually and materially. Why bother? Living in this world, everything can only be so-so. If, in sleepless nights, one accidentally becomes serious, it is truly doubtful: living like this, are we still "people"?

○○○○○○○○○

At two o'clock in the afternoon, Jin arrived, wearing a well-tailored suit. He warned me: one, don't talk to the prisoners; two, dress decently. The first point was difficult for me, as I originally only wanted to put on a Hong Kong shirt over my shorts and undershirt. But what to do about not being decent? So I temporarily found a suit. Jin looked at me sweating as I put on suspenders and tied a tie, acting like an older brother and feeling a little sorry for me:

"You're not getting dressed, you're suffering!"

I looked at him, wiping sweat with a handkerchief and waving a palm fan, blowing the tie back and forth. May I ask: am I suffering, what are you then --?

Walking through the double iron gates, the police standing by the door all stood at attention to us, which made me very proud. Which police officer would look at us ordinary people, only they saluted us. Later, I realized: I was probably taking advantage of someone else's influence. If we weren't "honored guests" of the warden, the police's leather shoes would probably have already honored my body. Not to mention anything else, don't the gatekeepers of several newspaper offices often roll their eyes at me?

Following a "head", we saw the workshops, the hospital, and the men's prison. On the way back, we encountered a "sir" from the women's prison. He said very enthusiastically:

"Are you all going to see the women's prison?"

So we re-entered again.

The warden's wife once told me: Jewish and Russian women in the women's prison wearing Chinese prisoners' clothes were "particularly charming." I had no intention of appreciating any "special charm," but since we were already here, we took a look. The prison was always gloomy, and I didn't come out of the men's prison in the best mood.

In the corridor, a large group of prisoners was gathered, and an old lady with a flushed face was gesticulating and lecturing them. At first, I thought it was some kind of spiritual speech, but according to the "sir," she was teaching "the teachings of Jesus."

We walked to the second-floor prison cells. The "head" told us:

"Female prisoners are treated better, two people to a cell, and they have beds to sleep on."

This was true. But in several cells, the beds were propped up against the wall. I looked at the "sirs" with questioning eyes. One of them explained to me:

"It's hot these days, there are bedbugs, so it's better to sleep on the cement floor..."

○○○○○○○○○

○○○○○○○○○

For the sake of "economy," we were roasted by the sun again at the tram station, sweating all over. On the tram, Jin asked me: do you have any thoughts? I shook my head. I remember a classmate who studied law once said to me: law is beautiful. I doubt how these "beautiful" two characters are explained? Opium poppies are beautiful, venomous snakes are beautiful, is the law the same "beautiful" as them? I sighed.

I said "goodbye" to Jin and jumped off the tram, squeezing through the crowd. Carelessly, someone stepped heavily on my white leather shoes. This was the loss of being decent, I lamented the forty dollars, and I had to wipe them again tomorrow. Suddenly, I stopped on the street, looking at the passersby hurrying past me:

-- Why learn from busy people, isn't it good to walk slowly, today I finally took a few rides, wouldn't I be bored at home again tomorrow? Why hurry, and let people step on my white shoes!

I curled up the corners of my mouth, smiling sadly to myself.

### The Madness of the End of the Century

— Yu Ruowen

Money,

How almighty money is!

Everything can be bought with money:

Status, reputation, love

So:

Merchants speculate,

Officials are corrupt,

Thieves act violently,

Small-timers take shortcuts,

All for money!

However,

Money,

What is so precious about money?

Ten thousand today, eight thousand tomorrow, penniless the day after!

But:

People are lining up outside the gold-paved door,

People inside the restaurant are burping,

People are wrestling in the dance hall pool,

People are fighting upstairs in the nightclub,

All to spend money!

Ah:

Is this the madness of the end of the century,

Or the mad end of the century?

### Flying Insects

— Bao Zhongqi

There is a lamp in the room.

Countless flying insects are flying around.

They make buzzing sounds

I don't know if it's a joyful cheer or an exhausted cry.

Finally, they rush towards the lamplight,

Scorching their heads; hurting their wings,

And burning their bodies

One by one they fall to the ground.

The flying insects outside the window still surge forward, buzzing!

People laugh at their foolishness,

Don't laugh!

You yourself are also a flying insect in society! (Reward for moving and helping education)

### Volleyball League, Women's Group Achievements Outstanding, Men's Techniques Should Seek Improvement

This year's volleyball league, the women's group A has completely ended this week, declaring the completion of meritorious deeds. Observing this year's performance, there is little progress on the men's group side. On the women's group side, there are indeed extremely significant outstanding achievements, so let's talk about Yuehua first, and also be happy to introduce the Green Team. It is precisely because the level of women's volleyball can be improved that the interest in women's sports is aroused.

Men's Champion Yuehua

The Yuehua team members are all Cantonese athletes, led by Xiao Xigeng. This time they rose exceptionally, winning three out of three games and winning the championship. Judging from their performance, it has not reached its peak. The front row locking net and the second row saving balls seem to have loopholes. However, the team members' fighting spirit is extremely exciting, so with the consensus of the people, they repeatedly defeated strong enemies. Their record is as follows:

Won Huaying Three—One

Won Russian B Three—〇

Won White Team Three—One

Also, the team's second win against Russian A was the most proud. However, Russian A has forfeited twice in a row since then, so it is not listed.

Women's Champion Green Team

After winning the basketball and one-goal championships, the Green Team, in the volleyball league, also defeated the three-province, Huayan teams this week, dominating the volleyball world, creating a championship in women's ball games this year. It is truly worthy of our admiration. Observing this year's Green Team performance, the level has indeed improved a lot. After the war, the level of Shanghai women's volleyball has been declining. Every game only has the ability to pass the net. Killing the ball, spiking, and hitting the hanging ball, falling to save the ball, blocking the net, etc., are rarely noticed, and the Green Team has achievements in all these aspects. Winning the championship is by no means accidental. The team's record and comments on the team's various aspects are recorded below:

Won Zhiqian Two—One

Won Three Provinces Two—One

Won Huayan Two—〇

Also, the team's first game was a two-to-zero victory over West Qinghong, now West Qing has forfeited twice, and the children are canceled, so it is not included.

Accelerate Training to Overcome People

According to the Green Team, there was no organization for volleyball. This time, the motive was purely to love sports, so a hasty army was formed, and it has been less than three months since the formation. However, after the formation of the army, it was immediately stipulated that every two, four, and six, practice at the Youth Friendship Association, and each time all team members are able to go regardless of the distance or stomach heat, and the coach Qian Xucang is talented and versatile, using wisdom to train. The management Xie Yiqin is enthusiastic and plans from it, and the White Team members also learn from each other. As a result, the Green Team's volleyball skills have improved by leaps and bounds, and they have achieved such excellent results.

Average Talent, Offensive and Defensive Routes

The team's talent can be said to be extremely average. Regardless of the front row, second row, or third row, there is no outstanding material, but they can all play their due role in their respective positions and exert their full potential. The main features are Wang Yin Huang Yaofen Huang Mingyuan. In terms of saving the ball, Wang Weizhen and Xiang Yulin are the most successful. In terms of tactics, both offense and defense can be changed and surprising, which is the key to victory

Stay Calm in the Face of Strong Enemies

Several teams that joined this time all have history. Such as the Three Provinces Huayan, the organization has been around for a long time, and there has been a lot of training. Zhi Qian gathers new famous generals and pulls together veteran lineups, and the lineup is prosperous. The Green Team is an emerging team, dealing with it. In the battle with the Zhiqian Three Provinces Two Teams, they both lost a game first. However, the Green Team members are extremely calm and fight calmly. The ability to turn the tide and eventually win, this kind of patience should be imitated by other team members.

Continue to Work Hard, Unlimited Future

The Green Team volleyball has won the championship. Based on their current performance, if they work harder, their position in women's volleyball will be unlimited. What needs to be improved and paid attention to, I think there are still gaps in keeping time, the position is not the most ideal, and the serve has not yet reached the stage of entering the room, and the skill of the front row locking net seems to be immature. If these three points can be improved, then the Green Team's volleyball will not only dominate Shanghai.

Finally, introduce the personal skills of the Green Team's most successful female heroes:

Xiang Yulin - Xiang lives in the third row, without the opportunity to score points, so she is not noticed. In fact, Xiang's standing position is good, she can save dangerous balls, and the balls she saves are sent to the most appropriate position, which is definitely not comparable to other candidates. Therefore, I think Xiang should be the first hero, and also one of the most successful members of the Taiji.

Huang Xingfen - Using the old half style, she applied her rich performance, either as a kill, or with a hanging corner, as she pleased. The ball has not come, the phenomenon of the party has been afraid of the heart, it is indeed worthy of the name.

Wang Weizhen - Wang is the most ideal general in the second row of Shanghai women's volleyball team. She does not avoid falling, and her body is exquisite. In terms of saving the ball, this is not enough to succeed.

Wang Yinlan - Born in the central part of the front row, it is very convenient to use her jumping height in terms of spikes. What is more commendable is that Wang is extremely willing to use her brains. Her way of killing the enemy is always changing, and the other party is unpredictable, so she can only sigh at the ball.

Huang Mingyuan - Huang tried knocking in this session for the first time, and she succeeded in one fell swoop. In addition to her original ability to save the ball, she can be called a full talent who can attack and defend.

Other newcomers Cheng Ran Liu Zhen Yan Zhi, etc., also have unexpected results. Given time, they will definitely be able to create a device.

### The Panda Team Battles the Portuguese Merchants' Red Team: A Decisive Baseball Duel This Morning

Since the Panda team of our Chinese compatriots joined the Shanghai Open Baseball League, they have won every battle. Chinese and foreigners alike generally believe that the team has a good chance of winning the championship. Today (the 13th) at 10:45 AM, the Pandas will be facing a major enemy at the Jiaozhou Park, the reigning champion "Lusitanos" Red team. If the Pandas can defeat them, then this championship, which has been dominated by Westerners, will be won by our Chinese. Before the game today, the reporter reviewed the rosters and strengths of the two teams, offering my humble opinion as follows:

Strength of the Portuguese Team

First, let's talk about the Portuguese team. Their pitcher, Tombutter, is an X·M·H·A· radio announcer, and he is extremely fat. However, the pitches he throws are unmatched in all of Shanghai. His speed makes it difficult for batters to swing. Many fans know the players on the team, and they are all members of the Portuguese League football team. Such as first baseman Gaines, third baseman G. Su Ruo, shortstop Oliver, right fielder V. Su Ruo, and catcher Peterson. Whether catching or throwing, they are fast and agile. What is most frightening is that the Pandas will not escape the lightning-fast catching and throwing of the third baseman and shortstop. Therefore, it is best for the Chinese team to hit the ball between first and second base when attacking, because the second baseman is not very skilled. If they can hit low and fast balls, they are guaranteed to get on base. At the same time, it is also very suitable to hit the ball along the pitcher's central line, because the pitcher is a fat man, and it is feared that he will not be agile enough and will be easily put on base. But it is easier said than done, I dare not believe that the Chinese team can hit the pitcher's ball as they wish. At the same time, the Chinese team must avoid stealing bases lightly, because catcher Peterson catches so well and throws so quickly that runners are often killed as a result, which would be a pity. The Chinese team should seize every opportunity, because it is not easy to get on base. If they can run bases carefully, they will have a greater chance of winning for every point they score. In addition, they must avoid hitting high balls, because the opposing team's outfielders are all good at catching them. Therefore, if the balls thrown by the Chinese team are not easy to lift, they should make more use of short bumps, preferably "bumping a ball to the left of the pitcher's hand or along the line," which will give them hope of getting on base. There is also one point: the Chinese team should carefully arrange the batting order. The weakness of the Pandas is that their hitting is slightly worse; only four or five players on the team are good hitters. Therefore, in the first five and last five players, those who are good hitters should be placed in odd-numbered positions to average out the strengths and weaknesses.

Panda Team Lineup

As for the lineup of the Chinese Panda team, the infielders are all famous players who have studied in Japan, and they are unusually tight. Especially shortstop Liang Yousheng, third baseman Wen Ruixiong, and second baseman Wen Tianhua, all throw like arrows. As for the catchers, there are two: Huang Yingrui and Wang Xiushan, both of whom catch the ball like glue. The former is experienced, but his hand is recently injured, and he may not be able to perform as well as he wishes. The latter, Mr. Wang, is young and bold, and in addition to catching Zheng's unpredictable pitches, he is a heavy batter among the hitters. Therefore, if Mr. Huang is the catcher, it may be a good idea to move Mr. Wang to the outfield, so that the Chinese team has one more hitter and a better chance of getting on base and scoring points. Moreover, if Mr. Wang can be a catcher, he will definitely be able to handle the outfield. In addition, the most important thing for the Chinese team to pay attention to when defending is that if there is a double play opportunity after each baseman catches the ball, they should throw it out quickly, and avoid hesitating. Because winning a baseball game depends on speed. Moreover, the opposing team are all good at attacking, and they often steal bases recklessly and hit well, so each outfielder should pay attention at all times. The slightest slackness will inevitably lead to the loss of points.

Finally, please note: The Panda's game schedule previously published in this newspaper has been completely rescheduled by the organizers. As soon as it is arranged, it will be disclosed immediately.
