### Preface to the Translated Version of "The Indispensable Book for a Victorious Nation"

— Chen Binhe

My ally Japan's elder statesman and prominent figure in public opinion, Mr. Tokutomi Sohō, recently authored "The Indispensable Book for a Victorious Nation," divided into three sections: The Necessity of Victory; The Foundation of Victory; The Strategies for Victory.

Looking at the overall purpose of Mr. Tokutomi's book, it lies in arousing the Japanese people to firmly believe in victory and strive for the final triumph. At this crucial juncture when the Greater East Asia War faces a decisive stage, a matter of life and death, the publication of this book is not only timely but also essential reading for everyone.

Although the intended audience of this book is the Japanese people, our current national situation in China and the need for our citizens to maintain a firm belief in victory are just as important as they are for the Japanese. In other words, we are now a member of the participating nations, and our survival depends on victory, while defeat means destruction. Sharing the same fate as our allies, we have reasons why we absolutely must win for the sake of national survival. Indeed, victory is essential, but it cannot be achieved through complacency and procrastination. Here, Mr. Tokutomi presents the strategies for victory, which are the pathways to achieving it. These strategies can also serve as a reference and model for our government and the public. Therefore, we are translating and publishing this book into Chinese with the sole purpose of arousing a firm belief in victory among all. Only when the citizens of all participating nations in the Greater East Asia War jointly hold a firm belief in victory and implement strategies for victory can we achieve the goal of victory.

We often say, "A firm belief is the mother of all success." An ancient proverb also says, "Where there's a will, there's a way." "Having a will" means "having a firm belief." If one's own belief is still wavering and cannot be firmly established, then before the enemy's attack or the pressure of the environment, one will have already lost one's footing, revealing weaknesses and inviting failure. Therefore, at this critical juncture, we cannot emphasize the importance of a firm belief in victory enough.

In the first section of the third part of this book, it says, "The attainment of victory begins with the conviction of victory. Without a belief in victory, achieving it is probably impossible in the world… A belief in victory is the determination to fight for victory at all costs, without surrendering, no matter what great enemy one faces, what difficulties one encounters, or what blows one suffers. It is this kind of belief." This clearly explains what constitutes a belief in victory. However, possessing a belief in victory still requires unwavering and enduring commitment.

This section also states, "During World War I, France was under extreme pressure and nearly signed a treaty of surrender with Germany. French morale was low, and mutinies frequently occurred in the army. However, due to the belief in victory, the colors were clear, the name was just, and the spirit was revived, ultimately achieving victory. This victory was entirely due to the belief in victory held by Clemenceau and Foch, which is by no means an exaggeration. This means that the belief of a single Prime Minister is the belief of the entire nation. The belief of a single Commander-in-Chief is the belief of the entire army. This is crucial in the belief in victory of the entire nation. Therefore, the first condition for us to defeat the Anglo-Americans is that we Japanese must have the belief in defeating the enemy."

"The belief of a single Prime Minister is the belief of the entire nation. The belief of a single Commander-in-Chief is the belief of the entire army." We believe this observation is correct in principle. Last April 22nd, the editorial board of Shen Bao published an article titled "Purging Defeatists in the Peaceful Areas," stating: "Currently, within the peaceful areas, the general public, especially party and government officials, lack a firm belief in peace. Judging from the behavior of a few politicians, they still do not understand the true meaning of peace, let alone have any belief in it. They see the present situation as a transitional phase, a temporary state, and thus seize opportunities to profit from the chaos. These Chinese, although not leaders, occupy important positions in various institutions, using their positions as cover to act foolishly and blindly for profit. They speak of serving the people and the country, but their actual behavior is the opposite. As a result, the feelings of the majority of the people have a backlash effect. Therefore, in order for the National Government to gain the firm belief of the vast majority of the people in peace, it is necessary to purge or sanction these defeatists or wavering elements." In the context of our Chinese situation, even if a few leaders have a belief in victory, if the majority of party and government officials do not have a belief or their belief is not firm enough, then it cannot be said, as Mr. Tokutomi does, that "the belief of a single Prime Minister is the belief of the entire nation." We should say, "Only when party and government leaders and staff firmly believe in victory can they influence the entire nation to firmly believe in victory." For example, if party and government staff can work diligently and impartially, putting politics on the right track, controlling the economy effectively, and stabilizing people's livelihoods to a certain extent, that is a strategy for victory. With the implementation of such strategies for victory, the entire nation will naturally share a firm belief and achieve the goal of victory.

Furthermore, recently, due to the evolution of the European situation, the fluctuations in public opinion have inevitably shaken beliefs. In fact, the more critical the juncture, the more turbulent the times, the more we must grasp the belief in victory and remain steadfast. An ancient proverb says, "Strong winds reveal sturdy grass, turbulent times reveal loyal ministers." At this juncture where the firmness of belief is being tested, the publication of the translated version of Mr. Tokutomi's book is even more timely.

### Japanese Prime Minister's Policy Speech Explains Various Decisive Strategies, Will Recognize the Independence of the East Indies Peoples

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The opening ceremony of the 85th Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet was held solemnly on the 7th at the Diet building, graced by the presence of His Majesty the Emperor of Japan. At 11:00 AM, amidst the escort of Fujita, Military Aide-de-Camp, His Majesty the Emperor arrived at the House of Peers, and after the officials paid their respects, Prime Minister Koiso presented the Imperial Speech. His Majesty immediately bestowed gracious words, and Deputy Speaker Sasaki respectfully accepted the Imperial Speech and withdrew. Thus, the opening ceremony concluded. At 11:15 AM, His Majesty returned to the Imperial Palace amidst the respectful farewell of the officials. The Imperial Speech bestowed by His Majesty the Emperor of Japan was as follows: "I hereby address the members of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives at this Imperial Diet. Our soldiers on the expeditionary front are fighting bravely and fiercely, defeating powerful enemies everywhere and displaying our might. The construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is progressing rapidly, and our alliances with friendly nations are becoming stronger. This is what I always rejoice in. However, the enemy's resistance is becoming increasingly fierce, and the war situation is becoming more perilous. The time has come for the Empire to mobilize its total strength to achieve victory. Today, you should first rouse public anger and strengthen solidarity, resolutely shatter the enemy's wild ambitions, and secure the nation's destiny for eternity. I have instructed the Ministers of State to submit urgent bills related to the current situation to the Imperial Diet. You should understand my intentions, discuss harmoniously, and fulfill your duty of cooperation."

### Plenary Sessions of Both Houses

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The 85th Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet held its opening ceremony on the 7th, receiving the gracious Imperial Speech. On this occasion of decisive victory, both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives resolutely rose up. The House of Representatives first held a plenary session at 11:30 AM, deciding on the drafting committee for the response to the Imperial Speech. A plenary session was held in the afternoon. Meanwhile, the House of Peers also convened a plenary session at 1:30 PM, resolving on the response to the Imperial Speech and electing Duke Tokugawa Kuniyuki as the temporary speaker, determining the chairmen of all committees and standing committees. Subsequently, Prime Minister Koiso delivered a speech amidst an atmosphere of tension and solemnity, clarifying general policy guidelines, expressing the Empire's belief in victory, and, based on the highest war guidance policies, demonstrating the grave determination to gather the total national strength for decisive battles. At the same time, in accordance with this intention, the Koiso Cabinet concretely announced its aspirations and internal and external strategies for dealing with the decisive battles. After the Prime Minister's policy speech, Minister Araki and Minister Yonai reported on the war situation. In their reports and speeches, they resolutely stated that the day of defeating the enemy was not far off. Thereupon, the Diet presented a resolution of gratitude and condolences to the soldiers, which was unanimously approved by the assembly. At this time, Viscount Okouchi Masatoshi rose to question the Prime Minister regarding the enhancement of military production and air raid countermeasures, which Prime Minister Koiso and the relevant ministers answered before the session adjourned. During the recess, the House of Representatives, after the House of Peers adjourned, held three more plenary sessions, in which, like the House of Peers, Prime Minister Koiso delivered a policy speech and the Ministers of the Army and Navy reported on the war situation. Simultaneously, a resolution of gratitude and condolences to the Imperial Army and Navy soldiers was presented and unanimously passed. Thus, the first day's agenda of the Extraordinary Session came to an end.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Koiso delivered a policy speech on the 7th during the 85th Diet session, the gist of which is as follows: Japan has now reached a critical juncture of prosperity or decline. Under the protection of the spirits of our ancestors, maintaining the unparalleled national polity of the Japanese Empire and promoting its glorious and enduring history depend on this day. I, along with a trillion compatriots, share a firm belief in victory, unite as one, gather our total strength, and cooperate with the brave soldiers on the front lines, managing state affairs in order to achieve the complete accomplishment of the war's objectives. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War, as stated in the Declaration of War, is Japan's self-preservation and self-defense, an unavoidable uprising. At the same time, it has the great goal of revitalizing Greater East Asia. It is not only a battle for the survival of the Yamato race but also a decisive battle determining the fate of a billion people in Asia. Now that the war situation is critical, the Empire's prosperity or decline truly hinges on this day. To overcome this critical situation, the management of state affairs must be completely aligned with the objectives of the Greater East Asia War, in order to achieve harmony between military and civilian affairs, close coordination between command and state affairs, and ensure that war guidance is strong and without regrets. This is why the Supreme War Guidance Council was established. From now on, this council will manage state affairs, comprehensively coordinate command and state affairs, and determine fundamental policies. Therefore, all policies are based on this.

### Six Strategies

The first strategy for the current war situation is to elevate morale and establish a national victory system. Elevating morale begins with thoroughly invigorating the concept of the national polity, overcoming all difficulties, and upholding the unparalleled national polity. This strong determination is the source of the belief in victory. The solidified concept of the national polity is the greatest combat power, supporting the eternal destiny of the nation. It is the enduring belief of a trillion compatriots for thousands of years. This great spirit gives rise to a pure national spirit, externally crushing the enemy's scheming, and internally eliminating selfishness and serving the public, completing the rock-solid system within the country. The second important strategy is to increase combat power. All efforts to strengthen combat power should be pursued with the full strength of the nation. Among these, the most important is the rapid increase of air power, relying on this to grasp the initiative in the war situation and favorably unfold the urgent decisive battles. As for all other facilities and industrial activities that cannot effectively contribute to the upcoming decisive battles, they should be stopped in order to shift towards key industries. These measures are being implemented gradually. The third important strategy is to increase food production and stabilize national life. Maintaining the minimum living standards of the people during wartime is an urgent task. A trillion compatriots have endured considerable hardship and maintained composure, continuing to advance on the path to victory. This is due to the soundness and excellence of the national character, which is truly commendable.

### National Mobilization

The fourth important strategy is labor and national mobilization. At this critical juncture, no one, young or old, male or female, throughout the country should be idle. A trillion citizens should each be in their respective workplaces, dedicating their energy to fulfilling their respective missions, doing their utmost, and awaiting divine assistance. The government will constantly review the conscription system and the allocation and management of labor, striving for balance and improvement. At the same time, it plans all possible measures to thoroughly mobilize the nation's labor force. The fifth important strategy is to strengthen the defense of the homeland. Previously, when enemy aircraft attacked the western part of our homeland several times, officials and citizens alike were able to defend bravely, minimizing damage, which is something to be proud of. In the future, no matter how enemy aircraft attack, officials and citizens should continue to engage in homeland defense with ardent fighting spirit. The sixth important strategy is to use science and technology for mobilization. Modern warfare is almost entirely scientific warfare. The government strives to unify and utilize the scientific and technological capabilities of the Army and Navy, and to quickly transform Japan's science and technology into combat power, rapidly producing a large quantity of decisive battle weapons. In addition to establishing special organizations, it also encourages private individuals to invent new weapons. In this way, all the technologies of our Japanese compatriots can be used for the war, and its effects are worth anticipating.

### Wartime Diplomacy

Finally, corresponding to domestic policies is the Empire's wartime diplomacy, which further strengthens ties with our ally Germany. We further hope that friendly nations in Greater East Asia will cooperate as one and exert their total strength to carry out the war. At the same time, we maintain friendly relations with neutral countries. Our ally Germany, amidst extreme difficulties due to changing circumstances, is still confident of ultimate victory and continues to fight bravely, which is commendable. Being able to exert its potential in difficult situations, we believe that the war situation will soon enter a favorable position. We remotely pray for its ultimate success. The nations and peoples of Greater East Asia remain unmoved in the current situation. Furthermore, amidst the evolution of this situation, they pledge to revive East Asia and form a unified entity with the Empire, strengthening the war system, which is something to be proud of. Thailand has previously reorganized its cabinet, but the new cabinet of Prime Minister Apaiwong, based on the alliance, adheres to the policy of jointly carrying out the war, which is evidence of the consolidated unity of Greater East Asia. The independence of Burma has already reached its first anniversary. Under the enthusiastic guidance of State Representative Ba Maw, overcoming many difficulties in the country, its development and determination to complete the war are very strong. The independence of the Philippines is also approaching its first year. Under the effective guidance of President Laurel, food and security under wartime conditions are on the right track, and it is actively preparing its war system, making it a powerful ally.

### East Asian Solidarity

President Chandra Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India and others are fighting for the independence of India with admirable enthusiasm. The Imperial authorities will continue to provide strong assistance to achieve their goal of independence. Regarding the East Indies, the Empire, based on the long-cherished wishes of the indigenous people, especially their participation in political affairs, has made it clear that the residents of various regions understand the true intentions of the Empire. In order to complete the Greater East Asia War, we will consistently continue our efforts. Their cooperation with the current military administration is extraordinarily evident. Therefore, in order to ensure the eternal welfare of the East Indies people, we hereby declare that we will recognize their independence in the future. The Empire's policies towards various regions of Greater East Asia will remain unchanged in the future. Therefore, we will further promote the spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration to meet the trust of the various nations and peoples of Greater East Asia. In this way, Greater East Asia, with the Empire as its core, will be firmly united under a firm belief in victory, gathering all its strength to advance towards the holy war for the revival of Greater East Asia, and we firmly believe that the eternal ideals of the immortal Empire will be manifested in the distant future.

### Army Minister Reports on the War Situation

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - Army Minister Sugiyama, on the 7th, reported the following gist of the war situation at the Extraordinary Diet session:

In the Central and Southern Pacific areas, the Japanese garrisons on New Britain and Bougainville Island inflicted heavy blows on the enemy. Bougainville and other key locations remain in our hands. However, it is deeply regrettable that the Japanese forces on Saipan Island, despite fighting bravely, were eventually occupied by American forces. The Japanese Army and Navy units on Guam and Tinian Island are now united as one, bravely fighting in difficult circumstances, and their morale remains extremely high in this fierce battle. According to American statements, the damage inflicted on the enemy on Saipan, Guam, and Tinian Island has reached over 30,000 troops. In the New Guinea area, since July, the Japanese forces have fiercely attacked the enemy near Aitape, inflicting heavy casualties. Under the cover of a powerful mobile fleet, American forces are gradually invading Hollandia, Sarmi, and the Biak area. Japanese Army units and Army and Navy air forces are now cooperating with each other in fierce fighting. Near Sarmi, the enemy was once repelled. On the coast of Biak, a small force inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. The enemy is still gradually increasing its forces. Conversely, the Japanese forces are overcoming all difficulties and bravely launching repeated attacks against the enemy.

In the Burma area, in February of this year, the invading Yu forces in the Yoma Hills were annihilated. Subsequently, a preemptive strike was launched, attacking Imphal and Kohima. In April, Kohima and Bishnupur were captured. After that, fierce battles were fought with the Yu forces in the Kohima and Imphal areas. The Yu forces suffered approximately 30,000 casualties. About 100 large guns were captured and destroyed. At the same time, the enemy suffered a major strategic blow. After achieving such a huge victory, the forces in that area are now returning to their original defenses. Also, the enemy has landed airborne units near the Cassar and the Tagon Valley, and the Yu forces' 5th Division, equipped with American equipment, and the other 15th Division of the Yu forces on the Nujiang Front have successively invaded the Japanese positions. The Japanese forces on the Nujiang Front fought bravely with a small force, using key locations as bases, launching repeated counterattacks. As a result, the airborne units that invaded Cassar have been severely battered. The Japanese forces have repeatedly attacked the Yu forces that invaded from the Fugong Front, inflicting heavy damage. Currently, the Japanese forces are preparing for the next operation on the southern, eastern, and western lines of Myitkyina. Since the end of last year, the damage to the Yu forces, according to the latest Yu statements, has been approximately 80,000 killed and wounded, and over 300,000 sick.

On the Chinese Mainland

The Kyōhin Line Operation began in late April, and Luoyang was captured on May 25th. Subsequently, the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Line Operation began in late May, and Hengyang was captured on August 8th. This operation completely thwarted the Yu-American air force's attempts to obstruct Japanese maritime traffic and air raids on the Japanese homeland, causing extremely great losses. As of today, the Japanese forces have sacrificed 7,350 men in this operation. The Yu forces suffered even greater losses, with approximately 175,000 killed and captured, and 750 large guns, 3,000 machine guns, and 37,000 rifles seized. Also, recently, enemy air forces from the homeland and Manchuria have attacked Kitakyushu and Southern Manchuria five times, and the Japanese air defense units have bravely intercepted them, resulting in the downing of over 30 B-29 long-range bombers. There were also Japanese aircraft that crashed into enemy aircraft, demonstrating their vigorous attacking spirit.

Regarding air operations, around the end of last year, the American air force's first-line strength on all fronts in Greater East Asia was approximately 5,000 aircraft. In the Solomon Islands, Bismarck Archipelago, and the eastern part of New Guinea, there were approximately 1,500 aircraft. The Japanese Army and Navy air units in that area have cooperated with each other, and since the end of last year, they have often engaged enemy aircraft several times their number. During this period, the Army alone has shot down and destroyed over 1,000 enemy aircraft. However, due to the strength of forces, supply capabilities, and base capabilities, there are unavoidable difficulties in exerting combat power. In front of Burma, there are approximately 800 to 1,000 enemy aircraft. The Japanese Army air units, although limited by the strength of forces and other difficulties, bravely resisted several times the enemy's strength. Since the end of last year, 530 enemy aircraft have been shot down, and approximately 200 have been destroyed. In China, the Yu forces have been rapidly increasing their base strength since this spring. Until recently, the total number of Yu aircraft has reached over 700, including at least 100 or more B-29 aircraft. The Japanese air force units often fought enemy aircraft with skillful tactics. Since the end of last year, they have shot down 500 and destroyed 1,000.

The Kuril Islands Area

Japanese aircraft and the Navy are cooperating with each other, currently intercepting 4 enemy aircraft in that area. The above is the combat situation of the Japanese Army air units. Since the end of last year, the Army's air and ground units have shot down 2,700 aircraft, while the Japanese have lost 604 aircraft. In short, the enemy's counterattacks in the Pacific and Mainland areas are extremely fierce. Today is a good opportunity to shatter the enemy's ambitions. The Japanese Army is determined to unite as one, overcome all difficulties, and complete the great task of defending the homeland. The enemy's personnel losses have increased dramatically, and they have unfavorable conditions such as extended war lines and supply lines. Conversely, the Japanese have strategic advantages due to the smaller war lines, reduced supply lines, and strengthened operational bases. The Army and Navy are working closely together, gathering all combat power to deal with the enemy. At the same time, our entire nation is working diligently together to increase aircraft production. Therefore, we firmly believe that now is a God-given opportunity to defeat the enemy and complete the war.

### East Japanese Army Breaks into Haikou City

Guangzhou, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from Chongqing, the elite of the Japanese East Zhejiang forces, after capturing Qingtian on August 27th, continued to pursue the Yu forces along the Ou River. On the 4th, they broke into Haikou City, 20 kilometers southeast of Lishui. Fierce fighting is currently underway.

Japanese Aircraft Bomb Ganzhou Airfield Heavily

China Frontline Base, 7th (Central News Agency) - Japanese bomber squadrons attacked the Ganzhou Airfield, a Yu frontline base, at dawn on the 6th, bombing its protective areas and the vicinity of the runway. It seems to have suffered considerable damage. However, due to poor visibility, the results of the battle could not be confirmed. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.

### Three Budget Supplementary Proposals Submitted to the House of Representatives by the Japanese Cabinet; Deliberation to Begin This Afternoon

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Cabinet submitted the following budget proposals to the House of Representatives on the 7th: Supplementary proposal for the general budget of revenue and expenditure for the 19th year of Showa (33rd year of the Republic of China); Supplementary proposal for the special account budget of revenue and expenditure for the 19th year of Showa; Supplementary proposal for the temporary military expenditure budget, and one other item.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese House of Representatives held a general consultation meeting of budget committee candidates at 10:30 AM on the 6th to discuss the operational guidelines of the budget committee, the objectives of questioning and deliberation, etc. As a result, it was agreed that, in view of the fundamental purpose of the decisive battle parliament, key points should be selected to concentrate discussion. The questioners, the order of questioning, and the items to be questioned will be drafted by the chairman and directors and then submitted to the whole body for discussion. Budget deliberation will begin on the afternoon of the 8th. The key points of the deliberation items are: A. Establishing a sure-win domestic system; B. Increasing military production, with special attention to increasing the production of aircraft; C. The food problem. Furthermore, within the establishment of a sure-win domestic system, opinions will be concentrated and frankly reflect public opinion from the spiritual aspect on matters such as wartime guidance, national movements, rectifying morals, guiding public opinion, and raising national morale, striving to give full play to the functions of the parliament. The general meeting of this item has considerable expectations for the deliberation and questioning of the temporary military expenditure.

Actively Promoting Agricultural Production

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) – The supplementary budget proposal for the general account of the 19th year, submitted by Japan in this temporary parliament, includes 62,000 yuan for temporary parliamentary expenses; the remaining 785 million yuan is entirely for food production expenses. According to this plan, it is expected that an additional 1.7 million koku of rice and 1.1 million koku of wheat will be harvested. In addition, to ensure the labor force in agricultural work, Prime Minister Koiso's proposal will be considered to organize Class A food production teams, mainly composed of successors to agriculture, and increase the number of team members from 30,000 to 60,000 to be dispatched at any time and anywhere. In addition, about 500,000 young people aged 17 and 18 in cities and towns who cannot be incorporated into the Class A production teams will form Class B production teams to engage in food production work for two months during the busy farming season. Furthermore, 80,000 students from agricultural schools, under the principle of year-round mobilization, will use farmland as classrooms to learn practical agricultural techniques. The central purpose of this increased production campaign is to complete the task of ensuring increased production by dispatching agricultural soldier teams. In addition, a system will be established to lend draft horses to livestock farmers without charge and to distribute chickens at cost. At the same time, an average of 210 female agricultural technicians will be selected from each prefecture to strengthen increased production measures.

### After Seizing Changtang Street, Japanese Troops Occupy Qiyang; Baishui on the South Bank of the Xiang River Falls

Hunan Front, 7th (Central News Agency) – After the Japanese rapid forces seized Changtang Street on the 3rd, they immediately pursued the 46th Army and occupied Qiyang, a key point on the Xiang-Gui Railway, on the morning of the 5th. This location is an advanced base for the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force, only 30 kilometers from Lingling.

Hunan Front, 7th (Central News Agency) – The elite Japanese troops in Hunan, in response to the occupation of Qiyang, also began operations near Jinlansi, defeating the Chongqing 58th Division and advancing more than 50 kilometers southwest along the Xiang-Gui Railway. On the morning of the 5th, they arrived at Wenmingwei, 20 kilometers northwest of Qiyang. Another Japanese westward advancing force crossed Baishui City on the 4th and seized Changliujie, 3 kilometers away from Qiyang, at the same time in the evening, cutting off the Chongqing army's retreat route. The battle situation with Qiyang as the center is becoming increasingly urgent.

Hunan Front, 7th (Central News Agency) – After the vanguard of the Japanese troops in Hunan occupied Changning, they continued to advance towards the mountainous area of Bacheng. On the morning of the 4th, they occupied Baishui City, 40 kilometers west of Changning. The main force of the 14th Division of the 31st Army of Chongqing were all repelled. Baishui City is located between Changning and Lingling and is a key transportation hub on the south bank of the Xiang River. At present, the artery of the southeastern military of the Chongqing army has been completely cut off.

### Navy Minister Reports on the War Situation

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Navy Minister, Admiral Minei, reported the general outline of the war situation to the 85th Diet as follows: A brief description of the general war situation since the last Diet session and a sincere disclosure of my beliefs are as follows:

Central Pacific

In the region, since one corner of the Marshall Islands fell into enemy hands in early February, enemy mobile forces have continued to attack the Mariana Islands, the Caroline Islands, and Nanto Islands, etc., to weaken the Japanese advanced bases. By mid-June, the enemy occupied Saipan under the cover of a large mobile force based on a dozen aircraft carriers and battleships. Subsequently, they landed on Tinian and Guam, but the Japanese army is still in its old position. The enemy forces in New Guinea also echoed the operations in the Central Pacific, invading Biak Island in late May, and advancing to Sansapor in northwestern New Guinea in early August. The Japanese army and navy fought bravely in these battles, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy, but the Japanese army also suffered many casualties.

Japanese Combined Fleet

The naval forces, in coordination with the Japanese army in the Mariana area, were also active, but it is regrettable that the enemy landing forces could not be eliminated due to the failure to adequately supply air power. As a result of the aforementioned operations, the enemy forces have obtained powerful air bases in the Mariana area and northwestern New Guinea, and have gradually expanded their air power circle, causing the air raids on the Ogasawara Islands, Iwo Jima area, the Philippines area, and the Caroline Islands area to become increasingly fierce. The enemy in the North Pacific continued to conduct frequent air raids and occasionally shelled key points in the North Kuril Islands, requiring strict vigilance. Warplanes from the Indian Ocean area to Sumatra and Central Java have also intensified their activities. During this period, enemy submarines were extremely active. The navy, with the cooperation of the army and other forces, desperately defended and attacked, achieving the definite result of

Sinking Enemy Submarines

One hundred and thirty, destroying forty-two ships. However, further efforts are needed in the future to achieve unprecedented results. The Japanese submarine force also performs various important tasks in the vast ocean. Recently, it firmly attacked two enemy aircraft carriers, one battleship, and one cruiser, destroying about twice that number of ships. In addition, it achieved the result of sinking about twenty-four enemy ships, totaling 180,000 tons. Frankly speaking, in the war situation since this spring, although our army has achieved significant local results in various aspects, from a general perspective, the current situation still requires sudden awareness. There will be many difficulties in the war situation in the future. However, due to the brave and skillful fighting of the front-line soldiers, the stubborn enemy relying on material resources is worried. The tangible and intangible damages are both heavy and large. The deeper the enemy army penetrates.

The Japanese Defense Perimeter

The more difficulties and weaknesses within are exposed. I believe that defeating the many with the few is the wonderful meaning of ancient Japanese military strategy. The Imperial Navy's painstaking efforts over the years have also been in this regard. By comparing the strengths and weaknesses of both sides in terms of material and spiritual aspects, and seeing through the enemy's hidden difficulties and weaknesses, I am confident that the Imperial Navy will launch sure-win strategies in the future. What I want to say especially today is that everyone knows that the essential elements of combat, that is, obtaining air supremacy on land and sea in today's war situation, are necessary conditions for combat. Without such air supremacy, aircraft, needless to say, and any elite battleships and superior mechanized forces cannot be expected. From the daily war situation, one can understand why there is a demand for rapidly replenishing new and advanced aircraft. Currently,

The Naval Air Force, fights the enemy day and night. As the war situation becomes increasingly fierce, the consumption of aircraft has gradually increased, and the number of mechanical failures has exceeded expectations. I hope that the one hundred million citizens will cooperate with each other and transport the aircraft they expect to the front-line troops, so as to allow them to be fully active. Under the Emperor's majesty, I pledge with the citizens to rapidly replenish all war preparations with zealous trials, and to integrate this with the front-line troops, seize the weaknesses of the enemy expeditionary forces, and inflict thorough pain. At the same time, I hope that the country should also take victory as the ultimate goal, and exert a firm and persistent spirit, each performing their duties, and making

Efforts to ensure victory. The Japanese Combined Fleet, under the command of Commander-in-Chief Mota, has extremely high morale, and all have ignited the belief in destroying the enemy, which is what I am most gratified about.

### Japanese Government Commends the Ministry of Transport and Communications, Shimonoseki Facilities Department

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Information Bureau announced on the 6th that the Prime Minister, in accordance with Article 1 of the Ordinance for the Commendation of Meritorious Government Officials and Soldiers, awarded a certificate of commendation to the Shimonoseki Local Facilities Department under the Ministry of Transport and Communications.

### Implementing the Greater East Asia Declaration, Japan to Allow East Indies Independence; Chairman Chen and Dean Zhou Issue Statements

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Prime Minister Koiso declared in his policy speech to the current Japanese temporary parliament that he will recognize the independence of the East Indies in the future. This is another concrete proof of the Allied nations' assistance to the oppressed peoples of East Asia to achieve independence and liberation. Our National Government Chairman Chen made a special statement on this matter. In addition to expressing admiration for Prime Minister Koiso's grand declaration, he also urged the compatriots across the country to recognize the future of the nation and the nation, and its responsibility for the Greater East Asia Declaration, and to strive even harder to complete the war. The record is as follows: Prime Minister Koiso of the Allied Nations, in his policy address to the 85th Temporary Parliament yesterday, in order to further develop the efforts of the Allied governments since last year to allow the original inhabitants of the East Indies to participate in political affairs in accordance with their long-cherished wishes, solemnly declared that they will recognize the independence of East Asia in the future. This is the Allied Nations' assistance to the East, sparing no effort to take on the forefront of defending East Asia. The Greater East Asia Conference was convened ten months ago, and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was issued, jointly establishing the basic principles of mutual assistance, mutual benefit, and common defense among the East Asian nations. This statement also aims to fulfill every word of the Greater East Asia Declaration from the beginning of the Greater East Asia War. At this decisive stage, the clear and powerful influence it gives to the East Asian nations and the fatal blow it gives to the Anglo-American aggressionists are extremely significant, not only making the East Indian people in the midst of striving for liberation jump for joy.

We must deeply recognize that this war is related to the survival of the entire East Asia, and it is also the boundary between independence and slavery for any nation in the East Asian sphere. Only through the common struggle of the East Asian nations can the scourge of aggression be eradicated and the overall liberation of East Asia be ensured. Only by ensuring the overall liberation of East Asia can we ensure the independent survival and stable development of each nation, and further contribute to the stability and peace of the world through the stability and peace of East Asia. This cannot be achieved by empty words. Only with ability can there be gains, and only with sacrifice can a price be obtained. Therefore, in addition to expressing admiration for Prime Minister Koiso's powerful statement, I deeply wish that all our citizens will recognize the future of the nation and its responsibility for the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and strive even harder. I also deeply hope that our East Asian nations will unite even more to complete the war.

Dean Zhou Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) – The general idea is that Prime Minister Koiso's statement that he will allow the East Indies to be independent in the future is a epoch-making measure to implement the sacred purpose of the Greater East Asia War, which is deeply admired. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to liberate the countries and nations that were under British and American domination. If the East Asian countries and nations still do not achieve independence and freedom after the British and American forces are driven out of East Asia, it will violate the sacred purpose of the Greater East Asia War. Prime Minister Koiso's statement is in line with the spirit of the Greater East Asia War. In addition to expressing admiration, we deeply hope that the East Asian countries and nations will assist in the concrete realization of this statement, and further strive to assist the Allied nation Japan in completing the victory of the Greater East Asia War, so as to determine the co-prosperity of the East Asian countries and nations.

Minister Lin Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) – After hearing Prime Minister Koiso's statement at the temporary parliament that he will recognize the independence of the East Indies in the future, Minister Lin Yifu pointed out two points, the general idea being: Japan's move is an aid based on a moral spirit. Our country should recognize the sincerity of the Allied nation, strive for national independence, and seek East Asian liberation together.

### Train Frequency Reduced; Inland River Transportation Smooth; Water Transportation Capacity Increasing Daily

Since the frequency of trains on various lines of the Central China Railway has been reduced, transportation relies more on shipping than before. To understand the situation of Shanghai's external water transportation, a Central News Agency reporter visited Shanghai Inland River Steamship Company. According to the person in charge of the company, although Shanghai's commercial transportation used to rely on land transportation, due to the location of loading and unloading points, the water freight was high. In fact, goods from Kyoto, Shanghai, Hangzhou and other places are all transported to Shanghai by inland river transport ships, because the loading and unloading locations are mostly at the docks, which is more convenient for transporting goods into warehouses, and the freight is low. Therefore, although the company feels the same difficulties as the railway in terms of fuel management, in order to promote the mission of water transportation, it still fully maintains the past routes. Therefore, since the frequency of trains has been reduced, the water transportation capacity has not only not decreased, but has been increasing daily. Especially in the past month, passengers traveling to and from Kyoto, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Jiaxing and other places have mostly switched to inland river transport ships because it is difficult to buy train tickets. The latest statistics show that more than 315,000 passengers have traveled to the above-mentioned places by transport ships, which shows that water transportation is convenient and does not affect travel. At present, in order to actively promote inland river transportation, the company has specially adjusted the original frequency. Although it feels the lack of fuel, it still does not interrupt the original Hangzhou line.

The company's current routes to Central China include:

Shanghai-Suzhou Line: This line takes Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Shanghai as its center points, connecting Changshu, Kunshan, Qingpu, Jiangyin, Danyang, Jiangkou, Sanjiangyin, Qishuyan, Yixing, Taicang, Shaxi, Jintan, Jurong, Huangdu, Jiaxing, Hupu, and Piaoyang.

Huangpu River Line: This line takes Jiaxing, Hangzhou, and Shanghai as its center points, connecting Jinshan, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Sanqiqiao, Minhang, Songjiang, Pingwang, Jiangbian, Zhuji, Jingjiang, Chuansha, Datuan, Chongde, and Changan.

Yangtze River Line: This line takes Wuhu, Nanjing, and Zhenjiang as its center points, connecting Pukou, Yangzhou, Nanjing, Gaoyou, Taixian, Yukou, Chongde, Tianshenggang, Kouan, and Tongjiangji.

Hankou Line: This line takes Hankou as its center point, connecting Jiujiang, Xindi, Shihui Xiang, Hukou, and Shashi.

Jiangbei Line: This line takes Yangzhou, Dongtai, Nan Tong, and Taixian as its center points, connecting Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua, Jurong, Huaiyin, Huaian, Dongtai, Yancheng, Bining, and Haian.

Huai River Line: This line takes Bengbu as its center point, connecting Huaiyuan, Xiahe, Fengtai, Taixian, Linhuaiguan, Wuhe, and Zhangfengtan.

After receiving the report, the bureau dispatched a large number of detectives to the address at 2:30 PM yesterday and arrested the main culprit, Zhu Rongsheng (also known as Big Fatty, with a dragon tattoo on his arm), and three accomplices, fifteen customers, eighteen heroin pipes, and multiple packages of heroin on the spot.

### Public Works Bureau Holds Registration of Well Merchants and Native Wells; Random Checks to Be Conducted at Any Time to Emphasize Hygiene

Since the merger of the First District Public Works Office, all public utilities in the city have been unified under the management of the Public Works Bureau. It is reported that the water supply affairs in the city are currently being planned and managed by the bureau. All well companies, water pipe merchants, etc., must apply for registration with the bureau in accordance with the regulations before they are allowed to operate. If there are underground water pipes and sanitary equipment in the operation and repair of houses and other projects, or reconstruction and other works, the contractor should also prepare a detailed drawing and submit it to the bureau for approval before construction can begin. Those who have not completed the procedures in accordance with the regulations must apply for registration with the bureau. Fearing that merchants and people do not understand the procedures, so as to cause the rules to be violated, the bureau also sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau, in the future, if merchants and people apply for building or repairing licenses, and there are incidental water supply equipment, such as opening artesian wells, and setting up tap water pipes and other projects, they should guide merchants and people to register with the bureau. As for the stores and households in the city, due to the limited amount of tap water, they have opened native wells one after another. In the past, the authorities strictly prohibited native wells because the city has tap water equipment, in order to emphasize hygiene. Now, at this extraordinary time, it is specially rewarded to open up, but it is only limited to washing and industrial use. The Municipal Public Works Bureau, in order to understand the details of the native wells in the city, recently held a registration of the native well equipment owned by the owners of the whole city. If the wells have been built or are being prepared and excavated, please go to the second section of the bureau to collect the application form as soon as possible. After the bureau organizes the completion, it will cooperate with the Hygiene Bureau to send personnel to conduct random inspections at any time. Those who do not meet the regulations will be banned.

### Regarding Countermeasures Against Commodity Prices, Thorough Research is Underway; Dean Zhou Answers Key Points

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) – Zhou Fohai, Acting Dean of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, met with domestic and foreign reporters in the capital in the Central Storage Conference Room at 11:00 AM on the 7th and answered various points of concern to the reporters in detail. The details are as follows: (1) Regarding the gold price issue, there has been an abnormal phenomenon recently, with soaring prices, which has a huge impact on commodity prices. The reason is: some people are hoarding and manipulating. The Shanghai authorities once severely investigated and punished this; due to the psychological relationship of the people, the trend of competition is increasing. The authorities are planning countermeasures for this.

(2) Regarding the problem of commodities, it can be said from two aspects: currency and materials. The current rise in commodity prices is by no means inflation, because the circulation area of ​​Central Reserve Vouchers is increasing, and the amount of banknotes issued should increase accordingly. Self cannot be called inflation. Seeing the high interest rates in the financial situation in Shanghai and other places can be used as proof of no support. Therefore, the main reason for the rise in commodity prices is the lack of materials and hoarding by the general public. How can commodity prices be stabilized in the future? We must work hard to increase production and save consumption. However, the simple issue of increasing production is extremely complicated, such as the issues of fuel, raw materials, and transportation, which must be resolved one by one. Regarding commodity price countermeasures and the entire specific plan, the authorities are conducting thorough research. (3) The ratio of Central Reserve Vouchers to

The Japanese yen will never be changed because a country's change will affect economic chaos and soaring prices, but the impact will not only be on our country, but also Japan will be considerably affected. During my visit to Japan, I met with Prime Minister Koiso and Ministers Ishiwatari and Shigetsu, and we agreed on this matter, and we are more determined not to change the original exchange rate. (4 Regarding the establishment of the banking industry in various places, the establishment of new banks has long been suspended in the Kyoto and Shanghai areas, and places with fewer banks and money shops are also subject to conditions. Restriction (5) Regarding the 400 million yen loan from the Japanese Bank to the Central Storage Bank, it is used as a preparation for the development of the Central Storage Bank. In the future, the Central Storage Bank's reserve fund will be more sufficient, and its credit will increase day by day, needless to say. (6) Regarding the recovery of currency, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Storage Bank have made great efforts. In ordinary countries, the strategy for recovering currency should be to issue public bonds and encourage savings. Regarding the first point, because the National Government's finances are very sufficient, there is no need to issue public bonds. At present, only construction public bonds are issued, and the number issued is not very large. Regarding the area of ​​preparing for livestock, the authorities have already held it, and it is a good way to do so. At present, regarding the recovery of currency, the authorities have implemented the third step, which is to

Buy out materials and recover currency. I discussed this with Minister of Finance Ishiwatari, and the Japanese side will cooperate to transport a large amount of materials for the purpose of recovering currency. (7) Regarding taxation, in order to reduce the burden on the people, in terms of taxation, in order to reduce the burden on the people, in terms of taxation, physical objects are levied, such as the land tax that has been levied in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. In the future, any improper taxes will be cancelled. Finally, Zhou talked about a profound feeling during his visit to Japan, saying: "I once visited

Prime Minister Tojo Daigo, it took 50 minutes by private car and more than 2 hours by train. After Daigo retired, he no longer had a car to ride. Although the military department was willing to borrow a car, Daigo refused, so he expressed his apology to me, saying that he could not answer the visit. This is enough to prove that Japan's political organization and situation are good, and it can be imitated by our country."

### Strictly Prohibit Private Purchase of Castor Seeds

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) – The collection of castor seeds was originally an important measure under wartime, but some ignorant pharmacists, for the sake of profit, occasionally buy them without authorization, which hinders the work and is extremely serious. At present, relevant agencies are starting to conduct strict investigations. If there are unscrupulous merchants who privately purchase them, they will be severely punished.

### Chongqing to Comprehensively Reorganize the Army

Guangzhou, 7th (Central News Agency) – It was recently reported that the Chongqing government implemented a comprehensive reorganization of the Chongqing army on September 1. According to a Chongqing report by the Associated Press on the 4th, the Yujun has recently undergone a major reorganization, and all divisions with insufficient troops and incapable cadres are included in the reorganization. Another well-equipped and fully equipped elite army was formed. As a result, most warlord generals had to retire voluntarily. According to other reports, the Chongqing regime reorganized the army in this way in order to modernize the army, simplify the theater of war, and separate the military and political affairs of each theater of war. In short, the Chongqing regime's reorganization of the army was caused by the Japanese army's launch of the mainland campaign and its predicament.

### Baojia Entertainment Organizations Limited-Time Registration

### Reader's Scholarship News "Silver Sea's Eternity" Premieres Today Enthusiastic Purchase of Tickets from Industry and Commerce

The China Film Company's latest blockbuster "Silver Sea's Eternity" will premiere at the Grand Light Cinema starting today, with three screenings daily. For today and tomorrow, the company has agreed to donate all proceeds from the balcony seats to the Shen Xin Two Newspapers Scholarship Fund and the Vagrant Labor Camp Fund. Everyone knows this film features a grand gathering of twenty-six stars singing, but few know that this film has other unspeakable grand scenes. According to someone involved in the production, it was directed through the combined efforts of Mr. Zhang Shankun and more than ten other directors. All manpower and material resources of the China Film Company's four major studios were also fully mobilized to participate in the performance. In terms of manpower alone, there were more than a thousand people, both above and below, making it truly an unparalleled and majestic film, undoubtedly creating a new record in the history of Chinese cinema. For those who have never watched domestic films, we hope you can spare two hours to give it a try, which may allow you to understand the degree of progress in the Chinese film industry.

The Shen Xin Two Newspapers sent letters to the industry and commerce sectors the day before yesterday, encouraging the sale of three types of special seating tickets priced at three thousand, one thousand five hundred, and one thousand yuan. Yesterday, the recipients of the tickets constantly came to the Social Service Department of this newspaper to deliver the ticket prices, shoulder to shoulder, filling the doorway, demonstrating the enthusiasm of all sectors for doing good deeds. Their generous donations are truly immeasurable. The names of those who purchased tickets will be announced one by one in this newspaper as a sign of gratitude. However, there is one more thing to say. A small number of ticket recipients returned the tickets. We believe that "scholarship assistance" is an obligation that everyone should fulfill, unlike other wasteful expenditures. Why not save on unnecessary expenses and use the money for meaningful "scholarship assistance"? It's truly a win-win to both watch a famous film and contribute to a good cause. Today, regular seats at the Grand Light Cinema, priced at 300 and 500 yuan, will be sold at the cinema gate. Special seats priced at 1,000 yuan and above, in addition to being sold on behalf of the Shen Bao Social Service Department, will also have a portion of good seats reserved for sale at the Grand Light box office. We invite enthusiastic individuals to purchase tickets directly from the cinema.
