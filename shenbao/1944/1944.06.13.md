### Educating the Next Generation

A society, a nation, and a people are a continuous, organic entity. This organic entity requires the constant effort of individuals from all aspects to maintain its perpetual existence. The magnitude of everyone's effort and the duration of their endeavors determine how large and how long this organic entity can exist. Therefore, every individual has the right to be nurtured and educated by the previous generation, and every individual has the obligation to nurture the next generation.

In China, the work of educating the next generation is even more important than in other countries. China has been a closed-off nation. Since the opening of its ports, it has lagged behind in all aspects, constantly failing because it could not catch up with others. In the past century, China has barely managed to maintain a thread of life, and the pressure from its environment has constantly suffocated it. To make a place for ourselves as individuals and as a nation in this great era, we must redouble our efforts to catch up. Our current efforts and our future efforts to educate the next generation are all aimed at enabling our descendants to survive. Only through such continuous efforts can we make China increasingly prosperous and let the Chinese nation shine.

In present-day China, the work of educating the next generation is even more urgent than in other countries. After more than a century of Anglo-American aggression, the nation has been oppressed to the point of collapse. Fortunately, in this Greater East Asia War, everything in China must be decided by the Chinese themselves. As the saying goes, "You reap what you sow." The responsibility for planting the seeds lies with the Chinese people of today. We can imagine the future of China by observing how we educate the next generation. If we hope that China will become an independent nation in the future, we must first educate our children to become independent individuals. This is a good opportunity, but if we fail to seize it, it will be as if we never had it.

Educating the next generation is a task of cultivating people for a century, a difficult task. The most important thing, simply put, is to give the next generation the opportunity to be educated. If we do not first give the compatriots of the next generation the opportunity to study, we cannot even begin to discuss the future of the next generation of China. This is undoubtedly the responsibility of the national government, but at the same time, it is a matter for the entire Chinese nation. Therefore, the entire society should do its utmost to help with this work. We in the journalistic field have taken a stand, and in recent years have focused on advocating for scholarship assistance, with the sole purpose of achieving this goal.

Now, the Seventh Scholarship Assistance Campaign has begun. With the social and economic situation deteriorating, it is unknown how many more young people will be forced to drop out of school next semester. Think about it, if we do not find ways to remedy this, and the next generation is full of ignorant and unemployed compatriots, is there any hope for China's future? Are we willing to be selfish individuals who only care about their own generation? Are we willing to see our nation head down the path of destruction? If not, we must rise up, we must all help with this work of educating the next generation of our compatriots. Recently, our newspaper held football and basketball games, and all the people of Shanghai were our sponsors. The enthusiastic atmosphere gave the organizers a lot of courage. Social sympathy is most valuable, and social awareness is most clear. The scholarship assistance campaign is only the starting point for the work of educating the next generation. We hope that everyone will help with this starting point.

### The Japanese Army Conducts Night Raids; The Enemy Retreats Behind the Baleier Line; A Valiant Aerial Battle Unfolds South of Bishenpur

Rangoon, 12th (Central News Agency) - The main force of the enemy's 20th Division in the Baleier area previously launched desperate counterattacks, but after being pressured by the Japanese army, it became increasingly shaken and is now retreating. Before the enemy's retreat, the elite Japanese troops braved all difficulties to repeatedly engage the enemy in hand-to-hand combat and night raids, causing the enemy's First 180th Brigade to collapse due to unbearable pressure. Furthermore, the enemy attempted to strike the flank of the Japanese army directly from near the Tanknopal road junction. They began their retreat quietly at midnight on the 7th. The enemy forces on the main road and to the north also began to collapse and retreat towards the Baleier area. At that time, the Japanese army units, seeing that the opportunity was not to be missed, suddenly launched a fierce attack, clearing out the stubborn enemy forces near the Tanknopal northern road junction and to its east. Other units echoed the attack, expanding their gains in the Sitongi and Falburen areas, and launched a fierce attack from the main road. The sound of artillery fire echoed loudly, shaking the entire war zone.

Rangoon, 12th (Central News Agency) - On the morning of the 8th, while bombing Imphal, the Japanese warplane unit in Burma encountered four enemy Hurricane fighter planes 15 kilometers south of Bishenpur. A fierce aerial battle ensued, and the Japanese planes shot down all of them instantly (one of which was not confirmed). In addition, the Japanese planes also encountered an enemy P-51 patrolling the sky above the Imphal southern airfield, and immediately shot it down. The Japanese planes then safely returned after completing their mission.

Battle Situation in Northern Burma

Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Chongqing "Central News Agency" front-line special correspondent, the battle situation in the Myitkyina area is not progressing smoothly. A special unit led by American officers was assisting in the battle in the Myitkyina area, and the unit advanced to the east bank of the Irrawaddy River. However, since the night of the 7th, the Japanese army has launched a fierce attack on the Yu army west of that area. Furthermore, the American air force has been unable to launch large-scale operations due to unfavorable weather conditions, and has only been active in northern Burma.

Rangoon, 12th (Central News Agency) - The main forces of the Yu army's 116th, 130th, and 3603rd Divisions advanced to the banks of the Nujiang River in order to open up a new supply line to the Yu army. However, they were ambushed by the Japanese army and have been defeated. On the 6th of last month, several hundred Yu soldiers attacked from the Burmese side, but the Japanese army immediately launched a fierce attack, causing them to collapse. The bodies abandoned by the Yu army alone have been confirmed to number over 290. At the same time, several hundred Yu soldiers who invaded the Lameng surrounding area were also routed under the fierce shooting of the Japanese army, with only 184 survivors. Furthermore, the Yu paratroopers who landed around Myitkyina in northern Burma have suffered heavy losses as the Japanese army's rear units have reinforced their positions and gradually tightened the encirclement. A captured Yu army division commander of the newly formed XX Division requested reinforcements from the rear, stating that "losses are too heavy, especially among cadres, so please send 50 officers and generals quickly." The prisoner-of-war camp also stated that the losses among the Yu army cadres in that area include three battalion commanders killed in action and two battalion commanders and two company commanders wounded. Therefore, the Yu army in that area appears to have suffered a severe blow.

Indian Soldiers Revolt Against the British and Are Weary of War

Rangoon, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to recent enemy intelligence, the British High Command has recently implemented strict inspections of all letters sent to British Indian soldiers and the families and friends of Indian soldiers. It has also issued orders strictly prohibiting Indian soldiers from meeting with ordinary Indians. These measures are actually due to the fact that, after the release of Gandhi, they are deeply concerned that Gandhi's achievement of complete Indian independence and the idea of demanding the British withdrawal from India will influence the Indian soldiers. Therefore, the British High Command is extremely worried. Moreover, the Indian soldiers, who are treated differently, are increasingly displaying war-weariness and anti-British sentiment. Therefore, the British authorities have recently been working hard to strengthen the special surveillance units over the Indian troops, urging the troops to fight and investigating the anti-opposition sentiments of the Indian soldiers. The morale of the Indian soldiers stationed in the country has been completely lost. Previously, there was a clash between an Indian army unit and a British special surveillance unit in Assam. A few days ago, another conflict occurred between an Indian army unit stationed in Madras and the British army. At the same time, there are also actions of open desertion and resistance to superiors, and the British Indian High Command is in a state of panic and at a loss for what to do. According to recent reports, they intend to reorganize the structure of the front-line troops, forming mixed British-Indian units in order to supervise the fighting.

### Allies from All Walks of Life are Concerned About Chairman's Health; Their Sincere and Earnest Concerns are Moving

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - Minister Chu's remarks upon his return to Nanjing have already appeared in the newspapers. This reporter recently met Minister Chu at a memorial meeting, where he said that the concern of the allies from all walks of life for the Chairman's health was truly inspiring. During his time in Tokyo, he met with people from all levels of the allied nations, and almost everyone inquired about the Chairman's condition. The sincerity and earnestness of their intentions were deeply appreciated. He also said that he had hosted a banquet for General Abe and accepted General Abe's invitation, meeting with him several times. The concern was particularly evident. When the General was touring various places, people would inquire about the Chairman's health whenever they met him. This shows that the concern of the allies from all walks of life for the Chairman's health was not merely a display of friendship in front of the Chinese people. The intellectuals of those countries have a deep understanding of the importance of the relationship between China and Japan, and they have a great respect for the Chairman's noble character. Their sincerity and earnestness are revealed unconsciously, which is truly admirable. Minister Chu also said that when he was in Tokyo, he told the allies that since the Chairman went abroad for medical treatment, the central ministries and departments and the provincial and local agencies in China have been able to maintain their positions and work hard, just as when the Chairman was in the country. The allies all expressed their deep comfort upon hearing this.

### The National Government Military Propaganda Corps Issues a Statement "To the Soldiers and Officers of the Yu Army"

Rangoon, 12th (Central News Agency) - Since the National Government Military Propaganda Corps began its activities in Burma in March, it has had a great impact on all sides. On the 11th, the Corps issued a statement entitled "To the Soldiers and Officers of the Yu Army," criticizing the contradictions in the Yu side's goals in the war of resistance and the increasing lack of leadership. It urged the Yu side to abandon the war of resistance in order to seek independence and liberation. It went on to announce the true nature of British and American aid to the Yu side, revealing their ambition to colonize China, and claimed that the Henan operation was also intended to make the Yu side reflect. It called on the Yu side to quickly awaken.

### The Manchurian Special Criminal Law to be Implemented Starting in July

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing dispatch from the Associated Press, new battles have begun between the Japanese and Yu armies around Yichang, the Japanese army's first-line base in the Yangtze River area.

Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) - With the Japanese army rapidly advancing in Hunan, Changsha, the 9th War Zone of the Yu army, is facing an imminent crisis of falling. A Chongqing dispatch from the United Press on the 10th also acknowledged that the defense of Changsha is on the verge of despair. The dispatch stated that, due to the previous three battles for Changsha, the citizens of Changsha had been completely evacuated, and the entire city had been completely turned into a defensive position. After receiving Chiang Kai-shek's order to defend to the death, the Yu army has stored a large amount of food and ammunition in preparation for fierce fighting. The boats and sailboats on the Xiang River have been completely moved to the south. The city of Changsha is filled with machine guns, and sandbags are piled up everywhere in the streets. The mountains around Changsha are also filled with fortifications. However, the Changsha defense forces were already in a state of despair before the Japanese army's attack.

Japanese Army on the Longhai Railway Reaches Lingshi

Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) - After the fall of Luoyang, the Chongqing authorities have been paying close attention to the movements of the Japanese army on the Henan front. According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Japanese army is continuing to advance west along the Longhai Railway and has now reached Lingshi. Lingshi is only 164 kilometers from Tongguan, so the Chongqing authorities must be feeling a great threat.

Religious Groups Cooperate with Japan

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - Less than a month after the Japanese army conquered Henan Province, various religious groups in Henan Province, who had been groaning under the high pressure of the Yu army in the past, have voluntarily applied to the Japanese army units stationed in various places to participate in the work of building a paradise, and have expressed their sincerity in cooperating with Japan. In order to exchange views and promote mutual understanding, they have decided to convene a religious conference in the near future to gather representatives from all factions. After the troops were stationed, due to the implementation of the new policy based on the principle of "no entry, no supply, no labor," the people who had temporarily believed the Yu army's false propaganda about Japan were greatly moved, and their trust in the Japanese army grew day by day. As a result, various religious groups, the core of the people's thinking, took the lead in requesting to cooperate with the Japanese army.

### Strict Measures Taken Internally to Eliminate Opium and Narcotics; Vice Minister Yuan Reports on Three Recent Tasks

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - At 3 p.m. on the 12th, the Ministry of Interior held a routine meeting with reporters in the Ministry's auditorium, presided over by Vice Minister Yuan. More than ten Chinese and foreign reporters from various news agencies and newspapers attended. Vice Minister Yuan reported on three areas: opium suppression, civil affairs, and police administration, which lasted until 5 p.m. The main points are as follows. Regarding the problem of opium suppression, first, the opium suppression regulations, according to the National Government's outline for opium suppression, in addition to a three-year ban on opium, absolutely prohibit narcotics and adopt a policy of immediate and thorough eradication. The laws for suppressing narcotics are also strict, and those who cannot be convicted under the general criminal law are now subject to the law for punishing narcotics offenses, which has already been implemented. Second, regarding the problem of opium suppression and investigation, on May 13 of this year, the Executive Yuan approved the establishment of an independent agency, the Opium and Narcotics Investigation Office, and first established branch offices in four areas: Jiangpu, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Yangzhou, to carry out investigation work. In areas where branch offices have not been established, the Executive Yuan has ordered local police agencies to be responsible for the work. The Investigation Office is exclusively responsible for the smuggling and trafficking of opium and narcotics, while the Opium Suppression Bureau is responsible for the registration of the people, the management and distribution of licensed sellers, and the management of registered officials. Regarding civil affairs, the issue of strengthening local administrative organs is currently being studied, that is, reforming the current administrative supervisor system, based on administrative simplification and county administrative reform. The detailed measures will likely be decided at the next Executive Yuan meeting. The greatest goal of this county administrative reform is to strengthen county administration, especially county finances, and the promotion of the baojia system is currently being actively promoted. Regarding police administration, the widespread abolition of stations, city gates, and docks since January of this year has been welcomed by travelers. However, the Ministry has received reports from various parties that many policemen are outwardly compliant but inwardly disobedient, and are engaging in various obstructive behaviors at stations and other places. Therefore, the Ministry has specifically ordered all police agencies to pay attention to preventing policemen from engaging in illegal behavior at stations and other places, so as to reduce the suffering of travelers.

### North and French Armies Continue to Reinforce, Fully Compete for Cherbourg Peninsula, German Side Announces Withdrawal from Carentan

Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: German News Agency reports: Both sides in Western Europe have mobilized a large number of reinforcements, especially in the American landing beachhead area, from near Signy, east of the Vire River estuary, along the east coast of the Cotentin Peninsula (also known as the Cherbourg Peninsula), northward to Ouineville. Large detachments of fresh enemy troops are landing, and these reinforcements are carrying a large number of heavy weapons. The northern part of the landing beachhead, between Montebourg and Quineville, was relatively calm on the morning of the 11th. At the same time, the American army group commander in the area launched a larger formation, covered by tanks, to launch an attack on Carentan, but the German troops in the area are still holding their ground firmly. The American formation exerted strong pressure from Signy to the southwest, but also failed to achieve success. The intention of the anti-Axis forces is to penetrate the entire peninsula to the west coast, then blockade its northern part to defend against attacks from the south, in order to carry out a mopping-up operation there, and to make the peninsula the main base for the second phase of the invasion war. General Montgomery, on the evening of the 10th and the 11th, together with newly landed detachments in the invasion area, mobilized approximately twenty divisions, of which seven to eight divisions are believed to be casualties.

Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: Huitong News Agency reports: For two days, the anti-Axis forces have been reinforcing France, mostly by sea landings, as glider transport has been hampered by heavy rain. The British army landed at the mouth of the Orne River, and the American army landed at the mouth of the Vire River. The enemy's landing point is about twenty kilometers deep, with an average of only a few kilometers.

Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: The German News Agency quoted an official German war report as saying: All enemy attempts to expand southward from Caen and Bayeux have been crushed, and their attempts to advance towards Cherbourg north of the Vire River estuary have also failed. German troops only withdrew from Carentan after fierce fighting. The two Laude artillery batteries along the Stvaast coast east of Cherbourg continue to bombard enemy fleets with heavy artillery. German reserve troops are standing by to be deployed. Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: Huitong News Agency military affairs reporter Setorius said that the German troops dispatched by the German High Command to fight on the Normandy Peninsula are only a small part of the reserve force. The remaining reserve troops are all on standby to be deployed. It is still difficult to say for sure whether the German army has launched a major counter-offensive on the Cotentin Peninsula and the Calvados coast, as the German authorities believe that the enemy's landing in Normandy is only the first step in the invasion of Europe, and that other enemy forces with equally strong forces may land at any time elsewhere in Europe. However, before the situation in Normandy stabilizes, the British and Americans are unlikely to launch other landing operations immediately. The British and American headquarters in the British mainland have enough troops to launch landings elsewhere, but their entire air force and most of their navy have already participated in the Normandy campaign. Speaking of the enemy air force units, they have suffered heavy losses in this landing battle, so when landing elsewhere, although the enemy still has ordinary land forces to serve as airborne troops, technically speaking, their combat effectiveness is not as good as that of airborne soldiers who have received several years of special training.

### Twenty-Nine Anti-Axis Transport Ships Sunk, German Submarine Activity in the English Channel Area

Stockholm, Sweden, December 12th, Central News Agency: According to a report from the London United Press, since the 10th, the German army has gathered a large number of submarines to attack the supply routes of the anti-Axis forces in the English Channel, in order to engage in fierce battles with the anti-Axis forces.

Artillery Battery Power

Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: German News Agency reports that the German fortress and outer artillery battery near Cherbourg destroyed at least eight hundred ships of various sizes in the four days of the invasion campaign. In the coastal area about three kilometers long in front of the fortress, there were a total of 4,400 enemy soldiers' bodies, but in the same period, only six German soldiers were killed or injured inside the fortress.

Air Warfare

Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: The German authorities announced on the 11th: German fighter planes attacked a large enemy convoy escorted by warships in the waters of Caen on the evening of the 10th, and sank nine large ships of 20,000 tons and nine transport ships of 8,000 tons in just a few minutes. Enemy ships came to the rescue but were also hit and suffered heavy damage. In addition, one transport ship of 10,000 tons was also hit. The German fighter squadron also launched a fierce attack on the enemy units approaching the Vire River estuary, and several enemy special landing boats that were about to land were also hit and damaged.

### Anti-Axis Naval Guns Bombard Douru Harbor

Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: According to a broadcast from Vichy on the 11th, the anti-Axis fleet bombarded Douru.

### German Troops on the Italian Front Continue to Move Northward

Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: German News Agency reports: German troops on the Italian front are now disengaging from the enemy north of the coastal area of Ariete, without suffering enemy attacks. American tanks are focusing on the area between the Tyrrhenian Sea and the upper reaches of the Tiber River, exerting major pressure to the west. North of Zataipa, the enemy is forcefully crossing the Furia River and advancing towards Lake Bolsena. When the enemy attempted to advance north and east across the river, a major battle unfolded on the Tiber River. A few days ago, a major battle also took place near Grignano. Although the fighting on the western front is fierce, it is only a small contact between the rear guard teams. Bopo and others have completed the task of preventing the enemy from encircling them.

### The Karelian Isthmus is Breached by Soviet Troops

Stockholm, Sweden, December 12th, Central News Agency: The Soviet Command announced: On the 12th, the Soviet army launched a major offensive on the Karelian Isthmus, and after fierce fighting, it breached the Finnish positions in the western part of the isthmus. According to the Finnish Intelligence Bureau on the night of the 11th, General Govorov's Leningrad Front Army launched an offensive towards the Karelian Isthmus north of Leningrad on the 10th, and has now created a breakthrough forty kilometers wide and twenty-four kilometers long, and occupied the city of Terijoki and many villages such as Addakina.

### Taylor to Return to Rome

Lisbon, December 12th, Central News Agency: Huitong News Agency reports from Washington: Former Roosevelt representative to the Vatican, Taylor, will return to his original post as soon as possible.

At the same time, the American army group commander in the area launched a larger formation, covered by tanks, to launch an attack on Carentan, but the German troops in the area are still holding their ground firmly. The American formation exerted strong pressure from Signy to the southwest, but also failed to achieve success. The intention of the anti-Axis forces is to penetrate the entire peninsula to the west coast, then blockade its northern part to defend against attacks from the south, in order to carry out a mopping-up operation there, and to make the peninsula the main base for the second phase of the invasion war. General Montgomery, on the evening of the 10th and the 11th, together with newly landed detachments in the invasion area, mobilized approximately twenty divisions, of which seven to eight divisions are believed to be casualties.

### Aircraft and Artillery Concentrated Bombardment, Beginning to Attack Caen

Berlin, December 13th, Central News Agency: According to front-line news, the anti-Axis air force concentrated its bombing on Caen with a large number of medium bombers and fighter-bombers on the 10th. The bombing of Kanesi was a concentrated bombing of a military area. Also, on the same day, anti-Axis aircraft bombed the northern tip of the Cherbourg Peninsula.

Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: According to news, the anti-Axis fleet in the Seine Bay is currently launching a fierce artillery bombardment of the city of Caen, and the entire city is shrouded in thick smoke. The city's large steel factory, located not far from the coast, is a good target for British naval artillery.

Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: German News Agency reports: The British army has gathered a large army north of Caen, which shows that the army will attack the area today. The German side said that if the enemy does not occupy Caen, the mouth of the Orne River can never be used for landing operations.

Berlin, December 12th, Central News Agency: German News Agency reports: The anti-Axis forces are clearly planning to make every effort to attack the city of Caen. A large number of troops and military equipment landed behind the British front lines north of Caen on the 10th. These reinforcements were transported by glider. At night, the enemy dropped a large number of paratroopers south of Caen in the German positions. Since the British command formed a new focus north and northwest of it, it is speculated that the anti-Axis high command is eager to occupy the city. The fact that the German army regained the left bank of the Orne River dealt a major blow to the enemy's invasion plan. This can be proved by the British army being forced to cross the river with a strong tank force to the east bank to attack the German defensive positions from the south. The British tank forces occupied two strongholds, and the German army retreated northward.

### Invasion Army Uses New Weapons, Gliders Transporting Tanks

Geneva, December 12th, Central News Agency: According to a report from London, the most cherished secret weapon of the British has been officially revealed last night. This weapon is named "Hamil Rate". It is a huge glider that can carry two fast light tanks or other heavy weapons and is now being used in Normandy front positions. Its two wings are stretched out, which is larger than the "Lansder" type. It is towed by a heavy American bomber, but the control is extremely flexible, and a small landing strip is enough for it to land. Whether day or night, a few miles away from the target, the towing cable is removed, and this aircraft can land on its own with almost mathematical accuracy. When it silently descends towards the target, the sound of a motor suddenly comes on. This motor is installed on the "tank with a large steel cannon" carried on the aircraft. The crew turns it on in advance. As soon as the aircraft lands, the tank starts to move.

### What is the Soviet Union's Attitude Towards Jiangsu?

— Reclusive Scholar of Jiangnan

Since the beginning of the Anglo-American invasion of Europe, the question "What is the Soviet Union's attitude?" has been of concern to the world. The Allied forces thought that it would be great if the Soviet Union could respond to their landing operation and launch a full-scale offensive. It has been a week since the Allied forces set foot on a corner of Normandy. Although the landing has been temporarily successful, Roosevelt and Churchill have both declared that the subsequent battles will be extremely difficult. Of course, everyone knows that such a great war, no matter how much they can take advantage of, they cannot simply whistle and drive straight into Berlin! But they are thorough utilitarians. In any situation, they are calculating: "To obtain the greatest effect with the least sacrifice." Therefore, the more difficult the war, the more they want to transfer the sacrifices they have suffered to others. This is natural in their base merchant nature. After the landing operation began, if the Red Army took a counter-offensive posture in the Yeshi area, they would be very happy: "Ah! The Red Army's major offensive has begun." However, the Soviet Information Bureau's announcement used extremely cold sentences: "No major changes on the front lines." Anglo-American commentators! Please calm down. Open a military dictionary and look for terms such as "Counterattack", "Counteroffensive", and "Offensive"!

Chongqing, thousands of miles away from the landing battlefield, is also clamoring for the Soviet Union's total counter-offensive in response to the Anglo-American invasion of Europe to begin soon. This is like a puppy yelling at a bear that is coldly watching the tigers and wolves fighting, inciting the bear to join the fight. However, the bear, which has never considered them to be opponents, remains unmoved. The Ta Kung Pao said on the 10th:

"According to Berlin reports, only a very small number of German troops stationed here have been mobilized to deal with the danger from the West. However, Spenlin seems to be waiting for some German troops on the Eastern Front to move west."

Then, let us try to give the most accurate answer to the question "What is the Soviet Union's attitude?" It is indeed very simple. "The Soviet Union will decide whether to take a major offensive based on its own position. If it takes a major offensive, it will choose the time and place that it deems appropriate."

Originally, the Anglo-American invasion of Europe seemed to be taking the form of fulfilling the Soviet Union's demand for a second front against Germany, but that is not the case. In the most difficult times of the Soviet Union's war of resistance against Germany, it regarded Britain's promise as a talisman and demanded the opening of a second front as a means to save the Soviet Union from its difficulties. However, in this era, Britain and the United States broke their promises and did not fulfill them. After the Soviet Union paid a great sacrifice, it gradually turned to the offensive. At the same time, the Soviet Union's political pressure on Europe gradually strengthened. Therefore, Britain and the United States launched the landing operation. On the surface, it seems that they are starting a comprehensive assistance to the Soviet Union under the common war goal of defeating "Hitler Germany". However, Britain and the United States are not "for the Soviet Union", but are rushing to the European continent "for themselves". The beachhead they set up in northern France is for the attack on Germany, and also a political and military beachhead to deal with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union understands this attempt by Britain and the United States very well. Therefore, the Red Army's official newspaper "Red Star" said:

"The military operations in Normandy can be said to be only fulfilling a secondary task. The main direction of the Allied forces' attack will soon be clear."

Although the Allied forces that landed in Normandy have considerable forces, it is too early to think that they can give Germany a decisive blow. In other words, the second front defined by the Soviet Union has not yet begun. The more fiercely the Allied forces fight in northern France in the future, the stronger the demand from Britain and the United States for the Red Army to launch a major offensive from the east. Britain and the United States, who launched the "invasion of Europe" in response to the Soviet Union, have now turned around and demanded that the Soviet Union open a "first front" against Germany.

The anxiety and disbelief that the Soviet Union has experienced before will now be tasted by Britain and the United States.

On the night of the 11th, the Soviet Intelligence Bureau announced that it had launched an offensive in the Karelia region. Needless to say, there is still a long way to go between this and the major offensive coming from the east that Britain and the United States are demanding. But there is also an intention to launch a political offensive against Finland. We must pay attention to this: that is, the Soviet Union will launch an offensive from its own standpoint, at the time and place it wishes.

### Information Minister Matsudaira Explains the European War Situation

Believes the German Army Will Deal a Blow to British and American Forces

Information Minister Matsudaira of the Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy, at a regular press conference held yesterday (12th) afternoon for Chinese news reporters in this city, made the following remarks regarding the recent British and American forces' invasion of Europe:

A Major Blow Will Be Dealt to the British and Americans

Minister Matsudaira began by saying that since the enemy British and American forces invaded Europe, more than five days have passed. The situation in the war zone seems to be rapidly changing. Enemy paratroopers have suffered strong attacks from the German army. The enemy navy invading along the coast, although having established a bridgehead at sea, has already suffered casualties of one-fourth. The remaining troops are in an extremely small area. The United States is worried about the severe losses and the slow progress. The Minister continued that the enemy's invasion was decided as early as last year and heavily publicized, with the attack launched between May and June. Therefore, the German army completed its war preparations in advance, reduced the Eastern European war zone, and moved troops to France. The commander in northern France is Field Marshal Rommel, who has a great reputation in North Africa and Italy. Rommel has experience fighting the British and American armies and is highly experienced in command. It is firmly believed that the German army will deal a major blow to the British and American forces this time. It can also be said that the German army is quietly waiting for a good opportunity to decisively engage the American army and annihilate them.

The French People Are Complaining Greatly

The Minister then said that the French people are inevitably suffering losses due to the enemy's invasion of Europe. He expressed deep sympathy for the suffering of the French people from all sides. He said that the treacherous British and Americans are claiming that the French people are disregarding assisting Germany and are inclined towards the British and Americans, constantly instigating unrest. But today we deeply understand that the French people have a poor impression of the British and Americans. For example, they are very dissatisfied with the proclamation issued by de Gaulle under the protection of the British and Americans, because de Gaulle believes that if the British and American armies occupy France, they will organize a military government and suppress the French people. Therefore, de Gaulle has stated that he will be unwilling to cooperate with the British and Americans in the future. Furthermore, the atrocities committed by the American paratroopers, such as indiscriminate bombing of innocent civilians and the use of human-shaped bombs, have caused the French people to complain greatly. When American paratroopers land, the people surround and kill them, which is enough to prove the French people's antipathy towards the British and Americans. Therefore, the enemy British and Americans are facing many difficulties in invading Europe and will inevitably suffer heavy losses. They may not abandon this operation, but increase reinforcements and launch another attack, hoping to expand their territory. It is firmly believed that the British and Americans will suffer unprecedentedly serious damage in the future. At that time, the British and American people will be even more dissatisfied with their government's policies, because the greater the losses, the greater the people's complaints. Therefore, this invasion of Europe by the British and Americans is actually a good opportunity for our Axis powers.

### Readers' Scholarship News Application Forms to be Issued Separately to Graduates and Transfer Students

The application forms for the seventh session of the scholarship funded by readers of this newspaper have been issued to various schools yesterday. Some schools have as many as 30% of their students applying. If application forms are issued according to the number requested by each school, the total number will inevitably exceed 50,000. It is estimated that the fundraising target of this newspaper is 10 million yuan, but there is only half the assurance of reaching that amount. It is still difficult to estimate how much tuition fees will increase next semester. Allocating 5 million yuan, even if each person receives an average of 1,000 yuan, will only cover 5,000 people. If each person receives an average of 5,000 yuan, then only 1,000 people can be approved. If a large number of application forms are distributed, knowing that nineteen out of twenty cannot be approved, wouldn't that be close to deception? Therefore, it is difficult for various schools, which have many requests for accommodation, to comply after careful consideration by the office. However, in order to protect the interests of graduates and transfer students, the application forms for these students will be distributed separately from the others, but also not more than one-third of the other applicants. The application forms were distributed yesterday, already following this procedure. It is hoped that all schools will take note. These extra application forms are for graduates and transfer students only, and other students may not borrow them.

Competition in Practical Calligraphy Promotes Xiaoxiao The "Practical Calligraphy Competition" organized by this office closed on the 8th. More than 500 entries were received from aided students in various senior elementary schools and junior high schools. There were more entries in the brush calligraphy group. From each grade level, twelve entries were selected in each of the brush and fountain pen groups. However, because one person wrote in both brush and fountain pen styles, and often one person won two awards, it was deemed inappropriate. After consideration, the brush and fountain pen groups were merged, and each person was only allowed to be selected for one award. A total of eighty candidates were selected in the preliminary rounds for the five grade levels. The list is as follows. This office originally planned to hold the semi-finals in the coming days, but because the schools are in the middle of major exams, and the students do not have time for this, it has been decided to postpone the event. It will be postponed until after the 20th of this month. The date and procedures for the semi-finals will be announced at that time. Hope all qualified students pay special attention to the news released by this office, so as not to miss the opportunity.

### Scholarship Basketball Charity Match Chinese Youth Defeats Western Youth

23 to 18 Coming from Behind

In the basketball charity match for scholarships sponsored by this newspaper, Chinese Youth faced Western Youth. The first game was held yesterday (12th) at 7:30 p.m. at the YMCA gym on Eight Immortals Bridge. Chinese Youth started with Zhai Xilin, Wu Chengzhang, Fan Qinggong, Zhang Liangxiong, and Zhang Zhilun. They faced Western Youth's Bolin, Yelong, Founik, Chizhmelov, Chai Liao, and Saszkin. Liu Hesheng and Feng Jianwei were the referees. At 7:30 p.m., the whistle blew to start the game. Both sides exchanged blows for less than a minute. Western Youth scored one point from a free throw, and then Liao scored a field goal. Zhai Xilin immediately responded with a field goal. Kong Guangyi replaced Zhang Liangxiong, but the situation did not improve. Western Youth continued to lead, with a strong offensive, holding an absolute advantage of 9 to 2. Wu Chengzhang scored a field goal, followed by a field goal by Fan Guangong. At halftime, Western Youth led 9 to 6. At the start of the second half, Chinese Youth worked hard to counterattack. Zhai Xilin scored one point from a free throw, and Kong Guangyi scored a field goal, tying the score at 9 to 9. Taobielinsky and Wu Chengzhang each scored, bringing the score to 11 to 11, which was the most intense moment. Kong Guangyi had good luck, scoring two field goals, and Chinese Youth took the lead at 15 to 11. Founik immediately responded with a field goal. Zhai Xilin then scored two consecutive field goals, giving Chinese Youth an advantage at 19 to 12. Western Youth was frustrated and brought in Chizhmelov. After Bolin and Chai scored two field goals, they slightly improved. However, Zhai Xilin scored again, and Kong Guangyi also scored a free throw, giving Chinese Youth the advantage at 23 to 18. Under Western Youth's strenuous counterattack, Chizhmelov scored a goal. At the end of the battle, Chinese Youth finally reversed the defeat and won with a score of 23 to 18.

The next game is scheduled to be held at the same venue on the 14th, and it is expected to be even more exciting. At that time, Chinese Youth will counter with Zhuo Guorong, Ma Linxi, He Jingui, etc. A women's performance may be invited before the game. As for which team, it has not yet been confirmed. The event will be a sensation for fans. Tickets are limited, so don't miss the opportunity.

Confucius Cup Football Charity Match East China Defeats Overseas Chinese United

Two to Zero

The Confucius Cup Football Charity Match, East China versus Overseas Chinese United, was held yesterday afternoon at 5:30 at the Racecourse. Overseas Chinese United once again borrowed four generals from Tianjin, hoping to avenge their old grudges. Unexpectedly, East China won again, with a score of two to zero, scoring one goal in each half. Spectators braved the scorching heat and flocked to the event, creating an unprecedentedly grand and lively atmosphere. As the competition unfolded, Overseas Chinese United launched a fierce attack. East China counterattacked, and Youliang penetrated deep into the enemy's territory, attacking near the goal, but unfortunately, it was a few inches off. Longhai's two good attempts were both saved. Overseas Chinese United took advantage of East China's weak defense and launched a rapid counterattack. After Automali received a supply from the rear, he launched a cold arrow, but Zhang Banglun calmly saved it, and the audience applauded. East China counterattacked, and the front of Overseas Chinese United's goal was in danger. A Dai shot from fifteen yards out. Chiang Du Xue of Overseas Chinese United was eager to save the ball and committed a penalty of twelve yards. Old Sun's iron leg rose up and hit the center. One to zero, the first half ended. Changing sides and fighting again, East China's strength was slightly affected by Old Sun's retirement. Overseas Chinese United's offensive became stronger, and East China's situation was precarious. Fortunately, the defenders were effective. Soon, Old Sun made a comeback, and the offensive regained momentum. Li Zijiang revolted and used a trick to lure out Tai Duka near the goal, shooting to the lower right corner. Tai missed the ball completely. Han Longhai rushed forward and added a kick, and the ball went straight into the net. Two to zero, East China won the victory. After the match, Lin Genghou presented the awards. The charity ball was purchased by the seventy-two disciples of Confucius for a total of 720,000 yuan, with each contributing 10,000 yuan.

Overseas Chinese United: Tai Duka, Luo Xucheng, Chiang Du Xue, Bolini, Xilati, Xueweitai, Dijianna (down), Bama, Automali, Autonilo, Baojie, Taikeni (up).

### National Forum Rescuing the Countryside

— Yang Su

A few days ago, I had the opportunity to stay for a few days in a township not far from Shanghai. What I heard and saw gave me a lot of shocking and alarming information. I deeply felt that today's countryside is sinking into the depths of sin and suffering. If we do not use thunderous force to rescue the current crisis, it will soon fall into a situation beyond recovery.

Political darkness is the crux of the turmoil in today's countryside. In fact, there is no politics to speak of in today's countryside. People are simply being exploited all day long. There are regular levies such as street light donations, baojia donations, education donations, health donations, public welfare donations, etc. There are even more bizarre temporary levies. Some are carried out under orders. For example, there is a bamboo donation when bamboo is used for Qingxiang, there is a donation for獻機, and there is a donation for collecting waste iron. The amount of the donation is determined by the local bosses, and no one asks about the amount remitted. As for the mandatory purchase of grain, it is even better business. For example, the higher-ups stipulate that each farmer should sell four dou of grain at a limited price. The district receives the order and collects it according to the baojia household. The district chief will collect an additional two or three dou, and the police chief will also collect an additional two or three dou. Each township baojia chief can collect an additional one or two dou. Therefore, in reality, more than one stone must be handed in. As for the money for the grain, if it is issued from above, they can simply not forward it, or give it a discount. To the extent that the grain delivered by the locals can also be embezzled, and when the higher-ups urge them, they will go through the motions for a second time. There are even more ingenious ways to make money. For example, they can use the excuse of promoting sports to hold a sports meeting, or protecting children, holding a health competition. Thus, each household will have to pay temporary donations, and the organizers will take out a small portion to buy some prizes, and the rest can be pocketed. Even more are the times when they are promoting class songs, Shanghai opera, or脱書. Hundreds of thousands of tickets are printed and distributed to households, and the profits of hundreds of thousands of yuan are naturally as easy as turning one's hand.

The district office is like this, and the baojia chiefs below are certainly not willing to lag behind. For example, within a bao, the cost of making a wooden sign to be nailed to the door exceeds the cost of the sign by several times. To build a brick wall, to install a trash can tomorrow for hygiene, and so on... these are all the baojia chief's extra income.

The above is about the established agencies. As for the general special classes, they certainly have even better ways. Many special businesses such as gambling dens and opium dens have to pay considerable money every month. They can send people to intercept "private grain" at transportation hubs, confiscating entire ships and vessels "for public use," while also sending people to escort ships and smuggle goods themselves.

The prevalence of opium and gambling is truly alarming. Nowadays, because morphine is cheaper than opium and easier to consume, most people who used to smoke opium in the countryside have switched to morphine. The number of new morphine addicts is even more countless. Four or five out of ten young people in the countryside around the age of twenty are morphine addicts.

As for the rampant gambling, it is even more severe today. In every small teahouse, people openly gamble all day and all night. The ingenuity of the gambling methods makes the Shanghai people pale in comparison, and the size of the winnings is even more astounding. Entering and exiting with 5,000 or 10,000 yuan per game is considered the most common. Some people gamble with land and materials (such as so many dan of beans, so many stone of rice). The prices are ridiculously absurd and unheard of.

The most dangerous thing is that the general youth, due to the wasteland of education, certainly do not receive proper education, which creates a habit of idleness. Children in their teens are already smoking cigarettes and skilled at gambling. What's more, they will shamelessly do everything that is immoral.

In short, today's countryside harbors a crisis that is even greater than the city. This is the most serious issue facing our nation. We should loudly call out: Rescue the Countryside!

Naval Painter (1)

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Takeshi, Translated by Hong Yang

Longfu resolved to resign from his work at the Paris-do advertising department and dedicate himself to painting. He originally intended to support himself to achieve his goal, but with work, he had no time to see the sea except on Sundays, so in the end, he had no choice but to resign.

However, since he began receiving his father's allowance, his spirit had become even more tense. Soon after, letters from his mother and younger sister further encouraged his courage.

——If you're a real man, big brother, come back home in glory after becoming a famous painter!

His sister's strong personality was filled between the lines, and her determination was fully expressed.

——Tokyo must be a wonderful place! I'll be graduating from Notre Dame Girls' Academy next year, and the thought of spending my whole life in such a remote place is really infuriating. Big brother, who resolutely escaped from home, is perhaps a brave warrior of life.

When Longfu read to this point, he couldn't help but think that his younger sister had already become a seventeen-year-old girl. He wrote back saying that life in Tokyo was by no means happy, but his sister wrote back scolding him for putting on such a pompous, adult-like air.

Since determining his work goal, Longfu began researching this and researching that, and always felt that time was precious. Because he believed he had to understand the ocean and depict the ocean, he lingered in Fangzhou and Izu and began to sketch from life. However, the ocean, such a great nature, is boundless when viewed head-on. He had never thought that the appearance of the waves had so many types, were so difficult to grasp, and that the inseparable sky and colors were also ever-changing. Although he was born loving the sea, he actually lacked knowledge of the sea. He had never thought that even just the sea would be a lifetime's work.

However, he, the marine painter, thus had his eyes opened. No matter which painting, it didn't meet his expectations in the short term, but he painted many in one go. Nevertheless, the reason he didn't despair was that the allure of the ocean firmly grasped his heart.

During this period, Tokyo became his temporary residence, and he was subject to conscription examination. It proved that the examination at the Naval Accounting School before was not wrong, that his physique was determined to be Grade C this time. However, he did not reflect on it; now, his resentment towards the "Navy" had vanished into thin air since the day of the Kure naval review.

(I've returned to my original self again. Instead of swimming against the tide, I'm being pushed back to shore by the waves again. That's fine.)

His mood was like when he was playing at Tenpozan beach, and he returned to a naive and innocent time. (100)

### Nanshi Deaf-Mute School Launches Expansion Campaign

The Nanshi Luxiangyuan Road Deaf-Mute School was established two years ago, with the pure aim of promoting special education, compensating for physiological defects, cultivating deaf-mute children, teaching necessary knowledge, instilling suitable skills, and creating deaf-mute talents, hoping that poor deaf-mute children can all receive basic knowledge and skills training, so that they can all become useful talents. As the tuition fees of various deaf schools in Shanghai are surprisingly high, it has led to a sharp increase in the number of students in the school, and the original school building is not enough. It is hoped that the school building can be expanded to accommodate as many students as possible. However, this matter is of great importance, and it relies on the generous assistance of all sectors of society. There is no shortage of people in Shanghai who own real estate in the Nanshi district, and most of them are uninhabited, leaving them empty. Perhaps they can be generous and grant assistance. The deaf-mute will benefit directly, and indirectly, the society and the country will also benefit a lot.
