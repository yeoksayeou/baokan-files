Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 23rd: The Special Attack Units Mandara, Sekicho, Nikko, Wakashu, Seika, and Shigisho, along with other air units, have been continuously bombing enemy ships near San Jose on Mindoro Island and in Leyte Gulf. The results of the battles from the 20th to the 22nd, a period of three days, as currently confirmed, include the sinking of four enemy transport ships, two cruisers or destroyers, and two vessels of unknown type near San Jose. Four transport ships, one cruiser, one cruiser or destroyer, and two vessels of unknown type were set ablaze. One enemy transport ship was destroyed. In Leyte Gulf, one enemy transport ship was sunk, one large aircraft carrier was destroyed, and one vessel of unknown type was set ablaze. In the Sulu Sea, one enemy transport ship was sunk, and one transport ship was set ablaze.

A Japanese Army base on the Philippine frontlines, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Seika Special Attack Unit and a new fighter squadron engaged over forty enemy fighter planes on the morning of the 20th above an enemy transport fleet off San Jose, Mindoro Island, shooting down ten (two unconfirmed) and sinking one medium-sized transport ship.

A Japanese Army base in the Philippines, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the night of the 22nd, a large joint formation of Japanese air force fighter-bombers launched a surprise attack on San Jose Airport on Mindoro Island.

The Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.

### The Philippine Battle Situation Remains Fundamentally Unchanged; British Carrier Aircraft Attack Sumatra

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Philippine battle situation, centered on Leyte Island, has taken on a new form due to the enemy's (U.S.) operations on Mindoro Island. However, the fundamental nature of the battle remains unchanged. The enemy's (U.S.) forced landing on Mindoro is aimed at breaking the stalemate on Leyte. Specifically: (1) to disperse the Japanese military's attacking power, and (2) to establish medium and large-scale air bases. The enemy forces will further strengthen their operations in the Leyte area and make them full-scale by absorbing the Japanese air bases dispatched to Mindoro Island, and aim to launch air raids on Luzon Island, construct bases on Mindoro, and disperse the Japanese air power on Leyte Island. Thus, the Philippine battle situation has entered a delicate phase. The enemy's supply lines to Mindoro Island must pass through complex sea areas, exposing their weaknesses. Moreover, the use of large aircraft is limited to areas south of central Philippines. To overcome these obstacles, both Japan and the U.S. must make enormous sacrifices. Conversely, the Japanese side holds an absolute advantage: (1) the Japanese military has bases covering the entire Philippine archipelago like an iron barrel, and (2) the Japanese military's supply lines are shorter than the U.S.'s from their homeland. Currently, the Japanese military is focused on preventing the enemy from gaining bases and destroying their main force in a decisive battle. Furthermore, there have been no significant changes in the Mariana and South Pacific areas. Only in the Indian Ocean did a small number of British fleet carrier aircraft attack the northern tip of Sumatra on the evening of the 20th, carrying out a minor operation.

Talks by Mr. Shindo and Mr. Aizawa

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - At a time of urgency in the battle situation in the Philippines, Japanese Army Lieutenant Colonel Tsuneemon Shindo led a strong fighter squadron to intercept the U.S. Air Force invading the area, achieving remarkable military feats in offensive operations and transport cover. The lieutenant colonel personally received commendation.

Furthermore, the Japanese Aizawa fighter squadron was commended for its military achievements in the battles of Manila Bay and Leyte, and the unit also received a unit award. These two matters have been reported to the Emperor. Lieutenant Colonel Shindo and Major Jinshiro Aizawa, commander of the Aizawa fighter squadron, met with the Army Ministry's press corps on the afternoon of the 22nd and discussed the real situation on both sides in the Philippines: "The local air force attacking the Philippines, although technically crude, has very comprehensive fire prevention equipment, and the manufacturing materials are also very excellent. Their combat style is mostly to encircle a small number of Japanese aircraft from all sides, and their ages are mostly around twenty years old. When attacking, if there are Japanese fighters in the sky, they will never approach, and even if they do, their bombing is extremely clumsy. Those with excellent skills are the carrier-based bombers flying from standard aircraft carriers, and some of their leaders are also quite excellent. However, many standard aircraft carriers have been sunk, and recently it seems that they are flying from specially made aircraft carriers. When dozens of enemy ships attacked San Jose, the Japanese special attack units attacked them with an exchange rate of one aircraft sinking one ship. Two-thirds of the enemy ships are currently conducting landings, and in order for the special attack units to complete their mission, they still need to prepare many escort aircraft to eliminate enemy interference, so more aircraft must be sent to fiercely attack San Jose. During the fierce battle of Leyte, because there were so many Japanese aircraft, air superiority was entirely in the hands of the Japanese military, but in the heat of battle, due to sudden changes in the weather, resupply was interrupted, which was quite regrettable. If there had been sufficient aircraft, the enemy's landing of two or three divisions would not have been a problem. The enemy also landed two or three divisions on the Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor."

### Enemy Aircraft Heavily Damaged in Attack on Nagoya Area; Over Forty Shot Down and Destroyed

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 23rd: The results of the engagement against enemy aircraft near Nagoya on the 22nd, as subsequently determined (including those already announced) are as follows: twenty shot down (including four unconfirmed), and over twenty enemy aircraft damaged. Four Japanese aircraft did not return after self-detonation.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 22nd, the Japanese air defense forces launched a fierce attack in a combined air-land effort against enemy B29 aircraft attacking the Nagoya area, shooting down twenty and destroying over twenty, totaling forty percent of the attacking enemy aircraft. Due to the fierce attack by the Japanese forces, the enemy aircraft hastily and blindly dropped their bombs, so the damage to the Japanese side was extremely minor. In total, the enemy aircraft attacked the Nagoya area three times, on the 13th, 18th, and 22nd, for a total of approximately 250 aircraft, of which approximately 30%, or 87 aircraft, were shot down or damaged, truly the result of the Japanese air defense forces' heroic fighting spirit and outstanding combat power.

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Enemy B26 aircraft from the Mariana Islands base, starting at 1:00 PM on the 22nd, divided into several formations and attacked the Japanese mainland from high altitude. The main force was concentrated on Nagoya, while simultaneously dispersing to invade Shizuoka, Aichi Prefecture, and Osaka Prefecture. The Japanese air defense forces immediately intercepted them, inflicting heavy damage. By 2:30 PM, the enemy began to retreat westward. The results of the battle are currently being investigated, and Japanese losses were extremely minor.

### Yunnan Expeditionary Force in Northern Burma Suffers Japanese Counterattack

Northern Burma Frontlines, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The 12th Division of the 5th Army of the Yunnan Expeditionary Force, attempting to gradually advance south along the east and west lines of the Yunnan-Burma Highway from the Longling area, has suffered a skillful counterattack from the Japanese military since the offensive resumed in November, resulting in casualties reaching tens of thousands by the end of November. Since May of this year, the Chongqing forces have suffered successive defeats in Rameng, Yueh, and Longling over a period of six months, and their morale and combat strength have rapidly declined. In particular, the low quality of the soldiers is an undeniable fact. The Expeditionary Force camp has not received resupply from the rear, resulting in increasing desertions and instances of looting of mines, and military discipline has been disrupted.

### Japanese Military Completes Preemptive Posture for Decisive Battle on the Mainland

Maintaining Strategic Superiority in the Philippines

Central News Agency dispatch - The Japanese forces stationed in China, in cooperation with the fleet stationed in China, have completed the north-south operations across the mainland and the mopping-up operations on the southeastern coast of China, achieving remarkable results. The damage suffered by the enemy is increasing day by day. This Japanese mainland offensive, in a broader sense, has destroyed the British, American, and Chongqing's coordination in Southeast Asia, especially exacerbating the internal difficulties of Chongqing. Moreover, it has lost its only base for cultivating combat strength in southeastern China, which Chiang Kai-shek called "using the wealth of the southeast to support the soldiers of the northwest," namely Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces, and is heading towards its end. Furthermore, the U.S. military believes that attacking the Japanese mainland must be based on landing on the Chinese coast, which has also lost its hope of realization. The strategic situation of the enemy's coalition forces in Burma has also been indirectly threatened. From the Chongqing side's perspective, the only way to break the current predicament is to open up foreign aid routes. The China-India route is difficult to develop, and the effect cannot be fully expected. Therefore, their greatest hope is that the U.S. military will land on the Chinese coast from the Pacific Ocean. After the U.S. military landed on the Philippine islands, they believed that U.S. assistance was approaching and expressed surprise. However, the MacArthur forces encountered fierce resistance from the Japanese military on Leyte Island and were unable to advance. During this period, the Japanese military easily opened up the north-south route across the mainland, further forcing the Chongqing forces to retreat deeper inland. At the same time, a portion of the Chongqing forces remaining outside the north-south route is in a state of isolation and helplessness. The "Saodang Bao," the organ newspaper of the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission, expressed in an editorial on the 19th the hope that the U.S. military, after the Philippine operations are completed, will land on the Chinese coast. The editorial pointed out the following points: (1) The Japanese military is currently frequently strengthening its defenses on the Chinese coast. The longer the U.S. military delays landing on the Chinese mainland, the stricter the Japanese military's defenses become, and the more difficult it becomes for the U.S. military to drive out the Japanese military. If it is said that landing on the Chinese coast is a strategic prerequisite for defeating Japan, then we must seize the opportunity immediately. (2) After opening up the north-south route across the mainland, the second step for the Japanese military is to prepare for countermeasures against the U.S. military landing on the Chinese coast. The Japanese military is currently advancing from Nanning, Guangxi Province, towards the coast, and has captured Qinzhou, west of Leizhou Peninsula and close to Beihai. At the same time, the Japanese military in the coastal areas of Guangdong and Fujian provinces is strengthening. If the enemy immediately lands on the coast, the Chongqing army in southeastern China will raise its hands in cooperation. Even if the Japanese military enters Hunan and Guangxi, not a single member of the Chongqing army in the southeast will lag behind. The Chongqing army in that area is a battle-hardened elite, born warriors. In short, it is an urgent task for the U.S. military to land on the Chinese coast. (3) On the other hand, the Southeast Asia Army led by Mountbatten should take advantage of the current situation where the Japanese military is fighting to the death in the Philippine Islands and immediately begin attacking the Malaya area with the least effort to achieve the greatest effect. Reading the Saodang Bao editorial, we can now see how the Chongqing side views the loss of the southeastern provinces as having a direct effect on breaking the stalemate in the Battle of Leyte Island and a secondary effect on approaching the Chinese mainland. However, the U.S. military's implementation of the "island hopping" strategy in the Philippines, where the Japanese military has concentrated its powerful forces, is a risky operation. The enemy U.S. military commentator Baldwin warned that the U.S.'s risky behavior must endure greater sacrifices. In reality, no matter how much material the U.S. military pours in, it still cannot resist the Japanese military's strategic advantage in the Philippines. Even in terms of air power, the Japanese air power in the Philippines can overwhelm the U.S. The Japanese side has always maintained a strategic advantage, and the strategic situation on the mainland is also increasingly favorable to the Japanese side. The fact that the Saodang Bao pointed out that the difficulties of the U.S. military and the Chongqing army are increasing day by day will become even more serious in the future.

Hankou, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - When the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing indiscriminately and blindly bombed the Hankou area on the 18th, it was ambushed by the Japanese military's air force and ground forces on its return route, shooting down two B29 aircraft and four P51 aircraft, and destroying twelve B29 aircraft and three P51 aircraft, totaling a great victory of twenty-one aircraft shot down and destroyed. The Japanese side's losses totaled two aircraft self-detonated.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese hospital ship was illegally sunk by U.S. fighter planes and bombers on November 23rd at 8:15 AM outside Manila harbor. The Japanese government lodged a serious protest with the U.S. government on December 21st. The ship clearly displayed hospital ship markings at the time of the disaster. At the same time, the weather was clear, and the visibility was good, so there was no reason for misidentification. Moreover, the ship was anchored near the harbor outside Manila, which was a combat zone, and there were no other ships or military targets nearby. The U.S. aircraft violated international law and humanitarian principles by sinking the ship.

### Graduation Ceremony of the Officer Corps; Commandant Chen's Address (Continued to Conclusion)

Fortunately, the Greater East Asia War began, and Japan took the lead in launching the liberation of the East Asian peoples. This is the most righteous war in the history of East Asia and a good opportunity for China's liberation. Thus, under the leadership of the late Chairman Wang, we resolutely joined the war. This was not a request from Japan, nor was it to follow Japan in battle, but an opportunity for us to defend ourselves. China, which has been a semi-colony for a hundred years, can finally breathe. This participation in the war is to overthrow imperialism externally and to adapt to public opinion internally. Otherwise, it would violate the will of the people, violate the meaning of the revolution, and violate its own mission. Participation in the war was voluntary and out of free will. After participating in the war, all kinds of problems in the rear should be quickly resolved in order to assume the task of participating in the war. How to concentrate materials and how to increase production depends on the establishment of peace in the rear. All of you are responsible for the military in this regard and must strive to move forward, which is the greatest contribution to the total war effort. There are two points regarding the issue of security: (1) Whether the organization and training of the army itself is sound or not, everyone should always be aware of their duties. How is the academic level of their own troops? You must pay attention to it every day and every moment. (2) How to eliminate the Communists and bandits in their own defense areas to ensure local security so that people can live and produce in peace. The National Government has a very good plan for this and has also determined the direction. I hope that you will follow the central plan and implement it to the end in order to achieve the Kuomintang's goal of eliminating imperialism and liberating China.

In addition, you commandants have come here for a month of training, and you should clearly recognize your responsibilities in order to have hope for the troops and be able to complete the task of participating in the war. As for the comrades of the cadre corps, you know that you are important grassroots cadres, like the most important cells and tissues in the human body. Among the students of the training corps, there are university students and high school students, all of whom are educated young people. Everyone knows the crisis facing the country and their own responsibilities and has come to enlist. I hope that you will adhere to the initial intention of enlisting this time and make it everyone's responsibility to build an ideal army. With a good army, the country's future will be bright, and with a future, individuals will naturally have a future. Today, I have the greatest hope for all of you."

Weekly Review

### Resolutely Strengthen Politics

— Lin Sheng

Our ally Japan, in order to establish a strong political system to carry out the decisive battle, recommended General Kobayashi, the president of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, to join the cabinet as a State Minister.  Japan's political structure is thus further strengthened, and they are boldly implementing a strong political system integrating the military and the people, to adapt to the major war situation. This war is a war of all the nations of Greater East Asia. China also bears an important role. The independence and liberation of the Chinese nation also depend on this war. Therefore, Chinese politics should also follow the needs of the war situation, adopt the same pace as our ally Japan, and strengthen politics.

Looking back at the unsoundness of our country's political structure and the long-term imperfection of administrative facilities, these are important obstacles to the implementation of national policy. Our country's politics were originally not sound enough in peacetime, and now, in wartime, especially in the current decisive stage, all the unsound phenomena in politics are fully exposed.

As for the various shortcomings exposed in our country's politics today, all parties have pointed out many times, and this newspaper has also repeatedly offered concrete suggestions for the reference of those in power; however, in reality, it seems that it has not yet been possible to actively rectify and thoroughly reform.

Overlapping organizations, numerous institutions, decentralized authority, and unfocused responsibilities; focusing only on appearances and not seeking practicality... these are all prominent shortcomings of our country's political organization, administrative facilities, and personnel mechanisms. Due to overlapping organizations and numerous institutions, the lighter consequence is simply wasting time and effort, wasting materials, and having empty government offices without anything being accomplished. The more serious consequence is mutual constraints and counteractions, failing to accomplish things and even ruining them. Due to the decentralization of authority and unfocused responsibilities, the result is that everyone pushes things away when something happens and no one takes responsibility. Due to focusing only on appearances and not seeking practicality, doing things is based on an accounting mentality, using false reports as truth, and even some meetings and all proposals become mere formalities.

In order to truly improve political affairs, we now, after repeatedly pointing out the shortcomings, further propose four major principles for reforming politics:

The first is strong politics. This means thoroughly strengthening the power of administration. The political structure and administrative organization must strive to be simple and straightforward. Authority must be unified, responsibilities must be concentrated, and the habits of bureaucracy and the style of perfunctory evasion must be thoroughly eliminated. We should seek truth from facts and unleash the powerful forces of politics.

The second is expert politics. This means that the use of personnel should be based on talent. People with ability and talent must be recruited by all possible means, given opportunities, and given power. Any matter should be done by experts, and those who are truly knowledgeable about the matter should be responsible for it.

The third is people-oriented politics. In wartime, the people are the foundation of all national power, and the government must find ways to properly maintain them. In wartime, the people certainly have the obligation to be especially hardworking, enduring, and sacrificing for the country, but the government also has the responsibility to guarantee the minimum safety and the most basic livelihood for the people. Otherwise, the war will not be easy to conduct. Furthermore, in order to solicit public opinion and seek to convey the conditions of the lower levels to the upper levels, it is also necessary to establish organs of public opinion and publicly elect people who can truly represent the public to take charge of them. Thus, the separation between the government and the people can be reduced.

The fourth is clean politics. Corruption is one of the main sources of many problems in our country. Although advocating clean politics has been called for for a long time, no progress has been seen in recent years. To make things work well, clean politics must be established. The government should now, on the one hand, improve the treatment of civil servants as much as possible, and on the other hand, severely punish private gain and fraud, and severely punish embezzlement and perversion of justice. It is hoped that the superiors will be honest and the subordinates will be clean, and politics can get on the right track.

In view of the seriousness of the situation and the fact that our country's politics are too far behind reality, we make the above appeal, hoping that the authorities will take decisive action.

### Japanese Parliament Scheduled to Hold Opening Ceremony Next Week; Army and Navy Ministers to Report on War Situation

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The fourth ordinary session of the 86th Japanese Parliament, held during the war, will convene on the 24th. This parliament is of great significance and can be called a decisive battle parliament. Government officials and members of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives are all looking forward to this parliament establishing the various capabilities for the decisive battle and beginning to make all necessary preparations. The government has already decided on the general account budget for the next year (22.2 billion yen) and submitted 21 bills. The remaining matters are only the special accounting to be decided on January 4th of next year and the legal bills to be decided on the 12th of that month. The government hopes to use this parliament to allow the people to thoroughly understand the truth of the current war situation and at the same time make clear to the people the government's determination to complete the war. Regarding the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society (翼政會), the central organization of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives, it held a representative council on the 22nd and decided to support the government with the attitude of "questioning what should be questioned and supplementing what should be supplemented," as mentioned by President Kobayashi in his speech, so that the total national strength can promote the fourth year of the war to become a year of victory. In addition, the deliberations on operational matters will also be refreshed in terms of measures. In particular, the appointment of the president of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society as Minister of State further completes the integrated system of officials and civilians and gives full play to the true meaning of this decisive battle parliament. On the 24th, when the convening begins, members of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives will gather at the House of Peers at 9:00 a.m. to carry out the establishment procedures, and then notify the government and the House of Representatives of this. The 25th is a holiday for the Taisho Emperor Festival. On the 26th, the opening ceremony will be held, and a meeting will be held to discuss the draft of the Imperial Rescript and elect the chairmen and standing committee members of the whole house. On the 27th, both houses will hold a joint meeting, and Army Minister Sugiyama and Navy Minister Yonai will report on the war situation. If no special problems occur, then once the New Year's holiday is over, it can be continued as early as next spring in order to quickly exert the mission of the new parliament.

### Please Everyone Develop the Spirit of "Universal Love"

Today is "Christmas Eve." Ordinary young masters regard it as a "night of joy." They spend the whole night traveling and playing everywhere. In times of national peace, it is indeed excusable to enjoy one night a year, but in these difficult times, if everyone forgets all their responsibilities, it is inevitable that they will be too excessive. We have three hopes for all sectors of society today: (1) Millions of Christians at sea should develop God's spirit of "universal love" and do more social welfare undertakings; (2) Ordinary young masters should save some unnecessary consumption tonight and donate it as scholarships tomorrow; (3) All entertainment venues tonight and tomorrow night, such as theaters, restaurants, teahouses, dance halls, etc., should take out a sum of income and pledge to donate a team. Which of the 5,000 children assisted by this newspaper is not a diligent and studious youth? Which one is not a promising talent? The future of the country and society will rely heavily on them. It is a pity that some of them have been baptized by artillery fire and their family property has been lost; some of them have been oppressed by life and their food and clothing are not sufficient. Although their families are poor, their ambitions are not diminished, and their future is no worse than that of the children of wealthy families. The most important thing at present is to hope that wealthy people will help and relieve them as much as possible. This depends on how far everyone's spirit of "universal love" can be developed.

Saving Birthday Banquet to Donate to Scholarship

The Shanghai Iron and Steel Industry Association sent a letter saying: "This year's tenth month of the lunar calendar is the seventieth birthday of Mr. Zhang Juntang, supervisor of our association. Mr. Zhang is a senior member of our industry and is highly respected. However, because of the difficult times, he firmly refuses to celebrate his birthday. Members of our industry, believing that Mr. Zhang is respected for his age and virtue and has provided much support to our association, gathered at our association on the 23rd of the lunar month in a thrifty ceremony to collect funds for a public banquet to express their congratulations. Now, with 20,000 yuan saved from the banquet and 20,000 yuan donated by Mr. Zhang himself, totaling 40,000 yuan, we donate it to your newspaper for scholarships, named the "Zhang Shou Team." This small amount is a token of our support. Please accept it."

Yesterday, Miss Li Li fundraised for the Xiangji Team. Miss Li recently came to Shanghai from Southern China and is engaged in theatrical movements. She is very willing to support our newspaper's scholarship fundraising. Sure enough, with just her word, she raised 200,000 yuan. This amount can save ten university students from dropping out of school. Her contribution to scholarships is very significant. There are certainly not a few women in the Shanghai community who can be as good as Miss Li at keeping their word. It is hoped that they can all rise up to fundraise. The teachers and students of Mingde Girls' High School and Elementary School are admirable for their enthusiasm. Fang Old Lady, Jiuxing Real Estate Company, Rongfang, and Master of Shuqi each formed a team, and their kindness is greatly appreciated. Zhong Xianglin wished his parents good health and showed his filial piety, which is deeply meaningful. Mr. Zhan Peilin was the first paper merchant to donate. It is thought that the successors in the paper industry must be very impressive.

### The Glorious War Record of the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit

Oh, the phoenix is blowing over the seas of the Philippines again today. Since October 24, due to the attack of the Japanese fleet and the fierce attacks of the army, navy, and air force, the enemy's vast mobile units in the waters near the Philippines have suffered devastating blows. However, in order to save the situation, the enemy appeared with a new mobile unit in the eastern sea of Lamon Bay on the 29th and in the eastern sea of Siluan Island on the 30th. They all used carrier-based aircraft to attack all Japanese air bases. However, Japan fiercely countered with army aircraft and completely shattered the enemy's wishful thinking. Enemy aircraft carriers have been subjected to suicide attacks by the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Unit, even forgetting to recover their own carrier-based aircraft and running away. The following is the glorious war record of the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit on the 29th and 30th.

Discovering Enemy Ships

At 0:00 a.m., a reconnaissance plane sent a telegram saying, "Enemy mobile unit discovered." Then it sent a telegram reporting the enemy mobile unit's position, course, speed, etc. All Japanese bases were filled with the spirit of "destroy one ship for every ship that comes." In the blink of an eye, they were fully prepared for a strong ambush. During the waiting period, enemy planes revealed themselves in the clouds. The joint formation of fighter planes and bombers consisted of more than seventy such carrier-based aircraft. At this time, our fighter group, which had long been prepared to intercept in the air, rushed towards this enemy formation. The lightning-like attack caused the enemy to become chaotic and scattered in all directions. Enemy bombers took the opportunity to continuously drop bombs. As a result, only small pits were added to the ground for no reason. Initially, they looked very small and gradually grew larger. Suddenly, there was a burst. This was originally a Japanese fighter plane diving and pursuing the enemy's escaping Grumman fighter. Bang bang bang! Continuous machine gun strafing accurately hit the enemy plane, and the enemy plane burst into flames and crashed.

Badly Hitting the Enemy Planes

One plane after another was shot down. In fact, this was inevitable. Because at 0:00 a.m. that day, they attacked the enemy's mobile unit, sinking one large aircraft carrier and setting fire to one cruiser and two other warships.

Due to our air force, the enemy's aircraft carrier even forgot to recover its own aircraft and fled alone.

On the 30th, a team from our Kamikaze Special Attack Unit carried out an incomparably heroic suicide tactic against the enemy's mobile unit in the eastern sea of Siluan Island in central Philippines. As a result, according to the report made to the base by the escort plane, it said:

Great War Results

Under the protection of the escort plane, the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit departed from the 0:00 base at 0:00 a.m. and attacked the enemy mobile unit centered on three aircraft carriers (one large, one medium, and one small or cruiser) and one battleship. Three planes crashed into the large aircraft carrier, causing an explosion, resulting in its sinking. One plane crashed into the medium aircraft carrier, causing it to stop. One plane crashed into the small aircraft carrier. Although the explosion was real, it was soon covered by the smoke of the large aircraft carrier, and the result was unknown. One plane crashed into the end of the battleship O - The student officer reading the war results, who came from a humble background, could not finish reading before his voice broke with tears.

The whole unit, including the men and supplies, risked their lives to fight the enemy. This kind of noble and tragic death crash. When the reporter heard the wireless telegram reporting the victory that "three planes hit a large aircraft carrier," his heart and nose were sore, and he recalled the commander's order before departure, "Plane No. 1, Plane No. 2, Plane No. 3, rush to the large aircraft carrier!" The death-defying spirit of the special attack unit members is truly admirable. They sang the song "What is there to regret dying for the glory of the country," and their faces were full of patriotic and loyal sincerity. This is something that the reporter will never forget.

Map of the Battle Zone of Leyte Island

### Overview of the Battle of Leyte Island

Since the enemy American forces landed on Leyte Island on October 20th, the decisive battle between Japan and the United States in the Pacific has unfolded here.

Leyte Island is approximately 40 *li* from north to south, and the widest part in the north is 18 *li* from east to west, while near Baybay it is only 6 *li*. Therefore, the battlefield does not have the vastness of the mainland that can accommodate large-scale mobile warfare, but it is not like Peleliu Island where the activities of troops can be covered by naval gun fire barrages.

Currently, the battle lines on the island are divided into three areas: (1) the Carigara Bay area, (2) the Dagami area, and (3) the Baybay area on the west coast. Since entering December, the Leyte Plain on the east side, bounded by the central highlands, has entered the rainy season, thus the superior equipment boasted by the enemy army on the battlefield is obviously restricted, and the mechanized units' heavy tanks, tractors, etc., have all lost their mobility. The enemy army's suffering is increasing daily, while the Japanese army is dispatching new elite troops to await the opportunity to annihilate the enemy. On November 1st, after the new Japanese reinforcements landed at ××, the enemy army's strategy had to be fundamentally changed.

In order to suppress the Japanese army's rear supply base, the enemy army has deployed one division of elite soldiers from the 24th Division in the Carigara area, attempting to advance southward to Ormoc via Carigara, Capoocan, Maraangas, and Limon. In the south, they advanced from Abuyog and out to Baybay on the west coast, and further advanced north, in order to echo each other from north and south and attack Ormoc in a pincer movement. Therefore, the initial encounter battle occurred near Limon between the new elite Japanese troops advancing north along the Ormoc highway and the enemy forces. By the 15th, the elite Japanese troops had driven the majority of the enemy American forces towards the coastline near Maraangas, advancing to the mountain slopes overlooking the enemy. By the 17th, they had cut off the enemy's retreat between Capoocan and Catmon Hill, completely encircling the enemy American 24th Division. As a result, the enemy was extremely anxious, and even sent boats from Carigara to transport food and ammunition to resupply the besieged troops. Afterwards, they finally dispatched the 32nd Division from Carigara by sea to provide reinforcements. However, the declining trend could not be reversed. The 32nd Division, which went to reinforce the 24th Division, was like a moth flying into a flame, encountering a head-on blow from the Japanese army in the narrow area of the coastline more than 500 meters wide. (Translated from the December 8th *Mainichi Shimbun*)

### Ancient City

— Chuan Wo

The ancient city wall in my memory is always fresh.

In the clear autumn, the sunlight exudes fragrance—the scent of a foreign land may not necessarily be less sweet than that of my hometown; sometimes, I feel like wandering is a kind of pleasure.

Even a child who is not good at finding happiness becomes happy when he accompanies me to often climb that dilapidated but solid city wall and silently sit on the parapet. The vast Yuan River meanders below the city, shimmering with a bluish-white, hazy light. Brownish-yellow, mottled sailing boats are moored side by side along the riverbank, masts towering, forming a quiet weft of varying densities. But the boats that come and go are always in a hurry, making rhythmic splashing sounds, matching the heartbeats of the excited. Look, the sky is dry and blue, with a few white clouds leisurely floating, seeming to fly, yet seeming to linger; thus, the river is silent for it. Water and sky embrace in silence. When larger steamers, belching black smoke, proudly sail between the water and the sky, we feel a welcome sense of solemnity and grandeur.

But we are no longer content to remain silent. I venture to stand on a parapet that is higher than the others, and my legs can't help but tremble. With a trembling and joyful voice, I said to my companion, Qing, "If I jumped into the river from here, how novel and grand this moment would be!"

He laughed. He put down his pencil, ready to sketch, and thoughtfully said, "Life should not be sacrificed for a moment of novelty and grandeur."

I took his hand and started walking on the city wall. This city wall is like a country road: in the middle is a wide dirt road, with small grass growing on both sides; but there is no dust, no pedestrians, allowing you to leisurely overlook the city scenery and look up at the clouds in the sky, which is much more beautiful than a village road. Moreover, the green moss and wild vines that randomly crawl on the parapets, clinging tightly, stretching endlessly, are just like the old guards who are used to telling the stories of the city's rise and fall, silently telling us that they will forever protect this ancient city wall, even in wind and frost, in the darkness!

I don't know why, we started racing on the city wall again. I was in front, Qing was behind, running all the way from the South Gate to the East Gate. Ah, what a lively place this is! The South Gate is calm and poetic, while the East Gate is active and full of vitality. Below the city wall is a large wharf, dockworkers busily loading and unloading heavy cargo; water carriers carry river water into the city with heavy but light steps; batches of passengers surge up from the boats, revealing smiles of hope on their wind- and dust-stained faces; there are also some teams, their songs echoing with neat steps. … When I suddenly woke up from my enchantment, Qing was already sitting there, focusing on his vivid sketch.

Among our companions was also Juan—a timid girl, who usually refused to go to the city wall with us, but I always wanted to entice her to go up once. This time finally came, on a starry night without a moon.

"Juan, why don't you come with us to the city wall tonight?" I said, laughing and pulling her hand, "You really don't know how beautiful the city wall is on an autumn night!" Due to her love for the night view and Qing's encouragement, she agreed to join us.

Our group jumped and stepped onto this city wall, which seemed even older and more vigorous at night. The autumn wind rustled like a wild goose spreading its wings, and the high sky freely stretched out and quietly rippled. Facing the great river, the dark blue water transformed into a gentle expanse of silk waves. Darkness swallowed the vast waves, leaving behind the still shadows of boats, and the lights on the water shone so sparsely in the still night air, bringing the sweetness of dreams to the night-sleeping water travelers, although, there was also lingering sorrow in their dreams. However, the night shift steamer raised its long whistle, chasing away the fatigue of the rushed travelers, but it did not shatter the tranquility of the city wall. The tranquility of the city wall was so gentle and pleasant that when we realized the comfort in our hearts, we turned our eyes to explore the darkening distant sky. Yes, you could see the starlight sinking into the horizon, the starlight dissolving into eternity, and thus, the distant river seemed even more hazy and vast.

A wisp of blue smoke slowly rose. The elderly man among us had lit his grass pipe and sat down comfortably. Was it time for him to describe a moving story again? We waited attentively. But perhaps the starry night was too beautiful, it made the old man understand the subtlety of silence, and he did not say a word for a long time.

"Could the great ancient poet Qu Yuan have drowned himself here?" Juan was no longer timid. She opened her beautiful eyes and looked at the deep river, as if expressing her feelings.

"No, that was the Xiang River; but, there is also the ideal Peach Blossom Spring of our pastoral poet here!" This time it was the old man's kind voice, the same voice as when describing a story.

"Oh, is Peach Blossom County here really the Peach Blossom Spring in the story? Then why don't we go play there?" Xiao Ming almost jumped up.

"The former Peach Blossom Spring no longer lives up to the ideal Peach Blossom Spring, and the current Peach Blossom Spring is of course even more mundane, but the people there already know how to live practically."

When silence returned to us, the starry sky suddenly became brighter and wider. I seemed to be able to see how the bay under the city was undulating. "The river surface, which has been depressed for hundreds of years, is no longer depressed today." Qing's thoughtful voice floated on the solemn ancient city wall of the autumn night.

Looking back, not far away in the city, a cluster of brilliant fire was shining.

### Nature, Music and Painting

— Sang Zi

I changed the water in the vase that Jin Minzhi placed on the piano, wanting to insert a bouquet of fresh flowers.

"You forget that it's winter," she said with a smile.

I didn't forget winter, just as I didn't forget the cold air, but there was a layer of warmth in my heart, as if I needed a bouquet of flowers to decorate it. Without winter flowers, I used paper flowers to replace them. The paper flowers were beautiful and exquisitely made like real flowers. So I was very satisfied with what I had done.

"I love everything natural." I remember this was a famous saying that I admired.

Jin Minzhi pressed her slender white fingers on the complete set of milky white piano keys and played a piece by Chopin. As the notes danced with ever-changing order, and the beautiful sound rippled into the air, I, as an outsider to music, was fascinated by the progress of the music. …

This is nature, I praised it, and then I woke up, due to the music stopping. Jin Minzhi's eyes had a questioning light, I knew her as well as I knew myself. So-called nature is the harmony of art; if so, would the paper flowers desecrate the sacredness of the famous music? Her meaning was that I laughed without disagreeing.

"I didn't smell the fragrance of flowers," she said.

"You forget that it's winter," my words were imitations. But I also said, "Please, enjoy this sunlight."

We were in a bright room with a glass roof and glass doors and windows. The winter sun filled the room. We were like flowers in a greenhouse. The glass was stained with mist, allowing the cold air outside to condense into transparent thin ice, and then letting the sun melt it again.

I praised this as nature! Jin

Jin Minzhi was afraid of the cold, tucked her hands into her sleeves, and didn't continue playing the piano. Where to seek warmth, besides the sun, I told her that the leap of fingers on the piano keys was a kind of exercise, and cold was not a terrible devil.

I didn't feel like she was listening to me. With natural reverence, she was staring at a painting hanging on the wall above the piano.

"I find warmth in there," she said emotionally, her eyes shining.

This was a small oil painting, the light-colored part being the hazy light of the sun shining in from the window sill. It swept over the beautiful flowers in the vase, swept over the innocent and sincere half-face of the beautiful little girl, and finally shone on the face of the white-haired old man holding the child, that face full of love, with the child's kiss marks.

I also found warmth in there. That painting, that is nature itself, that sunlight, that quiet room, those beautiful flowers in the vase, that old man and child, that love, that peaceful air...

When the beautiful piano sound rang out again in the room, winter was gone, the paper flowers had a fragrance, and Jin Minzhi was doing the exercise of leaping fingers. The greenhouse was spring, forever.

### Impressions of the "Yunnan Uprising"

— Shi Hua

…Recently, various theater troupes have been competing to perform scripts based on the historical facts of the Yunnan Uprising in the early Republic, such as "Cai Songpo", "Little Phoenix Fairy", "Yuan Shikai" and the hard-working "Yunnan Uprising". The background is the same era, but the angles of expression are multifaceted. "Cai Songpo" mainly shows the entire military history of the Yunnan Uprising, "Little Phoenix Fairy" is a three-dimensional portrayal of a "revolutionary woman", and "Yuan Shikai" takes the disillusionment of Yuan Shikai's imperial dream as the warp, and the generous righteousness of several revolutionaries imprisoned at the time as the weft, weaving a tragic historical drama, while the "Yunnan Uprising" directed and written by Shi Hui encompasses the three characters of Cai Songpo, Little Phoenix Fairy and Yuan Shikai, comprehensively showing how Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor and the entire historical facts of Cai Songpo's escape from Beijing.

…Since its establishment, the hard-working troupe has successively performed several good plays. The recently performed "Jin Xiaoyu" is a rare gem in the recent drama world. And Shi Hui's "Yunnan Uprising", whether in writing, directing or acting, has exceeded the previous level.

…Yuan Shikai's character has been judged in history. It can be said that the continuous warlord civil wars since the establishment of the Republic were the roots he planted. As the "Yunnan Uprising" says, "the people are the most important." The era we are in is no longer the era of imperial autocracy. Yuan Shikai did not see this point clearly, was obsessed with personal honor and wealth, fabricated popular will and presumptuously declared himself emperor, and his doomed fate was inevitable.

…Not only is there a very powerful depiction of the disillusionment of Yuan Shikai's imperial dream in "Yunnan Uprising", but also the shameless faces of the many villains surrounding Yuan Shikai (the so-called six gentlemen of the Ning'an Association) are also deeply portrayed.

…In fact, "Yunnan Uprising" should be renamed "Yuan Shikai", because the entire four-act play, except for the second act which writes about how Cai Songpo escaped, the remaining three acts are all about Yuan Shikai. The first act is the six gentlemen conspiring to restore the monarchy, the third act is Yuan Shikai appearing in imperial robes, with Gou Keming's assassination attempt as the climax, and the fourth act is Yuan Shikai's suffering and death. In terms of writing skills, Shi Hui fully used his talent and stage experience here. The tension and emotional entanglement of the atmosphere when Cai Songpo escaped, the stimulation of the climax of Gou Keming's assassination attempt, and the final death of Yuan Shikai and the righteous martyrdom of Concubine Min are all dramatic parts rarely seen in his plays.

…The Yuan Shikai in "Yuan Shikai", the playwright only uses a few strokes to outline the outline of a traitor, while the Yuan Shikai in "Yunnan Uprising", Shi Hui uses more ink, so the performance is more comprehensive and profound: greedy, cunning, arbitrary, ambitious, obliterating the interests of the people and the future of the country and nation for the sake of his own imperial wealth. He is the most important character in the whole play. Bai Wen's performance is unrestrained and vivid, quite successful, and the makeup is very similar. The disadvantage is that his innate height is too high. Others, such as Liu Quan's Cai Songpo, are very moving despite the few scenes. Shi Yuan's performance of Gou Keming's loyalty, and Wang Jun and others' caricature of the six gentlemen, have a profound ironic meaning. Shangguan Yunzhu's Little Phoenix Fairy, Shen Min's Concubine Min, and Ma Xiaonong's old madam are also above the standard.

…In short, "Yunnan Uprising" has a special and profound meaning in today's performance. It tells us that Yuan Shikai sacrificed the people for his own interests and disregarded the future of the nation, and his demise was inevitable.

In the previous issue, I also briefly described the strength of each women's team. Now, after each game, I dare to add a comment. It is not difficult to predict the difference between the strong and the weak, and the outcome of the game.

The basketball skills of the Green Team have been understood by basketball fans in Shanghai. This performance has progressed without regression. Their defensive skills, position and man-to-man marking are used together. In addition, the individual skills of the three generals are superior, and it is difficult for enemy forwards with slightly inferior skills to cross the line. The passing of their forwards is the most skilled. And in terms of blocking and inducing the enemy, they are all effective. Huang Mingyuan's good at following up under the basket is said to be no less than ordinary men, which is not an exaggeration. Therefore, it is expected that they will be able to secure the championship this time, which is almost without doubt. What is hoped is that they will not be arrogant or complacent, and will do their best to improve the level of women's basketball in Shanghai. There are high hopes for them. The entire team lineup is recorded below:

Xue Chunsheng (leader), Qian Xucang (instructor), Xie Yiqin (manager), Li Yunzhi (captain), Yan Weiwen, Huang Mingyuan, Rong Shujian, Wang Weizhen, Liu Zhenbao, Wang Yinlan, Wen Juan, Zhu Chengran, Zhang Minzhi,

San Sheng's Performance Has Improved Significantly

San Sheng has reorganized its army this time, and thanks to the active training of the team members under Liu Hesheng, there has been a lot of progress, as can be seen from the huge score against Hua Dong. The newly joined Deng Xiulin is also a basketball player in the basketball world. Her vigorous style and accurate shooting have always been admired by the author. San Sheng has gained a lot from this new force, and Chen Liuzhen's progress is also a fact. The whole team relies more on strength, and the basketball skills still need to be cultivated. There is a possibility of winning the runner-up in the competition.

Pan San Sheng (leading), Liu Hesheng (instructor), Shen Meiying (manager), Chen Meizhen (captain), Zhang Huang, Xiao Yao, Chen Liuzhen, Zhao Diqing, Lu Cuifang, Li Bo, Deng Xiuchun, Chen Ze Zhuang, Le Jiashi, Hu Meixian, Qin Zifang.

Yi Kang Does Not Disgrace the Emerging Stars

Yi Kang is led by Xu Yikang, coached by Wu Zibin, managed by Zhu Mingxing, and the captain is Wu Meiyi. The team members include old and new players, such as Diao Youlan, Zhan Xiuqiong, Ren Kuanping, Zhu Mingyue, Chen Bingrong, Wu Ailian, Li Huizhen, Huang Baoru, Huang Zhen, and Xie Lijian. The team members are generally emerging players. And their changes and sophistication in combat, and the study of basic movements (such as using a holding style for free throws, commonly known as pouring a toilet, this is the most standard basic movement). The young players of the team can all work earnestly, and the offensive with methods is also a special strength. It is a pity that the application has not yet reached perfection. Among them, Ren Kuanping is the most admirable. Given time, the team will definitely become a strong team. There is no problem with winning a seat in the *Shen Bao* Cup. In the game against San Sheng, if they can work hard as before, they are expected to climb to a higher level.

Xue Bai is Clever, Small, and Lovable

Xue Bai is a student army. The team members are clever, small, and exquisite, which makes them very lovable. Their active performance relies on their shortness to make quick movements in and out, which is exceptionally wonderful. The audience at the scene will definitely give them very good encouragement and cheers. Their leader is Chen Hanquan, the owner of the Aidekai Underwear Company. Mr. Chen is a giant in the business world and is known for his enthusiasm for basketball. He organized the Xue Bai team and hired Zhang Juefei as an instructor. Yuan Qixiang is the manager, which complements each other. Therefore, the spirit of the team members is uplifted and excited. Their forwards, Xiao Qiusheng, Jing Shuwang, and Xun Ling, know each other very well and are very tacit. The guards, Zhang Zhili, Nie Baozhu, and Huang Ruyu, are both wise and brave, but their lack of experience leads to easy fouls, which is a disadvantage. It is hoped that they will strive to improve. The reserves, Guo Aizhen, Hou Aili, Zhu Jiazhen, Bai Yune, Shi Meifeng, and Chen Wenqin, are also all promising talents. The team has a future. Encourage them.

Hua Dong's Team Members Have Good Skills

The Hua Dong team was hastily formed for this newspaper's women's competition. Although there was an organization in the past, it has been shelved for a long time. This time, thanks to the efforts of Chen Zhong, the leadership of Zhang Jiaolian, and the dispatch of Yao Ziqin, they were able to reorganize their team. However, because of its hasty establishment, the performance is inevitably inferior to the above-mentioned teams. However, their fighting spirit during the battle did not slacken due to their ultimate defeat. If they can practice more from now on, I believe that they will be able to restore their heroic appearance soon, because the individual skills of each team member are not bad. Here is the

Zhang Jiaolian (leader), Chen Zhong (instructor), Yao Ziqin (manager), Xu Ruilan (captain), Shu Zhenxiu, Wang Huafen, Lv Jingchun, Mao Huixuan, Shen Chong, Wang Qiman, Li Jingyi, Sun Fengwu, Tang Meiguang, Shen Mu.

In short, the complete organization of the five women's armies this time is unprecedented, and the spirit of the team members is so enthusiastic that they do not let the cold weather, or changes in victory or defeat, affect them, which is really something this newspaper is grateful for.

Group B Semi-Finals: Qing Xie and Shan Team Upgrade

There were two games in Group B this week. Chen Lan was overwhelmed by Qing Xie, losing by three points, which is a pity. However, Qing Xie's game is indeed commendable. The team members are full of energy and run fast. The captain, Hua Xixi, is the best among them, which is why they were able to win.

The strong players of the Pang Team were also eliminated by the Shan Team. The main reason is the departure of the main general, Dong Yangfeng, from Shanghai. However, the Shan Team has Dang Tao, a member of the Group A team, and their tactics are not bad, so they were able to defeat the Pang Team by attacking with their strengths, being agile and capable. It seems that their success was not a fluke.

Exciting Battles Next Week; Awards Ceremony on Friday After the Games

Next week, Qing Xie will play against Shan Team in the semi-finals, and Zhong Bei will compete with Ren Yu. The two winners will have to compete for the overall championship on Friday (29th) at 7:30 p.m. The women's group will also be completely finished next week. The Green Team will play against San Sheng (Monday) and San Sheng will play against Yi Kang (Wednesday), and there will be scenes appearing. On Friday (29th), in addition to the Group B finals, there will be a thrilling battle between the Green Team and Yi Kang. The awards ceremony will be held. The two teams that tied for the championship in Group A, Hua Lian and Zhong Bei, and the champions of Group B and the women's groups will all be present. This newspaper will present silver cups to the four teams and take a group photo as a souvenir.

### Prediction of Victory or Defeat, Each with Unique Insight: Prelude to the Eastern-League Showdown

Tomorrow morning (the 25th) at 10 o'clock, there will be a Charity Arts soccer match at the Yat Garden, featuring a head-to-head match between the two giants of Chinese soccer, the Tung Wah and the League of Friends. Both sides possess strong armor and sharp weapons, and a fierce battle is naturally expected. I still remember the previous encounter between the two teams at the Rubber Garden, which was packed with people, creating an unprecedented spectacle. The excitement of this performance is not hard to imagine. However, opinions diverge on who will win or lose. Mr. Fan Cun and Mr. Shi Qian both have their own views on the battle between Tung Wah and the League of Friends. We now publish the articles of these two gentlemen below.

The League of Friends Will Surely Win

Fan Cun says, "In my humble opinion, the League of Friends will surely win. Why do I say this? Because the League of Friends has been painstakingly preparing and building up its military strength this time, sweeping away the disorganization of the past. Tung Wah, on the other hand, is still the same old guard, without any reinforcements, which is a clear mistake due to excessive self-confidence. Moreover, the veteran generals are showing signs of decline, and their performance is far inferior to the previous season. In contrast, the difference in strength is immediately apparent. After the catastrophic Waterloo defeat to the Portuguese merchants, their weaknesses were exposed without disguise, and their morale was greatly affected. The League of Friends, on the other hand, has regrouped and won consecutive battles. Recently, they have even concentrated on living in barracks and practicing hard without stopping, putting in deep effort and achieving effective results.

A few days ago, they defeated the Overseas Chinese League with a score of three to two, greatly boosting their reputation and morale. Therefore, in terms of "morale," the League of Friends has already overwhelmed Tung Wah.

Furthermore, in terms of "lineup," the goalkeepers of the two teams are equally skilled, but Xian Han's recent form is better than that of Bang Lun. The inside defense of the League of Friends is much stronger. Tian Shengqi is wise and brave, impeccable. Qixiang's ability to save the ball is even better, second to none in Shanghai. Tung Wah's Li Ning and Zhuang Youren are aging heroes, feeling that their hearts are willing but their strength is lacking. The weak defense and frequent troubles in the penalty area are Tung Wah's fatal wounds, which cannot be denied. As for the midfield line, the three generals of the League of Friends can both defend and attack, forming an impregnable fortress. Tung Wah's Liang Shutang lacks stamina, and Lin Gen has courage but no strategy, relying only on the veteran Xin to support the team. Although Tung Wah's forwards are said to be sharp, they often struggle to penetrate the enemy's lines. Their weakness lies in Zai Lin, who is easily blocked, and whose position is too far behind to score goals. A Dai's passing is good, but his age makes it difficult for him to charge and break through. Sun Laojin's recent form is poor, and he lacks the power of last season. Only the young and strong Youliang and Longhai Li Zhuang are fierce and formidable. On the other hand, the League of Friends this season has seen Li Yichen's efforts, Gao Xiuqing and Zhou Qilin's willingness to fight, and the young general Luo Shoufu's special performance. The front line is full of vitality, and its power is definitely not inferior to Tung Wah. In comparison, the League of Friends' lineup is more organized.

Due to the above reasons, unless there is an abnormal psychological state or special circumstances (such as the absence of a main general or injury and departure from the field), there is no reason why the League of Friends should not win tomorrow's battle. Therefore, I say, "The League of Friends will surely win."

Tung Wah Can Win

Shi Qian comments, "The way for Tung Wah to win against the League of Friends is extremely simple. The entire Tung Wah team is united and determined, and their morale is therefore strong. This is what is meant by 'those who gain the support of the people can be invincible and conquer everything.' Therefore, they should not be underestimated simply because of one defeat to the Portuguese merchants. In fact, Tung Wah has many tactics to defeat the League of Friends. The League of Friends' forward line seems to be gradually becoming normal, but Tung Wah's defense can use a one-on-one strategy. Moreover, they are very familiar with each other's play styles. Therefore, although Tung Wah's defense is weaker, it is not difficult to make the League of Friends' forward line, which has not yet reached a high level, feel helpless. Tung Wah's five forwards each have their own strengths, with their own unique characteristics. They can go straight in along the sides and cut in at the top. This is definitely not comparable to the League of Friends' two. Moreover, the two inside forwards are also fierce, with Longhai being strong and A Sun having a path. With Dai Zhongfeng's ability to assist, even if the League of Friends' defense is strong, it will be difficult to stop their edge. What is even more obvious is that Li Tiansheng is definitely not a match for Jia Youliang. This is actually the only route for Tung Wah's attack, and it is not impossible to rely on it for success. Moreover, the victory or defeat of a team should be based on the team with a stronger attack being able to win. In other words, the team with more attacks also has more opportunities. Understanding this, there is no doubt that Tung Wah can win against the League of Friends."
