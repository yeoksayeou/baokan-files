Editorial: Reforming Shanghai's Economy

We said the day before yesterday that Shanghai is the economic center of the country. The so-called "center" is because its essence has a leading role. If Shanghai's economy tends towards normal prosperity or towards recession, it can lead the economies of all parts of the country to also tend towards prosperity or recession. However, the current Shanghai economy has already produced many kinds of morbidity, becoming the center of China's economic morbidity, so it is very likely to lead the economies of all parts of the country to also tend towards a morbid path. For example, skyrocketing prices started in Shanghai; hoarding and speculation started in Shanghai; and industrial decline also started in Shanghai. Even the past stock market speculation started in Shanghai, and loose capital from all over the country moved to Shanghai, concentrating its target here.

Economic morbidity gradually evolved over the past year, and has now reached a very serious stage. The center of economic morbidity is the price problem. I remember that at the beginning of last year, when the hoarding wind was fierce, prices rose in a straight line. Until mid-March, the authorities, in view of the white-hot speculation and hoarding and the skyrocketing prices, specially organized the National Commercial Control Association to promote a controlled economy in the form of a commercial autonomous organization. In early April, they sent personnel to thoroughly investigate hoarding and speculation in the Shanghai market and ordered the Central Trust of China to tighten interbank lending and announced regulations punishing hoarding of commodities, and prices were slightly stabilized. However, after June, due to the reduction and late delivery of household rice, the black market price of rice soared. On the one hand, loose capital turned to stocks due to the crackdown on hoarding, causing the stock market to soar and prices to rise accordingly. In early August, the government's purchase of cotton cloth was a diagnosis of the disease, and stocks and prices were temporarily stabilized. After October, credit gradually eased, the stock market rose again, and rice and coal daily necessities were in short supply, and prices fluctuated again. By late January of this year, after the Lunar New Year, due to numerous rumors, prices skyrocketed and stocks plummeted, plunging the entire Shanghai economy into a chaotic and serious state of morbidity, which continues to this day.

The majority of citizens are the first to bear the brunt of economic morbidity, and their lives are the most difficult and painful. The majority of citizens are salaried workers, and the increase in their income permanently lags behind the rise in prices. A low-level member of an educational institution, with a family of five, eats at least six dou of rice per month, but one month's income is not enough to buy three dou of rice, so they can only change rice to porridge, and three meals to two meals. When going to the office, they wear shoes barefoot, because clothes and shoes must be worn, but socks can be omitted, but it is not to save money, but because they cannot afford to buy socks. Their hardship is like this.

So, what are the reasons for causing economic morbidity? We can summarize several points:

Unscrupulous officials collude with speculative merchants to seek profits together. Speculative merchants use political power to carry out their speculative tricks, so they collude with unscrupulous officials. Unscrupulous officials speculate secretly to fulfill their desire to make money, so they collude with speculative merchants. Legitimate and regular merchants who do not engage in collusion with speculators are without exception at a loss. Unscrupulous merchants who only engage in collusion are without exception nouveau riche.

Speculative merchants, by any means, take profit-making as their goal. As long as they can make money, they will hoard and speculate in stocks. As long as there is a temporary profit to be made, they will not hesitate to pursue those who harm others to benefit themselves, and even those who harm others and themselves (referring to reputation) are happy to do so. As a result, all government production plans become mere formalities, and although there is a lot of loose capital, it cannot be guided into the right track.

The destruction of Chongqing and the Communist Party, the creation of rumors, and the dispersal of people's hearts have created social panic and economic insecurity. This makes everyone afraid to tend towards Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and dare not invest in legitimate enterprises. At the extreme of the evolution, a part of the economic circles who pursue huge profits embrace the "grab one penny if you can" doctrine. A part of those who are solely concerned with their own welfare only seek to solve their own lives and do not consider the masses. This leads the entire economic circle, the entire Shanghai, on the path of destruction.

The above is about the causes of economic morbidity, but the ability of the causes to generate and even function naturally has its exploitable gaps. What is the "gap"? We believe that the first is that there are too many and too complicated economic institutions, with overlapping structures, so it is very easy to restrict and obstruct, and it is extremely difficult to divide labor and cooperate. The subtle relationship of using restrictions is regarded as a way to make money. For example, there are all kinds of control institutions and price institutions, vertical and horizontal. The second is that personnel are not sound, because there are too many officials, the employment of people is complicated, and there are many malpractices. For example, in the past, there were cases of fraud by employees of the Rice Control Association, such as a few unscrupulous employees of the price agency defrauding merchants, such as the case of embezzlement of military grain that the National Government thoroughly investigated the day before yesterday, and so on.

In short, Shanghai's economic morbidity has reached a serious point. We have said it many times that the economic crisis cannot be saved by economic forces alone, so we advocate that political reforms must be carried out first, and that political and economic forces must be managed together in order to be effective. First, economic institutions must be unified, whether it is economic administrative institutions, or ruling institutions, or price institutions. Second, for the economic system, no matter whether you choose the special situation of Shanghai that is suitable for the situation in China, third, the leaders of economic institutions must be experts, and the staff must be carefully selected. Only when the organization is unified and the personnel are sound can we talk about increasing production and suppressing prices. Only by reforming Shanghai's economic morbidity and giving full play to the leading role of the national economy towards normality can we promote true Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and truly cooperate with the Allied powers to win the victory of the Greater East Asia War.

### Shanghai Cotton Cloth Temporary Rationing Method Approved, Materials Control Review Committee Holds Meeting

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Materials Control Review Committee of the Executive Yuan held its 12th committee meeting at 3:00 PM on the 13th. Those present included Chairman Zhou Fo Hai, Secretary-General Yuan Nian Xian, Committee Members Chun Jun, Xiang Jing Fang, He Bing Xian, Jiang Zuo Xuan, Chen Zhi Shuo, Xue Feng Yuan, Tang Shou Min (replaced by He Yuanji), Wen Lan Ting (replaced by Lai Ge), Yuan Zun Deng (replaced by Luo Na), Shao Shi Jun (replaced by Shao Qigui), Chen Guang Zhong, Gan Shi Tao, Lao Yu, Pan Wen Xian, etc., Japanese committee members Inai, Tano, Okuda, Sakata, Kamiyama, etc., Secretariat Suzuki, Ishiguro, Egawa, and some other personnel. The Chairman submitted a matter for discussion, according to a report from the National Business Control Association, stating that the Shanghai Cloth Industry Guild had submitted a report on the temporary rationing of cloth in Shanghai, requesting that wholesalers be allowed to handle it, requesting a review and determination of the exact profit numbers for wholesalers and retailers, etc., and continued to submit temporary rationing methods and notices for purchasing cloth, requesting a decision on the case. It was resolved to pass the original proposal. The Chairman submitted a matter for discussion, according to a report from the National Business Control Association, stating that the price standard for cotton yarn and cloth rationing had been officially announced by decree, and regarding the yarn and cloth allocated to various factories for processing, it must still be returned, and only processing fees and appropriate profits need to be paid, and there are no prices specified. However, for factories that use yarn and cloth as raw materials, should the rationing price of the yarn and cloth they use be slightly lower than the rationing price for retailers, requesting a review and response, etc., requesting a decision on the case. It was resolved that the National Business Control Association should handle it at its discretion depending on the situation. The Chairman submitted a matter for discussion, according to a report from the National Business Control Association, stating that the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai had been allowed to hand over the unfinished transaction volume for 1943. When implementing the centralized rationing plan, it seems appropriate to handle it in a unified manner. In addition to writing to the embassy to request consideration, how should the price of moving out cotton products, which has not yet been approved, be handled? Requesting a review and response, etc., requesting that the 3,500 bales of 20-count cotton yarn should still be allocated to the company according to the 1943 transaction plan to subsidize the company in opening up the rivers in the Nantong and Haimen cotton-producing areas, requesting a review and response on each point, etc. It was considered that the National Business Control Association had already reviewed and commented on the points requested by the company, and there was nothing wrong with it, so it could be approved, and it had been submitted to the Executive Yuan for ratification. It was resolved that the ratification be approved.

Road Police Section Chief Embezzlement Case Under Strict Investigation

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - Shi Lubin, the former section chief of the Shanghai section of the Road Police Administration Office of the Ministry of Construction, was found to have engaged in illegal embezzlement during his tenure. After the ministry investigated and confirmed the facts, the inquiry records of the official were sent to the Capital Local Prosecutor's Office for legal action on the 5th. The local prosecutor's office believes that the case is serious and is currently under strict investigation. As soon as the investigation is completed, it will be submitted to the Capital.

The Practice of the New Policy Towards China

It has been more than a year since the implementation of the New Policy Towards China, and its progress has been slow. It is urgent to study the reasons for this in order to promote it smoothly in the future. The New Policy was announced on March 11 of last year and was concretized in the "Temporary Procedures for the Control of the Movement of Materials in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River" which came into effect on the 16th. Its purpose is to liquidate the separatist tendencies of various agencies under the Nationalist Government that arbitrarily restrict the movement of materials, and to open up the path for the revival and unification of China's economy. At the same time, it is expected that the Chinese side, based on its creativity and responsibility, will establish a controlled economy and reorganize all the economic forces in Shanghai, China's economic base, and mobilize them in the Sino-Japanese "co-existence and co-death" decisive battle. With the efforts of leaders in Shanghai's financial circles, the "National Commercial Control Association" was first formed before and after the implementation of the aforementioned "Temporary Procedures." Leaders in Shanghai's financial circles welcomed the new Japanese policy, opening up a path to break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese opposition and Sino-Japanese economic relations. The people under the rule of the Nationalist Government do not cooperate with the Nationalist Government. However, even after the Nationalist Government entered the war, Shanghai merchants still bought enemy securities and currencies at high prices and engaged in hoarding and speculation, impoverishing the people's livelihood. Faced with this reality, Japan's New Policy Towards China should strive for practical implementation, and its goal should also be "nurturing war and nurturing the people" as President Wang Jingwei said.

However, if we do not face the above-mentioned reality, the promotion of the policy will inevitably be distorted and become an insurmountable barrier, causing the New Policy to enter an unexpected direction. We think that in the past, entrusting special Japanese companies or combinations to monopolize the purchase and distribution of materials made Sino-Japanese economic relations sluggish, and we should first liquidate the concept of Sino-Japanese opposition. If we support the autonomous development of Chinese industrialists and entrust the distribution and purchase of materials to their creativity and responsibility, we can promote the exchange of materials and revive and increase production in the peaceful areas. Thus, the people under the rule of the Guomindang can create material strength and nurture war strength, and participate in the war without being asked.

Strengthening the Controlled Economy

In short, the complex situation on the ground is sufficient to hinder the understanding of the guiding principles of the New Policy and slow down its implementation speed. Since the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, its subordinate institutions, such as various specialized control groups, have gradually been organized, and thus the economy under the rule of the Nationalist Government has also jumped from a liberal economy to a stage of controlled economy. But

The administrative institutions of the Nationalist Government are not yet complete. Today, in the absence of officials with clear economic administration, many places cannot help but allow the National Commercial Control Association and various specialized control groups to operate autonomously.

The Chinese economy is now still dominated by the feudal national body's "gangs." These "gangs" are extremely self-protective, with the profit-making concept as their characteristic, so they should be incorporated into the National Commercial Control Association to avoid their antipathy to the controlled economy.

Since the Incident, the commercial network connecting the inland with Shanghai has been destroyed, and the financial routes have also been cut off. Merchants are keen on speculation, and collude with corrupt officials to seek huge profits. Merchants and industrialists with a conscience are hesitant to move forward. The purpose of promoting the establishment of the Commercial Tax Association is to curb the rampant activities of unscrupulous merchants, to maintain the order of the Shanghai economy, and to enable righteous merchants and industrialists to have the opportunity to rise again.

Price countermeasures in the peaceful areas cannot be ignored. However, the so-called low-price policy in price control hinders the circulation of materials and creates opportunities for hoarding and speculation. Therefore, the goal of promoting the controlled economy under the rule of the Nationalist Government should first be to restore the normal functioning of the economy in order to increase and revive production. This is the primary meaning.

When purchasing inland materials, the determination of the purchase price, the transportation of purchased materials, and the expansion of exchanged materials should be subject to appropriate instructions from the central and local organs of the Nationalist Government and the Japanese military and political organs, or entrusted to local cooperatives. However, because the relevant discussion is complicated, the instructions are inconsistent, and the responsibility is not clear, the operators do not know what to do. Therefore, there should no longer be those who hold "special status" and do not agree with the "autonomous development of the Chinese side."

Thoroughly Implement the Policy

In short, the deadlock in Sino-Japanese economic relations is due to the slow speed of implementing the New Policy, which is quite unable to satisfy the expectations of the Chinese side. To complete the Sino-Japanese war of coexistence and co-death, Japan must thoroughly implement the "New Policy Towards China." Chongqing is also closely watching the results of the "thorough implementation," so its relationship is of great importance. (Xiang: Translated from the West Japan Asahi Newspaper of February 15)

### Rice Control Committee Purchases Rice and Implements Bartering, Using Daily Necessities to Exchange for Rice from Farmers

Central News Agency report: The Rice Control Committee, in order to strengthen rice collection and promote unified collection and distribution, has now decided to implement rice purchase through bartering. All material purchase coupons have been printed and will soon be distributed to local offices, which will then distribute them to rice procurement preparers, who will use them to exchange for rice from farmers. It is expected that the rice control work will be promoted more smoothly. The summary of the key points for implementing material exchange for rice procurement is as follows: In principle, the material allocation process must first go through the existing allocation channels of the National Commercial Control Association. Therefore, "Material Exchange Distribution Points for Rice Procurement" are established and staffed by the Commercial Control Association's allocation agencies. After the National Commercial Control Association prepares the material purchase coupons, they will be handed over to the Rice Control Committee, which will then (with the seal of the Director) distribute them to local offices according to the rice procurement plan. The local offices (with the seal of the Director) will distribute them to the Japanese-supported rice purchase cooperative members and the Chinese preparers in their respective regions. The purchase cooperative members and preparers will issue them to the rice shops, who will then issue them to the farmers. When collecting rice, a purchase coupon equivalent to 20% of the rice payment will be given, but this is not allowed for amounts within 200 yuan (i.e., when the value of the rice collected is less than 1,000 yuan). The purchase coupons are only valid within the jurisdiction of the issuing office and cannot be used in other areas. The purchase coupons are divided into three types: white, blue, and red. Farmers who receive these purchase coupons can use them to exchange for any of the items listed on the coupon, but the quantities are limited as follows: White coupon: 3.5 yards of cotton cloth, 0.2 bars of soap, 1.2 boxes of matches, 0.04 jin of white sugar, 3 packs of cigarettes. Blue coupon: 17.5 yards of cotton cloth, 1 bar of soap, 6 boxes of matches, 0.2 jin of sugar, 15 packs of cigarettes. Red coupon: 35 yards of cotton cloth, 2 bars of soap, 12 boxes of matches, 0.4 jin of sugar, 30 packs of cigarettes. However, in southern Anhui, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu, there is also an allocation of candles, and the quantities are specified on the coupons. Those who hand in rice worth 1,000 yuan will receive one white coupon, those who hand in rice worth 5,000 yuan will receive one blue coupon, those who hand in rice worth 10,000 yuan will receive one red coupon, and so on. Purchase coupons are only issued to those who hand in rice. The validity period of the purchase coupons is set at 90 days from the date of issue (as indicated by the Rice Control Committee).

### 65th Round of Rice Rations to be Sold Starting Tomorrow: Two Sheng of White or Brown Rice, One Jin of Flour

### Cotton Control Committee to Change Name to Cotton Industry Control Committee; Cotton Management Office to be Merged

The Cotton Management Office under the National Commercial Control Association is the agency responsible for purchasing and distributing yarn and cloth. The Cotton Control Committee is the agency responsible for purchasing cotton raw materials. Since the two agencies deal with completely identical materials, they should not be separated in terms of control work. Now, in order to unify the control structure, the association plans to merge the yarn and cloth distribution task of the Cotton Management Office into a department under the Cotton Control Committee, and change the name of the Cotton Control Committee to the Cotton Industry Control Committee, so that one entity handles everything. It is reported that this proposal has been reviewed and deemed feasible by Committee Member Zhou of the Materials Control Review Committee and will be publicly implemented pending approval from higher authorities.

There are still a large number of items stored in outside warehouses. The owners of the goods often sell them repeatedly, and the addresses are unknown or have been changed repeatedly, making it impossible to reach them. It is heard that the committee's cotton yarn and cotton cloth transaction matters are mostly ready, and the outstanding cases are in urgent need of closure. All sealed cotton yarns and cotton cloths, such as those that have been legally applied for sale, and those that have been supplemented with applications for sale, or those that have been approved by the Commercial Control Association to be retained, are all required to be collected from today until April 20th. All owners should collect all documents and submit them in writing to the committee office on the third floor of 304 Huangpi Road (Old Route Maresca) for verification. If the category, quantity, and storage location are consistent with the sales application, the seal will be lifted immediately.

It is hoped that the owners of the goods will go to the warehouses or storage areas to personally inspect them and avoid delays. If there is any case of borrowing names, obstructing, or making things difficult, it can be reported to the committee for investigation and severe punishment.

### Economic Circles Dredge Materials in Various Places to Increase Raw Material Supply; Officials and Merchants Discuss and Reach Consensus

The authorities in charge of managing prices have recently repeatedly convened the chairmen or persons in charge of major commodity trade associations to cordially discuss important issues such as suppressing prices, dredging sources of materials, how to manage trade buying and selling, and cracking down on hoarding. The opinions of officials and merchants were very harmonious during the meeting. On stabilizing industry and commerce, they contributed methods and jointly believed that (A) the recent high prices were caused on one hand by illegal hoarding and speculation, and on the other hand by the difficulty of material procurement and transportation, and the excessive distance between regional prices, resulting in the production area not intending to release all materials at the price, forming an oversupply in one place and an over-demand in another. (B) In order to thoroughly suppress prices, the first priority is to find ways to dredge materials in various places on a large scale, promote smooth and unobstructed flow, and increase the bargaining chips for finished products or raw materials supply. At the same time, all large and small banks immediately stop any form of mortgage lending, and strictly prohibit the silver houses themselves from absorbing any kind of materials in various industry markets in disguise. The second priority is to thoroughly strengthen the organizational structure of the industry associations themselves, so that people outside the industry or scalpers cannot participate in it. Afterwards, the price of materials operated by the companies and firms in each industry will be authorized and the association will be responsible. If those who do not comply with the military buying and selling, the association shall be fully responsible, and the authorities will punish them according to law. It is heard that the authorities are quite happy to accept it and will gradually adopt and implement it.
