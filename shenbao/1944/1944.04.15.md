### After the Establishment of the Economic Security Bureau

The Economic Security Bureau of the First Police Station in this city was officially established on the 13th. The police authorities issued separate statements, elucidating the meaning of the establishment and the missions it bears. We feel a particularly deep expectation for the establishment of this new institution, and the reasons for this expectation are twofold: First, we have always valued Shanghai's position as an important rear base in the Greater East Asia War and the economic center of the country. If economic measures are put on the right track, they will generate great power, contribute to the war, and ensure the grasp of victory. However, judging from the facts, until now, the phenomenon in Shanghai's economic circles has not exerted the power it should have as an economic center, nor has it fulfilled its mission as an important rear base. On the contrary, economic measures have taken an off-track development, forming a chaotic phenomenon. Now that the Economic Security Bureau has been established, it can adjust the economic chaos from now on and guide the off-track development to the right track. This is one of the reasons worthy of expectation. Second, from the perspective of improving people's livelihood, the lives of Shanghai's five million citizens are most closely related to economic issues. In the past, because of the off-track economic measures, hoarding and speculation were formed, and prices soared, which seriously threatened the lives of citizens. Now that the Economic Security Bureau has been established, it can adjust economic measures from now on and gradually eliminate the threats to citizens' lives. This is another reason worthy of expectation.

Therefore, based on the above two points, we believe that the meaning and mission of the establishment of the Economic Security Bureau should be to fully realize that Shanghai's economic strength is sufficient to contribute to the Greater East Asia War, and that Shanghai's economic strength is sufficient to improve the lives of its citizens. These two goals are the entire working principle of the Economic Security Bureau, and all measures and activities should be aimed at these two goals. Of course, we believe that the police authorities and the staff of the Economic Security Bureau have complete and detailed work plans in mind. However, we would like to take advantage of the initial stage and offer our humble opinions.

The "Economic Security Bureau," as the name suggests, focuses on the words "security." Therefore, all facts and causes that disturb the peace of the economic sphere and hinder the peace of the economic sphere must be thoroughly eliminated and curbed to maintain peace. Furthermore, not only should we passively eliminate and curb the facts and causes of unrest in the economic sphere, but we should also actively cultivate the power to maintain peace. For example, those in the economic sphere who do not distinguish between officials and merchants, and who rely on political power to seek exorbitant profits, should be severely cracked down on immediately. When cracking down, even if there is a political background, we should not hesitate to implement it with great determination. In other words, any behavior deemed to hinder economic security, regardless of whether it has a political background or the size of the incident, should be treated equally and cracked down on in the same way. To be honest, the practice of letting go of big fish and catching small fish is actually a futile trick. Legitimate merchants should be protected. If they occasionally violate regulations, they should be given guidance first so as not to be subjected to unexpected troubles. Secondly, war-time production increase work must be protected, and any unhealthy conditions that hinder production increase should be assisted in eliminating. The execution procedures and penalties should be based on war-time laws and regulations.

Confucius said, "If one cannot rectify oneself, how can one rectify others?" Finally, we solemnly offer these two sentences to the staff of the Economic Security Bureau. The most difficult thing for the Security Bureau itself is still the issue of sound personnel. We have reviewed past economic institutions and control institutions, and there have been countless instances of those who took advantage of opportunities and positions to extort merchants. Therefore, the Economic Security Bureau absolutely needs personnel with transcendent character; otherwise, it will not only lose the meaning of its establishment but will also become a tool for disturbing the people. What is gratifying is that Director Mr. Gotō is a typical Japanese soldier, fair and selfless, and leads people well. There are also many experts assisting him. At the same time, we hope that citizens, especially those in the economic sphere, will fully cooperate and truthfully report and expose any instances of extortion or illegal activities, because the cooperation of citizens can ensure the smooth progress of security work, which will benefit the citizens themselves.

Recently, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has increased its strength, and the British Air Force is also attempting to advance into the mainland, fantasizing about cutting off the Japanese army's rear supply lines and even attempting to bomb the Japanese mainland, and is working to increase base construction and strengthen its forces. But in fact, it is all for relative use. This kind of joint operation between Chongqing, Britain, and the United States cannot exert any power.

### Completed by the End of This Month - The Ministry of Food Rushes to Complete Closing - Ample Supply of Wheat Flour in the Beijing Area

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) In order to further strengthen wartime food administration, the National Government authorities decided at the 45th Supreme National Defense Conference yesterday to abolish the Ministry of Food. The original affairs under the jurisdiction of the ministry will be transferred to the Ministry of Industry for continued handling. It is deeply believed that under the unified management of the authorities of the Ministry of Industry in the future, the future of food will definitely become brighter. It is now learned that the Ministry of Food has been rushing to complete the closing after receiving the order, and it is expected to complete the matter before the end of this month. From May 1st, it will be officially transferred to the Ministry of Industry for handling.

### In the Burma-India Campaign, There are Differences of Opinion Between Britain, the United States, and Chongqing

The Problem of the Supply War

Recently, Chongqing has been frequently using the term supply war. This is related to the fact that the US frontline headquarters recently suddenly emphasized the importance of the Chinese mainland front. The necessary condition for defeating Japan is to use China's large population and unique weapons to drive it to the forefront of the war against Japan. For Chongqing, the supply of military supplies is a prerequisite. On the one hand, cutting off the supply of military supplies to the southern occupied territories that Japan has suddenly occupied is also one of the most important conditions for carrying out the war. Therefore, the current decisive battle is the supply war, and the winner in this supply war can achieve the final victory. The proposal to link the anti-Axis bases in the Pacific and the Chinese mainland, called the "Nimitz Offensive," is the same.

The enemy regards the Japanese army's offensive on the Burma-India border as the second western front, especially the advance in the Fukang area, which not only cuts off the Ledo Road but also threatens air transport to India and Chongqing. Therefore, Chongqing and the United States are deeply embarrassed by the Japanese army's offensive in that area. Stilwell personally went to the front line, and the US military commander dismissed Chen Cheng, the commander-in-chief of the Chongqing army, due to the unfavorable war situation, and Wei Lihuang succeeded him. The British Indian army also sent reinforcements from the Acham border to defend. Currently, Chongqing's Burma-India operations are solely for ensuring the supply war on the Ledo Road. When the spokesperson of the Military Commission met with reporters on February 18, he said:

"The purpose of the operation in northern Burma is to defend the Burma Road. Although our current operations are small-scale, they are of great strategic significance."

On February 20, Chongqing's English newspaper "The Minsheng Pioneer" published a lengthy article on the supply war and the Burma-India operations, the main points of which are as follows:

"In the past, MacArthur said: If the Chinese army is supplied with sufficient weapons and trained, it can drive the Japanese army out of the Chinese mainland and end the current tragic struggle. He also argued that mere blockade and bombing cannot defeat Japan. To destroy Japanese military fortresses, the Japanese army must be defeated. These words clearly indicate that China must be immediately replenished with many weapons within the possible scope. MacArthur's proposal is the same as that of Nimitz, Stilwell, Sinaut and other US frontline commanders. We are very pleased, but today all the weapons and equipment supplied to China cannot but be transported by air across the most dangerous mountain terrain in the world. If there is a land route here, it can supply a large number of military supplies to the Chinese battlefield. In this sense, we hope that the supply war in northern Burma will be won quickly."

Defending the Ledo Road

However, what is noteworthy here is that Chongqing and the United States are extremely concerned about the Japanese army's offensive on the Burma-India border, while the British attitude seems extremely indifferent. Moreover, their goal is to restore the entire territory of Burma, while Chongqing's goal is only to defend the incomplete Ledo Road. The British attitude towards the offensive on the Burma-India border is only to focus on defending India and only hopes to prevent the Japanese army from entering India before the rainy season. Some British people's tendency also gives very little evaluation to the value of the operation to regain Burma. This is because Britain has no energy to take care of the East Asian front before the European front is over.

However, Chongqing is very dissatisfied with Britain's ability to do this, and there are often frictions between the Chongqing army and the British army on the front line. The Chongqing army's feelings towards the US army are also disgusted by the US army's arrogance. Moreover, the British army does not like the US forces entering and exiting the Burmese battlefield and is guarding and jealous. Before the Japanese army's fierce attack, the bond between the Chongqing, US, and British armies was not strong, so they had to gradually retreat. The Chongqing authorities took the difficulty of the supply war and took the defensive, and strongly wanted to attach a positive meaning, but it was only because they saw that the recovery of Burma was hopeless.

At the same time, Stilwell and Suttert-Me frequently promoted the strengthening of the Sino-Indian air force, because Chongqing itself revealed that it could not hope to obtain the necessary materials for a counter-offensive against Japan by land. The advance of the Indian National Army, which is not used in India, also has an extremely terrible influence on the Chinese people. This can be clearly understood from the fact that Chongqing has kept silent on this matter. The enemy of the Indian nationalist movement, the British army, joined hands to defeat the Indian National Army. This is a fatal blow to the Chongqing aspect that advocates nationalism. They are fully exposed because they took this contradiction in the Burmese and Indian battles, and they are extremely afraid of being isolated by the Japanese army's preemptive attack.

### Japanese and Indian Armies Conduct a Flanking Operation - The Enemy in Meilang Begins to Retreat - The Imphal Basin is Already Encircled

Yangon, 14th (Central News Agency) The Japanese and Indian armies, consisting of the 37th Brigade of the 23rd Division and the thousands of remnants of the 17th Division of the enemy forces that had been tied up in the Imphal area from the Telpen Pass, have been advancing towards the highlands west of Meilang while sweeping away the defeated troops, echoing the forces approaching the rear of Meilang. A certain unit on the Moro front launched a large-scale attack on the enemy forces located on the highway from Bishnupur to Imphal on the 10th. Since the 11th, the vanguard troops have launched a fierce attack on the enemy forces at Tairenpoppi, 10 kilometers west of Bishnupur, and on the Shirkit highway near the Limataka River west of that location. As a result of the rapid advance of the Japanese army, the retreat route of a part of the enemy's Fourth Army in the Imphal Basin has been cut off. Moreover, the enemy forces in Meilang have begun to retreat due to the Japanese army's flanking operation. The enemy forces in the Imphal Basin are gradually being encircled by the Japanese army and are therefore in a state of chaos.

Bayar Fortress Launches a Bayonet Fight

Yangon, 14th (Central News Agency) The Japanese army's attack on the Bayar Fortress is imminent, so the enemy is greatly panicked and burned down the large dense forest around the fortress in an attempt to prevent the Japanese army from advancing. The Japanese and Indian armies are now fiercely attacking the stubborn enemy with flames.

Yangon, 14th (Central News Agency) In the area about 10 kilometers east of Bayar, a key point between Tamu and Imphal, the Japanese and Indian allied forces and the stubborn enemy are launching a magnificent charge war every day. The main force of the enemy's 20th Division is defending Bayar to the death. On both sides of the strong position of Tenno Barr, about 15 kilometers southeast of the location, there are countless bunkers. The area between Tenno Barr and Seybaum (6 kilometers northwest of Tenno Barr) and Shenam (6 kilometers west of Tenno Barr) has been built into a strip-shaped position. Mines are buried in front of the enemy's positions, and iron nets are laid horizontally in three layers. The surrounding area is a mountainous area, but the Japanese and Indian allied forces are gradually conquering them one by one, suddenly approaching Bayar. On the 10th of this month, the allied forces broke through the center of the enemy's position with flesh bombs under the rain of flying bombs, and then used a surprise attack at night to repeatedly attack the enemy's important bunkers. They are now forcing the stubborn enemy and advancing westward. In addition, another unit of the Japanese and Indian allied forces launched a bayonet fight against the enemy's bunkers in Xidanga, a 40-50 degree slope, on the evening of the 10th, and finally broke through it and is now expanding the results of the battle. This kind of deep position offensive and defensive war is actually the key to determining the fate of the enemy's Fourth Army in Imphal, so the enemy's resistance is also extremely fierce. The tragic nature of the fierce battle there is beyond imagination.

### Fierce Air Battle Occurs Over New Guinea - 18 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down

East East, 14th (Central News Agency) On the 11th, at 9:50 in the morning, a Japanese aircraft team encountered an enemy aircraft team composed of 30 B47 aircraft, 20 B24 aircraft, and 40 medium-sized aircraft near Weiwajin on New Guinea Island. They engaged them in battle and shot down 17 B47 aircraft and one B24 aircraft. One Japanese aircraft did not return, and three aircraft were severely damaged.

### Wallace's Visit to Chongqing

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) German News Agency Report: US officials announced yesterday that US Vice President Wallace will go to Chongqing. This matter has attracted attention from all walks of life to the relationship between Washington and Chongqing. In any case, Washington political figures and newspapers are happily discussing the matter. Washington pointed out that the US side needs to have personal contact with Chongqing in order to change the relationship. General speculation is that Wallace's visit to Chongqing is related to the Japanese army's attack on India and the panic in Chongqing. This move by the Japanese army has made the reopening of the Burma Road a bubble, and Chiang Kai-shek attacked Burma in the hope that Roosevelt would fulfill his promise after the Cairo Conference. According to news from Washington, Wallace went to Chongqing to show goodwill at Roosevelt's personal request, but it is said that due to the European war, the possibility of the US side assisting the Chongqing side is relatively limited. It is believed that Wallace will return to the United States before the Democratic Party Memorial Day, and it is implied that when Wallace is in the United States, Roosevelt may ask Willkie to serve as Vice President.

### Philippine Chinese Promote Diligence Movement

Manila, 14th (Central News Agency) The Philippine Chinese Association believes that the Chinese people have a greater responsibility in wartime. In order to respond to the Philippine national diligence movement and the Japanese diligence work movement, it was decided at the Chinese conference to organize diligence and public service. Currently, more than 15,000 Chinese men aged 16 to 60 are working in units of Baos and Jias, respectively, engaging in the construction and defense of the Philippines since the 10th.

### British and American Intensify Diplomatic Offensive Towards Neutral Countries; Berlin Authorities Closely Watching

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to Hsu Luo-te, a correspondent for the Haitong News Agency, Britain and America are attempting to undermine the neutrality of Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Sweden, and Ireland, compelling the aforementioned countries to provide economic support solely to Britain and America. The German Foreign Ministry is closely monitoring this situation. According to experts at the Foreign Ministry, Germany emphasizes the following points: Providing one-sided economic support to belligerent nations constitutes an end to neutrality. Britain and America are using pressure, disrespecting the rights of neutral countries, disregarding international agreements, and announcing blacklists, completely ignoring the sovereignty of neutral nations. London's "Daily Mail" asserts that there can be no true neutral countries in this war, stating that the anti-Axis powers can utilize resources from neutral countries to fight Germany, while Germany cannot. If Britain and America succeed in these steps, only the Soviet Union will benefit. Newspapers from various countries unanimously advocate maintaining economic neutrality, explaining that Germany exchanges goods deemed necessary that the anti-Axis powers cannot supply, with neutral countries. Hsu Luo-te continues, stating that information has been received that after Hull made demands, diplomatic actions, threatened by economic blockades, have been taken against Turkey, Spain, and Sweden. In reality, the recent measures taken against Turkey, Spain, and Ireland differ little from economic blockades. The Turkish government continues to maintain its policy from the outbreak of the war. Due to geographical reasons, Swedish industry will be affected if Germany's coal supply is stopped. "Berlin Evening News" reports that London is attempting to create the impression that this diplomatic offensive is closely linked to an invasion of the European continent. The anti-Axis powers hope to halt Germany's imports, thereby hindering Germany's military production. The newspaper believes that economic pressure on neutral countries may put them in a difficult situation, but it will never seriously affect German military industry. This political strategy cannot replace decisive battles on the battlefield.

### Switzerland Supplying Materials to Germany; Britain and America Protest

Stockholm, 14th (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency reports: It has been announced that the British and American ministers here jointly delivered a note to the Swedish Foreign Ministry yesterday afternoon. The contents concern trade between Sweden and Germany and its allies. It is widely believed that this is one of Britain and America's methods of pressuring neutral countries. Authoritative sources told the Haitong News Agency reporter last night that the Swedish government may exchange views with other neutral governments before submitting a response, especially since there is a precedent with Switzerland. As for Sweden's attitude towards cutting off trade with Germany, it can be seen in the recent unanimous opposition to Hull's remarks in Swedish newspapers.

Stockholm, 14th (China-Britain News Agency) - According to a London dispatch, the British government has instructed its ambassador to Turkey, Hugheson, to protest to the Turkish government about Turkey's supply of materials to the Axis powers.

### British and American Discussing Emergency Issues

Lisbon, 14th (German News Agency) - US Under Secretary of State Stettinius announced that there are emergency issues between the British and American governments that should be discussed at length. Stettinius stated that there is no intention to establish an agreement. The British are unaware of what the Americans desire, as the issues are not of significant importance since America currently does not have such a plan. A British correspondent stated that the US Under Secretary of State could not raise issues that require concrete confirmation.

### America Requests Hess to Be Transferred to America to Testify; British Government Refuses

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to Haitong News Agency: Reuters reports from Washington that America is scheduled to begin the trial of thirty rebels on Monday. The US government requested the British government to transfer Hess to America to testify. The British government has refused. It is reported that the US government is eager to learn about the enemy's overseas activities.

### Anti-Axis Powers Create an Illusion, Predict Invasion of Europe; Diversionary Actions Worth Noting

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to Haitong News Agency military reporter Pu La-du, the Italian battles are merely a feint before the anti-Axis forces officially invade Europe. About two weeks ago, Berlin military figures, based on reports from the Anzio front, predicted that the enemy forces there intended to launch a new offensive. However, although enemy reinforcements have continued to arrive, the offensive has not materialized. Near Cassino in southern Italy, although the enemy replaced their troops with fresh forces two weeks ago, they have remained silent and have not taken any action. Could this be an illusion created by the enemy? In his recent broadcast speech, Churchill mentioned that there would be false alarms, which is probably what he meant. At the same time, British newspapers believe that the intensified destruction of transportation lines in France, Belgium, and western Germany by the British and American air forces is a prelude to the invasion of Europe. The London Times states that US Under Secretary of State Stettinius is conducting negotiations in the British capital on the eve of a large-scale military operation, adding that the scale of the operation is unprecedented. US Secretary of the Navy Forrestal also predicted that the invasion of Europe could materialize within three months. Regardless of whether these statements are intentional or unintentional, before a major invasion, there will inevitably be some diversionary actions to shift attention. The Italian battles are likely one of these.

### German Troops in Crimea Retreat to New Defense Line; Soviet Offensive in the Romanian Border Contained

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities announced on the 13th that fighting continues on the Crimean Peninsula. As Soviet pressure on the German and Romanian forces intensified, they were ordered to withdraw from the eastern part of the peninsula to the new defense line prepared in the past few months.

German Military Strategy is Resilient

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency reports: The German forces on the Eastern Front are combining offense and defense, sometimes avoiding strength and attacking weakness, and sometimes launching counterattacks to destroy the Soviet strategy of suddenly attacking the mouth of the Danube. The German and Romanian forces between the Dniester and Prut rivers and in eastern Bukovina are resilient in offense and defense, making it difficult for the enemy to cope. Strong Soviet forces attempting to pass through the key points of Chisinau and Yablunytsia were repelled by German and Romanian troops. The most notable change is in the Carpathian Mountains. A few days ago, German forces began attacking Ternopil, Brody, and Kovel. This is to do everything possible to stop the enemy's advance in the recent Eastern Front battles, and the counterattacks taken at certain points have been effective.

### US and British Aircraft Attack Hungary; Drop Toy Bombs

Budapest, 14th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency learned on Thursday that the Hungarian air defense authorities warned the public that British and American aircraft are dropping dolls and other toys and fountain pens containing explosives in Hungary. The public is ordered not to touch these items.

### Soviet Union and New Zealand Establish Diplomatic Relations

Stockholm, 14th (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency reports: The Soviet Union and New Zealand have exchanged notes on the mutual dispatch of envoys and the establishment of diplomatic relations. Until now, New Zealand's interests in the Soviet Union have been managed by Britain.

### Impressions of Eastern Zhejiang

— An Observer

At the end of March, I and a friend took a bus to Yu and made my first trip to eastern Zhejiang. It lasted seven days and covered three counties – Yin County, Fenghua, and Yuyao. I have some impressions of the inland situation after the war, which I would like to share with readers who care about the inland.

The Ruins of Tianyi Pavilion

After arriving in Ningbo, the first place I visited was the famous Fan's Tianyi Pavilion. The pavilion was built in the Ming Dynasty by Fan Qin, a Ming Dynasty official, and is considered the foremost private library in eastern Zhejiang, with a history of more than four hundred years. The pavilion is in a small alley, and the entrance is dilapidated and desolate, but the ponds, rocks, and gardens in front and behind the pavilion are still quite charming. We first entered the Zunjing Pavilion and saw a coffin lying on its side and wood chips all over the ground. We felt a little strange and asked the Fan family descendants who were the guides. They said that their own people were making coffins here. Then we went to Tianyi Pavilion. The pavilion was covered with dust. In the dust were stacked ten or twenty portraits of Fan's ancestors, piles of broken book blocks, and several steles covered with wooden planks. Opening the bookshelves, nine out of ten were empty. Three or five woodblock books proved that this place was indeed a library, making people sigh as they faced the plaque "Saiyilou" in the middle. The guide then took out a portrait of Fan Qin from among the many portraits to show the visitors. Mr. Wang, who was traveling with me, turned pale after looking at it and repeatedly instructed, "This is a treasure, please cherish it." But I think that if this historically valuable portrait is left piled in the dust of the ruined pavilion, it may disappear soon.

The decline and ruin of Tianyi Pavilion is the same as the fate of our country. Thinking of Fan Qin more than four hundred years ago, how hard he worked for the documents, just like our revolutionary martyrs of that year, how much they sacrificed for the construction of the country. It is only because there is no one to succeed them that not only have they failed to fulfill the responsibility of preserving and increasing them, but they have even destroyed and injured them, resulting in today's irreparable situation. Furthermore, if a place with historical and cultural value like Tianyi Pavilion were in another country, the government would definitely take care to protect and preserve it, and would never allow it to survive or perish on its own. Mr. Wang later suggested to Tao Xiaojie, the administrative inspector of eastern Zhejiang, that he should repair it slightly and purchase some ordinary books for the public to read. It is said that Tao has happily accepted it. I sincerely hope that when I revisit it in the future, Tianyi Pavilion will be able to restore its former appearance.

Since the price of paper has skyrocketed, it is often seen in newspapers that old books from various places are regarded as waste paper, sold by the catty, and transported to paper mills for the purpose of making recycled paper. This is a catastrophe for our country's culture, and eastern Zhejiang cannot escape this disaster. It is said that the price of old books in Ningbo is 45 yuan per catty. Someone bought 32 copies of Chen Yuanlong's "Gezhi Liaoyuan" for 210 yuan because it weighed five and a half catties. Hundreds of millions of catties of old books are bought.

A Glimpse of the Educational Situation

The educational situation in Ningbo is relatively satisfactory. There are three public and private middle schools, twenty-seven public complete elementary schools, fifty-three private ones, thirty-five public elementary schools, and two hundred and twenty private ones. Education expenses account for 23% of the total expenditure. Teachers' salaries are about 11 yuan per hour for high school, 8 yuan for junior high school, and 300 to 400 yuan per month for elementary school teachers. This is indeed a meager amount, but fortunately there is rice allocation and a rice-for-schooling program, which can be used to supplement it. In March of this year, each teacher can receive 5 dou of rice, priced at 60 yuan per dou, and 2.5 dou of rice for schooling, given free of charge. Originally, the primary and secondary schools in Yin County had a method of collecting rice for schooling, with high school students paying 1.5 dou per semester, elementary senior students 7 sheng, middle-grade students 6 sheng, and lower-grade students 5 sheng. The rice for schooling that teachers receive is allocated from this. However, the allocated rice has been reduced to 1.5 dou this month. This is because Ningbo is not a rice-producing area. There is a saying that Ningbo is familiar with three meals of porridge. Whenever there is a shortage of food, it is a very big problem to find a remedy. The market price of rice is around 2,600 yuan.

From Ningbo to Fenghua, there are still buses running daily, although there is only one bus a day, which is very convenient for travelers. The small car we took took less than 2 hours to get to Fenghua. The road is quite good and the scenery along the way is very beautiful. Fenghua was originally a peach-producing area. It was the peach blossom season, which was reflected in the golden rape flowers and the oily green beans and wheat. Together with the blue and clear water, it was really pleasant to be in it, and the scenery near Fenghua was especially good. However, the only downside is that there are tombs scattered in the rice fields along the way, and there are few trees on the mountains. On the one hand, it spoils the scenery, and on the other hand, it reduces production. If there were no graves in the fields, how much more rice and wheat could be produced in a year? If there were trees on the mountains, the price of wood and firewood today could be reduced. And this is not only the situation on the road from Yin to Fenghua. How many mountains in China are not covered with shrubs!

The county seat of Fenghua is very small, and the market is not as good as the nearby Daqiao Town. Education is quite developed. There is one junior high school and 118 elementary schools. As for teachers' treatment, in addition to a monthly salary of 400 to 500 yuan, they can get 200 catties of grain (about 1 dou of rice after milling) for 360 yuan. From this point of view, a Fenghua schoolteacher can feed his family without hunger, but there is no way to talk about anything else. It is also difficult to uniquely describe the hardship.

A Detour to Xikou

After leaving Fenghua, we detoured to Xikou. This is Chiang Kai-shek's birthplace, which has long been famous. The scenery is indeed not bad, and the construction is even more amazing. For example, the grandeur of the Wulin School buildings and the flatness of the road along Chiang's residence, "Suju," are enough to be a model for the whole of China.

A day later, we set off from Ningbo to Yuyao. There is also a bus that goes back and forth between Yuyao once a day. The road is the original route of the former railway and is still good. It passes through Cixi County. Yuyao is a county that produces eel, cotton, and rice. Material control is very strict, so people's livelihood is not a big problem. According to County Mayor Lao, soldiers, police, and county government officials in this county are allocated 3 dou of rice per month, priced at only 14 yuan per dou. Civil servants in affiliated agencies are allocated 3 dou, priced at 37.5 yuan per dou, people 2 dou, priced at 45 yuan per dou, and teachers 5 dou, priced the same as soldiers and police. When asked how he could do it so cheaply, he said that when he was herding grain in the countryside, the price was 15,000 yuan per 10,000 catties, which could mill 42 to 44 shi of rice. I asked if it would hurt the farmers, and he replied that part of the payment was in the form of affordable daily necessities such as soap and matches, so the farmers would not suffer.

The Current Situation Requires Diligent Governance

Based on the impressions I gained from my hasty trip, I feel that the situation in eastern Zhejiang today is generally not bad. It is now both after the war and during the war, and the rise in prices is unavoidable, as long as the unreasonable surge can be stopped. The most important issue to pay attention to is public security. Eastern Zhejiang is not entirely a peaceful area. There are still guerrillas and so-called "Three-Five Detachments" in remote areas. It is said that the people have fewer complaints against the Three-Five Detachments because they know how to win over the people. For example, they deliberately send a group of people to a village, deliberately break a bowl while eating in a restaurant, deliberately look panicked, and deliberately pay double the price of the bowl. This is a kind of trick, but why don't all the soldiers and police use this trick? There is now the 10th Army of the Army stationed in eastern Zhejiang, and there is a security team to defend it. In terms of strength, it should be above the guerrillas and the Three-Five Detachments. If they can be diligently trained and loyal to their responsibilities, it should not be difficult to make eastern Zhejiang an area where people can live and work in peace. I know that the military and political authorities in eastern Zhejiang today are working hard and are determined to make the nine counties of eastern Zhejiang a model peaceful area. I hope that they will continue to work hard and strive to the end.

### Implementation of Account Auditing for Business Income Tax; Expedite Collection; Prevent Illegal Merchants from Evading Taxes

The Shanghai Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance has started collecting the first-class profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the 32nd year in accordance with regulations on March 1 this year. Recently, companies, shops, factories, and banks have actively declared their profits and paid income tax in accordance with regulations. In order to prevent illegal merchants from evading taxes, the Bureau has decided to dispatch personnel to audit accounts and expedite collection. In the event of concealment or refusal to audit accounts, the taxable amount will be determined based on business conditions and penalties will be imposed.

### Establishment of Wharf Service Center; Safeguarding the Safety of Merchants and Travelers; Minister Ding Delivers Speech

The Shanghai Wharf Service Center, which has been in preparation for more than half a year, has recently begun providing services. Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare of the National Government recently delivered a speech as follows:

Shanghai is an important port for trade between China and foreign countries. Domestic and foreign ships enter and leave frequently, and merchants and travelers come and go in an endless stream. However, the wharves of each port are often occupied by hooligans and gangsters who use coercion and extortion, fraud and deception. Merchants and travelers either lose money, lose luggage, are beaten and humiliated, or are exploited. Darkness abounds and crimes occur frequently. Most of the wharf coolies are ignorant people who are either used by them or collude with them to illegally profit, which is also very hateful. More than twenty years ago, when I came to Shanghai to study, I repeatedly encountered such illegal activities and often thought of ways to eliminate them to protect travelers. After the incident, the number of ships decreased and the number of passengers increased. As a result, the darkness of the wharves became more serious, and merchants and travelers were in dire straits and suffered even more. As the head of the Ministry of Social Welfare, I cannot sit idly by and watch this act that hinders public welfare and deepens the suffering of the people. In the past year, the China Social Work Association petitioned to set up a "Shanghai Wharf Service Center" in Shanghai, not for personal gain, but for social service. They also submitted a detailed plan, willing to do their best to relieve the suffering of merchants and travelers, which is in line with my long-cherished wish, so I resolutely approved it. The Ministry of Social Welfare requested the Shanghai Special Municipal Government to instruct its subordinates to provide maintenance and sent separate letters to relevant parties to assist. They all agreed to do so, which shows that all parties sympathize with the elimination of corrupt forces, which is very gratifying. The wharf service center started preparations, which took half a year and cost millions of dollars before starting service a month ago. According to confidential reports, there are unscrupulous elements who are using the name to cause trouble. Their purpose is purely for personal gain, so they are willing to risk being unscrupulous, disrupt public security, and hinder public welfare. All circles must hate them deeply. It is my duty to sincerely safeguard public welfare. In addition to issuing warnings from the ministry and requesting the Shanghai Municipal Government to instruct its subordinates to take effective precautions, I hope that all circles will rise up and cooperate to eliminate the wharf villains and protect merchants and travelers.

### Purchase Certificates for Cloth in Each District; Ready for Distribution

Regarding the distribution of temporary allocation purchase certificates for cotton cloth, the Fourth Section of the Municipal Economic Bureau has already carried out population statistics in each district. In order to carefully review the accurate number of households in each district, people have been sent to the public offices in each district to review. It is learned that the Bureau is now preparing to notify the public offices in each district to send personnel to the Fourth Section of the Bureau to contact them to receive the cloth purchase certificates.

### Resignation of Chen Suliang, Secretary of the Price Evaluation Council

Chen Suliang, secretary of the Municipal Price Evaluation Committee, has previously submitted his resignation several times, but has not been approved. It is now learned that Secretary Chen's resignation is very firm and he has submitted his resignation again. The authorities approved it yesterday.

### Investigation and Registration of Ownerless Land and Houses to Be Conducted

Since the incident, many owners in Shanghai have been affected and have moved elsewhere, resulting in no one to manage their own properties. In order to protect the rights and interests of the people, the municipal government will immediately begin an investigation and registration to protect property rights. The Shanghai North Office of the Land and Housing Management Committee for Owners Not in Residence is now managing the applications from owners, returning land and houses and rent matters. Owners who return to Shanghai can directly apply to the office at No. 27 Fusheng Road at the end of Laobazi Road in Hongkou to return the land and houses.

### Installation of Police Sirens in Lujiawan Baojia District

In order to consolidate local security and improve facilities, each Lianbao Office in Lujiawan has set up sirens in key locations. However, the project is huge, and each Lianbao Office will automatically raise funds to carry out the project. Since the start, it has been going smoothly and a part has already been raised. Fundraising is still continuing in order to start construction. It is heard that the matter has been submitted to the First Police Bureau for record and will be guided and supervised by the Lujiawan Branch.

### Youxin Company's Gifts to Help Students

We received a letter from Youxin Company yesterday: "Dear Sirs, our company is expanding its new address on Taishan Road. We are grateful for the kindness of our friends. All the cash received totals 22,200 yuan. We are donating half of it to your newspaper's scholarship fund and half to the Xinwenbao's student loan fund. This is a small amount to express our sincere gratitude. Liang Haichou, General Manager of Youxin Company."

Scholarship Money Received Yesterday

### Thorough Cooperation Between China and Japan Will Surely Defeat the Enemy: Interview with Reporting Department Head Matsushima

Yesterday at 3:00 PM, the Reporting Department of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China held a routine reception for a Chinese journalists' delegation. Department Head Matsushima and Lieutenant Commander Ta discussed the current war situation in detail. The key points of Department Head Matsushima's report are summarized below:

Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses on Outer Island Perimeters

Since the U.S. Navy's failed attempt to seize Palau Island last time, it has remained silent. This is likely an attempt to recover from that defeat. A Washington dispatch on the 12th stated: U.S. Combined Fleet Commander King, speaking before the House Budget Committee on the 12th, said: The Japanese Navy's strategy on the outer island perimeter is to lure the Allied forces to attack, then inflict heavy casualties. This is very valuable, but the Allied forces must break this Japanese strategy and then destroy the Japanese Empire. The so-called Japanese outer island perimeter includes the Kuril Islands, Wake Island, Oshima Island, the Marshall Islands, the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and the Dutch East Indies. The United States has already tasted failure in island-hopping warfare. Judging from King's remarks, the losses suffered by the U.S. in the past have been extremely heavy. Not only have ships and vessels been damaged, amounting to millions of tons, but human losses have also reached over a million. We often hear the U.S. side boasting about dropping a certain number of bombs on such and such island, but the result is probably not enough to compensate for even one ten-thousandth of the ships and personnel sacrificed.

Attrition Warfare and Annihilation Strategy

The Japanese military has an outer defense line and an inner defense line for operations. As Commander King said, the purpose of the outer defense line is to inflict heavy losses on the enemy, which we call attrition warfare. The task of the inner defense line is to annihilate the enemy's invading forces. The recent Battle of Palau Island is an example of the inner defense strategy; invading enemy forces are the best targets for destruction by the Japanese Navy. Using the European war situation as an analogy, there are similarities. In the German-Soviet war, Germany sent a large army deep into the Soviet Union. Once the pre-determined plan was successful, it shifted its target and retreated to its original position, which is attrition warfare. If Britain and the United States open a second front at this time, it would give Germany an excellent opportunity to annihilate the British and American forces. This point has the same significance as the current Pacific war situation.

India-Burma Operations Corroborate Each Other

The heroic achievements of the Japanese Army in India and Burma are the most significant corroboration of the Pacific naval operations. Due to the bravery of the Japanese Army, the fall of Imphal is imminent, and the cutting off of the Ledo Road is also inevitable. According to a Shonan dispatch on the 13th: According to reliable information, the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Headquarters of Mountbatten in New Delhi has recently moved to Ceylon. From this, we can see the enemy's embarrassing situation. This move by the enemy anticipates the imminent fall of New Delhi and prepares to reopen a bloody path between the Indian Ocean and Burma. The eastern Pacific Ocean surface seems extremely quiet at present, while the western continent is extremely active. In this quiet situation, the Japanese Navy waits for the enemy to move; as soon as we discover the enemy, we will eliminate them, because the Japanese Navy is ready.

Using China to Attack Japan

We now ask all Chinese leaders to pay attention to one extremely important matter, that is, the recent widespread rumors about Wallace's visit to Chongqing. According to a Washington dispatch on the 12th: President Roosevelt sent Vice President Wallace as a formal representative to Chongqing to carry out activities to unite the generals in Chongqing under Chiang Kai-shek. This fully demonstrates the United States' active attempts to control and invade China. We recall that from the beginning of the Greater East Asia War until May of the 31st year of the Republic of China, the Japanese Navy occupied various outposts in the outer periphery of the Greater East Asia region. In August of the 32nd year of the Republic, the enemy began to attack the outer periphery, using all its strength to pressure Japan, but achieved nothing. Australia currently has no one to do farm work, which shows their lack of manpower. No matter how abundant the enemy's war equipment and ships are, their human resources have reached a stage where they cannot sustain it. Therefore, the enemy is thinking of using China to attack Japan, with the aim of using Chinese manpower as a sacrifice for the British and American offensive. This is the intention of Wallace's visit to Chongqing. From this, we can draw another conclusion, that the human resources of both China and Japan are currently feeling overwhelmed. Only if both sides cooperate thoroughly and work together can the final victory over the Anglo-American invading forces surely belong to our two countries, China and Japan. We hope that the Chinese leaders will give this matter careful consideration.

### Conservation Association Asks City Government to Advance Summer Time; Original Time to Be Advanced One More Hour

The Shanghai Special Municipality Conservation Association, recently considering that it is summertime, in order to save coal and make more use of daylight for work, and hearing rumors of disguised activities in the South City gambling dens, submitted the matter for discussion at the fourth board meeting. A unanimous resolution was passed to suggest that the city government advance the original summer time by another hour, and to urge the authorities to pay attention to the stirring of gambling thugs. An official document was formally submitted to the city government on the 13th, and it is believed that the authorities will agree. The original text is excerpted below: (omitted above) In order to promote conservation work, in addition to implementing various measures successively, this association, recently recognizing the value of time and the arrival of summer, intends to advance the already implemented new time by another hour, using sunlight to shorten working hours under lamps, directly benefiting human health and indirectly helping to save electricity. In addition to this association actively advocating and promoting this, we propose that your office adopt and implement it in order to seek universal promotion.

Pay Attention to Disguised Activities in Gambling Dens

Furthermore, after the closure of the South City gambling dens, there are rumors of disguised activities. Gambling is more harmful than floods and beasts, and it is the biggest obstacle to the construction of the new Shanghai. Fortunately, the South City gambling dens have now been ordered to be closed by your office, and all patriotic people are celebrating with joy, believing that this move is a precursor to the construction of Shanghai and the renovation of municipal administration. How can we allow the appearance of disguised gambling dens again? This association dares not remain silent on this matter. Therefore, we especially write to earnestly request your office to pay close attention, ensuring that the harm of gambling is eradicated, so that the country and society will both benefit, which is indeed deeply fortunate. (omitted below)

### Hukou Rice for Issues 67 Expected to Go On Sale Soon

Regarding the distribution of hukou rice for the 66th and 67th issues in this city's first district, it should have started in the latter half of last month, but as of now, there has been no news about delivery or sale. Ordinary citizens already feel that two sheng of rice per ten days is not enough to sustain them, and now it has been postponed repeatedly, so they urgently hope that the relevant authorities will urge its speedy implementation to alleviate the people's livelihood.

Household Soap Outside District One to Be Distributed Early Next Month

Regarding the distribution of household soap, which the citizens have been eagerly awaiting, the city's Economic Bureau has repeatedly negotiated with various manufacturers. As a result, the manufacturers are responsible for manufacturing, including brands such as Guben, Niu Pai, Arrow Knife, Nanyang, Taishan, Yuhua, Guanghua, Henry, Central, and Mingxing, as well as Changlin Hongxing, Jicheng, and others, totaling more than 3,000 boxes. According to reliable information, household soap in all districts of the city except District One will begin to be distributed in early next month.

Yesterday's Dispatch Time: 6:40 PM

Economic Circles Economic Commentary

### The Future of Prices

"Suppressing prices to the level before January" is the resolution announced by the government authorities and the comfort received by the public. The question is whether the resolution can be carried out to the end and whether the comfort can last long. In reality, the authorities' work on suppressing prices, with the newly established Economic Security Office as its latest development, is indeed constantly working hard there. A large part of the prices of goods, except for the retail prices of many daily necessities, has indeed seen a considerable decline. However, these realities cannot absolutely guarantee the future of prices, because the agency for suppressing prices is there, but it remains to be seen whether its implementation methods are thorough; the trend of a slight decline in prices is there, but it remains to be seen whether there is a possibility of rising again in the future.

Whether prices will rise again in the future cannot, of course, be entirely entrusted to the efforts of the implementing agencies, because increasing production and smoothing the flow of materials are ultimately the basic problems of price policy. However, the "bottom of the cauldron" of rising prices must rely on implementing agencies such as the Economic Security Office to do the "drawing fuel" work. If you ask what these "fuels" are and how to draw them out, then there is probably too much to say. In short, the future problem lies in implementation. The method of implementation lies in how to use the banner of economic security to capture profiteering hoarders and speculating merchants in one fell swoop, so that they cannot continue to influence the future of prices.

### Guilds Notify Members Not to Engage in Illegal Trading; Violators Will Be Reported to the Authorities for Strict Investigation

More than 200 guilds in this city, including the Grain Industry, Coal Industry, Charcoal Industry, Hot Water Industry, Noodle Manufacturing Industry, Wood Industry, Hardware Industry, Construction Industry, Glass Industry, Leather Industry, Seasoning Industry, North-South Goods Industry, Clerical Industry, Cigarette Industry, Department Store Industry, Knitting Industry, Silk Industry, Clothing Industry, and Electrical Industry, in order to receive instructions from the Economic and Food Bureaus to strictly supervise members' trading, hereby notify their respective member companies:

"The Economic Bureau (Food Bureau) instructs: It is found that trade associations are important grassroots organizations for controlling the economy and are closely related to the implementation of wartime economic policies. Each industry association should strictly supervise its members without any leniency. If any member is found to be engaged in illegal trading, their membership qualification should be revoked, and the competent authority should be reported to investigate and deal with them according to law in order to maintain discipline. If they dare to conceal and fail to report, once discovered by the local competent authorities, the persons in charge of the relevant associations should also be punished according to the severity of the circumstances." All our members must abide by this and not violate it. If anyone is found to be engaged in illegal trading, no leniency will be shown, and the authorities will be immediately reported for investigation. We hope everyone pays attention.

### A Visit to Lu Jia Yi School and Its Affiliated Nursery

Tender green grass, newly opened rapeseed flowers, a scene of rural scenery. This is exactly the area near Lu Jia Road at the end of Route Lufée, which is also the location of Lu Jia Yi School and its affiliated nursery.

Pushing open the gate of the campus, a row of bungalows immediately came into view! In the reception room, there were three children sitting head-to-head, pointing and pointing excitedly at the pictures. Hearing someone coming in, they all raised their heads and looked at me with curious eyes. Later, a young female teacher came out, greeted me, and explained that today is Children's Day, and the teachers and students have all gone to Longhua to have fun.

Starting from Scratch Empty-Handed

She accompanied me to visit the classrooms. The equipment was okay. The walls displayed the achievements of large and small calligraphy compositions, as well as many maxims, warnings, precepts and pictures. It is said that this school was founded jointly by seven or eight high school students and college students, relying only on a cavity of enthusiasm, a red heart, a small mouth and a pair of empty hands. They had no money and no backing. They just started a charity school from scratch empty-handed! Later, due to urgent need, they added a nursery, which has been open for nearly two years and currently has more than 240 students. From the first grade to the sixth grade, they are divided into three groups: high, middle, and low. Most of the students are children of poor residents nearby, so the tuition is very low, and the salaries of the teachers and staff are also very meager - from 200 yuan to 400 yuan, which is almost equivalent to pure volunteer work, but most of them are provided with food and accommodation. I also visited their campus and vegetable garden, which were full of greenery. There were trees planted by the students in the group, and the garden was planted with various vegetables. The rapeseed flowers were emitting a fragrance. This is to allow children from civilian backgrounds to practice planting, picking, and tasting by themselves. Who says there is no profound meaning in this?

The Blessed Land of the Nursery

Bypassing a large open field, we arrived at the old site of the Wang Family Ancestral Hall. This place is borrowed as the blessed land of the nursery. The houses are fairly large, and Miss Xue, the principal of the charity school, came out to greet us. It is said that due to insufficient funding, the nursery only accommodates 20 children, whose parents are mostly rice merchants, female workers, or vegetable growers. The purpose of opening the nursery is purely for service (only a small amount of food and accommodation expenses are charged). The monthly expenses for both the charity school and the nursery total 40,000 yuan. She explained very frankly: the school is poor; the nursery is of course even poorer. The teachers and staff are also capable but have no money. Funding is often stretched and always running a deficit, trapped in a situation of "a clever woman cannot cook without rice." In addition to fundraising, part of the funding also relies on donations from groups or individuals who come to visit, so they welcome and look forward to external visits, criticisms and guidance, so that they can improve. They also hope that all sectors of society will work together to help.

Speaking of their actual difficulties, money is certainly the most lacking; rice and coal are also big problems. Other items needed in the nursery, such as bowls, bedding, beds, tables, and chairs, are also very much needed. Books and medicines are also welcome.

Blessing the Children

Finally, surrounded by a group of innocent and lively children; in the sounds of "Hello, teacher! Hello, teacher!" which rose and fell, and I could hardly respond to all of them, I was sent off and embarked on my return journey, silently blessing these lovely children in my heart!

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

Shark (2)

After watching the night scene in Ginza and returning to the ship, in the cadet room, there was a lot of discussion about the customs of Tokyo. This had long become yesterday's dream.

Before the order for departure preparations was issued, the cadets waited eagerly for the order with new dreams and a sense of tension. However, this day finally arrived.

On October 5, Showa 14, the training fleet embarked on a long voyage amid the sky-high sound of bugles. Because it was slightly cloudy, the waves did not show their obvious posture. The harbor tugboats sending off the guests were full of flower-like colors. It turned out to be the relatives and lovers of officers and cadets from the vicinity of Tokyo, wearing gorgeous attire to send them off.

"Wish you a safe journey!" There were also very brave young ladies who shouted out a voice louder than the siren, waving their handkerchiefs at their loved ones.

Soon after, although the tugboats returned, the cadets on the deck still could not release their salutes. This was because many warships inside were holding embarkation ceremonies to send them off.

"Wishing you a smooth sailing!"

"Thank you for your kind hospitality!"

Such signals were exchanged.

However, the send-off was not limited to this. In the sky, the planes were also waving their wings, holding a send-off. In addition, three destroyers and two torpedo boats had been sent all the way to Kannonzaki.

Not all fleet departures can receive such a warm send-off. Those who receive such a send-off, in addition to fleets with special missions, are only the training fleet when it departs. From this, one can also know how much enthusiasm and expectation is placed on the training fleet.

The ship was full of a new lively atmosphere. In particular, the faces of the cadets were beaming with joy. This voyage was something they had long been eagerly awaiting. It was a dangerous journey to foreign countries and the South Seas, such as Honolulu, Hilo, Route, Ponape, Truk, and the Palau Islands. Moreover, it was a Pacific voyage where good and bad fortune could change at any time. This ocean, for the young cadets, could not be said to be a dreamlike yearning.

Although inland navigation is also a part of the Pacific Ocean, for the real people and others, only this time did they feel that this was the real Pacific Ocean.

This time, the Iwate, on which the real people were riding, had become the flagship. The commander's flag was flying on the mast. Thus, the warship Iwate sailed eastward, riding the wind and breaking the waves. The land gradually sank. In an instant, it disappeared below the horizon.

"If the weather is good, you can still see Mount Fuji."

The officer standing on the deck told the real people this.

It was already close to dusk. Looking out at a glance, everywhere was a vast ocean. At this time, the surging waves

(This is the Pacific Ocean!)

The real people affirmed this.

Social Service

### Frugal Soup and Cake Banquet to Help Refugee Children and Orphans

Mr. Zhu Bao, the father-in-law of Jin Chang, is engaged in the fishing business and is enthusiastic about public welfare. Last winter, he had a grandson named Shi Yu. On the occasion of the first month after his birth, a soup and cake banquet should have been held. Due to the extraordinary times, the Zhu family specially used 2,000 yuan of the banquet fee to prepare for helping good deeds. Recently, I learned that this newspaper launched a campaign to rescue suffering children, so I entrusted this fee to this newspaper to forward it to ten refugee children's groups. This man's enthusiasm for public welfare is an example for all sectors of society.
