### Experiment County

The two characters "Experiment" (實騐) are originally a scientific term.

Its meaning has two aspects: (A) For those with a theory but lacking concrete implementation measures, a small-scale experiment must first be conducted, and then expanded to a large scale for common use. For example, for all substitutes of natural products, whether artificial butter or artificial rubber, their chemical theories must first be determined, and then studied by the "Experiment Room" to determine the methods of implementation, so that they are suitable for large-scale factory production without suffering losses or failure. (B) For novel methods without a sure grasp of effectiveness, a small-scale experiment must first be conducted under certain external conditions to determine whether it is worthwhile to promote it universally under the same external conditions based on the merits of its results. For example, for a novel method of railway construction, an "Experiment Section" must first be designated to test its adoption under a certain type of locomotive at a certain speed. If the experience gained truly matches the expected effect, then all lines traveled by the same type of locomotive at the same speed can be rebuilt, thereby improving the general function of transportation.

Recently, the National Defense Council has attached importance to rural construction and designated the name "Experiment County," and further stipulated the standards for its election. This is enough to show that the authorities are handling national affairs with a scientific mindset, which is indeed beyond reproach. However, according to the above two meanings of "Experiment," analyzing the "Experiment County" in rural construction seems to have some imperfections. Therefore, I hereby offer my opinions for the reference of relevant parties.

1. Based on item (A), according to the "Outline of Rural Construction Plan," the second item already indicates concrete implementation measures. This means that rural construction has already obtained results equivalent to those studied in the "Experiment Room," and it is not just an empty theory. Efforts should be concentrated to vigorously promote it, and there seems to be no need to mention "Experiment" again.

2. Also based on item (A), the experimental work should be carried out in the "Experiment Room" to prevent external failures and prevent the entire factory from suffering significant damage. Suppose that the concrete implementation mentioned in the "Outline of Rural Construction Plan" fully demonstrates the theory, it is still not appropriate to use the county as a tool for experimentation, and make it risk the danger of success or failure. However, forming a prototype of a county as a "Rural Construction Laboratory" is not permitted by reality. Therefore, to put it bluntly, there is no possibility of "Experiment."

3. Based on item (B), according to the content of the "Outline of Rural Construction Plan," the second item, it can be roughly divided into three main objectives: (A) Training young people to improve their spiritual, physical, and technical qualities is education. (B) Reforming the tax system, increasing production, and making the villagers free from exploitation and living a prosperous life is sustenance. (C) Organizing a model homeland defense team so that they can take responsibility for public security themselves is defense. Education, sustenance, and defense combined as one. Using them to govern the country will make the country strong. Using them to govern the province will make the province prosperous. Using them to build the countryside, how can the countryside not flourish and prosper? This is not only not a novel method, but it has almost become an old saying, or at least it can be considered a preliminary common topic in politics. What still needs to be "Experimented" on?

4. Also based on item (B), the experimental work must be based on external conditions, and then the experience gained can be promoted to other aspects under the same external conditions. Although the "Experiment County" selection criteria stipulated in the "Outline of Rural Construction Plan" are only five points, it is certain that few counties can meet these criteria. Even if four counties can be selected from three provinces and one city for "Experimentation," the experience gained will inevitably be overly optimistic and difficult to promote to counties of a lower level. Moreover, the differences in local customs, the inequality of land fertility, and various natural differences cannot be forced to be the same, and it is inevitable that "Experimentation" will have to be carried out one by one.

In summary, the name "Experiment County" is unnecessary, impossible, and even if the "Experiment" has results, it is still not enough to promote its application. So what can be done? It is to implement comprehensive rural construction, and the steps are as follows: (A) Determine the principles and goals of rural construction. (B) Determine the details and schedules of advanced and preliminary rural construction. (C) Divide all counties in the three provinces and one city into three levels, super, advanced, and preliminary, according to their natural and man-made conditions. (Those with all the necessary construction conditions are classified as super counties, and actively implement advanced construction work. The next level is advanced counties, which eliminate obstacles to construction on the one hand, and implement advanced construction work at the same time. The next level is preliminary counties, which use all their strength to sweep away all resistance and prepare for preliminary construction.) Proceed simultaneously, review and correct at any time, in order to gradually achieve results and complete them on schedule. In addition, there should be proper arrangements for personnel, and the existing magistrate's character and learning should not be used as the standard for selecting an experiment county. Those who are good at politics and military affairs should be in charge of preliminary counties, those who are good at construction technology should be in charge of super counties, and those who are good at both should be in charge of advanced counties. Those who are uneducated, incompetent, corrupt, and degenerate should be dismissed and punished separately to eliminate all darkness.

Organizing county administration and building the countryside is like prescribing medicine to treat diseases. Observe the pathology and administer medicine accordingly. One should never use the patient as an experimental product, let alone use the experience of treating disease A to treat disease B. Those with serious illnesses should be treated urgently, and those with weak constitutions should be supported. How can one avoid the serious and focus on the easy, ignoring the patient's life and claiming to have done everything possible to treat the disease? This is how to treat people, and how can treating the country be any different!

### Wu Song to Dinghai Sea Area Our Fleet Exercise Completed Navy Minister Ren Talks About Significant Progress

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The increasingly serious Pacific war situation at the present stage has been unanimously recognized by the people of the country. There is no doubt that the active development of the Great East Asian War will be carried out in the future. The Chinese Navy has a responsibility to have a strong voice based on the responsibility of the Great East Asian War. The Ministry of the Navy, with this in mind, gathered warships such as Hai Xing, Hai Xiang, Hai Sui, and Hai 于 from August 1st to form a fleet, and carried out combat technical training exercises in the Wu Song to Dinghai Sea area. The results have been very good in recent days, and the allied naval officers have expressed their appreciation. It is learned that our Navy Minister Ren Yuandao, accompanied by Allied Navy Lieutenant General Maeda yesterday, inspected the live ammunition shooting of the four warships. The Chief of Staff of the Port Headquarters, Major General Cao Nantian, served as the temporary team commander. According to Navy Minister Ren's remarks to reporters, the results of this fleet professional exercise have made significant progress compared to the past, and unlimited expectations can be placed on the future advancement of our country's navy. In addition, Navy Minister Ren, after inspecting the live ammunition exercise, visited the sea areas of Bianlinsha and Putuoshan with his entourage, and was very satisfied with the efforts of the navy in these areas. Ren's official inspection has been completed, and he returned to Nanjing on the 22nd. At the same time, the four warships participating in the exercise returned to their original defenses on the same day.

### Japanese Local Governor Conference Held in Tokyo Today Government Clearly States Determination and Policy Direction

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government will hold a local governor conference at the Prime Minister's official residence on the 23rd to clearly state the government's determination and policy direction, in order to thoroughly inspire local frontline administration. The focus of this conference is to discuss key proposals to accelerate the enhancement of combat power against the background of the current stage of the war, especially awaiting the upsurge of local governors across the country. Therefore, the conference schedule is extremely tight, and all important matters will be decided in just one day on the 23rd. At that time, the governors of one capital, two prefectures, two offices, and forty-three prefectures, including Governor Nishio of Tokyo, Governor Saka of Hokkaido, and Governor Osawa of Guntai, as well as Prime Minister Koiso and all cabinet ministers and the three chief cabinet secretaries on the government side, will attend.

Conference Procedure

The conference procedure is scheduled as follows:

First, Prime Minister Koiso will report on the government's determination under this major professional situation and the efforts expected from the local governors, and will give instructions to the governors separately. Next, the Foreign Minister and Greater East Asia Minister, Army Minister Sugiyama, and Navy Minister Yonai will speak in turn. After that, at 9:30, they will jointly pay a visit to the Imperial Palace. At 10:30, they will return to the Prime Minister's official residence to continue the conference. The Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Shimada, the Minister of Munitions Fujiwara, the Minister of Health and Welfare Hirose, the Minister of Transport and Communications Maeda, and the Minister of Finance Ishiwatari will explain the policies to enhance combat power and exchange opinions with each other, focusing on this.

### Japanese Air Defense System Well-Organized Heavy Sacrifices for American Planes

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Regarding the American Air Force's air raid on Kitakyushu and western Chugoku on the evening of the 20th, an American journalist stationed at a B-29 base, on the morning of the 21st, after passing the inspection of the American military authorities, issued a message stating that the air raid was conducted by the 20th Air Force of the American military on the largest possible scale at present, and admitted that the bomber squadron suffered great damage. The general idea is that the 20th Air Force launched a major attack on the Japanese mainland on the 20th, which the Asian Air Force had once performed, using all its strength in day and night attacks. This was the fourth time since the air unit began attacking the Japanese mainland. The 20th Air Force's first daytime air raid, aimed at challenging the Japanese air force's reserve forces for defending the homeland, was actually the Yahata spirit factory area. The B-29 aircraft bombed with all their might according to this purpose. On the afternoon of the 20th, the B-29 aircraft attacking team flew to the sky over Kyushu and suddenly entered an extremely fierce anti-aircraft barrage. Suddenly, the Japanese fighter squadron came from a very high distance, diagonally piercing through the black cloud-like barrage, and each dared to hit the bomber behind our plane, collapsing and destroying them all at the same time. The number of Japanese interceptors was unexpectedly large. The 20th Air Force made great sacrifices in this battle. We now know how the Japanese Air Force defends its homeland.

### Japanese Army in Henan Establishes Traffic Monitoring Stations

Zhengzhou, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese military authorities, in view of the special political and economic situation in the newly occupied areas of Henan, have severely cracked down on the exchange of materials and the entry and exit of people between North China and Central China. This time, in order to further thoroughly crack down, they announced on the 21st that they would temporarily establish six traffic monitoring stations for the exchange of materials. Regarding the entry and exit of people, a permit system is also adopted at the monitoring stations.

### Japanese Wing Political Association to Refresh Personnel Temporary Suspension of Organization and General Affairs Committee

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Since Mr. Kobayashi took office as the president of the Japanese Wing Political Association, he has repeatedly studied various situations and personnel organizations within the association, and a plan can be decided before the extraordinary Diet session. At the Standing General Affairs Committee meeting at noon on the 21st, President Kobayashi explained his belief in changing personnel organizations as follows: The selection of new personnel will be made after listening to opinions from all parties, and there is already a plan in mind, which can be announced on the 22nd. The organization and the General Affairs Committee will not be changed for the time being. It is planned to select a small number of consultative personnel as the central mechanism for advancing the meeting. The liaison plan with the government is entrusted to the former Minister of Transport and Communications Maeda. The term of office for staff is one year, and elections will be held in mid-April after each regular Diet session. From next year, appointments will be made in mid-April. From next year, half or one-third of the general affairs staff will be replaced. This method can ensure consistency within the association.

Two Proposals Submitted by Diet Members

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Diet Members' Comrades Association held a general meeting on the afternoon of the 21st. After exchanging opinions on the current situation and the extraordinary Diet, it made a resolution and met with President Kobayashi at the Wing Political Headquarters at 5 o'clock, submitting the resolution and requesting a method of implementation. President Kobayashi also responded to this. The contents of the association's proposal and Mr. Kobayashi's reply are recorded as follows: The contents of the association's resolution: In order to unify the hearts of the people and make the government consistent, the old cadres of the Wing Political Association should bear clear responsibility. Based on the above principles, the old cadres should be decisively swept away when the new cadres are elected. Regarding the operation of the Diet, the previous attitude often improperly trampled on the power of deliberation. In the future, the operation of the Diet will clearly correct the above errors. Mr. Kobayashi replied: It is still difficult to comprehensively refresh the cadres, and we will wait until the expiration of the term to gradually plan for it. Regarding the operation of the Diet, I have the same feeling in terms of intent.

### Japanese House of Representatives Holds Diet Consultative Council

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government and Diet, in view of the upcoming 85th extraordinary session, are currently urgently seeking all-out preparations. Prime Minister Koiso has already met with President Kobayashi of the Wing Political Association, and at 2:00 PM on the 21st, he met with Chief Cabinet Secretary Tanaka, Director-General of the Legislative Bureau Miura, and Secretaries-General of the House of Peers Kobayashi and the House of Representatives Oki at the Prime Minister's official residence to hold extremely important consultations. The House of Representatives decided to hold a "Diet Consultative Council" at 10:00 AM on the 23rd to discuss the policy for the extraordinary session.

### Anti-Bandit Operations in North China Half-Year War Results

Beijing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The North China Pacification Army, under the goal of anti-banditry and national construction, has exerted its full strength to cooperate with the Japanese army and continue to eliminate communist bandits.

### Japanese Minister Horinouchi Gives a Speech at a Life Camp

The topic of the speech was "The Great East Asia War and Chinese Youth," and he pointed out in detail the causes of the Great East Asia War and its relationship with Chinese youth.

### German Troops Break Through Normandy Pocket Fierce Battle Unfolds for Toulon

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency: The most important event in the Normandy campaign was the completion of the breakthrough by German tank forces and the Meitok Brigade from the British and American forces in the Falaise-Argentan area. They have been able to maintain contact with the German forces west of the Tar area. After a day of fierce fighting, the US and Canadian troops were annihilated, and the remnants were also repelled. However, the losses of the air force were also heavy. The German paratroopers made great contributions to this battle. The German troops besieged in Argentan and Falaise have now moved to the west side of the Seine River and are participating in fierce tug-of-war battles there. The American tank and mechanized units advancing towards the Seine River are fighting in the Vernon and Mantes areas, attempting to establish a bridgehead on the north bank of the Seine, but have been repelled and unable to enter Vernon. The US military has increased the deployment of strong motorized brigades that are currently fighting between Orleans and Tours to resist German reinforcements. Therefore, their attempt to reach Paris from the southwest was once again frustrated. On the Loire River front, there was only minor contact between the US military and the German rear guard team, except for artillery offensives. The US military shelled Lorient in Brittany.

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – German News Agency Frontline News: Reconnaissance troops of the Anti-Axis forces have approached the outskirts of Paris. Because the situation is uncertain, the future is difficult to predict.

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – German News Agency News, according to German official announcement: Between the southern coast of France and the Durance River, German troops are disengaging from the enemy to the west. The enemy's pursuit is unrelenting. A fierce offensive and defensive battle is unfolding in Toulon. The enemy attacked in Aix (north of Marseille), and the German counterattack drove the enemy back.

Fleet Bombards Southern French Fortress

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to frontline news: The Anti-Axis fleet began shelling La Ciotat, a port between Toulon and Marseille, on the evening of the 20th. It is generally believed that this was because the Anti-Axis troops suffered setbacks in Hyeres, so they attempted to carry out another landing in La Ciotat to complete the encirclement of the port of Toulon.

### Key French Government Figures Gather in Belfort

Zurich, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to the Doramen Social Democratic newspaper, French Prime Minister Laval and key government figures arrived in Belfort (Belfort, on the northwestern border of Switzerland) on the afternoon of the 19th.

### Mr. Nakano Discusses Promoting Light Industry

Beijing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Mr. Nakano of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Beijing discussed the policies and possibilities for promoting local light industry as follows: Promoting local industry and ensuring daily necessities are the most important things in North China. Whether it is promoting the supply of important materials from its side, preventing inflation, or promoting the purchase of production products, it is necessary from any aspect. The development of light industry in North China has exceeded expectations. The financial aspect has also become quite poor with the increasing demand for funds for important industries. However, private capital in North China still has a surplus. If it can be brought into the right track, it can also prevent the past rise in material prices. It is a policy that achieves two goals with one action.

### German Reinforcements Shift from Defense to Offense The Eastern Front Situation Gradually Stabilizes

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Haisong News Agency: When the Great Eastern War has reached its peak and is rapidly approaching the final decision stage, there has been an important change in the situation. This change occurred between the end of July and the beginning of August. At the beginning of the summer war, the German position was very serious. There was no way through the marshy area in the center, and the German lines of communication were cut off everywhere. The Soviet mechanized units drove west. In times of difficulty, German soldiers often relied on the ability of their commanders. The battle began to enter a new stage in early August. The German army organized into a powerful force, concentrated its forces to change from defense to offense, engaged in large-scale deployments in areas where the battle lines were more critical, and transferred fresh troops to reinforce them. As a result, the situation became stable, and the Soviet summer offensive plan was shelved.

### Indian Gathering Makes Every Effort to Fight for Liberation

A Certain Base in Burma, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Sixth Anniversary of the Establishment of the Indian Provisional Government was held solemnly in Chhatgaon, Burma, on the 21st.

The meeting also passed a resolution based on the general will of the Indians present, resolving to work with Japan and other allied countries to grasp all circumstances, and even if they encounter difficulties and hardships, they must persist to the end until they achieve common victory, liberate India from foreign oppression, and achieve liberation.

### Roosevelt Sends Representatives to Chongqing

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch: Roosevelt announced on the night of the 19th that War Production Board Director Nelson and Army Major General Harry will go to Chongqing as representatives of the German system. Among them, Major General Harry is in Chongqing to coordinate military vehicle and military logistics supply issues. The two will depart from Washington soon and are scheduled to stay in Chongqing for several months. According to news from political circles in Washington, the Anti-Japanese War capability of Chongqing has been on the verge of collapse due to the Japanese army's continental operations. The United States has considered this result and decided to take this action.

### Japanese Army Continues to Fight in Tinian Heavy Losses for the Enemy in New Guinea

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – An electric dispatch from a Japanese army base in the Central Pacific stated that after the Japanese army in Tinian severely damaged the US army, they are still utilizing the terrain in various places to continue fierce fighting. On the night of the 20th, several US planes bombed the southern area of the island and shelled the sea on the same night, which was extremely fierce. Hundreds of illuminating bombs were mixed and intertwined. The Japanese army is currently engaging in strong night raids to continue the fight.

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from San Francisco, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis military authorities announced on the 15th that the Anti-Axis forces near Aitape in New Guinea have lost 1,307 people.

### Vietnam Governor-General Decoux Assumes Full Power; Cooperation with Japan Further Strengthened

Central News Agency, Xiji, 22nd

Telegram: After the French government declared that all authority would be granted to Governor-General Decoux, all newspapers in Vietnam published the government's clarification simultaneously, without further explanation. This measure was expected.

From the beginning, Governor-General Decoux has been the supreme political ruler of Vietnam, often enjoying authority equivalent to that of the head of state. Judging from the current situation of the French mainland, this move is a natural progression. This also shows that there will be no changes in the diplomacy or internal affairs of France. The reaction of the general French public is also the same. Their trust in Japan is even more solid. General opinion instructs that the French people, united under the guidance of the Governor-General of Vietnam for peace and prosperity, should further consolidate cooperation and devote themselves to building the Greater East Asia and assisting Japan. What is particularly noteworthy is that Vietnam will henceforth restore its full East Asian character and cooperate under Japanese protection to build world peace. From Japan's perspective, this measure taken by France has not changed the friendly relations and cooperation between Vietnam and Japan. The problem of having to mediate between Vichy and Nanjing in the past can now be directly negotiated on the spot. The joint defense treaty and economic agreement between the two countries will be implemented quickly. Regarding the various unresolved issues in economic cooperation, after Governor-General Decoux assumes full power, the contribution to the enhancement of Japan's war power will be even greater.

### Oil and Grain Association to Take Over Mobile Permit Matters; Business Coordination Association to Transfer Within Days

The Oil and Grain Control Committee of the Business Coordination Association was ordered to reorganize this time. It decided to implement the management of oil and grain operations in accordance with the control laws and regulations promulgated by the government, increase production, and dredge sources in order to balance supply and demand and suppress market prices, especially to strictly prevent private trading among the industry. However, in order to make the above policies effective, it was decided to adopt a management system instead of directly purchasing, such as handling sales registration, material registration, and membership registration, with the aim of unifying the management of free oil and grain operations. Regarding oil and grain transportation matters, the Materials Transportation Permit Office of the former Business Coordination Association was responsible for handling it. Now it is planned to transfer the transportation permit affairs to the Oil and Grain Control Committee for handling. It is heard that the Business Coordination Association will transfer it to the Oil and Grain Control Association within days.
