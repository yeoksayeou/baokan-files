### The Utilization of Public Opinion

Generally, politicians tend to hold the view that in times of war or severe crises, it is necessary to implement strict policies to suppress public opinion. However, what are the consequences of implementing such policies? The historical facts of China and foreign countries clearly show that "preventing the people's speech is more dangerous than preventing a river." Suppressed emotions overflow, small grievances become large, often making the situation even more serious. Therefore, the most successful politicians, especially in times of emergency, understand the importance of utilizing public opinion. On the one hand, they use media outlets to ensure that the public fully understands the true nature of the situation, preparing them and preventing them from being swayed by enemy strategies. On the other hand, they leverage the media to ensure that the authorities fully understand the people's sentiments, enabling them to concentrate their will and power. Negatively, this can avoid rumors and slanders; positively, it can gather collective wisdom, overcome difficulties, and complete national policies.

The decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War will determine the fate of Japan and all the nations of East Asia. Today, the enemy not only attempts to counterattack materially with planes and warships but also launches spiritual counterattacks using strategic paper bullets and radio waves. However, in this decisive stage, the policy adopted by the new Japanese cabinet is not to strengthen censorship and control of speech, but rather a "respect for speech" policy! The new head of the Information Bureau, Mr. Ogata, himself a civilian authority on public opinion, has fully demonstrated the Japanese authorities' significant determination to respect speech. Furthermore, Mr. Ogata's address to the Board of Directors of the Information Department of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association on August 9th publicly declared the Japanese authorities' determination to reform speech countermeasures, eliminating the attitude of suppression. For fair criticism, no restrictions will be imposed. For public opinion guidance, the emphasis will be placed on newspapers, thoroughly implementing a policy of respecting speech, especially in the event of an emergency, striving to make news reports more vibrant – swift and accurate. To implement this policy, efforts will be made to fully utilize civilian talent in order to fully exert the effectiveness of propaganda.

From the new guidelines of our ally Japan's information and propaganda work, we can fully see its special feature: the rapid and thorough respect for national public opinion, in order to strengthen the people's trust in politics and the military, so that there is no gap between the reality of the war situation and the national psychology, in order to grasp the people's hearts and concentrate the people's strength, and to support the major political parties in completing the war from the perspective of ideological warfare. In addition to admiring the wise new policy of our allied authorities, we cannot help but feel a sense of self-consciousness and shame regarding our own country's information and propaganda policy, which has been involved in the war for nearly two years, and our country's public opinion circles in this decisive stage. We hope that similar wise measures will be taken in the shortest time possible. In addition to placing emphasis on newspapers for public opinion guidance, government authorities at all levels should also maintain close contact with civilian leaders, such as holding regular symposiums on the current situation, so that civilians have a deep understanding of the current situation and government policies, with no separation.

### The Utilization of Public Opinion: Director Ogata Reveals His Aspirations

The Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association held a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Information Department at its headquarters at 3:00 PM on August 9th, inviting Information Bureau Director Ogata to attend. Director Ogata explained his views on information and propaganda policy, stating: "Reforming the previous attitude of suppressing speech, we will not restrict fair criticism, but we will particularly focus on newspapers in guiding public opinion. We will not interfere with the content of newspapers. The emergence of a sense of war fatigue, etc., is actually due to newspapers not recording the true facts. We hope to quickly implement the policy of respecting speech. In the event of emergencies such as air raids, news reports should be more vibrant. At the same time, governors and police chiefs should provide accurate materials to prevent rumors. Furthermore, the Information Bureau should strive to utilize civilian personnel when implementing propaganda and enlightenment."

Subsequently, the Information Department of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association proposed the following policies to strengthen information and propaganda. Director Ogata expressed his approval and assured that he would work in this direction, strengthening the people's trust in military and political affairs, so that there would be no gap between the reality of the war situation and the people's thinking, in order to thoroughly reform the information and propaganda policy.

Do not let the people indulge in safety. The government should let the people know the truth of the current situation, so that they will not waver in any environment.

When guiding speech, do not add unreasonable restraints. Grasp the people's psychology and do not miss opportunities. Especially in the newspapers, break the current passive control policy. Each newspaper should have its own characteristics and compile fresh and lively content to promote national sentiment.

The information and propaganda organs affiliated with each province should be integrated into the Information Bureau, so that it is responsible for strengthening unified tasks.

In view of the fact that ideological warfare is the final deciding factor in war, the Information Bureau should have the character of an "ideological warfare" headquarters.

Regarding the public's expression of political opinions, it should be treated in the same way as the activities of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society. (翔: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, August 10th)

### Japanese Forces in Bougainville Continue Guerrilla Warfare, Recapturing the Enemy's First-Line Positions

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from the South Pacific base, Japanese forces in Bougainville ambushed newly landed enemy troops on the left bank of the Gaba River (approximately four kilometers south of Torokina Point) on August 10th. With limited forces, they resolutely defended their positions and launched repeated surprise attacks on the enemy, continuing guerrilla warfare. On the evening of the 19th, with reinforcements from the Japanese forces in the Warega area (ten kilometers south of Gaba), they launched another fierce attack, capturing the enemy's first line of positions on that day and compressing the enemy towards the coast. At 9:00 AM on the 20th, they finally drove the enemy away from the coast.

Southwest Pacific Japanese Army Base, 29th (Central News Agency) – On the morning of the 27th, approximately seventy enemy small aircraft attacked the Papuan region of New Guinea. The Japanese forces stationed there immediately engaged them in combat, shooting down one and causing considerable damage to forty others, forcing them to retreat.

### War Situation in Burma

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – In order to open the Ledo Road, the Chinese army in Burma, under the supervision of enemy American forces, repeatedly attacked the Japanese army's positions on the Salween River front. The Japanese defense forces ambushed the offensive of the numerically superior Chinese army, overcoming the difficulties of insufficient troops as much as possible. With hand grenades and bayonet charges, they severely damaged the Chinese army and resolutely defended various key points. The Chinese army in front of La Meng fiercely bombarded the Japanese army's positions for three days, from the 18th to the 20th. On the morning of the 20th, they launched a full-scale offensive, engaging in fierce bayonet charges with the Japanese defense forces. They are still engaged in bloody fighting. The Chinese army in front of Tengyue suffered heavy losses due to a Japanese counterattack on the 16th. However, on the morning of the 18th, they reorganized their remnants and launched another fierce attack on the Japanese army, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese defense forces for two full nights, and were completely repelled in an instant on the 19th. On the 20th, under the cover of a third artillery bombardment, the Chinese army broke through a part of the city wall. When the Chinese army attempted to break into the city, they were repelled by the Japanese army. On the 18th, the Chinese army repeatedly attacked four times, and under the cover of more than ten aircraft and concentrated artillery fire, they attempted to invade the city through the breach in the city wall. The Japanese army fought bravely day and night, overcoming the difficulties of fighting with a small number of troops, and continued to engage in bloody fighting. From the 13th to the 20th, the comprehensive war results obtained in the defense of Tengyue amounted to at least eight hundred Chinese army corpses abandoned, while approximately one hundred Japanese soldiers were also killed in action. In the Longling area, at dawn on the 18th, the Chinese army fiercely bombarded the Japanese army's positions with more than three thousand shells and launched a large-scale assault, engaging in a heroic hand grenade and bayonet charge with the Japanese army. They were repelled after about an hour. On the morning of the 19th, the Chinese army launched another attack, and on the 21st, they fiercely attacked the Japanese army's positions again for about three hours, finally breaking into the Japanese army's positions on the northern highlands of Longling, and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese defense forces.

### Japanese Troops in Truk Fighting Heroically

Truk Base, 29th (Central News Agency) – From Saipan Island, Guam Island, and Tinian Island to Truk Island, it takes no more than four hours by plane. The morale of the Japanese garrison on Truk Island is high. Whenever enemy aircraft attack, the heroic Japanese fighter pilots immediately take to the skies to engage them, intercepting enemy aircraft. On the other hand, they engage in submarine activity, attacking enemy ships, or intensifying land warfare training under intense air raids, constructing fortifications. The combination of blood, sweat, and mud fully demonstrates the hard work spirit of the Japanese soldiers on the front lines. Recently, enemy aircraft have been attacking very intensely, sometimes in dozens, sometimes in a few. The Japanese air force also often sends the same number of aircraft and skilled pilots into the air to intercept them, using a spirit of determination to make up for the lack of materials. This kind of superhuman action often surprises the enemy. All the land positions are fully prepared for enemy air raids. Air raid shelters are being built that cannot be destroyed even by 500-kilogram bombs. Other work to expand the positions is still continuing day and night. On the other hand, in order to prevent the enemy from landing, they are fiercely engaged in land warfare training, either in the hot weather or in the rain, training without interruption. At the same time, in order to prevent the supply routes from being cut off by the enemy, they are establishing self-sufficiency measures for food, opening up wasteland, and have planted potatoes, pumpkins, and cucumbers, etc., with very good results. In this way, the comprehensive preparations have been completed.

### Establishment of Security Advisory Council in the Philippines

As for the position of Commander of the Police Force, it will be succeeded by Mr. Santos, the Governor of Mindanao and Sulu.

### Japanese Youth Labor Movement Reaches Its Highest Point; Working Diligently in Factories to Increase Production

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – Japanese young men and students, in order to win the war and create a new history, have initiated a labor movement. At present, this movement is expanding and has reached its highest point. Members of the Japanese Navy News Corps and the Literary Suicide Squad, after visiting students participating in factory labor, expressed their impressions as follows: The term "students" includes university and secondary school students. At present, most schools at all levels in Japan have suspended classes, and all students have gone to factories to participate in work. However, this month, they attend school once a week for classes. From next month, the method may be changed to allow students to concentrate on learning various technologies, completely converting them into the most elite weapons of the shipyard. So I thought that those who wielded such weapons would naturally be the old workers of the shipyard, and the newly joined students would only stand in the distance and watch. However, when I gradually entered the interior of the factory, what surprised me and exceeded my expectations was that those who managed the cranes or held iron hammers were all young students who were still studying. When I saw this situation, I almost doubted my own eyes. Look, that group busy turning the crane, without a guide introducing them, I knew they were young patriots. Those who are hammering rivets, those who are punching holes, none of them are workers from the industry. I also visited once a large cargo ship of tens of thousands of tons under construction. There was also a group of students busy hammering rivets at the bottom of the ship. They were exposed to the scorching sun like fire and baked by the coal fire of the iron smelting furnace. Inside and out, it was extremely hot everywhere. But they still continued to work hard to complete their mission. A group of young middle school students gathered together and desperately carried steel plates. A team was enthusiastically manufacturing rollers. Originally, one skilled worker was required to watch the furnace, but none of them were students majoring in science and engineering, all of them were students majoring in liberal arts. Although it is factory work, because the young students have clear minds, they can complete the task in a quarter of the time of ordinary people. Their advantages are not limited to this. Because they work in the factory with true enthusiasm, they especially show a fresh and lively phenomenon. Although they are working hard all day, they are gradually gaining practical experience in factory management and factory management methods. So now we can go one step further and draw a conclusion that even if the students do not go to school at all, there is nothing worth worrying about. The young students are voluntarily working hard for the country in this way.

### German Forces in Defensive Battle Southeast of Paris; Enemy Advancing Towards the Marne River Bend

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to German reports: Southeast of Paris, American forces are advancing from the bridgeheads of Melun, Fontainebleau, Nogent, and Troyes towards the Marne River Bend (where the Marne flows east into the Rhine River), encountering strong resistance from the German forces. Fierce fighting is currently underway.

### Speculation on the Anti-Axis Military Strategy

Berlin, August 28th (Central Overseas News Agency) – As we predicted, the American army has now concentrated more mobile troops on the extreme right wing of the invasion of Europe's front line, which is located in the large bend of the upper reaches of the Seine River. After the enemy troops advanced to the city of Troyes at the end of last week and advanced forward, they are now approaching Romilly and Nogent. The American vanguard has even crossed the Seine River near Nogent. There are currently three possible strategies for the anti-Axis forces: 1. Advance towards Chalon and Reims, implementing their northern flank plan, in order to encircle the German forces along the Seine River on a large scale, and can make great use of tank convoys for combat in the Compiègne Plain. 2. Advance eastward into Nancy, breaking into the mountainous region of Western Lorraine, but will encounter difficult terrain. 3. Attempt to break into Burgundy, advancing towards the Swiss border through Dijon and Besançon, in order to cut off the retreat route of the German forces in southern France and prevent them from contacting the main German forces. Judging from the current situation, if the enemy forces cannot adopt the above three strategies at the same time, they will at least adopt two of them.

### Fierce Fighting Resumes on the Franco-Italian Border

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to German reports: On the 27th, the British and American forces in southern France continued to exert pressure on the west, north, and east. Within the Rhone River basin, German forces in the process of withdrawing have reached their designated positions. Although the British and American motorized formations have tried their best to attack, they have only achieved insignificant progress. The great battle on the Franco-Italian border has resumed. The British and American forces are attacking Saint-Paul, attempting to recapture the Maddalena Pass, but are blocked by the resistance of the German forces.

### Japanese Troops in Southern Henan Province Reach the Vicinity of Biyang; Fierce Street Fighting in Jiangkou, Leizhou Peninsula

Guangzhou, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to the Central News Agency in occupied areas: The Japanese troops in southern Henan Province suddenly moved from Queshan and Zhuzidian on the 22nd. On the 25th, they had reached an area 50 kilometers northeast and 40 kilometers west of Biyang and are currently engaged in combat with the Chinese army in that area.

Urumqi, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to Chongqing reports: The Chinese army authorities announced new movements of the Japanese army in Henan Province on the 27th as follows: The war front in Henan Province, north of Hekou, Xiangyang, and Shijiang, has been silent for a long time. The Japanese army suddenly began to attack again, forming a fan-shaped offensive westward from the Beijing-Hankou Railway, reaching the key points of Biyang, about 48 kilometers northeast and 40 kilometers east of the Queshan-Biyuan Highway.

Guangzhou, 29th (Central News Agency) reported: Fierce fighting continued in the Hengyang area on the 26th and 27th. The Japanese army advancing from Xiangxiang reached Yongfeng on the 26th and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army. In Zhejiang Province, strong Japanese forces have reached a point 17 kilometers south of Yiwu. In Guangdong Province, the Japanese and Chinese armies are engaged in fierce street fighting in Jiangkou, Leizhou Peninsula.

### Japanese Air Force Bombs Liuzhou Airfield

Japanese Army Frontline Base, 29th (Central News Agency) – Japanese aircraft squadrons attacked Liuzhou, a stronghold for the Chinese army's counteroffensive, on the night of the 28th, destroying one large aircraft, burning six aircraft on the ground, and inflicting considerable damage on ground facilities. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to their original defenses. Although the attack could take advantage of moonlight, the heavy cloud cover made navigation difficult. The Japanese bomber squadron arrived over the target at approximately 10:00 PM, first identifying a Chinese aircraft parked on the runway and immediately dropped bombs, setting it on fire. They followed up with a wave of attacks, confirming that they had burned six Chinese large aircraft, destroyed one large aircraft, and destroyed many ground facilities.

### Yu Mei Army Watching: Japanese Next Operation

Central News Agency, Shanghai: After the fall of Hengyang, the movements of the Japanese army have attracted much attention from the Yu Mei (Chongqing-America) forces. There are many speculations about the Japanese army's next move. Both the Yu and US sides are convinced that the Japanese army's next operation will definitely be to break through along the Xiang-Gui battle route into Guilin and Liuzhou in Guangxi, on the one hand going south to open up the Yue-Han (Guangdong-Hankou) railway line. The Yu Mei armies each have different ideas under the threat of the Japanese army, and therefore are making different plans. A Yu military spokesperson met with reporters and said that the Japanese army is currently concentrating on the west bank of the Xiang River, its first goal being to attack the Yu army west of Hengyang, and at the same time preparing to attack Guilin, the provincial capital of Guangxi, along the Xiang-Gui Railway. It is further predicted that a large-scale attrition battle will be launched before the next operation. It is said that the US military's plan to land on the Chinese coast will not be frustrated by the Japanese army's Hunan operation. If the US military can land, the Yu army can also attack the coastal areas. To cover up from the eyes and ears of the people, the Yu side greatly exaggerates the fierce counterattacks around Hengyang and the attack on the Japanese army around Yichang. The purpose of this public announcement is to restore the recognition of American newspapers, thereby increasing aid to Yu. Nimer, the United States, had long anticipated the inside story of the Yu side, so Reuters and other American newspapers have made the following comments: The Yu army's military operations in the west of Yichang and Hankou are aimed at containing the Japanese army in southern Hunan from attacking Guilin. However, Yichang and Hankou have become solid fortresses, and the Yu army lacks tanks and heavy weapons, so its operations will be difficult to succeed. According to front-line news, about ten divisions of the Yu army reinforcing Hengyang are gathered on both the east and west banks of the Xiang River, deploying troops in Yongfeng and Jinlan. However, they have been attacked by the Japanese army everywhere. The Yu army's counterattacks in the areas of Fengling, Anren, and Leiyang have also been frustrated by the Japanese army. The Yu side's counterattack on Yichang is only for publicity and has no real strength. Under the threat of the Japanese army's next operation, the Yu Mei army is quite frightened. The New York Times said: If the Japanese army starts to attack Guilin and Liuzhou, the US Air Force will have to retreat to Yunnan. Such pessimistic statements about sacrificing the Yu army on the mainland to echo the counterattack plan in the Pacific make the United States even more anxious and worried.

### Fierce Fighting in the Eastern Foothills of the Carpathians: Soviet Forces in Romania Occupy Buzau

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: Yesterday, the Soviet army, with superior forces, advanced south from the lower reaches of the Prut River and occupied Buzau, 45 miles northeast of Ploesti (the Romanian oil area). The German army is still engaged in fierce offensive and defensive battles on both sides of the lower reaches of the river. The fierce battle in the eastern part of the Carpathian Mountains has begun on the Hungarian border. The German-Hungarian Allied forces are fighting hard against the enemy, and the enemy has suffered heavy casualties. West of Baranov in the Vistula River bend, there have been frequent battles with advances and retreats. Northwest of Modon and Turbat (in Estonia), the Soviet army launched a new offensive. The German army repelled several Soviet troops during the counterattack.

Budapest, 29th (Central News Agency) - The total strength of the Soviet army on the current Romanian front is 60 to 70 divisions, which are advancing south along the Black Sea coast, and the progress of the Soviet army attacking Ploesti and Bucharest is quite rapid. The German army was temporarily surrounded by the Soviet-Romanian forces in the Kishinev area, but the German army successfully broke out and has concentrated in the Galati area, giving priority to guarding the lower reaches of the Douro River and the passes of the Carpathian Mountains with its main force. There are different opinions on the Soviet army's intentions. It is generally believed that it will advance south with its entire army, directly approaching the foothills of the Carpathians, in an attempt to occupy Romania and then threaten Bulgaria.

### Dynamics in Southeastern Europe Worth Watching

If necessary, a part of the troops will be divided to attack the German army in Bulgaria and isolate Greece, and another part will enter Serbia to contact Tito's army, so as to attack Hungary from the south. Another part will strengthen the Kragujevac Expeditionary Force to attack the German industrial areas of Styria and Slovakia. In the next week or two, the dynamics in Southern Europe will be more worthy of attention. When this situation unfolds, new situations in the Adriatic Sea and Turkey must also be watched carefully.

### Economic Security Office Exposes Illegal Sale of Rice: Rice Control Association Staff Evade Procurement and are Investigated

Since its establishment, the Economic Security Office has spared no effort in cracking down on the hoarding of major commodities, raising market prices without authorization, and engaging in malpractices in the operation of related goods in the city. In particular, it has attached special importance to the transportation and sale of food rice, and has successively discovered many cases of evading rice procurement. Among the cases that have been exposed, some Rice Control Association staff colluded with rice merchants to illegally apply for rice transportation permits, breaking them into smaller quantities to evade procurement. This behavior not only hinders the policy of controlling rice, but also directly affects the people's food supply, causing no small harm. Therefore, after confirming the investigation, it has successively sent the cases to the local procuratorate for investigation in accordance with the law. The details of the two cases are briefly recorded below:

Li Shouliu, a staff member of the Rice Control Association, in addition to working in the Rice Control Association, jointly established the Yufeng Rice Store in Songjiang with several relatives. Li Shouliu used his position to illegally obtain 14 rice transportation permits, four in the first time and ten in the second time, transporting the rice to Shanghai for sale and profit. Li Shouliu and other investors, Li Meng and Li Chuansheng, were summoned to the office for investigation and found to have committed the act of selling their positions. Therefore, they have been sent to the local procuratorate for legal action.

On July 20th of this year, the Shanghai Shen Bao published a short news item "Where does the large amount of rice come from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce?". After investigation by the office, it was confirmed that Chen Yuan, a section chief of the Rice Control Association, and clerk Rong Huiren, in the name of some staff members of the Rice Control Association, assisted the rice merchant Bao Mingxiang in illegally obtaining 18 rice transportation permits, transporting 180 dan of rice from Henglin, Changzhou to Shanghai for sale and profit, breaking them into smaller quantities to evade procurement. The investigation has been confirmed, so the above three suspects have been sent to the local procuratorate for legal action on the charge of selling their positions.

### Illegal Profit-Making Will Be Strictly Cracked Down

The office previously received a confidential report that some bread manufacturers instructed people to buy bread ration coupons outside, while receiving a large amount of rationed flour from the Flour and Noodle Control Office to make bread, which was sold in the city to make profits. On July 21st and July 26th, the office successively seized two bread factories engaged in this malpractice at No. 1317 Yuyuan Road and No. 91 Dengtuo Road. One was established by the Russian ABRIRKIN, and the other was established by the German Jew MALLACH. The price of bread ration is 22.8 yuan per pound, while the black market price is as high as 50 yuan. After deducting the cost of buying ration coupons, a net profit of more than 20 yuan per pound can be obtained, which has a significant impact on the people's food supply. It is now known that ABRIRKIN sold about 240 to 420 pounds of bread per day at black market prices in June and July, earning a profit of about 5,000 to 8,000 yuan per day. He has also purchased 61 sets of rations for August and September, totaling 3,600 coupons, preparing to illegally sell the bread obtained from these ration coupons. As for MALLACH, because he only recently started this illegal business, the scale is still small. He has purchased 90 ration coupons for August and September, preparing to sell the bread at black market prices. The details of the above two cases and the malpractices of other manufacturers are still under investigation.

### Thrift Association Asks Police to Strictly Prohibit Daoist Rituals and Promote National Banquet Regulations

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Special City Thrift Association has spared no effort in promoting various thrift affairs under the wartime system. Recently, as the early autumn season has arrived, there are many local ruffians and hooligans in the city who are holding Daoist rituals in the name of epidemic prevention and disaster relief, profiting from them. Such superstitious actions that waste money and manpower have long been repeatedly banned by the authorities. However, many citizens are still deceived by them. Therefore, the association has sent a letter to the police and Baojia authorities to tighten up the ban measures. The Baojia chiefs in various places are to dissuade them nearby. If local hooligans dare to force them, they can report to the police for arrest and punishment. Otherwise, if Daoist rituals are still found in the area, the Baojia chief will be responsible for dissuading them. At the same time, the Thrift Association has formulated the "Shanghai Special City Thrift Association's Promotion of Thrifty Banquet Measures" in accordance with Article 20 of the Wartime National Banquet Restriction Outline. It is reported that it has been submitted to the Social Welfare Bureau for approval. The Thrift Association is also planning to organize thrift inspectors to station in various restaurants to take responsibility for inspection. If any violations of the Wartime National Banquet Restriction Outline are found, the investigation results will be reported truthfully to the relevant authorities for strict punishment.

### Youth Movement and People's Movement in the City Have Been Unified

Due to the re-division of the administrative area of the city, the organization of the City New Movement Association and the Youth League in the city has also changed.

### Extending Empathy and Showing Compassion

Yesterday, we received a donation of 10,000 yuan from a confidential donor, which is deeply appreciated. We also received a letter from Wang Juegan, a student of Shanghai Xinzhong Middle School. He donated his prize money of 500 yuan from participating in the Mandarin speech contest to the scholarship fund, which is commendable. The original letter said: "Sir: I am a student of Shanghai Xinzhong Middle School. This time, the University Weekly Newspaper Society organized a Mandarin speech contest. I felt that the biggest reason for the lack of unity among our compatriots is the inability to unify the language. Therefore, I boldly participated in this speech contest, not measuring my shallow talent. Fortunately, I won the third place in the middle school category and received a prize of 500 yuan from the society. I originally planned to buy some toys as a souvenir. Later, I thought that my family situation was still good, so I could receive high school education. However, I don't know how many poor young people cannot receive higher education. Extending empathy, I am willing to donate all the prize money I received today to your newspaper's scholarship fund, to fulfill my duty of mutual assistance, and to express my respect for your newspaper's enthusiasm for caring for out-of-school youth."

### Customs Detains Goods, Must Obtain a Receipt

Jianghai Customs issued Announcement No. 1727 yesterday, stating that the customs should issue a receipt for the detained goods. This has been stipulated in the relevant regulations and has been announced and notified many times. It is now found that recently, merchants often do not know to obtain the receipt when their goods are detained, so that the identity of the owner cannot be proved, and there is no way to investigate the cases, which not only increases the difficulty of handling cases by the customs, but also damages the interests of the owner. For this reason, it is re-announced that the owner of the detained goods must obtain the receipt from the customs officer on the spot and immediately report it to the head of the Supervision Section on the ground floor of the Customs Building on the Bund, or to the place where the case occurred. If it is too late, they can also submit a detailed written report for verification. Do not delay. If the merchant has a written appeal for the detained goods, the number of the receipt for the detained goods should be noted, and there is no need to submit the receipt with the application, so that it can be used to collect the goods when they are returned. In addition, if the merchant has a written appeal regarding the detained goods or the dutiable value of the declared goods, it should be submitted to the Secretariat on the third floor of the Customs for submission to the Customs Commissioner for handling.

### Materials Investigation Committee to End at the Beginning of Next Month

The Materials Investigation Committee, which was established in Shanghai last year by the Executive Yuan of the National Government to crack down on hoarding and speculative speculation and to suppress prices, has made good achievements in investigating cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and matches, soap, candles, and other materials related to people's livelihood in the urban area for one year. Now, because the work of this materials investigation is being carried out by the local competent authorities, the Materials Investigation Committee is no longer necessary. Therefore, it was approved by the Executive Yuan meeting at the beginning of this month to abolish it. It is now learned that the Materials Investigation Committee has received the order from the Executive Yuan to abolish it and is handling the closure. Because there are still many investigation procedures that have not been completed and need to be decided to transfer the procedures, the committee decided to hold a final meeting at the beginning of next month to determine all closure matters.

### Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau Announcement

— Jing Si Zi No. 18

It is found that the city is actively promoting electricity conservation recently. All factories, groups, and residences should comply with it. However, considering that there are many factories in the city, such as those producing military supplies and daily necessities, if the electricity is also restricted, it will have a great impact on wartime production. Therefore, in order to clarify the situation of each factory's products and electricity consumption, the bureau will give appropriate increases in electricity to factories producing military supplies and daily necessities, otherwise, strict restrictions or power cuts will be imposed. This approach aims to promote wartime production while adapting to wartime thrift. All factories in the city are requested to bring their factory seal and the private seal of the person in charge to the Fourth Section of the Bureau to collect and fill out the form within one month from the date of publication. Each form costs 100 yuan in national currency for printing costs and handling fees. If they fail to report within the deadline, it will be regarded as a voluntary waiver and the power line will be cut off without exception. This announcement is hereby made for general knowledge.

August 28, 33rd year of the Republic of China.
