### Editorial: Impressions of a Half-Day on Hongqiao Road - Conversations with Endless Rice Vendors

— Chen Binhe

Since the establishment of the Municipal Advisory Committee, it has paid close attention to municipal affairs, especially issues related to the lives of citizens. The city's food supply problem has been the most important issue for the Advisory Committee from the beginning. After several discussions, it submitted proposals to the government. However, it is regrettable that in the past month, the rice supply problem has become widespread and severe. In order to understand the source of rice in the suburbs of Shanghai and any obstacles along the way, members of the Advisory Committee invited representatives from the municipal government to conduct on-the-spot observations. Yesterday, Mr. Chen Riping, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan, and myself, along with Mr. Shen Guanzhun, Secretary of the Municipal Government, and Mr. Lu Qiwen, Special Commissioner, a group of five people, set off from the Shen Bao newspaper office at 2:00 PM on the 27th, with Hongqiao Airport as the destination, passing through Chenjiaqiao, a rice distribution center. On the way back, we also went to the Xujiahui area. Along the way, most of the rice vendors transported rice by bicycle. We got out of the car at any time and talked to the rice-selling villagers resting by the roadside, a total of six times. The questions and answers were roughly as follows: Question: Where does the rice come from? What is the purchase price? Answer: It is transported from Qingpu. Today's purchase price is 880 or 890 yuan per dou, and the profit is 300 or 400 yuan per dan. Question: Are there any obstacles on the road? Is there any extortion? Answer: In the past four or five days, the obstacles have been reduced. Extortion has also decreased. However, the police and security teams in Qingpu County extort 5 to 10 yuan per dou for cigarette money. When they demand money, their attitude is polite, and they say that their salaries are too low and ask for help. But there are also those who do not extort money. (The tone of speech was quite joyful) Question: What was the extortion situation in the past? Answer: 15 to 20 yuan was demanded for every 1,000 dou, and the attitude was very aggressive. Question: Where does Qingpu's rice come from? Where do you buy rice in Qingpu? Answer: Most of Qingpu's rice comes from Zhujiajiao. To buy rice in Qingpu, some buy from rice shops, some buy from cigarette shops (because cigarette shops also operate rice), and some buy from households. Question: Are there many people going to Qingpu to buy rice? Answer: There are two shifts of cars a day, morning and afternoon. At the same time, there are one thousand and several hundred bicycles transporting rice.

From the above questions and answers, it can be proven that the municipal government's efforts to dredge the source of rice, prohibit extortion, and eliminate obstacles have been effective. Therefore, we believe that the reason why rice prices are still high is because the price of rice in the producing areas is high. This leads us to suspect that there must be hoarders manipulating the market in the producing areas. Because in the past, the cost of planting for farmers did not exceed 2,000 or 3,000 yuan per shi. The purchase prices in the past were unreasonable, and the current soaring prices are even more unreasonable. We believe that the crux of the problem is that the hoarders in the producing areas knew in advance that the government would change the procurement method. After the change, they desperately pushed up prices and made huge profits.

Members of the Advisory Committee, especially Mr. Li Zanhoushi Xiang Kang, strongly advocated that the government must limit the price of rice in the producing areas before changing the method, but the price limit could be higher. On the one hand, planned procurement is necessary, and competitive bidding should not be allowed. However, the authorities did not pay attention to these two points, resulting in the current abuses.

Secondly, we are very moved by the porters on the road, sweating profusely, earning meager profits of 300 or 400 yuan per stone of rice. They are all meritorious in supplying Shanghai's food. Zhu Baiying said, "When eating a bowl of porridge or rice, we should think of how hard it was to obtain it." Bai Juyi's poem says, "How can you know that every grain in the plate is the result of hard work?" I wonder if those who enjoy high-end entertainment in Shanghai have ever thought about how hard the meritorious people who supply food are! On the way back on Hongqiao Road, we saw police officer No. 5815 from Shanghai searching a rice vendor's rice. According to him, he was searching for smuggled goods. According to our observation, this rice vendor was a complete villager and would not carry smuggled goods. With his obstruction, he had to sweat more. We felt very sorry for him. We don't know if the police authorities ordered him to search rice vendors?

We hope that the municipal government will quickly implement new and reasonable distribution methods and quickly organize price stabilization work to relieve part of the food shortage. However, the food problem is a whole, and it cannot be solved by local or regional efforts alone. The central government must formulate an overall plan, and the provincial and municipal authorities and county local authorities must do their best to assist in its implementation to achieve results. For example, even if this city can eliminate extortion, if the price of rice cannot be stabilized in the producing areas, the price of rice in this city will never fall. At the same time, we have previously suggested that the central government should quickly organize a livelihood inspection team, and we hope that the municipal government will also consider organizing one, believing that it will be of some help in solving the livelihood problem.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that on the way back, we passed by the Siwei Chemical Farm on Hongqiao Road and took the opportunity to visit. The farm hires a Hungarian technician who uses yellow sand and chemicals to grow tomatoes without soil. The tomatoes are seedless and have a good color and taste. It is said that the same method will be used to grow tropical plants such as jackfruit, cherimoya, watermelon, and mangoes, and they will be produced soon. I think investing in and establishing this kind of industry that is beneficial to people's livelihoods is much more meaningful than opening stock companies and business companies.

### Adjustment Principles

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th - Regarding the adjustment of the control organization, according to the authorities, it is being carried out based on the following principles: Material control adopts the principle of focusing on key items. Those that are important are strictly controlled, and the control methods are varied depending on the supply and demand situation. Strengthen the Commercial Control Council and its subordinate organizations to promote the spirit of autonomous control and seek closer relationships between the various levels to ensure smooth operation from top to bottom. Strive for harmony between the administrative organizational system and the civil economic organizational system, and maintain consistency between central and local administrative organizations. Clearly delineate the scope of authority between central and local organizations and between government and commercial groups to clarify responsibilities. Avoid interference and friction between Chinese and Japanese civil economic organizations to promote normal activities.

### Key Points of Improvement

As for the key points of improvement, they can be summarized as follows: In terms of organization, this adjustment clearly delineates the functions and powers of the relevant agencies. For example, the Material Control Review Committee is an advisory body to the Executive Yuan, responsible for reviewing important economic policies. The National General Commercial Control Council is responsible for connecting and coordinating the lower-level organizations and supervising and guiding them. The Rice and Grain, Cotton, Flour and Wheat, Oil and Grain, and Daily Necessities Control Committees are responsible for implementing their respective businesses. The system is clear and there is no overlap. The Material Control Review Committee has also established a Standing Committee to assist the Chairman in handling daily affairs, simplifying the organization and improving the efficiency of control. In terms of personnel, in addition to key personnel from relevant Chinese and Japanese agencies and the financial and industrial sectors, the members of the Material Control Review Committee also include representatives from various provinces and special municipalities, integrating the opinions of the central government, local governments, and relevant parties. The directors and supervisors of the Commercial Control Council and the chairmen of the various control committees are all leaders who are highly respected and familiar with the industry. The government has high expectations for the progress of future control efforts.

### Other Materials

Regarding materials outside the control of the Control Committee, such as wool, leather, cigarettes, and tobacco leaves, the competent authorities will formulate management measures separately, taking into account the needs of the times, the urgency of the situation, and the degree of importance, so that these important materials can also be reasonably controlled. Other matters, such as the relationship between Chinese and Japanese commercial groups and the system of Chinese commercial groups, will also be rationally adjusted by the relevant parties to further improve the entire economic control mechanism. Continue to carry out various activities, separately eliminate the counterattacks from the Chongqing army from land, sea, and air, and remove any obstacles and invite US aircraft to remove the mines blocking waterways, etc. At the same time, suppress the Dongting Lake water city and bravely advance, making the land forces' combat favorable progress.

### Japanese Aircraft Night Raid on Lingling Airport

Central News Agency, a certain Japanese base, 27th - The Chongqing Air Force base in Hengyang was attacked by the Japanese army. The Chongqing Air Force fled to Lingling, where it deployed more than 50 fighter planes to launch hit-and-run attacks.

In this battle, one small Chongqing fighter plane was hit and caught fire, and two others were damaged. One auxiliary facility caught fire and one exploded. The Chongqing army's anti-aircraft fire was very fierce, and the weather was bad, so one Japanese plane did not return.

### Japanese Army Continues to Advance in Henan Province

Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 27th - The Japanese army in Henan began attacking the area along the new Yellow River east of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, the territory of the Chongqing army's Fan Dong Tingshen Army (Commander Chen Yixin), numbering about 20,000, on the night of the 16th. That night, the Japanese troops repelled these troops, and by the morning of the 18th, they occupied Fugou (50 kilometers east of Xuchang). They continued to advance south, and on the 20th, they broke into Xihua (30 kilometers southeast of Fugou), expanding their results. With the cooperation of fast-moving units, the army attacked Zhoujiakou (an important town on the west bank of the new Yellow River). On the 18th, they eliminated stubborn resistance from the Chongqing army at a point 10 kilometers northwest of the town. By the morning of the 19th, they occupied Zhoujiakou and continued to advance south, occupying Shangshui (20 kilometers south of Zhoujiakou) on the 20th. They are currently pursuing the defeated Chongqing troops.

Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 27th - Since mid-June, the Japanese army has launched a destructive campaign against the Fan Dong Tingshen Army led by Chen Yixin, who are entrenched along the new Yellow River line east of the Beijing-Hankou Railway and in southern Henan Province.

The entire East Asian

nation, the entire Chinese nation's great East Asian War for survival is now entering the final decisive stage. At the beginning of the war, the Allied forces used the power of a thunderbolt to destroy the enemy's century-old power in East Asia in the blink of an eye. The foundation for victory has already been laid. For two years, the enemy's remaining forces have been gradually cleared, and the prospect of victory has become brighter. As long as we continue our efforts, we will definitely achieve complete victory. However, the ambition of Britain and the United States to invade and enslave East Asia, driven by greed, is still desperate, vainly trying to revive. Therefore, the Allied forces and we cannot but strive for the final five minutes, killing the enemy in front and achieving the results, consolidating security in the rear, expanding the peaceful area, and fully realizing complete peace. All of you are selected from among the generals, the pillars of the country. Now you have come to the Corps for further education as active-duty officers. Your role in reorganizing and building the army is extremely important and significant, especially at this last crucial moment of the East Asian nation's and the Chinese nation's survival.

### Critical Moment

It is the time for us to demonstrate our martial spirit and be diligent and enterprising, awaiting orders at all times. Upon returning to your posts after graduation, you must fulfill your responsibilities in your respective positions, working with one heart and one mind to complete the final victory. Our efforts focus on three aspects: politically, rectifying thought; economically, increasing production; and militarily, ensuring security. Our efforts to rectify thought, increase production, and ensure security in the peaceful area are aimed at consolidating the peaceful area, expanding the peaceful area, and realizing complete peace. Because the Chongqing Communist forces are completely puppets of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, in other words, they are the forces of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the Chongqing Communist area is also the enemy's area. Our expansion of the peaceful area and the realization of complete peace are equivalent to recovering the fallen areas and eliminating the enemy's forces. Therefore, although our work may seem to be in the rear in the future, its significance is the same as that of the front line. Moreover, ensuring security in the peaceful area, expanding the peaceful area, and realizing complete peace can gradually reduce the Allied forces' worries in the rear, allowing them to successively deploy the troops stationed in China to the front lines, increasing their combat power. The victory in the Pacific War will be more assured and will be completed sooner. This is equivalent to our soldiers fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Allied forces in the Pacific. While the three key tasks should be equally important, at the same time, efforts to ensure security are particularly fundamental, because if security cannot be ensured, the Communist bandits will breed, and the people's livelihood will not be peaceful. Then, rectifying thought and increasing production cannot be realized. Only when security is ensured can the Communist bandits be eliminated, the people can live and work in peace, and the rectification of thought and the increase in production can be completed. Therefore, we must devote special efforts to the fundamental and important task of ensuring security. All of you are intelligent and brave, warriors of the era, unwilling to be oppressed, unwilling to be slaves, and have long had the determination. After returning to your teams, you must always worry about the difficulties of the country's future and the importance of your own responsibilities. Be wise and brave, work hard and diligently, share weal and woe with the soldiers, and protect the people. Do not drive fish into the deep, do not drive birds into the thicket. Sacrifice everything to serve the country, so that the final victory of the Great East Asian War can be achieved sooner, and the liberation of the East Asian nations can be achieved sooner.

### Chinese Independence

The completion of autonomy and revival is what this Chairman has high hopes for. Furthermore, your training period in the Corps was very short, and the equipment in the Corps was limited by funding. However, now that you have achieved such results, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the efforts of all the faculty, staff, and advisors.

### German Troops in Normandy Fight Valiantly to Prevent Enemy from Penetrating Inland, British Elite Forces Reinforce Tilley Area

Central News Agency, Berlin, 27th - Haintong News Agency military correspondent Sertorius stated that the battle for Cherbourg is coming to an end. Although the remaining German defending forces are still heroically resisting at various points, the outcome of this battle is already clear under the circumstances of the enemy being numerous and we being few. It is undeniable that the Anglo-American forces will win, but whether the enemy's occupation of Cherbourg is a real gain is still questionable. The first thing to point out is that even if the enemy occupies Cherbourg, they still cannot use the port. Before the American troops entered the city, the German troops had thoroughly destroyed the port facilities. The enemy has repair preparations, but part of the fortress is still in the hands of the German troops, and their cannons are facing the port, so the repair work must wait until all the forts have been completely occupied. Another reason to reduce the value of the enemy's victory is that the American troops participating in the Battle of Cherbourg exceeded the original number by four to five times. The enemy can immediately replenish the vacancies in the various divisions in the shortest possible time, but it will take time for this huge army to concentrate in this small area to continue to advance south. Moreover, the road ahead is blocked by the strong German positions, which must be occupied first. Therefore, it will be difficult for General Montgomery's troops to penetrate Normandy in the next few days to obtain the cooperation of the American First Army. The British Second Army is currently temporarily using its own troops to launch an offensive in the Tilley area on Sunday morning. After heavy damage, they managed to occupy the ruins of Tilley and penetrated the German positions by about one kilometer, but the gap was soon filled. The enemy has transferred new forces to help in the battle, so the great battle is still going on fiercely. The initial goal of the British offensive was to break through along the highway between Caumont and Caen. The widest part of the front line reached six kilometers, and there are signs of expanding to neighboring areas. This offensive may develop into a major offensive by the enemy to advance inland.

### Cherbourg Garrison Would Rather Die Than Surrender

Central News Agency, Berlin, 27th - The German authorities announced on the 26th that the German defense commander in Cherbourg has rejected the American troops' surrender advice. The German troops in the area are determined to continue defending to the end, and are engaging in fierce bayonet fighting with the anti-Axis forces, desperately defending the various fortresses, but thousands of German troops have been overwhelmed by the superior forces of the anti-Axis forces.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 27th - On the night of the 25th, the Cherbourg fortress was cut off from external communications. The German garrison in the former Cherbourg fortress issued its last radio report, saying, "The German Cherbourg garrison is now united in continuing the final desperate battle. Long live Führer Hitler, long live Germany."

### Unconfirmed German General Captured

Stockholm, 17th - Central News Agency via Reuters: Anti-Axis sources in London issued a statement this morning saying that General Hüner, commander of Cherbourg, and Major General Hanneck, commander of Normandy defenses, have been captured, but this statement has not yet been confirmed by other sources. Every Inch Gained at a Heavy Price

Forward Lines, 17th - Central News Agency via Huitong News Agency Naval Correspondent Dennis, filed a report a few hours after leaving Cherbourg, stating: As the war extended to the suburbs of the city, every position, every machine gun nest, or individual stronghold was fiercely contested. The German army completely destroyed the remaining port facilities of Cherbourg. The last few hours of hard struggle defy description. The German army held on to every square foot of land, exacting the greatest effort from the enemy and inflicting the greatest losses.

Berlin, 27th - Central News Agency via German News Agency: Yesterday, fierce fighting occurred in Italy between the Tyrrhenian Sea and Lake Trasimeno. The remnants of the enemy, mostly annihilated in that area, had received reinforcements a few days ago. The enemy launched an offensive on a broad front. After fierce fighting, the German army retreated several kilometers along the coast.

### British King's Nephew Wounded and Captured

Stockholm, 27th - Central News Agency via Huitong News Agency: British sources report that Lord Russell, nephew of King George VI of England, has been wounded and captured on the Italian front. Lord Russell is the eldest son of Lord Herwell, and also inherits his title.

### German Troops on the Central Eastern Front Retreating to New Positions - Soviet Army Adopting Pincer Encirclement Tactics

Berlin, 27th - Central News Agency via German News Agency, according to an official German announcement: The valiant German forces in the central sector of the Eastern Front, in the areas of Babruysk, Mogilev, and Osipovichi, are engaged in fierce offensive and defensive battles with six enemy armies. West and northwest of Vitebsk, German forces are currently fighting fiercely, retreating to new positions. East of Polotsk, Soviet forces launched an attack under tank cover but were repulsed.

Berlin, 27th - Central News Agency via Huitong News Agency: Following increased Soviet air activity on the Eastern Front, Mogilev, the Smolensk highway, and Vitebsk have become three focal points of intense fighting. The Soviet army is attempting a pincer encirclement in the Vitebsk area, and fierce battles are ongoing. Near Smolensk, the Soviet army lost 175 tanks, and on the Western Dvina front, they lost 70. The severity of the situation is evident.

### Rice from Various Regions Continuously Transported to Shanghai - Supply and Demand Can Be Balanced - Difficulties and Extortion Along the Way Affect Rice Prices in This City

The rice supply in this city has been well managed by the government authorities, with close cooperation between officials and merchants. The daily arrivals have been relatively smooth, and rice prices have fallen below nine dollars. Rice merchants are procuring rice from various regions, applying for permits, with an average quantity of about 20,000 dan per day. Rice purchased from Wuhu, Changzhou, Kunshan, Taizhou, and other places has been arriving in Shanghai successively. The number of temporary transport permits applied for by citizens is over 1,000 shi per day. Those transporting from Qingpu, Zhujiajiao, Songjiang, and other producing areas are continuously on the road. Based on the above applications and the amount of rice being transported, supply and demand can be considered roughly equivalent. According to the current situation, calculating the cost of rice from the producing areas, plus transportation costs and legitimate profits, the price in the city should be able to return to normal. However, it has not yet returned to the right track. The main reason is that there are still difficulties and extortion along the way.

Reports from Rice Purchasing Merchants In recent days, rice merchants who have registered to purchase rice have reported that a certain county on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line has prohibited the export of rice and has arbitrarily established trade associations. A certain location on the Shanghai-Nanjing line is said to be charging a handling fee of 50 yuan per dan to a certain rice store holding Shanghai Rice Permit No. 1099. It is also rumored that citizens in a certain county holding Temporary Rice Transport Permit No. 699 from the Rice and Grain Control Committee were obstructed from transporting rice in that area and were restricted to selling it locally. Furthermore, merchants in a certain county holding Permits Nos. 592, 593, 272, and 185 were obstructed in a certain location. They had to pay 500 yuan per shi of rice to be allowed to proceed. Although these facts have not been personally witnessed, these rumors are definitely not without cause. Evidence from the Food Administration authorities shows that the daily correspondence and files regarding these matters are numerous, and a general understanding can already be gleaned. Regarding the ban on rice exports in various regions, the reporter once interviewed the Rice and Grain Control Committee.

Will Request Sanctions from Authorities According to the spokesperson of the Committee: "This Committee is the national rice and grain control agency. We treat the food supply of the entire country equally and handle it uniformly. The permits and certificates we issue allow the transport of rice from producing areas, taking into account the local consumption quantity, and only allow transport of the surplus to regulate the food supply in Nanjing and Shanghai. Therefore, there is no impact on the local food supply. The Executive Yuan has already issued an order to the governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, instructing all counties and districts under their jurisdiction not to obstruct the transport of rice. Therefore, arbitrarily banning the export of rice is a violation of regulations, and arbitrarily establishing trade associations is also illegal." It is slightly opened for relevant parties to dispatch secret agents, disguised as rice merchants, to go to various places to investigate the truth and to photograph the acts of obstruction and extortion, in order to present them to the highest authorities for severe sanctions. It is generally believed that if these extortionists are not severely punished, it will not be enough to serve as a warning.

### Minister Matsushima Discusses Mariana Islands Battle Situation - Japanese Aircraft Are Destroying Enemy Fleets

The battle situation in the Mariana Islands is becoming increasingly fierce. Minister Matsushima, Fleet Spokesman stationed in China, gave a statement yesterday stating: The decisive battle between Japan and the United States in the Mariana Islands is still continuing fiercely. The enemy is desperately trying to capture Saipan and is also making a sudden attack on Iwo Jima, between Japan and Saipan, in an attempt to cut off Japan's supply line to the Mariana Islands. However, the Japanese garrison on Saipan and the garrisons in the Volcano Islands are fighting bravely, causing the enemy to be exhausted. The enemy is currently losing everything in their attempt to capture Saipan. In other words, due to the skillful operations of the Japanese army, the enemy is losing their valuable warships and aircraft carriers every day. Japanese aircraft are continuously active in the inner South Seas islands such as Truk and Palau, as well as in the Philippines and other places. Wherever there are airfield facilities, there are traces of Japanese aircraft, and no enemy land-based air force can organize a strong formation. Therefore, Japan is currently in the most advantageous situation to destroy the enemy fleet. Once the Japanese fleet has grasped air supremacy and carries out a decisive battle, the American forces will become increasingly disadvantaged, but the Japanese army's operations will become increasingly advantageous. To protect the capital of tens of thousands of people on Saipan, the United States will lose all of its principal and interest. This is only a matter of time, and we can wait and see.

### Wheat Flour Control Committee Confirms Collection and Distribution Plan

After the reorganization of the Business Control Committee's Wheat Flour Control Committee, the internal structure is planned to be changed to one office, three divisions, and ten sections, which are currently being adjusted. The committee has decided on the steps to implement the wheat flour control plan and has drafted four interim plans for wheat flour purchase, wheat flour distribution, processing and manufacturing, and movement control. These plans have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and they will be announced and implemented once approved. It is understood that the committee's new control plan is more advanced and improved than the past, and its strengthening focus is on: Wheat flour self-manufacturing, that is, the wheat purchased by designated purchasing merchants, agents, and grain stores is directly entrusted to local flour mills to grind flour and bran. The purchase price of wheat is based on the standard of allowing farmers to survive, and a fair and reasonable price is set for purchase. Stipulating strict measures for movement control to prevent smuggling and corruption.

### Tram Lines Return to Normal Operation

Since the labor strike occurred at the Shanghai Tram Company on the 23rd of this month, the company and relevant authorities have made great efforts. On the 26th, a portion of the main lines was restored to traffic first, and from yesterday onward, all lines have been fully restored.

### Tragic Ferry Overturn Accident at Gao Miao Pier

Over Ten Male and Female Passengers Drowned In the Huangpu River at the Gao Miao Pier, i.e., Qingning Temple in Pudong, a ferry overturned at 6:30 AM on the morning of the 26th, resulting in the tragic drowning of over ten passengers. Details obtained from the relevant authorities are as follows: The owner of the overturned boat, Shen Huixiang, a Chongming native, is 43 years old and makes a living by rowing boats. He owns a two-ton wooden boat and specializes in ferrying workers from the Yufeng Yarn Factory at the pier, but he has not obtained a Huangpu River permit from the Public Utilities Bureau and has not joined the Ferry Industry Association. At 6:30 AM on the morning of the incident, he was loading workers at the Qingning Temple pier to cross the river. However, the boat had not yet stopped properly, and the workers rushed to board, becoming very crowded. Shen Huixiang was deeply concerned that there would be an accident due to the excessive number of people, and he hastily rowed the boat away from the pier. Unexpectedly, the boarding workers had exceeded the load capacity, and they had not yet sat down, causing the boat to lose its balance. Coupled with the fact that it was high tide and the current was very strong, the boat overturned, causing a major tragedy. Police officers Liu Chunhua and Han Fengming from the water patrol team led small boats to rescue the victims, but the tide was too rapid, and they were unable to rescue them in time. Over ten people sank to the bottom of the river. Mr. Kimura, the owner of the Yufeng Yarn Factory, assisted in the search with boats upon hearing the news.

Recovered Corpses After recovering the corpses, they included Qian Genyun, a 24-year-old female living at No. 4 Qianjiawan, Pudong; Xi Zhaodi, a 16-year-old female living at No. 38 Quanjiazhai, Jinjia Song, Pudong; Tao Rongzhen, a 14-year-old female living in Majia Alley, Pudong; Lu Xingeng, 27 years old, living at No. 8 Lujia Lane, Pudong; Ding Xiaomei, a 43-year-old widow living in Dongzuijiao, Pudong; Wu Jinmei, a 16-year-old female living in Dongzuijiao, Pudong, etc. Among them, except for Xi Zhaodi, who was a female worker at the Gongda Yarn Factory, the rest were workers at the Yufeng Yarn Factory. Their families have claimed the bodies for burial. The corpses of Zhuang Yuanmei, Zhang Peizhen, Ma Xiaomei, Liu Xiulan, Ma Genmei, Ma Wenzhen, and others have not yet been recovered. Their families are crying along the riverbank, which is very tragic. After the incident, the boat owner, Shen Huixiang, has been detained by the Water Patrol Headquarters for investigation.

### Short Commentary - Donate Scrap Metal

The Shanghai Economic Bureau recently convened a symposium of representatives from various industry associations across the city, presided over by Director Xu of the Economic Bureau, to encourage members of various industry associations to donate scrap metal, hoping that association members would donate as much as possible.

During wartime, in order to jointly strive for victory, the people have the obligation to contribute money, goods, and labor to the country. All belligerent countries are like this. Moreover, we can further understand the future of the country's efforts to achieve victory from the people's emotions regarding the contribution of money, goods, and labor. Therefore, when the country makes demands on the people, the people should do their best to meet them. We are currently in a decisive period, and everyone should pay special attention to this principle.

Voluntarily donating scrap metal is the obligation of the people to contribute goods that the country requires, and the people should do their best to donate. Moreover, scrap metal is merely idle waste in the possession of the people, and at most it is only a part of personal property. However, for the country, it can be used as a raw material for military needs, and even as a raw material for machinery in civilian industries, to manufacture tools for striving for victory and protecting the people's property, and to manufacture tools for manufacturing civilian goods. In individuals, it is a small amount of waste, but in the country, it can be used greatly. Weighing the importance, this is what should be done.

This newspaper is humbly a member of the nation and has already donated 200 jin of scrap iron as an example, hoping that all sectors of society will respond enthusiastically and form a vigorous movement.
