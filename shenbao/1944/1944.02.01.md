### Editorial: New Developments in the European Situation - Starting with the Soviet-Polish Dispute

A: At a time when anti-Axis propaganda was loudly trumpeting an offensive on the European continent, the sudden Soviet-Polish dispute arose, and it seems to be in a stalemate. Will this have an impact on the future European war and the international situation?

B: Indeed, most people have been talking about this issue these past few days, and some even say that the evolution of the Soviet-Polish dispute into a problem of Anglo-American relations with the Soviet Union seems to be a significant interlude in the international war of 1944. However, even though it is just an interlude, it automatically sullies the superficial articles of the Atlantic Charter and other such documents!

A: Do you think the Soviet-Polish dispute is one of the manifestations of discord among the anti-Axis nations?

B: How could it not be? As far as the Soviet-Polish dispute is concerned, its origins lie as far back as five years ago, when the Second European War broke out in 1939. The Soviet Union seized the opportunity to advance into Poland, seizing eastern Poland and other Eastern European regions, while annexing the three small Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, restoring the former territory of Imperial Russia, and declaring the liberation of "West Belarus" and "West Ukraine." However, this action immediately aroused resentment from the British and Americans, who first engaged in instigating and assisting Finland's anti-Soviet actions, and then supported the Polish government-in-exile in London, actively carrying out anti-Soviet activities, which did not stop even after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war in June 1941. However, as the German-Soviet war progressed and the Soviet Union lost territory at a rapid pace, the Soviet-Polish issue was put on hold.

A: Then why did this dispute arise again after the Moscow and Tehran Conferences, when the anti-Axis nations were promoting the idea of eternal cooperation between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union?

B: Frankly speaking, since the German-Soviet war, Britain and America have been adopting a policy of "sitting on the mountain to watch the tigers fight," trying their best to avoid and reduce the damage of the war, while hoping that Germany and the Soviet Union would kill and exhaust each other until they were unable to fight Britain and America any further. In the process of implementing this policy, it was of course necessary to appease the Soviet Union to prevent it from developing ulterior motives. The Moscow Conference and the Tehran Conference at the end of the year both had this meaning. Talk of strategic cooperation to post-war cooperation, etc., is just diplomatic etiquette. However, on the one hand, due to the new manifestations of German strategy, and on the other hand, due to the rapid advance of the Soviet winter offensive, the flames of war have approached the old borders between Poland and the Soviet Union and Romania and the Soviet Union. As a result, the Polish and Balkan issues have once again attracted international attention, and Britain and America will certainly not fail to feel the danger of westward expansion of communism. The Soviet-Polish dispute is one of its manifestations.

A: I see. No wonder the Soviet Union's Pravda spread rumors of peace talks between Germany and Britain to provoke a nerve war with Britain and America. It seems that in the future, there will be one ugly drama after another between the Soviet Union, Britain, and America, waiting to be staged in 1944. However, it is very strange that since Pravda published this rumor, pro-Soviet arguments have appeared in British and American public opinion circles!

B: There is really nothing particularly strange about it! On the one hand, Britain and America are afraid of the red terror penetrating Europe, and on the other hand, they are unwilling to decisively stop fighting against Germany, the only country in Europe capable of subduing communism, and they themselves are already riddled with holes, with strikes and internal strife rising one after another. In the end, they have no choice but to yield to Stalin! The trend of events is that Britain and America will only yield. Only Germany's strong morale and invincible defensive capabilities can decide everything.

### Reorganization of the Operations of the North China Development Company and Other Organizations - Minister Aoki Answers Questions from Diet Members

Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) - At a meeting of the North China Development Bill Committee in the House of Representatives on the 31st, Representative Ashida Hitoshi asked about the future direction of the North China Development Company and the Central China Development Company. Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia replied as follows: After the outbreak of the China Incident, both companies began active operations, first entrusting the task of investing in construction and control to various business companies. After the implementation of the new policy, they also cooperated with great enthusiasm in strengthening combat power and replenishing materials in China. Japan must also follow China's wishes and research and, as much as possible, allow China to manage joint ventures between China and Japan. The Central China Silk Company and the Central China Supervisory Company are examples of this. Therefore, the North China Development Company and the Central China Development Company must also adapt to the new situation and reform their organizations and operations. As for the local control companies, they should also be controlled as appropriate, depending on the situation.

Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) - At a meeting of the House of Representatives North China Development Company Amendment Bill Committee on the 31st, Representative Ono Yu questioned the implementation of Japan's policy toward China and the relationship between China and Japan. Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Greater East Asia Ministry replied, stating in essence that the spirit of the new policy toward China is to eliminate the remnants of Britain and America and to aim for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The purpose of abolishing extraterritoriality and transferring taxation rights is to eradicate British and American-style oppression and cooperate with China's free development, thereby further strengthening the relationship between China and Japan. Since the implementation of the new policy, the Chinese side has also been very active and has further doubled its cooperation with Japan. Since the two countries now have this kind of relationship, all our expatriates must serve the motherland and work harder for China.

### Four German Generals Defending the Fortress of Europe

German newspapers published on January 14: Marshal Kesselring is active as Commander-in-Chief of the Southwest Atlantic. When Badoglio betrayed and German troops entered Italy, Marshal Kesselring served as Commander of the Southern Army in Italy, taking on the heavy task of preventing the anti-Axis forces from advancing. After Marshal Rommel recovered from his illness, he made a comeback and was appointed as Commander of the Northern Army in Italy. After that, Marshal Rommel inspected the defenses of Europe under the order of Führer Hitler. At the end of November last year, he patrolled Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. Marshal Kesselring, who established a great achievement in blocking the offensive of the anti-Axis forces on the Italian front, was appointed as Commander-in-Chief, responsible for the coastal defenses from northern Austria to the Mediterranean coast of France. Before the anti-Axis forces opened the Second Front, the German army stationed General Wöhler in the Balkans, Marshal Kesselring in Southwestern Europe, and General Renthke in the Atlantic coast, and then used Marshal Rommel as a mobile force to deploy an impenetrable and solid front line, coupled with a substantial air force and high morale, preparing to intercept and annihilate the anti-Axis forces.

Rome, 31st (Central News Agency) - According to a broadcast by the Italian radio station, Italian Chairman Mussolini summoned the generals of the army to the military headquarters on the 30th for instructions. The content is as follows: Since Badoglio's betrayal, the entire Italian army, navy, and air force seemed to have been on the verge of collapse, but the fact is quite the opposite. By the end of September, we had rebuilt the national army. The landing of the Anglo-American forces in Anzio had a significant impact on the morale of our people, but in order to defend our capital Rome, we really cannot stand idly by, let alone have a psychology of surrender. Our army is stronger than ever before, and we must fight alongside our allied nation Germany again. The cooperation between the Italian and German armies on the battlefield is imminent, and we must let our allied German army know how genuine the friendship of its allies is.

He hoped that the new Italian army would not repeat the mistakes of the old army under any circumstances. Mussolini continued to mention the oath that the generals should take, believing that this oath is not only a guarantee of loyalty to the republic, but also a manifestation of the new spirit. All those who take the oath should break all ties with the past. Mussolini also said that the only purpose of the new army is to be able to fight alongside the German army again. He finally praised the German army's war record.

### Capital Students' Narcotics Eradication Corps Uncovers White Powder Organization - Seized Narcotics All Burned

Nanjing, 31st (Central News Agency) - The young students of the capital believe that the narcotics eradication movement is of great importance and significance to the cause of saving China and protecting East Asia.

### Natural Color Photography Technology Successfully Developed by Japanese

Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The invention of Japanese natural color photography technology has been completed by the research department of the Fuji Film Company of Japan, and is currently being gradually implemented. Natural color photography has been the subject of continuous research in various countries around the world for many years. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, both Germany and the United States had made considerable progress in this area, but the extent of their advancements since the war began is unknown. However, we believe that the invention made by the company's research department is no less significant than those of the two countries. Originally, natural color photography required the separation of three colors to be completed, but now only one roll of film is needed, and there is no need to separate the three colors. At the same time, no special equipment is required; ordinary cameras can be used for photography.

### North China Establishes Decisive Battle System - Communist Suppression Combines Military and Political Warfare

The construction war of North China, a vital military base, is now closely linked to the fierce battles in the South Pacific. From the National Government's participation in the war to Japan's unfolding of a new policy towards China, and finally to the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, North China's role as a military base has been further emphasized in the process of Sino-Japanese relations. As we enter the third year of the war to crush Britain and America, the development of North China's abundant underground and agricultural resources is becoming increasingly important. From now on, the construction of North China should transform it into a major arsenal and granary for the Greater East Asia war effort.

The CCP's Strategy

Recently, the CCP has replaced its so-called "political offensive" with guerrilla warfare to disrupt construction, focusing on hindering North China's construction that strengthens Japan's war effort, directing destruction throughout North China.

The CCP's "political offensive" aims primarily to impede North China's contribution to Japan and its ability to increase war resource production. The fundamental tasks of its so-called political offensive are: First, to have outstanding party members approach military officers and officials in the new regime, feigning employment, spreading anti-war ideology, disrupting security, and deliberately engaging in corrupt and unethical behavior. Second, to infiltrate economic groups and trading companies connected to the front lines, engaging in hoarding, disrupting low-price policies, and hindering currency circulation, in an attempt to destabilize the economy. Third, to obstruct important industries and transportation facilities, issuing threats of attacks, creating obstacles to the increased production and delivery of materials to Japan. Fourth, to incite labor-management disputes using food and wage issues, reducing production and creating public unrest, with the aim of undermining North China's war participation system.

New Measures for the Food Problem

In response to the CCP's offensive, North China is politically realigning with Nanjing, establishing the North China Office of the National Government's Military Affairs Commission and the North China Office of the Ministry of Justice and Administration, increasingly strengthening its ties with the central government. Furthermore, taking the opportunity of the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, the North China Political Affairs Commission is being reorganized, personnel are being refreshed, and the National Government's leadership in North China is being affirmed, establishing a groundbreaking strategy for the development of peaceful political power. With Chairman Wang Kemin and Chief Secretary Wang Yintai at the center, strong governance is being implemented, becoming the central hub of North China's construction.

The North China Communist Suppression Committee, as the foundation for the struggle against the CCP, has completed the consolidation of the security forces, peacekeeping troops, and New People's Society from various provinces, preparing various institutions to launch communist suppression efforts. In the economic sphere, regarding measures for the food problem, the North China Food Administration, cooperative societies, and purchasing and transportation companies are being mobilized to promote the North China Construction Movement. The responsible purchasing quantity for each province, county, and city is being specified, and the utmost effort is being devoted to supply and procurement. Simultaneously, smooth trade with Manchuria and Central China is being facilitated, and the food problem, which was once quite dire, is showing signs of improvement.

The "North China Development Company," the central hub for North China's construction, is resolutely reorganizing North China's wartime economy to adapt to the decisive battle situation, following the preparation of various systems in China. North China's transportation infrastructure is also being greatly reformed, preparing the wartime transportation system.

Establishing North China's Wartime Economy

As a result, in the area of coal, a major material transported to Japan, the first half of this year has been extremely smooth, achieving the annual production plan. In the iron industry, the North China Iron and Steel Company and other existing facilities are being expanded to increase local production. This year, a system capable of supplying large quantities according to Japan's production expansion plan is being rapidly established. Furthermore, the development of bauxite shale, essential for air combat, and the establishment of a light metal industry using these raw materials are also underway. In the current situation where the transportation of alumina from the south is quite difficult, the essence of Japan's chemical industry has been gathered to exploit the inexhaustible bauxite deposits and achieve local production, truly a triumph for North China's construction.

Thus, North China's construction has moved from the raw material resource stage to the industrial production stage, completing a system directly beneficial to the decisive battle.

The Advancement of the North China Army

However, the foundation of North China's military base is the thorough suppression of the communists. Communist suppression is North China offering a valuable stream of blood to the Greater East Asia War. It is the vanguard of adapting to the decisive battle posture. Compared to the difficult battles in the south, the communist suppression war in North China has a special nature that combines political warfare. Great results cannot be achieved at once. But the North China Army does not forget its mission to advance the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War. While Japan is expanding its battle to crush Britain and America in the South Seas, behind that decisive battle power, North China's thorough communist suppression and the production war of decisive battle resources aim to establish an iron wall of defense for Greater East Asia.

### The Eight District Public Office Will Be Abolished Today - Merged into the First District Public Office - Important Internal Personnel Choices Have Been Decided

Central News Agency reports: The First and Eighth District Public Offices of this city were established on the day of receiving the two concessions last August. It has been half a year since then. Mayor Chen, in order to unify Shanghai's municipal administration and eliminate the administrative boundaries of the former concessions, has decided, after several consultations with relevant parties, to abolish the Eighth District Public Office and merge it with the First District Public Office today (February 1st). The new First District Public Office has undergone appropriate adjustments in terms of organization and personnel to better align with China's administrative system. For example, the administrative meetings and personnel meetings that followed the old Municipal Council system of the former Public Concession have been ordered to be abolished. In the future, decisions on various administrative matters will be made through council meetings. Since receiving the concessions, all department heads of the First District Public Office, except for the Finance and Public Works Departments, have been Chinese. After this merger, Chinese personnel will also be appointed as heads of the Finance and Public Works Departments. All general affairs section chiefs of each department will be replaced with Chinese personnel. Some foreign employees, besides those who resign, will be transferred to positions such as commissioners and technical experts. After the merger of the two districts, the original Finance Department will be reorganized into three departments: the Finance Department, the Accounting Department, and the District Treasury. The Social Welfare Department of the Eighth District Public Office will be abolished. The Social Welfare Department of the First District Public Office will be renamed the Industrial Investigation Department, and the original social welfare affairs will be handled by the Municipal Government's Social Welfare Bureau. The fire departments of the First and Eighth Districts will be transferred to the First Police Bureau. The education departments of the First and Eighth Districts will be abolished.

List of Senior Personnel

The list of senior personnel of the First District Public Office, from the Director onward, is as follows: Director of the First District Public Office: Mayor Chen (concurrent); Chief Secretary: Wu Songdao; Appointed Secretary: Takase Den; Simplified Secretary: Gu Jiwu; Director of the General Affairs Department: Sun Lifu; Deputy Director: Noguchi Kinjiro; Deputy Director: Wu Yiyi; Director of the Finance Department: Yuan Houzhi (concurrent); Advisor to the National Economic Commission stationed at the First District Public Office: Hibino Noboru; Deputy Director: Lin Zhefu; Director of the Accounting Department: Dai De (concurrent); Deputy Director: Fukuyama Fujinan; Director of the Treasury: Pan Shiju; Deputy Director: Wang Shu; Director of the Public Works Department: Zhang Enlin (concurrent); Deputy Director: Xu Guansan; Chief Engineer (temporarily concurrent Deputy Director): Jiang Shoubaoping; Director of the Economic Department: Feng You; Deputy Director: Hirano Osamu; Deputy Director: Dai Linzao; Director of the Health Department: Yuan Junchang (concurrent); Deputy Director: Nagai Isamu; Counselor: Tashiro Yoshiaki; Director of the Industrial Investigation Department: Ling Xianwen; Deputy Director: Ando Jiro. As for the abolished Education Department, the former Deputy Directors Ueno Taichu and Tan Dakai will be reassigned as counselors, and section chiefs will be reassigned as supervisors, inspectors, etc.

Mayor's Remarks

On August 1st of last year, I was ordered to receive the administration of the Public Concession and the French Concession in this city. I immediately established the First and Eighth District Public Offices to separately manage the administration of the two districts. This was a temporary expedient considering the needs of the time. In order to unify Shanghai's municipal administration and eliminate the administrative boundaries of the former concessions, it was necessary to merge the First and Eighth Districts as soon as possible. It has been half a year since the reception of the former concessions. During this period, we have been engaged in renewing administration and gradually improving the existing system. Now, this work has been successfully completed through the efforts of all parties. Therefore, it has been decided to merge the Eighth District into the First District on February 1st, and to make appropriate adjustments to the administrative system and personnel of the First District Public Office in order to align it with China's administrative system as much as possible. From this day forward, the Eighth District Public Office will be abolished, and the responsible persons have been designated to handle the transfer of its departments. The Eighth District was in charge of all the administrative facilities of the former French Concession, especially the tax rates, etc., which were originally not entirely the same as those of the First District. After merging with the First District Public Office, they should be reorganized according to their nature, simplified under the principle of unification, so as to benefit the citizens. Recalling the reception of the concessions, I am deeply impressed by the cooperation given by all related parties of the Allied nations and all sectors of this city. I am deeply grateful for their deep support for this merger of the two districts. In the future, the construction of Greater Shanghai will be gradually implemented in accordance with the established policy. I sincerely hope that all related parties will continue to assist us in order to jointly complete this great mission.

### 61st Period Household Rice and Flour - Sale Begins Tomorrow - Two Sheng of Rice, One Jin of Flour

A notice issued by the First District Public Office yesterday states: From February 2nd to February 9th of this year, all retail rice shops and rice warehouses of this office within this district shall sell rice upon receiving the 61st Rice Purchase Coupon and sell flour upon receiving the 61st Flour Purchase Coupon. Retail rice shops, upon receiving each rice purchase coupon of this number, marked with the shop's number, shall sell two sheng of white rice, at a price of 16 yuan (National Currency). Upon receiving each flour purchase coupon of this number, marked with the shop's number, shall sell half a jin each of first-grade and second-grade flour, at a price of 7.5 yuan (National Currency). Furthermore, all rice shops and rice warehouses of this office within this district will be temporarily closed for one day on February 10th. This notice does not apply to the jurisdictions newly merged into this district.

### The Haikwan Tael Unit Will Be Abolished Today - Import Tariff Rates Have Also Been Revised

In order to increase tax revenue, the customs authorities have been ordered to revise the current import tariff rules, effective February 1st. Merchants should inquire with the Appraisal Section of the customs for all detailed information.

Key Points of the Revision

The Director of the Customs Administration, Mr. Zhang Sumin, explained the revision of import tariff rates as follows:

Transshipment and export tariff rates have already been revised one after another. The key point of the revision is the abolition of specific duties. Since import tariff rates are the same, specific duties should also be abolished. However, the collection of import tariffs is still related to the Haikwan Tael unit, which is a more complicated issue. After half a year of research by customs tariff experts, it was finally completed and has now been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It will be implemented on February 1st. The important revisions are as follows: 1. The current specific duties are temporarily converted into ad valorem duties, divided into nine levels of differential tariff rates: 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60%. 2. The 5% flood relief surcharge and the 5% customs surcharge currently levied based on the import tariff rate, as well as the 30% temporary surcharge on import specific duties, will be waived. 3. For goods subject to ad valorem tariffs, the duty-paying value shall be calculated in the common currency of the port of entry, and the Haikwan Tael unit will be abolished. 4. Imported cigarettes and cigars, which were originally taxed by customs according to the import tariff rules, with four-fifths of the tax revenue being used as consolidated tax, will now have all the tax revenue from cigarettes and cigars collected as customs duty and consolidated tax will be levied separately according to the consolidated tax rate.

### The Municipal Government Establishes Personnel and Regulations Committees

Central News Agency reports: The Shanghai Special Municipal Government has established Personnel and Regulations Committees. The selection of committee members has been decided and officially announced: Wu Songgao, Dai De, Geng Jiaji, Sun Lifu, and Zhao Zhijia are members of the Personnel Committee, with Wu Songgao designated as the Chairman. Shen Guizhun, Wu Songgao, Zhao Zhijia, Li Shiyu, Xu Quanshen, Sun Lifu, and Zhang Jianchu are members of the Regulations Committee, with Shen Guizhun designated as the Chairman.

### French Concession Trams Increase Fares Starting Today

The French Concession Tram Company in the Eighth District of this city has decided to revise the tram fares starting today (1st) due to the sharp increase in various operating costs. The minimum fare for the first class will be 1.2 yuan, and the minimum fare for the third class will be 0.7 yuan. The fare for buses will start from 2 yuan, but this will not have much impact on long-distance passengers. The western terminus of Bus Route 22 will be changed to the intersection of Fuxing Road and Avenue Petain (present-day Hengshan Road).

### Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Hosts Art Exhibition Opening

The National Art Exhibition organized by the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association is scheduled to open today at the Shanghai Branch's exhibition hall on the third floor of the Hall & Holtz Department Store at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road.

### Municipal Education Bureau Takes Over the Education Departments of the Two Districts - Unifying Educational Administration

Central News Agency reports: On January 29th, the Municipal Education Bureau received Instruction No. 884 from the Municipal Government, stating that when the First and Eighth Districts are merged on February 1st, the education departments of the two districts will be abolished at the same time. All educational administration in the two districts will be directly managed by the Education Bureau. All procedures for the takeover were previously planned by the Education Bureau and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. After receiving the order, the Education Bureau will proceed with the takeover one by one in accordance with this plan. From February 1st, the city's educational administration will be completely unified. It is also heard that the Municipal Education Bureau will expand its organization and add five sections after taking over the education departments of the First and Eighth Districts.

### 31st Period Rice for City Residents Will Be Sold Soon

The supplementary issuance of rice for city residents for the 31st period has been fully prepared and will be sold soon. Every resident, regardless of age, can use their rice certificate for this period to purchase two sheng of rice, with the price remaining unchanged at eight yuan per sheng. Yesterday, designated rice merchants in various districts within the restricted area were ordered to quickly complete the procedures for payment and rice distribution, so that various districts can begin selling in the next few days.

### Fourth District Investigates Idle and Abandoned Land

Since its establishment in early December of last year by the Municipal Grain Bureau, the Land Administration Bureau, and the district offices, the Shanghai Special Municipality Idle and Abandoned Land Investigation Team has been conducting a general investigation of all idle and abandoned land in this city, with the aim of recruiting farmers to cultivate it, thereby increasing production. It was resolved at the first meeting that each district would be responsible for assisting in the investigation of idle and abandoned land within its jurisdiction, and that the investigation should be completed by the end of February and submitted to the team for review. According to reporters inquiring with the Fourth District Public Office, the district office has ordered its subordinate towns to actively investigate all idle and abandoned land within their jurisdiction, and has issued a survey form instructing investigators to fill in detailed information regarding the name of the abandoned land, its location, the name of the owner, the nature of the soil, the appropriate crops to plant, the reason for the land being idle and abandoned, countermeasures to promote cultivation, the year and month the land became idle and abandoned, and a plan.

### 60th Period Household Flour Sale Extended by Six Days

The sale of household flour for the 60th period, originally scheduled to end on January 30th, has been extended to February 5th by order of the authorities to the rice merchants. The rice merchants, fearing that the public may not be aware of the true situation, have issued notices stating: "By order of the First District Public Office, the sale of household flour for the 60th period has been extended to February 5th." The issuance of rice and flour for this period coincided with the Lunar New Year, and the 25th, 26th, and 27th of last month were closed for three days as usual. It was unavoidable that some residents did not have time to purchase their rations. This extension may be one of the main reasons.

### Ancient and Modern Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition Opens Tomorrow - Conserving Paper, No Invitations or Catalogs

### President Zhou Generously Donates 100,000 Yuan to the City Education Association's Impoverished Education Fund

Central News Agency reports: Mr. Zhou Fo-hai, President of the Central Reserve Bank, deeply saddened by the large number of impoverished students in this city who are unable to attend school, generously donated 100,000 yuan (National Currency) yesterday to provide assistance. The funds have been delivered to the Municipal Education Association, which immediately sent a special letter of thanks to President Zhou for his enthusiasm for social welfare. (Another report) The examination papers for the association's impoverished student loan program are being graded. It is reported that most of the impoverished students who performed well on the exam will be admitted, and the results will be announced on February 2nd.

### Short Commentary: After the Merger

The First and Eighth District Public Offices of this city will be merged into the First District Public Office starting today. Since the reception of the concessions on August 1st of last year, it has been half a year. Because the administrative systems remained separate, the gap between the Public and French Concessions, although eliminated in form, still inevitably existed in practice. With the merger now, the administrative systems are becoming unified, and the impression of the concessions, both in form and substance, has been eliminated. The authorities' determination to complete the entire city of Greater Shanghai and to cooperate with the Allied nations is commendable.

In the future, the First District, in terms of economy, culture, population, and other aspects, can be said to be the center of Shanghai. Improvements in the livelihood of the people and municipal administration in the First District can serve as a model. We respectfully offer two suggestions to the authorities:

First, establish a municipal public opinion body as soon as possible so that the opinions of the citizens can be communicated and serve as a basis for improving all livelihood and municipal administration issues. Only when the opinions of the citizens can reach the top can livelihood issues be effectively improved. We remember that Mayor Chen expressed the intention to establish a public opinion body a few months after the reception of the concessions last year. It is now time to establish it urgently.

Second, the unique situation of the First District is that there are many Allied nationals. To further achieve close coordination in building Greater Shanghai, it is also necessary to communicate the opinions of the Allied nationals as much as possible. Therefore, continuous contact should be maintained with the leaders of the Allied nationals, holding regular meetings of a discussion nature to listen to their opinions. At the same time, the goals and significance of the authorities' policies can also be used to make the Japanese understand them, ensuring that there is no division.

In short, for the sake of building the future of Shanghai, establishing a public opinion body, communicating the opinions of the government and the people, and working together in harmony have become actions that cannot be delayed or postponed.

Economic Sector

### Commentary: Construction Bonds

We have said before that construction is production, and production is construction. The ultimate goal of issuing construction bonds is to help promote wartime production. In peacetime, the country's production expansion funds can be borrowed from foreign countries, but in wartime, this fund can only be raised domestically, and the methods are nothing more than paying taxes and absorbing bonds. Comparatively speaking, among the two methods, taxation is more stable than issuing bonds, because if the absorption performance of issuing bonds is not good, the result will be equivalent to the increase in banknotes.

In order to promote the progress of construction projects, the National Government has decided to issue construction bonds of 600 million yuan, designated for dredging shallow lakes and swamps, managing canals, revitalizing farmland water conservancy, and other construction projects. According to reports, the issuance method, in principle, will be undertaken or raised by the Central Reserve Bank, and the undertaken part may be resold. In principle, large bonds should be digested by the people first, not purchased by banks first, to avoid the possibility of currency issuance. However, due to practical difficulties, this is naturally the only way out. In that case, the appropriate method would be for financial institutions to promote savings in order to digest bonds. For example, in the Allied country Japan, during the five-year period from Showa 13 to Showa 17, there were 70 billion yen in savings, and national debt absorbed 88.5% of its total issuance, that is, 38.58 billion yen. At the same time, it also absorbed 28.6 billion yen in domestic and foreign business equipment funds and 7.5 billion yen invested in Manchuria, all of which belonged to the method of issuing bonds. This is a clear example of wartime savings assisting in the digestion of bonds. We must deliberately learn from it so that we can help national production on the one hand and save people's consumption on the other, which is truly killing two birds with one stone!

### After Listing of Various Exchange Draft Banks: Restore Lending and Increase Lending Interest Rates to Eliminate Speculation

After the listing of the Exchange Draft Banks, members of the Shanghai Money Shops Association have resumed lending to various industries, all in accordance with the loan restriction methods issued by the Silver Money Industry Association and the Ministry of Finance. Mortgage loans are based on the principle of not promoting speculation and hoarding. The term is determined by mutual agreement based on the nature of the collateral, and the maximum shall not exceed three months, and is limited to the legitimate industrial and commercial industries of members of the same industry association. Credit loans and overdrafts have begun to be sent out, and are limited to old customers with good credit. The amount is limited according to its use, and there must be a guarantor with real shares. The total overdraft amount is approved separately. The lending interest rate has been generally increased to more than 3% per month. As for the monthly announcement of deposit and loan interest rates by the money industry, the highest monthly deposit interest rate was previously 6 yuan and the loan interest rate was 33 yuan, which may be appropriately increased in the future, with the aim of eliminating speculation and hoarding and suppressing prices. In addition, the banks will conduct strict investigations and approvals for various industries that need to borrow money due to business needs in order to maintain finance and eliminate malpractices.

### New Financial Institutions: Nine New Institutions Established

Since the 1st of this month, nine new financial institutions have been established in the city, including two bank branches, five money shops, and two securities firms, as well as one land company.

### Speculative Businesses: Handling Liquidation, Cotton Cloth and Silk Shops Not Yet Open

Since the Lunar New Year, some speculative businesses have been handling liquidation matters. At the same time, the n絨, silk, satin, and cotton cloth shops have not yet officially opened as of yesterday. Reporters visited leaders of various industry associations and received the following information:

After the relevant authorities actively discussed effective measures, speculative merchants in the entire Shanghai industrial and commercial sector have been severely threatened. At the same time, large quantities of hoarded goods cannot be freely sold, so the money market is extremely tight and turnover is difficult. These merchants are now handling liquidation matters after the end of the general year-end closing.

### Brief News

Xinzhong First and Second Dyeing Factories have always focused on weaving Longding fine cloth and Yun 細斜. Recently, the two factories have heard that yarn and cloth are allowed to move freely within the three provinces and one city, and they are actively preparing to increase production. It is also reported that the shares of the two factories have been approved by the authorities and are circulating in the Chinese Securities Trading Market.

### Amidst Rising Prices and Tightening Money Market, Chinese Stocks Plunge Across the Board

Yesterday, the decline in Chinese stocks was severe. At first, there was a one-sided downward trend, which only stabilized around noon. Also, the Securities Exchange temporarily decided to stop trading in the afternoon from today and resume the original state after February 4th.

### Navy, written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang, Soldier Class (5)

Takao has also started studying hard recently. Although his math isn't as good as Makoto's, his grades in Japanese, Chinese Literature, and Drawing are all better than Makoto's. His English isn't inferior to Makoto's either.

That year's summer vacation seemed to have nothing to do with the Soldier Class. Takao also spent his whole day at his desk. This worried his parents.

One evening, the sea breeze was cool and the moonlight was bright. Takao was still flipping through a small dictionary under the electric light.

"Go outside and play for a while!" his mother said worriedly.

Although Takao reluctantly went outside for a walk, he felt it was very boring to be alone, so he went to find Makoto. Makoto seemed to be studying too, but because Takao came, he readily agreed. The two of them walked together towards the Tenpouzan Seaside. Along the way, the neighborhood was lit with local custom June lanterns. On the old-fashioned flower lanterns, beautiful pictures were painted, swaying in the cool breeze.

"What beautiful scenery!" Once they reached the seaside, Takao forgot all about his exams. The cherry blossoms he was so used to seeing were shrouded in a blue-purple evening spirit. The moonlight on the sea was faint, and the gently rippling waves radiated a silvery glow.

"I've been practicing shouting commands towards Sakurajima recently - for when I become a military officer in the future." Makoto openly said these things lately.

"Do it and see!" Takao urged him.

"Listen! ... Forward... march..." He shouted with all his might. But the sound just wouldn't come out right. That strange sound wouldn't reach Sakurajima.

"Hahaha, you really can't do it. First of all, a naval officer wouldn't issue that kind of command. If you tell a warship to go 'forward', it won't move forward. You have to shout 'Both sides forward at minimum speed!'" Takao's naval knowledge was also unreliable, but it did seem slightly better than Makoto's.

Teased by Takao, Makoto now began to challenge Takao to a wrestling match.

"Come on!..." The two of them started wrestling on the cold, wet sand. This time, Makoto finally won, and Takao lost three times in a row.

The two of them laughed at each other and lay down on the sand, their bodies exhausted. The cool night breeze blew across the beach, and the full moon on the thirteenth night illuminated Makoto's snow-white skin.

"That's strange!" Takao pointed at the bright moon and said. "Makoto! Look at the moon, are there three? Or four?"

"Nonsense, the moon doesn't have a plural."

"Then, how can I see it like this! What's going on?" Takao's voice sounded especially disappointed.

Two or three days later, a special guest came to Makoto's house, Takao's younger sister. She said to Makoto, "My brother is very pessimistic, would you please come to my house and play?"

This year, she was just fourteen years old, tall, and spoke clearly like an adult. Among the gentle Satsuma women, she was a unique figure. Although she was a young girl, she had a stubborn temper and would sometimes bravely argue with her parents. When she entered the girls' school this spring, her relatives all hoped that she would enter the prefectural high school, but she insisted on entering the fashionable private girls' school in Kagoshima, and finally got into that school. That old-fashioned girls' school was located on a distant small mountain. Even when it was difficult to get to school in the rain, because it was the school she liked and chose, she would still force herself to go to school. If you said she was a Satsuma woman, it would be better to say that she had the temperament of a Satsuma man.

Makoto blushed and replied, "Please come! I'm really worried!" Her intention was to ask Makoto to return to her house with her. This was unacceptable! For a young man and a young girl to walk together on the street was a violation of local customs.

"Please go back first!"

"Why?"

"No reason..."

Makoto blushed and couldn't speak. Keiko stared at Makoto's face.

"Useless!" she said, shaking her braided hair as she turned and left.

Thirty minutes later, Makoto quietly entered through the gate, crossed the courtyard, and came to Takao's room. "What did you take?"

"Makoto... because the doctor said I have nearsightedness."

Takao said as if spitting something out and lowered his head.

To be a naval officer, having bad eyesight is a fatal blow. Takao's pessimism was not without reason.

"Then... it's still early. If you wear glasses, it will be okay."

"No, if I wear glasses, I'll become even more nearsighted." "Then go to the seaside and practice looking into the distance. Mount Kirishima, Mount Kaimon... you can look at them."

Although the physical examination for the military academy was approaching, as long as he tried hard, it wouldn't necessarily be bad—

From that day on, the two of them stood on the coast every day, looking at the distant peaks of Mount Takachiho and the Satsuma Fuji behind it. When the nearby scenery entered their eyes, they would hurriedly close their eyes. Although Makoto was only accompanying him, it was not without significance to make his good eyes even better.

### Generous Donation of Scholarships to Help Poor Students, A Young Child's Enthusiasm is Commendable

Dear Editor: The last time I visited the National Common Occupation Exhibition organized by your organization, I saw many children queuing up to get scholarship registration forms. My father said, "These children have very good grades, but their families are very poor and they don't have money to pay tuition, so they come to the Shenbao to apply for help. This is a very good thing, and we should donate when we have money." I remembered those words in my heart.

I am nine years old this year and studying in the fourth grade of elementary school in the Tianhou Palace. Because I usually don't miss classes and study hard, I got first place in the term exam this time and also received a scholarship of 340 yuan. I remembered what I said before and told my father that I would donate this scholarship to the Shenbao as a scholarship. My father and mother both agreed very much, and now I will send this 340 yuan to you, please forward it to the poor reading children. Qi Kangnan
