### Central Belief

A central belief is a person's soul, the engine of all human endeavors. Those with a central belief have unwavering will, courage, and accomplishment, and are more readily believed by the general public. Those without a central belief are weak-willed, hesitant, and indecisive, unable to accomplish anything, and even less able to be believed by the general public.

Whether looking at history or the present, there has never been a person with a great career who did not have a central belief. These men of lofty ideals, embracing their convictions with ardent enthusiasm, spared no sacrifice and shunned no hardship, consistently pursuing their work until their goals were achieved. In other words, those with a central belief are never satisfied with maintaining the status quo, but resolutely and decisively complete the central goal they believe in. Such astonishing and perilous experiences often create the most brilliant and glorious pages in human history, inspiring anyone who feels it and motivating anyone to strive for strength, just as Mencius said, causing excitement in those who hear of it even hundreds of years later.

Central belief is spiritual strength, and spiritual strength is the greatest of all. It can create material strength. Material strength is limited, while spiritual strength is infinite. Material strength is superficial, while spiritual strength is latent. Material strength is time-bound, while spiritual strength is continuous and eternal. A central belief makes a person's will unwavering, their goals clear, filling them with courage to create new life, just like a train propelled by a steam engine, advancing toward a definite destination.

Central belief is not superstition. Superstition arises from the psychology of seeking blessings and fearing misfortune; it is not rational. Central belief is not delusion. Delusion arises from impossible hopes; it is also not rational. Central belief is purely rational. It stems from deep understanding and prolonged research, and then a thorough belief in a certain matter or ideology, thus giving rise to the greatest perseverance in its execution. Profound understanding enables people to have determination and courage, while long-term research enables people to have plans and steps. Therefore, central belief is the master of everything. Those with a central belief can demonstrate their power and achievements everywhere. Those without a central belief can only wander, hesitate, advance blindly without a plan, and then retreat blindly without a plan. Lacking a master in spirit, their behavior is like a rudderless skiff, drifting in the vast ocean, ultimately leading to nowhere and accomplishing nothing. Therefore, with a central belief, wavering will never occur.

In wartime Shanghai, because of the deep-seated legacy of Anglo-American influence, it is a city rife with rumors. Those without a central belief, placed in such a diverse city, are often tempted by others. One must understand that war is merely a superficial phenomenon. Behind the war lies the most important root cause. Understanding this root cause clarifies everything. If everyone deeply understands the root cause of the Greater East Asia War, that it is the oppressed nations opposing the aggression of the Anglo-American enemies, only this war of liberation can save us from peril. From thorough understanding, advance to complete belief. From complete belief, advance to planned action. Then, no environment can shake our will. Therefore, at present, what we need most is for everyone to have a central belief. However, if we hope that the general public shares a central belief, then government leaders and social leaders must first lead by example, firmly upholding their central belief without wavering, in order to establish a central belief for everyone.

### Enemy Ship Sunk Near Palau Islands, Japanese Forces on Angaur Island Counterattack

Central Pacific Base, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the afternoon of the 16th, an enemy ship (type unknown) cruising in the waters near the Palau Islands was sunk east of Peleliu Island.

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Under the cover of a mobile force and intense artillery fire, enemy forces began landing on Angaur Island, southwest of Peleliu Island, on the morning of the 17th. Japanese forces on the island are currently counterattacking.

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – When enemy MacArthur forces landed on Peleliu Island at 8:00 AM on the 15th, they also attempted to land on Morotai Island in the Moluccas. Under the intense shelling of a large mobile force consisting of aircraft carriers, battleships, and other vessels numbering eighty, they began landing in the southern part of the island. Japanese forces immediately engaged them. Fierce battles raged throughout the 16th, with continuous bloody fighting. However, the enemy on the island, disregarding the fierce fighting of the Japanese forces, did their utmost to secure a position in the southern part, with a force of about one division.

Central Pacific Base, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – In the Palau Islands area, 114 enemy fighter-bombers attacked on the 16th. Japanese forces shot down two of them. Also, in the Kendari area of Celebes Island, about 30 enemy aircraft attacked on the 16th.

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to an Associated Press reporter at the Peleliu Island front on the 16th, the situation of the landing battle on the island is as follows: On the night of the 15th, Japanese forces attempted a night attack on the U.S. Marine Corps bridgehead, and part of them had entered the inner side of the U.S. left flank. Prior to the landing, the U.S. forces had carried out intense artillery fire, believing that there were few survivors among the Japanese forces on the island. However, after the landing, Japanese forces emerged from various places one after another and launched fierce attacks on the landing U.S. forces. By evening, Japanese forces even deployed tank units, and part of them broke through the U.S. lines. However, the U.S. forces were able to maintain the bridgehead. The U.S. forces attempted to advance to seize the island's airfield, but Japanese fire was intense, and the U.S. forces were unable to advance a single step, especially on a hill on the left flank, where Japanese forces appeared to be stationed. However, the U.S. forces did not launch a large-scale barrage on that area with large-caliber guns. U.S. tanks and other vehicles in that area were engulfed in flames, extremely intense. The power of Japanese mortars was truly frightening.

### Japanese Government Held Liaison and Informal Discussion Meeting, Strengthening the Structure of the Greater East Asia General Headquarters

### Sketches of Tokyo Under Intense War Situation

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) – As the war situation in Tokyo intensifies, Tokyo is currently striving to realize so-called armament, or to evacuate its large population to local areas, or to improve air defense facilities. All of these are sufficient to express the colors of a wartime capital. The recent situation and the Japanese people's determination to win are introduced as follows: The most reassuring thing for the citizens is to ensure their food supply, and the citizens know very well that there are several months' worth of

### Emergency Food Supplies

Stored in safe places in the city. Even if there is an air raid, each citizen can be fed by the supply corps. The food supply is based on a rationing system, with each person receiving 330 grams of polished rice per day. Important workers receive 570 grams. Because the system is perfect, the rationing order is well-organized. Each month, the rationers deliver the food to the homes. Side dishes such as vegetables and fish are rationed every two or four days. Soy sauce, sugar, salt, and edible oils are all rationed according to the standard amount researched by the National Nutrition Department of the Ministry of Health and Welfare. According to a survey by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the

### National Constitution

There has been no change before the incident. Although the average weight of infants in Osaka and Kyoto has decreased by 3%, there has been an increase of 15% in the northeast of the four countries compared with before the incident. Therefore, on the national average, the nutrition of the people has not decreased. In addition, each household can be rationed five bottles of wine or two bottles of beer per month. Milk for infants, cakes and milk oil for patients, etc. According to Japanese customs, appetite will inevitably increase in autumn. Therefore, Tokyo and other military cities have recently implemented a ration of two cans per person. The paper on the canned food is printed with the words "Made in Showa 15", so the general public believes that there are stocks from five years ago, so naturally there is no need to worry. Regarding Tokyo's

### Transportation Tram

The number of passengers has increased significantly recently. All office workers are carrying a miscellaneous bag called "Hokobukuro", which is a new type of bag that is a compromise between a briefcase and a small cloth bag. It contains items such as gas masks, leggings, first-aid medicines, and bulletproof headscarves in case of an air raid. In addition, using this kind of bag, even in a crowded tram, you can hold the handrail with one hand and read the newspaper with the other, which is more convenient than a briefcase. In addition to civil servants, this type of bag is also used by workers, including women who work in service organizations and factories. The old-fashioned leather bags used by women are rarely seen, but only a small bag is hung outside the miscellaneous bag to hold lipstick. Regarding

### Publishing Business

Recently, we have been trying our best to save paper, but scientific and technological publications that encourage national war will can still be published in quantities of 10,000 to 50,000 copies. Hundreds of books can be published every month, and there are often crowds in bookstores. From the first day of the month, newspapers will be changed to two large newspapers a week and four small newspapers on the remaining days. The editorial policy is to be concise and not to omit news. Every day after lunch, simple and clear songs are popular in various workplaces. In terms of sports, aviation exercises are popular, and painters can often be found visiting various factories. In terms of art, artists are also very active. The front line battlefields and military schools, factories, etc. can often be found. All works are collected in Tokyo. Afternoon

### Theater Cinema

Whether large or small, they are extremely crowded. By evening, the most distinctive feature is the national bar, where drinkers often go to get drunk. Students wearing patriotic badges can often be seen in trams. These students are mostly workers in aircraft factories and radio wave weapons factories. The number of students in Tokyo ranks first in Japan, so the work efficiency of these students is also extremely impressive. The evacuation of elementary school students has now been largely completed, and there are few elementary school students on the streets. The ticket sellers on trams, the ticket windows and ticket gates of provincial trains, and the operation of large cargo trucks on the streets are all

### Women in Charge

In addition, each state-owned railway is gradually switching to women. At the same time, women in uniforms can also be seen on cargo trucks flying on the streets. Zero-piece transporters. Therefore, the large-scale dispatch of these women has made a significant contribution to the increase in labor and military industrial production rates.

### Soviet Troops Protecting the Territory Enter Greek Territory, Battle for Riga Intensifies

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a German news agency report, the Bauska district is the focal point of the large-scale offensive by Soviet troops on the northern front. Ten divisions of Soviet troops have arrived in Riga, attempting to isolate the German forces in Estonia. In the Modon area, approximately six Soviet divisions and several tank brigades launched a fierce attack on the 15th. After fierce tank battles against the German armored forces, they were eventually defeated. The fighting in the Volga region is also extremely fierce. Soviet troops attempted to break into German positions with fourteen infantry divisions and four tank units, but were repelled by German forces 20 kilometers west of Riga.

### German Troops Retreat from Entire Finnish Front

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Reuters dispatch, German troops on the Kandalaksha front in Finland have completely retreated today after three years of defense. The reason is that Soviet troops wanted to encircle most of the German troops from the north, so they had to retreat completely. All military supplies were moved in a short period of time, and military equipment was destroyed or dismantled. However, a Soviet flanking team finally cut off one of the German troops' retreat routes, and fierce battles took place for several days on the Korja Highway north of Sala. German troops broke through on the 13th and reached the designated location. The evacuation operations on the Uhita and Rauhi fronts were carried out according to schedule, and German troops have now crossed the Finnish-Soviet border and are retreating westward.

### German and Finnish Troops Clash on Hogland Island

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Reuters dispatch from responsible sources, when German troops advanced to Hogland Island in the Gulf of Finland on Friday, they clashed with Finnish defense forces on the island. According to the Finnish armistice agreement, the island should be transferred to the Soviets. However, in order to protect the interests of their country and Finland, and to establish a defensive line to protect Estonia, the German troops had no choice but to occupy it. Therefore, the attitude of the Finnish garrison on the island is particularly unfavorable to their country and the people of the Baltic states.

### U.S. Submarine Sinks Japanese Prisoner Ship

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the 7th of this month, a Japanese transport ship carrying 750 American prisoners of war was sailing in the Mindanao Sea when it was suddenly torpedoed by a U.S. submarine and sank immediately. All 750 American prisoners of war and the Japanese crew were drowned. Details will be announced after proper investigation. Also, on June 26, a Japanese prisoner transport ship was similarly sunk by a U.S. submarine in the Sumatra Sea. Out of 720 prisoners on board, only 180 were rescued.

### On the Shanghai-Nanjing Train

— Min Xian

In order to understand the actual situation of all classes, the reporter did not use any help. He spent a lot of effort and was lucky enough to buy a third-class train ticket to Zhenjiang. It took three hours and I was covered in sweat. The so-called lucky thing is that I had lined up to the ticket window twice, and the full sign had been hung up just a few people away, but after the fact, there were still several short-sleeved, crooked-hats selling there. [Do you want the tickets for the day?] When asked about the fare, it was several times higher than the regular price. As for the procedure, the buyer must first hand over the citizen's certificate to be taken away. In just a few minutes, the ticket will be delivered, and the money and ticket will be cleared. The credit is full. How these brokers get the tickets, I think readers will not be difficult to understand!

The reporter finally got a ticket, and there was still difficulty when entering the gate. I was told by an experienced traveler that as long as I spent a little more money, I could pass unimpeded, but in order to reduce trouble, the reporter had to take out another kind of ID card, and finally passed through smoothly. After entering the gate, I lined up again, squeezing out a lot of sweat. The strangest thing is that the reporter was the twelfth person to enter the station to check tickets for third-class passengers, and when I rushed to the train, the passengers were almost full. At first, I thought it was second-class passengers who had no seats and came here to take a seat, but after inquiring one by one, they were all third-class passengers. They were able to enter first, I don't know what kind of magic is. In short, traveling now has a mysterious nature anytime and anywhere. When the car started, it was already crowded. Looking around, of course, most of them were single passengers, with bags on top and bags below, of different sizes and a variety of items. But looking at their packages and bags, it seems that they have exceeded 30 kilograms, and they can all be taken on the train. I don't know what kind of magical method there is? The various colors in the car are also worth recording, which are described as follows:

### The Center of the Topic

Because everyone is squeezed like sardines, almost breathless, the only way to pass the time is to chat. The topic of conversation is almost focused on the soaring cost of living. From the soaring cost of living to the value of banknotes, some people talk about their own reasons for such a trend, so how can prices not rise day by day? I wonder what proper countermeasures the wise authorities have taken.

### The Plans of the Single Runner

The topic turned to the single runner. The first speaker was a burly man from Jiangbei. He said that he had run dozens of trips and had never encountered bad luck, so he achieved this. There are no more than three kinds of skills, that is, first, you have to be able to endure, no matter how cold, hot, crowded, or hungry you have to endure. The second is to be willing to give up. When you encounter an unavoidable need, you have to be willing to give up and make friends. The third is to be ruthless, that is, you must sell the inferior goods at a high price and not talk about any personal feelings. When speaking, he looked proud, pointing to the three pairs of bulky cloth bags he was carrying, indicating that no one else could get on the train except him. This is his way of being willing to give up. Another middle-aged man who looked like a farmer said that although running solo is hard, it is much more painful than being subjected to all kinds of exploitation when farming at home. Now, although there are many expenses, the wool comes from the sheep, and I don’t feel heartache. Another middle-aged woman accompanied by a young girl said that they were aunt and sister-in-law, saying that her little girl originally wove cloth at home, but now she has run a few times with her, and it is much more promising than weaving cloth. This is why there are more and more single passengers.

### Reasonable Illegal

While talking, it suddenly became quiet, and it turned out that three friends in uniform had already walked into the car to conduct a random check. Those who are determined to run solo have already negotiated a compromise, with a knowing smile on their faces. Those who are new to the game will inevitably struggle a little more, and they will still have some subtle relationships and let them go safely. Among them, there was an old man who refused to spend the standard amount, so he forcibly took away three packs of cigarettes. Afterwards, someone came to mediate, saying that they had a certain sense of proportion when it came to asking for money, and they would never hurt your old capital with reasonable estimates, and they would only spend once at a time and would not come to bother you again, so it is better to be sensible. When the car passed Changzhou, I saw the old man take back the cigarettes and get off the train, and I must have made an explanation. Is this the so-called robbers also have principles?

### As Black as Crows

Finally arrived in Zhenjiang, the reporter got rid of the sardine-like squeeze, and his mind was refreshed. When walking through the inspection place, I saw several solo guests giving cigarettes, towels, etc. to the inspection comrades, and some also gave substitutes, as if they were familiar friends. Probably the inspection comrades asked them to buy them on their behalf, or returned the money because the items they bought on their behalf were not purchased! What else can I say!

### Japanese Troops Occupy Zhaoqing City, Fierce Fighting Continues, U.S. Air Force in Guilin Begins to Withdraw

A certain base on the South China Front, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A part of the Japanese troops in the Xijiang area attacked and entered Zhaoqing City, a stronghold of the 36th Group Army of the Yu (Chongqing) on the 16th, and fierce fighting is still continuing in the city.

One team of Japanese troops has now broken through the provincial border, entered Guangxi Province, and is attacking Huaiji County. According to the Associated Press, four teams of Japanese troops attacked from Guangdong Province and have now forced the gap between the east and west of the Chinese mainland to be compressed to 190 kilometers. According to Reuters, the battle for Guilin has now begun, and the Yu army's camp is very chaotic.

### Chongqing Political Council Dissatisfied with Chongqing's Administration; Difficult to Achieve Unity Due to Conflict Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party

Central News Agency Dispatch: The evolution of the Chongqing-Communist conflict will have implications for various international frictions. Currently, the United States and the United Kingdom, in the ongoing war against Japan, are utilizing Chongqing's strength to fight the Japanese army on the Chinese mainland. They also need the strength of the Chinese Communist Party to restrain and monitor the Japanese army. Therefore, the United States and the United Kingdom hope for unity between Chongqing and the Communist Party, as it would benefit them. However, the Soviet Union does not think so. The Soviet Union uses the Chinese Communist Party's strength to monitor the United States, the United Kingdom, and Chongqing and has no desire for the United States and the United Kingdom to control Chinese power. Therefore, while the United States and the United Kingdom hope for unity between Chongqing and the Communist Party, the Soviet Union is intensifying its efforts to obstruct this, taking advantage of the weaknesses of the United States and the United Kingdom. As a result, it is very difficult to achieve unity between Chongqing and the Communist Party, which is akin to sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams. The inside story of the Chongqing-Communist conflict, such as the forced statement by Chongqing's propaganda minister Liang Han-tsao, takes various forms. Instigated by behind-the-scenes figures on both sides, the situation is only escalating. According to news obtained from relevant sources in this city, there is considerable detail regarding the Chinese Communist Party's attacks on Chongqing. The situation of the Chongqing National Political Council is described below:

### Conflicting Views Between Chongqing and the Communist Party

○ It is reported that on the morning of the 5th of this month, the first day of the Chongqing National Political Council's opening in Chongqing, Chiang Kai-shek also attended and presided over the meeting. The Communist Party, however, was very dissatisfied with Chiang's personal presiding and strongly criticized it. According to the Communist Party's opinion, the serious situation on the current Chinese battlefield is being ignored. Only empty words are used to cover it up (because Chongqing Chiang's speech was lengthy), which will blur the people's vigilance, relax the people's will to resist Japan, and numb the people's [resistance] mobilization. In particular, Chongqing Chiang's statement that today's [resistance] is also for the unity of the country, etc. Therefore, the Communist Party's political views on Chongqing, namely unifying the Kuomintang, i.e., unifying dictatorial politics, are in complete opposition to the national public's theory of unifying a free, living, independent, and democratic country. Therefore, this situation is sufficient to show Chongqing Chiang's deeply rooted dictatorial prejudice and strongly suggests a threat of preparing for civil war. Therefore, Chiang's speech has aroused unfavorable reactions from the councilors. On behalf of the entire body, Councilor Lin Hu delivered a reply, expressing deep dissatisfaction and demanding the elimination and reform of real malpractices. According to Lin, when we look back at the national system and look forward to the future, we not only do not feel optimistic, but we are also full of apprehension. In this critical moment of survival, if we strive to invigorate ourselves and eliminate accumulated malpractices, then there will be a turning point and new life. Otherwise, the future is unimaginable.

### Unanimous Dissatisfaction with Government Policies

○ The session of the Chongqing Political Council lasted for seven days, from the 1st to the 7th, during which the various ministries and departments of the government presented their policy reports. However, the questions raised by the councilors, as reported daily by Chongqing's Central News Agency and United Press, only mentioned routine trivial matters, including reports from the ten departments of military affairs, politics, foreign affairs, economy, finance, food administration, social affairs, internal affairs, education, transportation, justice, and administration. Therefore, the nationwide public demand for reform is at its most critical and dangerous state, yet the Chongqing regime shows no sign of reflection. Taking only the report of He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Affairs, as an example, at a time when Chongqing and the public were unanimously angered by the defeat in the Hunan-Guangxi campaign, he still tried to deceive himself and justify his actions. According to He, the Chongqing army in each battlefield is both attacking and defending, inflicting significant losses on the enemy at any time. And the report of Yu Hongjun, the Vice Minister of Finance, did not mention a word about rampant corruption and the impending financial bankruptcy. It only stated that the financial system focuses on the collection and purchase of land tax, striving to achieve fairness and no abuse, and convenience for the people, etc. Therefore, this report aroused dissatisfaction from the Political Council. Councilor Zhou Binglin demanded that the heads of the various ministries and departments pay attention to policy matters. As a result, all 120 attending councilors stood up and requested that the two departments of finance and military affairs request the government to improve the treatment of soldiers and public school staff and submit concrete measures for discussion at the meeting. At the same time, the council members vehemently criticized the government's corruption. One councilor even stated that high-ranking officials and generous salaries could be obtained in the government through personal connections. Looking at the bribery cases in the organizations, such as the person responsible for collecting goods in kind, officials in various places are actually extorting, causing undue suffering to the peasants. In addition, Councilor Guo Zhonggui from Henan gave a vivid report to the conference on what he had seen and heard in Henan, regarding the extraordinary anger caused by the Chongqing army's collapse without a fight on the two battlefields in Henan. After the report of Gu Zhenggang, the Minister of Social Affairs, Councilor Zhou Binglin reported on the deaths he had seen on the streets in Kunming, believing that the most needed sympathy in social relief work has now disappeared. At the same time, Councilor Jiang Yiping asked whether the Ministry of Social Affairs could eliminate social ills. In addition, Huang Yanpei, Wang Yunwu, Zuo Shunsheng, Wang Liming and others raised questions about the protection of personal freedom. In short, in the policy reports of various departments of the Chongqing regime and the questions raised by the councilors, the Kuomintang attempted to cover up the unprecedented crisis on the surface and maintained its dictatorial and isolated political system of rule. At the same time, it also partially reflects the intense anger of the people nationwide and within the Kuomintang against the ruling Kuomintang.

### Inspecting Newspapers and Suppressing Public Opinion

○ The editorial of the Liberation Daily on the 12th of this month [After Freedom of Speech] attacked Chongqing's freedom of speech issue. In April of this year, Liang Hancao, Chongqing's Propaganda Minister, made a statement to Chinese and foreign reporters, admitting that the Kuomintang's censorship system had shortcomings, even errors, in technology. He also announced a relaxation of standards. In May, the Kuomintang's Twelfth Plenary Session of the Central Committee announced that fair public opinion should expose malpractices and convey public grievances, and passed a case to improve the key points of publication inspection, partially abolishing prior submission for inspection. In June, the censorship measures and prohibited standards, and wooden board censorship rules were published. According to the Kuomintang's announced interpretation of prohibited content, the main content of these regulations is that magazines not aimed at discussing military, political, and diplomatic affairs are to be self-censored by the author and publisher, who remain legally responsible. They can still be banned after publication. The important prohibited standards include: First, interpretations that violate the highest principles of legislation, that provoke unity among ethnic groups, that promote aggression, that promote fascism, or theories of class dictatorship, that promote personal slander, that endanger the state, and that disrupt public order. Second, those that harm the friendship between our country and friendly countries or the unity of allied countries, etc. The various measures that have been stipulated in the interpretation have many drawbacks in the regulations themselves, which can be said to be an expression of the Kuomintang's dictatorship. For example, among the daily newspapers published, in May, a total of 33 editorials, foreign reports, and news items were not published or were deleted, including 12 that advocated democracy and unity, and the rest included various parties, etc. In addition, the speech essay delivered by Sun Ke, the President of Chongqing's Legislative Yuan, at the National Central Training Corps, was also not published. Furthermore, the American reporter's criticism of Lin Yutang's remarks on the 15th of this month was absurd, and the foreign news report was also not published. With such a serious situation, how can one speak of freedom of speech?

### Kong's Comments Show Insufficient Understanding

○ Kong Xiangxi's remarks at the Washington Club in the United States on the 10th of this month, which severely criticized the Chinese Communist Party, completely lacked an understanding of the current situation. On military matters, Kong said that China had never diverted American supplies for purposes other than fighting Japan, and that American lend-lease supplies armed the best units of the Kuomintang. We can see the extent of Kong's lies by looking at the border areas imprisoned in the [anti-Japanese] democratic base areas. Kong then said that when it comes to the effectiveness of the Chongqing army's armed operations, the Chongqing army has artillery tanks, and their combat spirit is no less than that of any country's army. Therefore, Kong's bold lies are directly contrary to the facts. Furthermore, considering the overall policies of Chongqing in politics and economics, even with any number of artillery and tanks, it is difficult to improve the Chongqing army's combat capabilities. In terms of Kong's political remarks, some people believe that China is not a democratic country, but Chongqing has decided to convene a National Assembly within one year after the end of the war to formulate a constitution. He also said that the Chongqing regime is determined to fulfill this promise. Regarding the economy, Kong said that the degree of controlling inflation can be adopted to obtain a higher evaluation. However, Kong has forgotten his statement on July 4, in which he said that the budget in the Great Rear Area in 1944 showed that tax revenue accounted for 52 percent, but it is still doubtful whether this tax revenue standard can be achieved. Therefore, Kong went on to say that he had to rely heavily on bank loans, which would inevitably increase purchasing power and promote rising prices. Therefore, the price index in Chongqing last month exceeded two to three times the level of February to June of this year, and the price of food increased by more than 1,200 times. Therefore, Kong's statement that the Chongqing regime has failed to unify opinions on military, political, and social matters and has suffered damage is a repetition of the isolated unification theory in Congress.

### British and American Parachute Troops Land in the Netherlands; German Troops Encircle and Annihilate Most of Them

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - German News Agency: In the past few days, the anti-Axis forces attempted to break through the German defensive positions near the mouth of the Scheldt River and the Meuse River without success. Then, on Sunday afternoon, British and American forces used strong air transport troops to land in the areas of Tilburg, Eindhoven, and Nijmegen in southern Holland (near the German border south of the Rhine River). The German army immediately attacked the landed enemy units. Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - German News Agency: The British and American air transport troops who landed on the north bank of the Rhine River west of the German-Dutch border on Sunday afternoon, protected by a large air force, have suffered heavy losses. After the paratroopers landed, they were followed by the landing of many cargo gliders. The German army in the area immediately engaged the enemy, surrounded the landed enemy troops, and annihilated most of them.

### Fierce Battle in the Nancy Area of France

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - German News Agency: Fierce fighting took place yesterday on both sides of Nancy in southeastern France. At that time, the German counterattack broke through the northern side of the enemy penetration area. East of Nancy, the American army surrounded the town from the southeast with a larger force, where fierce fighting is taking place. The French Second Tank Division advanced towards Epinal, suffered heavy losses in the German counterattack, and was unable to continue its advance. West of Epinal, Germany stopped the enemy's advance at the Treres Canal.

### Finnish Prime Minister Dies, to be Succeeded by Kastimurun

Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Finnish Prime Minister Haekziel recently died of cerebral hemorrhage. It is reported that Kastimurun, the president of the Supreme Court, was appointed as Prime Minister on the 18th.

### Returning from the Soviet Union

Achievements of the Five-Year Plan The work of evacuating these facilities was extremely difficult. It would not be surprising to use trains to load them, and it would not be enough to load them for several months. Some of them arrived early, while others did not arrive for several months. When the train finally reached its destination, there was no place to load and unload the goods, and there were no homes for the workers. There were many such situations. And these were all encounters in the severe cold of Siberia. This is from another Soviet newspaper. It can be seen that before they were installed in the interior, they had already taken extraordinary efforts. By the end of 1942, the second year of the war, these factories relocated to the interior had been largely installed and began operating. The production capacity of aircraft, artillery, tanks, etc., had by then returned to its pre-evacuation level. The Eastern region had already made considerable achievements in three five-year plan constructions before the war. Therefore, the evacuated equipment utilized the existing buildings and equipment in the area, and with some additional facilities, the evacuated equipment and personnel could begin to operate.

The Iron Will The German-Soviet war, which lasted for three years and two months, gave Stalin an opportunity to dedicate himself to the cause. When it came to a time of crisis, one could not help but bring out all one's strength to cope, and this was true for both individuals and nations. Stalin's politics are one of the types of dictatorial politics. During the development of the Soviet Union in this war, when it came to a matter of life and death, his iron will and unwavering belief, along with his tenacity and domineering personality, were clearly displayed to people all over the world. In the summer of 1941, when the German army approached the surroundings of Leningrad, Stalin repeatedly ordered that the cradle of the revolution, the city of Leningrad, be defended to the death. The Red Army and citizens defending the area did not abandon the last line of defense, even though bodies piled up like mountains. However, the Moscow defense war must be said to be the most severe test of Stalin's iron will. The German army, which had been advancing rapidly from the Smolensk area directly towards the capital, dispersed the Red Army guarding Moscow. Just as the German army's vanguard, with the rapid force of tanks and mechanized units, was about to break into Moscow in one fell swoop, the situation was extremely urgent. The government agencies in the administrative and diplomatic departments all left the capital. On the anniversary of the revolution on November 7 of the same year, the leaders of the party, such as Kalinin, Voroshilov, Andreyev, Shvernik, and Voznesensky, appeared in Kuibyshev. At that time, the people of Moscow were filled with despair. The Soviet Union's allied nations, the United Kingdom and the United States, were disappointed with the Red Army and revealed an intention to abandon Russia. At this time, was it not due to Stalin's iron will and undefeated belief that the German army's advance was stopped, and the situation was finally reversed? He ordered the government agencies, the party leaders, and the citizens to evacuate from the capital. He himself, along with Molotov and many others, stayed in the air-raid shelter of the Kremlin, picked up the telephone, and encouraged and motivated the Red Army soldiers who were fighting hard on the line dozens of kilometers outside Moscow. The Soviet newspapers have detailed the situation at the time. Stalin, who had repeatedly wandered in the alley of life and death to train himself, had an iron will and an undefeated belief, even in the face of crisis, as the Soviet newspapers said, as unshakable as a mountain.

The Supreme Order to Regard Death as Home The so-called Stalinist tactics, which revealed their full picture in this war, were very simple in content. Russia's defensive warfare has been known for its retreat tactics since ancient times. As early as 521 BC, the Scythians skillfully led the invading army of the Persian King Darius into the interior of Russia and defeated the superior Persian army, so it is also called the Scythian tactic. During the Napoleonic Wars in 1812, commanders Barclay and Kutuzov, etc., clearly used this Scythian tactic to trap Napoleon. In this German-Soviet war, many military commentators have equated Stalin's tactics with the Scythian [retreat tactics], but I do not agree. I believe that Supreme Commander Stalin did not adopt a planned retreat operation like Commander-in-Chief Barclay and Kutuzov after him. A public lecture recently held in Moscow further proves my view. During the defensive war stage in the first half of the war, Stalin was always an advocate of resistance. Do not give an inch to the enemy! Do not abandon an inch of land to the enemy! Stop the enemy's advance with death! Resist to the end in this position! Resist! This was the highest order he often gave to the soldiers on the front line. Even areas or locations of little or no value from a general tactical theory perspective were defended to the death at the cost of human lives. When the German army had reached the banks of the Volga River, Volga traffic was cut off, and the main part of Stalingrad had fallen into the hands of the German army, Stalin's tactics were fully utilized in sacrificing so much to defend a corner of Stalingrad. Because the mountain of corpses was built, the German tank mechanized units could not move forward a single step. At this time, the Soviet Union's national mobilization progressed, the training of the mobilized troops also came to an end, and the productivity of the Urals, Siberia, Central Asia, and the interior of Russia was also expanded. Moreover, with the remaining time, the resources, both material and human, of the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and other allied countries were also mobilized and turned into combat power. Prior to that, resistance was necessary, that's what Stalin thought. (End) (Xiang: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, August 26)

### Municipal Advisory Committee Hosts Leaders of Japanese Residents to Exchange Opinions on Establishing Security and Improving People's Livelihood

Yesterday (the 18th) at 4 PM, the Municipal Advisory Committee hosted a tea party in the Municipal Government Conference Room for the leaders of the Allied Residents Group, industry and commerce, banking, and newspapers in this city to exchange opinions on improving municipal administration. More than 30 people attended, including Yasui Gengo, Mimura Masataka, Funatsu Tatsuichiro, Aoki Setsu, Kurimoto Toraji, Osaka Yoichi, and Yoshida Tosuke. Secretary-General Wu of the Municipal Government was also invited to participate and was hosted by Executive Committee members Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Chen Riping, Chen Binhe, Xiang Kangyuan, and Shen Siliang of the Advisory Committee.

### Welcome Speech

First, Li Sihao delivered a welcome speech, saying: Gentlemen, thank you very much for attending the second gathering of our association today. We feel that the current situation is becoming increasingly serious, and Shanghai's position is important. We should make our greatest contribution to the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, not only should the municipal authorities and the citizens cooperate closely, but we also hope that the Japanese authorities, Japanese residents, Chinese municipal authorities, and Chinese citizens will cooperate closely to create great power. I believe that the most serious issues in Shanghai at present that should be resolved first are the establishment of security and the improvement of people's livelihood. Without the establishment of security, it is not easy to implement any administrative plans. Without the improvement of people's livelihood, it is not easy for any cooperation to take effect. Regarding these two points, I would like to ask for the high opinions of all the leaders. Subsequently, Yasui, Aoki, Funatsu, Osaka, Yoshida, Mimura, and others successively expressed their opinions, which generally emphasized: ○ In wartime construction of Greater Shanghai, officials and people must work hard together. ○ Efforts should be made to improve the treatment of security team police and pay attention to their spiritual training. ○ Strengthen the Baojia self-defense and give play to the self-defense power of the people. ○ Officials and people should unanimously promote social economy and be serious about private life, etc. The atmosphere was very warm, and the meeting did not end until 6:30 PM.

### Inland Waterway Routes in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou Have Been Completely Suspended Since Yesterday; Zhejiang Provincial Government is Preparing Remedial Measures

In view of the frequent obstructions on the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou routes, the Shanghai Inland Waterway Shipping Company has suspended the routes starting today for the sake of passenger safety. However, the suspended routes are all separated from the railway. All transportation originally relied on waterways, which has a great impact on people's livelihood. It has already been reported to the Ministry of Construction, which has transferred it to the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, instructing the counties along the route to quickly prepare proper measures to facilitate the resumption of navigation. It is now learned that the Zhejiang Provincial Government has approved the Ministry's transfer of instructions to the counties along the route, requesting a report on remedial measures. The names of the suspended routes are listed below: ○ Shanghai to Hangzhou Line, ○ Tangxi to Xinshi Line, ○ Hangzhou to Huzhou Line, ○ Shanghai to Huzhou Line, ○ Huzhou to Suzhou Line, ○ Jiaxing to Xiashi Line, ○ Jiaxing to Haiyan Line, ○ Jiaxing to Tongxiang Line, ○ Pinghu to Zhapu Line, ○ Shanghai to Pinghu Line, ○○ Shanghai to Lili Line, ○○ Nantong to Haian Line.

### Baojia Fees for September and October Will Be Collected Together

Since the Baojia in this city were unified, Baojia expenses are also collected uniformly, starting in July. It was previously agreed that the Baojia fees for July and August would be collected on August 15 and end at the end of August. The end date has now passed, and the collection matters in various districts have also been completed. The Baojia Office has specifically instructed the general joint Bao offices and police sub-bureaus in various districts that all report forms and funds to be submitted must be reported and submitted to the office by today (the 19th) for verification. Those who still lack application forms can quickly obtain them from the office. The future collection decision is to start on the 1st of each month and end on the 7th. Those who are unable to handle the matter in September should urgently handle it and temporarily delay the issuance. Each district should pay close attention to this point. The notes for filling out the forms are recorded below: ○ Type 5 form and Jia-chief! Type 5 forms are prescribed for use at all levels. However, the reports of the Jia-chiefs for July and August must be concluded in the last item of Type 1 forms to make the total number clear. There is no need to fill out Type 5 forms again to save procedures and paper. Those that have already been filled out are convenient. Check that for each report after that, the Jia-chief does not need to fill in much information, so the office will shorten Type 5 forms and print [New Type 5] for the Jia-chiefs to use, and the content is exactly the same. ○ Overdue fee form - Check the collection results reported by each district, there is no case of overdue fees, so Types 4, 5, and 6 are temporarily proposed to be printed later to save paper. If there are a few households with overdue fees, each level should draw and use the form itself.

### Japanese Embassy Office Held Regular Reporting Meeting Yesterday

The regular reporting meeting hosted by the Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy was held at 2:30 PM yesterday (the 18th) on the 8th floor of the Huaxiang Hotel on the Bund of Nanjing Road. Information Minister Matsudaira returned to his country due to official business, and Vice Consul Fukuma attended on his behalf to meet with Chinese newspaper reporters in this city. Mr. Fukuma gave a detailed account of the recent international situation on the spot, which lasted for two and a half hours before the meeting ended.

### French Tram Company Complies with the Order to Restore the Original Price

To be Implemented Starting Today The French tram company in this city suddenly increased its prices without authorization from the 15th, increasing the price by half of the original price, causing public outrage and demanding strict prohibition. The Municipal Public Works Bureau also considered that the company's price increase was illegal and ordered it to stop increasing the price and immediately restore the original price in order to maintain the law. It is now learned that the company has agreed to comply with the order and restore the original price starting today (the 19th) to avoid punishment.

### Economy Association Suggests Stopping the Publication of Gambling Place Advertisements; Publicity Office Adopts and Implements

Publicity Office Adopts and Implements The Shanghai Special City Economy Association, in view of the fact that the Greater East Asia War has laid the foundation for decisive victory, has been promoting economy in various ways, hoping that the actions of the rear people will meet the needs of the soldiers on the front line, complete Sino-Japanese cooperation, and build the mission of the co-prosperity sphere. The association also considered that some newspapers in Shanghai used valuable space to publish useless advertisements and improper texts, so they sent a public letter to the Municipal Publicity Office yesterday with suggestions. The original text is extracted below: (Omitted above) Gambling places that publish advertisements in newspapers to attract gamblers should be prohibited first. It has been found that the major newspapers in this city have complied with the resolution of the Shanghai News Joint Association and automatically stopped publishing such advertisements since July 1 of this year. However, some small newspapers still publish advertisements for Jai Alai venues and dog racing venues, which are disguised gambling venues, attracting customers. In particular, the Fan Hua Bao is the worst. In addition to the advertisements, it also has a fixed position to publish Jai Alai articles, such as [Daily Ball Affairs] and [Win or Loss Predictions] and [Win or Loss Statistics] and other texts to encourage gambling. If it is not ordered to stop the war, the harm will be even greater. The association is committed to economy and concerned about the difficulties of the times, and does not dare to remain silent. Moreover, as the situation becomes increasingly serious, as a participating country, it should strive to improve itself, and newspaper publishers should be more self-disciplined, publish more national current affairs in useful space to enhance the people's understanding and belief in the current situation, which is in line with the mission of wartime reporting institutions. The association requests the Publicity Office to order the small newspapers to stop publishing the advertisements and their articles from today, hoping that the flow of poison will gradually clear, the gambling wind will slightly subside, and then seek its extinction, so the country will be fortunate. (Omitted below) It is firmly believed that the authorities of the Municipal Publicity Office will adopt and implement it.

### Silver and Money Businesses Increase Deposit Interest Rates

The silver and money businesses in this city have inevitably been manipulated by speculative hoarders due to rising prices in recent years, greatly affecting industrial and commercial economies. The business operations of silver and money businesses themselves have also been adversely affected. It is now understood that in order to attract deposits and prevent speculators from using funds for hoarding, and to maintain their legitimate business, various businesses have slightly increased the interest rates on interbank deposits and loans. In addition, the interest rate on customer's current deposits has been increased by 50%. The minimum interest rate on mortgage loans is six cents, and the maximum is one dime and four cents, with the general rate being around one dime. However, the collateral and the purpose of the loan still need to be carefully handled. It is believed that speculative hoarders may gradually disappear. It is internally decided that retail sugar outlets throughout the city will uniformly begin selling from the 21st of this month.

### The Situation of Soybeans Being Moved into Shanghai

— Toraji Kurimoto

It has been half a month since the Oil and Grain Control Committee took over the miscellaneous grain movement permit affairs from the Commerce Control Committee. In these two weeks (the actual number of days for processing permit affairs was only eleven), the number of soybean movement permit applications from the industry was approximately over one thousand tons, averaging about one hundred tons per day. The production areas are all in the Jiangnan region. The soybean harvest this year is very promising, so the market situation will gradually become more active. Therefore, the permit applications received to date are only a prelude. When comparing the market prices in the production areas with the market prices in Shanghai, the industry feels that there is considerable profit to be made, so they are applying to move soybeans in. This kind of material circulation is a good phenomenon when viewed from the current economic situation in Shanghai and the surrounding rural areas. Furthermore, once these soybeans are moved into Shanghai, it is unlikely that they will flow out to other ports again, unless there are special circumstances. Most of them are used as supplementary food for the four million citizens of Shanghai. Currently, the daily consumption of soybeans in Shanghai, excluding soy sauce making, is approximately 40 tons. As for the consumption of oil mills, each oil mill has stopped working due to insufficient power, so consumption in that area is not a problem. As for soy sauce brewing, it depends on the season and still needs to be delayed slightly. Needless to say, most of these soybeans are for citizen consumption, so the amount of import permit applications is just enough to supply the citizens for 25 days. And these applied-for soybean imports will arrive as early as mid-month and no later than early October. Moreover, now is the initial stage of the market, as long as the market price meets the industry's plans, the amount moved in will increase rapidly, so Shanghai will definitely not have a shortage of soybeans. However, what should be considered is that the purchasing funds for these soybeans are entirely the industry's own funds, and there is no other special financing. As for how much quantity the industry can move in with its own funds, this can only be revealed in future practice. However, if the industry's funds are unstable, in order to speed up the turnover of funds, goods will inevitably be gradually released to the market. And if the industry has considerable profit to make, it will not hoard them and prefer to keep the funds stagnant. Therefore, it will inevitably find ways to accelerate the turnover of funds. If the turnover slightly improves, the flow of introduced materials and the turnover of funds will naturally clarify the industry and the market. The demand side will also be relieved. The supply side will also not be unreasonable. It will become a great force in promoting the normalization of the overall economy. Since soybeans do not require special financing and there is no flooding of funds, this point can also be said to be very meaningful in terms of financial policy. It has been more than a year since China automatically participated in the Greater East Asia War, and the war situation will reach a severe decisive stage. The editorial of Shen Bao emphasized a few days ago [putting the public before the private], and our industry must also adhere to it. The Oil and Grain Control Committee also often hopes that the industry will [put the public before the private] in the disposal of relevant materials, respect the interests of the industry, seek preferential treatment for producers, and promote business with the greatest goals of stabilizing people's livelihoods and enhancing combat power. In this sense, one of its policies is to repeatedly disclose the actual situation of various items as soon as possible within the possible range using the data of the Oil Control Committee, in order to seek cooperation from the industry and provide reference for the general public.

### Price Stabilization Subcommittee Holds First Meeting

Economic Bureau Secretly Investigates Illegal Price Increases
The Price Stabilization Subcommittee of the Municipal Economic Bureau held its first meeting at the bureau's conference room yesterday (18th) afternoon at 3 o'clock. Attendees included the Director of the Aquatic Products Administration. During the meeting, various plans on how to stabilize prices in the city and stabilize people's livelihoods were discussed in detail, and the meeting ended at around 5 o'clock. Recently, the price problem in the city has been serious, due to the secret price increases by illegal merchants in various industries. In some cases, the industry associations have even approved these increases, which is completely wrong. This not only affects people's livelihoods, but also violates government regulations. It is reported that the authorities concerned with economic relations are secretly investigating these illegal price increases by members of industry associations. If found, they will be severely punished.

### Ministry of Industry Strictly Prohibits Businesses from Using Company Names Without Authorization

The Ministry of Industry considers companies to be legal entities, and they cannot be established without the permission and registration of the competent authority where the main store is located. This is explicitly stipulated in Articles 3 and 5 of the Company Law. Therefore, all sole proprietorships or partnerships, as well as companies that have not been legally registered, must not use company names. The ministry has recently received reports of non-corporate organizations using the word "company," which clearly violates the law and should be strictly prohibited to ensure compliance with the facts. It has been communicated to the provincial and municipal governments to instruct their subordinate competent authorities to comply accordingly. Businesses in this city should pay close attention.

### The 15th Phase of Rationed Sugar to Be Sold Regularly

The Municipal Goods Distribution Office recently announced that as the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar has passed and the demand for sugar among the people is eager, in order to meet actual supply and demand, with the cooperation of the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, the 15th phase of sugar rationing will distribute half a catty of sugar per person, priced at 64 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates.

### Huangpu District Special Civil Defense Training Graduates

The Huangpu District Police Bureau of this city has been strengthening the special civil defense force by providing various technical and knowledge training. The training has now been completed and a graduation ceremony will be held at 10:00 AM today (19th) in the plaza in front of the bureau. Chief Goto of the Special Higher Police will personally attend the parade. Various air defense, fire prevention, and air raid control exercises will be performed at that time, and officials from various agencies and guests from all walks of life are invited to attend the ceremony.

### Nanshi Goods Rationing Adopts Comprehensive Joint Tickets

In order to unify the city's rationing certificate system, the Municipal Goods Distribution Office will also adopt comprehensive joint tickets for goods rationing in the Nanshi District. In recent days, the certificate issuing preparation office has been set up at the old site of the former Food Bureau to issue household-specific goods requisition certificates to residents, as preparation for the implementation of comprehensive rationing certificates in the district.

### The Educational Character of the Former Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Children's Schools

— Taichu Ueno

○ The Superiority of Treatment The superior treatment of teachers and staff at the former Shanghai Municipal Council schools seems to be generally recognized by the public. However, it is essential to know the extent of this superiority. In fact, such treatment is the standard that advanced countries in the world offer to public servants. However, China's administration of personnel is still in its infancy, making the difference apparent. As for the disparity in treatment between Chinese and Western personnel, even within the same institution and holding the same position, the difference can be several times greater. Thus, when speaking of superior treatment, it should refer to Westerners, with the Chinese being merely subordinate. A brief description of the treatment of Chinese personnel is as follows: Teaching staff are divided into two categories: those with contracts and those without. Higher-ranking staff have contracts, and their treatment is detailed in the contracts, with slight variations, reaching over a hundred items. Due to space limitations, only a general overview can be given.

One. Stability of Work The stability of life for teachers and staff at the former Chinese Children's Schools was most evident. As long as there were no major mistakes, the school never dismissed or failed to rehire teachers. Regardless of changes in directors or principals, it never affected the work of the teachers. Therefore, there were often interesting stories of teachers and students working together or fathers and sons working in the same position. There were also instances of people teaching at the same school for their entire lives, dying in their positions. There were many old men with beards at the Chinese Public School, who had dedicated decades of their lives to their alma mater and had thousands of students under their tutelage.

Two. Standards of Basic Salary The ranking of teachers and staff was determined by their academic qualifications. Generally speaking, the salary of a first-class middle school teacher was roughly equivalent to that of a professor at a national university. Second and third-class teachers also received salaries that were at least 30% higher than those of provincial middle school teachers. As for primary school teachers, their salaries were not significantly lower than those of middle school teachers, and their ranking and salary standards were also determined by their qualifications. (Note 5)

Three. Annual Increments Teachers and staff received annual increments on a specific date each year. Usually, there was a salary increase once every full year. Senior teachers also received increases every three years, depending on their signed contracts. The amount of each increment was divided into three categories: highest, middle, and lowest. The average was roughly equivalent to the total salary standard, generally determined by work performance. However, in fact, the word "[year]" in "annual increment" was particularly emphasized, so there were rarely instances of adding the minimum increment during salary increases.

Four. Various Benefits Besides Salary. (Note 7)

A. Retirement Savings 5% of the basic salary was deducted monthly as retirement savings. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Council subsidized twice the amount of the savings, combined with the principal and interest. The interest rate was approximately 6% per annum, depending on the financial situation of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The total amount of principal and interest in the savings was reported separately in writing to each teacher by the finance department in early October each year, and it was stated that the individual could check the accounts at any time.

B. Retirement Pay If a teacher or staff member had served in a council-run school for more than 20 years and was approved by the head of the supervisory authority, they were entitled to 5% of the total annual salary of that year, multiplied by the number of years of service as retirement pay. This amount was also considerable.

C. Death, Illness, and Disability Benefits For those who became ill or disabled, after verification by the Shanghai Municipal Council Medical Committee, they were allowed to retire and could be given benefits equal to those of death benefits. The calculation method for the benefits was the same as for retirement pay, but it was not necessary to have served for more than 20 years. In addition, in the event of death, the Bureau subsidized the deceased's family with a considerable amount of funeral expenses.

D. Medical Treatment This point varied depending on the rank of the teacher and the provisions of the contract. The main points were:

Child. Fixed amount of medical expenses. Shen Bao Cup Basketball Tournament

The two teams and Youlian are now tied with one loss each, and a final match will be held on Wednesday to determine the winner. In Group A2, Huatong defeated Haiyun 4-0, winning the top spot in the division. The final match of the day was between Fuguang and Zhenhua for the A1 title. The two teams put on an excellent performance. In the first half, Zhang Gaozhen of Zhenhua headed in a goal, taking the lead. After the lemon break, Han Longhai scored with a header, tying the score at 1-1. Until the end of the match, neither side scored again. According to the rules, the game should have gone into overtime, but because it was getting late, it was impossible to continue. The final will be replayed this week.

### After Electricity Restrictions

— Ti Yan

There is no objection to the intention of the Electricity Company to promote production by further restricting electricity consumption. However, I dare not agree with the uniform restriction of 50% for residents. In Shanghai's common people's lane houses, most buildings house seven or eight tenant families. Ordinary electricity consumption is already as frugal as it can be. The current limit is only thirteen degrees per month, and even with the utmost effort, it is only enough for half a month. After the stipulated amount of electricity is used up, the landlord closes the main switch to prevent tenants from privately exceeding the limit and causing damage to the line. The tenants have no choice but to endure the high cost of switching to rush lights and vegetable oil lamps. In this way, electricity is saved, but the potential for future fires is not an unfounded worry. Especially for those living upstairs, if there is a fire in the middle of the night, the loss of property is a small matter. In such complete darkness, coupled with panic, I dare not say that they will be spared the tragedy of being burned to death! As for children of school age who study their books and arithmetic under the faint light every night, the damage to their eyesight is not worth considering!

However, it is a different story if only one family lives in a building. Although there are many rooms, when nothing is happening, the family sits in one room, chatting about their affairs. Although they are restricted, there is still plenty of electricity. Since they do not use it all, they continue to use electric stoves to avoid the risk of further reductions, and they can also save on high fuel costs. There is nothing more unfair than this! In my opinion, it is best to order the landlords to submit a household registration form to check the number of tenant families, and set a standard of only allowing each tenant family to use a certain number of light bulbs, and stipulate the total amount of electricity consumption. This will truly achieve the original purpose of conservation, and things can be used to their full advantage. I believe that the Electricity Company has no shortage of insightful people and will definitely adjust this unreasonable restriction to comfort us!

### Grand Situation of Charity Sale of Mooncakes

The Guanshengyuan Food Company, in response to helping students and providing relief to the poor, made extra-large mooncakes and held a charity sale for ten days starting from the 17th. For a time, the number of visitors was endless, and the situation was unprecedented. In the past two days, Mr. Yang Runzhen righteously purchased a "Three Pools Mirroring the Moon" mooncake for 6,000 yuan. Mr. Kan Jingliang righteously purchased a "Peaceful Years" mooncake for 10,000 yuan. Mr. Li Shimin righteously purchased a "Three Pools Mirroring the Moon" mooncake for 6,000 yuan. The above three mooncakes totaled 22,000 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates, which the company has duly delivered to this office. It is still hoped that the enthusiastic public will actively participate and contribute to the good cause.

### Wanlan Girls' Middle School Continues to Enroll Half-Fee Students

Those with excellent grades and poor family circumstances can apply to pay half the fee (1,500 yuan). Those with supporting documents can be exempted from the entrance examination. It is reported that the school officially started classes on the 18th. Those who aspire to study and are hesitating on the wrong path can quickly go to the school to register and avoid missing the opportunity. It is also understood that the school's attached women's supplementary classes still have vacancies in Chinese, English, and Mathematics. The time is optional, and there are no restrictions on level or age.

### Water Outage in Xujiahui: Urge Speedy Restoration

The entire area along the western side of Huashan Road in the 4th District, Xujiahui, has suddenly been cut off from tap water since the 15th. There is not a drop of water day and night. Residents, with no other options, have been drawing water from public taps on other roads or from nearby earth wells. The situation is even more crowded in the evening, and disputes often occur as a result. It has been found that this water outage is limited to Xujiahui only. It is hoped that the China Central Water and Electricity Authority will investigate the cause as soon as possible and restore tap water soon. (Yale)

### Still at Old Price

Since this office began selling [Shi Si Long] tablets produced by the Muller Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory through charity sales, purchasers have been enthusiastic. The Shanghai Healthcare Association, a hospital under special agreement with this office, also believes that the tablets are very effective after trial use and has successively purchased more. Recently, the prices of Western medicines have increased by more than double, but Muller Pharmaceutical Factory does not intend to raise prices for the time being in order to give preference to charity sales. Each box (20 tablets) is still sold at the original price of 400 yuan. Therefore, those who wish to purchase are urged to do so as soon as possible. [Shi Si Long] tablets are mainly used for acute and chronic pneumonia, influenza, colds, bronchitis, meningitis, acute and chronic gonorrhea, trachoma, laryngitis, rhinitis, otitis media, erysipelas, scarlet fever, mastitis, puerperal fever, and all suppurative diseases.

### Thunderstorm (4)

— By Toyoo Iwata, translated by Hong Yang

Ryufu, feeling uneasy, took the finished painting to submit it.

[Very good!]

That three-word comment from Lieutenant Colonel Tobita passed it. He immediately transferred the painting to the photography class of the Navy Ministry's reporter group, the Black Tide Society.

(How can that be?)

Ryufu returned to his office, feeling shy.

Insufficient preparation must also be a reason for failure, so he no longer waited for orders but permanently spread out the paper in preparation.

Even so, his heart was still uneasy.

(Ah, I was too excited to paint clearly. Forgetting to paint is not allowed.)

When he discovered his fundamental shortcomings, the order to paint a second time came again.

This time it was to paint England. On December 10, the Prince of Wales, the unsinkable battleship, and the battlecruiser Repulse were sunk off Kuantan. Such a great victory that shocked the world was again the achievement of our Japanese planes.

Ryufu only knew about the anti-aircraft equipment of the battleship Prince of Wales, and was vaguely aware of the rest.

(I want to depict a miracle painting. I want to do the work of an Italian medieval painter in modern times.)

So he drew a large torpedo bomber at the highest point of the drawing paper. He wanted to draw a halo around the torpedo bomber, but he stopped when he thought about the mission of the reportage painting.

However, he was not satisfied with the painting he had completed this time either. He only felt that it was stronger than the first time.

At 3:00 PM on December 18, the detailed report of the Pearl Harbor attack was published. Everyone felt that this great victory was completely like a dragon hidden in the clouds, revealing its full body. The California-class battleships were also sunk. The Maryland, Allison, Utah, and Nevada classes—of which only one battleship and two Class B cruisers could be repaired. The US Pacific Fleet was almost entirely destroyed. At the same time, the losses inflicted on the enemy's air power were also very great.

(The power of airplanes is really great!)

Ryufu repeated a grateful word.

But the second paragraph of the publication also said: The Special Attack Force had established unparalleled feats in that naval battle. In addition, the third paragraph was about our losses: 29 aircraft and 5 special submarines that had not yet returned.

(What are special submarines? What kind of ships are they?)

It was not Ryufu alone who was not greatly moved by the tragic feeling because the publication was simple. (142)
