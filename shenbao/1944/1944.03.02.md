### A Changing Era

The Greater East Asia War is the most significant event in East Asia in the last hundred years. From the Greater East Asia War onwards, the East Asian nations have entered a most momentous era of transformation. This era will determine the future destiny of the East Asian peoples. Whether East Asian nations will no longer suffer aggression and whether they will be independent and free depends on the achievements of their efforts in this era.

People in this great era mostly feel much anxiety. The reason for this anxiety was most thoroughly explained by the late Mr. Chiang Pai-li, who said: "Old habits can no longer adapt to the world's new environment, and the world's new environment does not particularly allow people's old habits." From these anxieties arise two distinctly different thoughts and lives: one is passive and negative; the other is active and positive. The former are dominated by the environment, while the latter dominate the environment. Those dominated by the environment gradually end their old lives, while those who dominate the environment gradually create their new lives.

This is an unprecedented upheaval. Chinese people in this era, whether scholars, farmers, artisans, or merchants, bear a most significant responsibility. We must understand that this change is a necessary and unavoidable process for China's independence. We must identify our goals, take two steps at a time, and strive forward in order to preserve this nation.

China is an agricultural society, and the lives and work of its people have followed old habits and traditions for centuries, seemingly unchanged. Since the Opium War and the opening of the doors, old habits and traditions have no longer been able to adapt to the new environment. As a result, thousands upon thousands of citizens have unknowingly been eliminated by the environment, becoming pitiful victims, and the fate of the entire nation has been controlled by Britain and America. As we look back at China's history over the past century and the efforts and struggles of many patriots, we cannot help but feel emotional. But emotions are useless. We must reform our old habits to adapt to the current new environment. We must forge our new spirit and create our new lives.

Reforming old habits is indeed a difficult task, like bookkeeping. How can someone who has kept a simple cash book of "receipts above and payments below" all their life immediately do modern accounting? But when the simple cash book can no longer adapt to the new environment, you must do modern accounting in order to survive. At this time, there are only two paths before you: one is to be eliminated, and the other is to quickly learn and create a new life. The future of individuals is like this, and so is the future of the nation. The Meiji Restoration in our allied nation, Japan, is the best example of creating a new life. Passive elimination leads to the decline and fall of a country and a nation, while active innovation leads to the revival of a country and a nation. Time is the fastest, and history is the cruelest. The Greater East Asia War has been going on for more than two years. What have we done? How much have we reformed? We hope everyone will always encourage each other, and we hope everyone will become patriots to revive China and heroes to defend Greater East Asia!

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - March 1st marks the 12th anniversary of the founding of the Manchurian Empire. Starting at 7:30 PM, China, Japan, and Manchuria held a special exchange broadcast. Our country was represented by Foreign Minister Chu, who extended deep congratulations on the 12th anniversary of the founding of Manchuria. The original text is as follows: "Today, as we joyfully celebrate the 12th anniversary of the founding of our neighboring country, the Manchurian Empire, I, on behalf of the National Government of the Republic of China, extend my deepest congratulations and sincere hopes. The territory of Manchuria, with its Baekdu Mountains and Songhua River, is fertile for thousands of miles. The national railways reach everywhere, and transportation is extremely convenient. The abundance of resources and the diligence of the people are the unique glories of Manchuria, and the production of soybeans is famous throughout the world. Since its founding, Manchuria has been united from top to bottom, managing diligently. The development of resources and the efforts of construction are a source of pride for the nation. With careful governance, it has quickly shone brightly, becoming a powerful link in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This is most admirable. As time passes, it has been twelve years. When we enter Xinjing, we see its majestic architecture, bustling people, and flourishing industries, creating a land of happiness. Its rapid progress is astonishing. The consecutive years of abundant agricultural harvests have earned praise from our ally, Japan. Today, in the year of the decisive battle for Greater East Asia, we must shoulder our mission, unleash our great national strength, sweep away the evil forces of Britain and America, and defeat the communists. This is my greatest wish in addition to the celebration. From now on, every year on this day, we will continue to express our endless congratulations, while reflecting on ourselves. I wish the Manchurian Empire prosperous and enduring."

Prime Minister Tojo of Japan

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - Japanese Representative Prime Minister Tojo's radio address to Manchuria was as follows: "Today, on the joyous occasion of the founding anniversary of Manchuria, I take this opportunity to extend my congratulations to the beloved people of Manchuria from afar. I am deeply grateful and offer my sincerest wishes for the health and well-being of His Majesty the Emperor of Manchuria. Looking back since the founding of Manchuria, twelve years have passed, during which the establishment of domestic security, ethnic harmony, and the great cause of peace and security for the people have been steadily realized. Industry has also flourished day by day, which is truly celebrated by East Asia. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Manchuria has been in step with Japan, actively reorganizing its highly defensive national structure. Domestically, it has increased food production and further promoted industrial production plans. Externally, it has strengthened its close ties with the Republic of China, other countries in Greater East Asia, and European allies, and its contribution to the Greater East Asia War has been extremely profound, for which the Japanese people are deeply grateful. In particular, its recent cooperation with Japan in food supplies is greatly appreciated, and I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude. To prevent the greedy and oppressive Anglo-Americans from attempting to invade East Asia again and to build a Greater East Asia that conforms to morality, the final victory of the Greater East Asia War is the only way to achieve this goal. Japan, together with Manchuria and all the countries and ethnic groups that share the ideal of liberating Greater East Asia, firmly believes that it will be able to achieve the final victory in this great war. On this auspicious occasion of the founding of Manchuria, we must strengthen our close ties and pray for the prosperity of Manchuria."

Prime Minister Zhang of Manchuria

Xinjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - Manchurian Prime Minister Zhang's radio address was as follows: "Twelve years since the founding of Manchuria is indeed a short period in the history of a nation, but its rapid development and the strengthening of its national power are sufficient to rank it among the world's best. Especially since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the national power cultivated over the past decade has been used to support Japan and achieve the sacred war. Now, the entire nation of 43 million people has united to advance the two major missions of strengthening war efforts and securing the northern border. The founding of Manchuria was the beginning of the construction of Greater East Asia. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration announced at the Greater East Asia Conference last November can be said to have applied the ideals of our nation's founding to the entire city of Greater East Asia. The great task of constructing Greater East Asia is certainly not an easy one, but the ten billion people of Greater East Asia, with their iron will, unite and strive to defeat the Anglo-Americans, and I believe we can succeed. China, Japan, and Manchuria are the axis of Greater East Asia, and the firm alliance of these three countries undoubtedly serves as a great driver. Now, Japan has established a system for ensuring victory for the entire nation. Under the leadership of Chairman Wang, the Republic of China is also becoming increasingly strong, which is truly heartening and encouraging. Seeing that the enemy is determined to fight a short-term decisive battle, relying on its material resources, and counterattacking on all fronts, the war situation is becoming increasingly severe and has reached a critical juncture for the rise and fall of Greater East Asia. It is also a time for each country and ethnic group in Greater East Asia to exert their greatest strength from their respective positions. On this auspicious occasion of the 12th anniversary of the founding of our country, Manchuria is willing to work more closely with the countries of East Asia, fighting courageously with the conviction of certain victory, to defeat the Anglo-Americans and persevere to the end."

### Impending Mud Season: Germany Adjusts Lines, Intense Battles on Northern and Southern Sections of Eastern Front

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) - Military sources yesterday received a statement from the German News Agency: The mud season on the Eastern Front is about to arrive early. The frozen ground in the southern sector has begun to thaw, but in the central and northern sectors, temperatures are still between 12 and 15 degrees below freezing. Meteorologists also predict an early arrival of the rainy and mud season. German military experts believe that this climate will be an important consideration when the German army adjusts its lines. Examining the overall situation on the Eastern Front, Berlin also believes that the Soviet army has not achieved its expected goals, failing to break through German defenses or hinder German strategic movements. The German army naturally hopes to occupy advantageous positions before the mud season, so that the muddy ground will not impede its movement.

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: Fierce battles took place on both the northern and southern sectors of the Eastern Front on Monday. The mud season was accelerated by a sudden cold wave, with temperatures in several areas dropping to 20 degrees below zero, the lowest temperature of this winter. Taking advantage of the weather, the Soviet army used skating divisions and mechanized sleds in an attempt to disrupt German movements. East of Lake Peipus, towards Pskov, the Soviet army is trying to cross the marshland in order to avoid operational delays caused by the changing weather, but has been blocked by the German rearguard. Northwest of Nevel, the Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive with numerous tanks and several rifle divisions, supported by artillery and aircraft, with the apparent aim of encircling the northern German forces from the south. However, the German army anticipated this and inflicted heavy losses on the initial attack, repelling it. The main front line remains in German hands.

Situation on the Southern Front

Snow in the southern sector has begun to thaw, and torrential rains have fallen in the Dnepr bend. On Monday, the German defense system in this area remained steadfast. The main Soviet offensive continues to be centered on Krivoy Rog. South of the Pripet Marshes, German mechanized units are engaged in a tug-of-war with Soviet cavalry and tank units. In the Crimea region, after a long period of silence, the Soviet army resumed its offensive northeast of Kerch. The Soviet army used smoke screens and heavy artillery support in an attempt to create a gap in the German lines, but was dispersed before reaching the German positions. Only one point penetrated the German lines, but was eventually cleared.

### Anti-Axis Aircraft Attack Germany, Air Raid Alarm in London

### Germany Develops New Anti-Aircraft Weapon Using Radio Wave Principles

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) - Anti-Axis air forces have recently been bombing various parts of Germany with large formations of 1,000 to 2,000 aircraft, but have suffered losses of approximately 100 to 200 aircraft due to the fierce counterattacks of the German Air Force. It is generally believed that the achievements of the German Air Force are due to the excellent performance of German fighter planes. It is also believed that the German army has been using new weapons that utilize radio waves in recent air battles. These new weapons can identify whether enemy aircraft are approaching, allowing fighter planes to maneuver effectively. A German weekly magazine has discussed the principles of this new weapon, stating that it works by emitting radio waves into the air. When an aircraft comes into contact with these radio waves, a reaction occurs, allowing for measurement. Furthermore, various methods are used to determine whether aircraft are hostile, even at night. Recently, the German army used a method to thwart attempts by the Anti-Axis forces to use tinfoil to interfere with the performance of this machine. Therefore, although the Anti-Axis forces have dropped large amounts of tinfoil when bombing Germany, they have failed to hinder this highly sensitive device.

### Actively Developing Agriculture and Industry in Manchuria

The Greatest Harvest

Manchurian agriculture, which bears the mission of completing the self-sufficiency of food supply between Japan and Manchuria, is increasing in importance day by day. There are 34.5 million farmers in Manchuria, accounting for about 80% of the total population of 43 million. Furthermore, the foundation of the low-price policy is built on agricultural products. Thanks to the silent labor of these honest farmers, domestic life is stable. They also fulfill the responsibility of exporting food and oil to mainland Japan, North China, and Korea. According to farmers in Jilin Province, the harvest in 1943 was the rarest in decades, so the impact of the strong collection in the previous year was partially recovered. At present, the peak period of shipping is in full swing. The carts full of grains form a long snake-like queue. The authorities of the Xingnong Department also believe that the shipment of this year's allocated amount is definitely not a problem.

For the shipment of agricultural products, the special allocation of cotton products was also implemented in 1943. Because the shipment was unexpectedly early, cotton products were not even prepared in time, and the whole Manchurian trading place was very active. Also, in view of the great harvest this year (1943), the depletion of land fertility in the coming year must of course be expected. Therefore, farmers follow the careful guidance of the authorities, work hard on fertilization to restore land fertility, and prepare for the inevitable increase in production next year.

The promotion of rice cultivation in Manchuria is also quite remarkable. One or two reclamation areas have harvested a surprising amount of 9 koku of unpolished rice per tan (Japanese area unit, equivalent to 991.7 square meters), and some experimental farmers can harvest 9 tons per cho (Japanese area unit, equal to ten tan) (the average in mainland Japan is 4 tons).

Moreover, there are still 20 million chō of uncultivated land. In addition to some areas in southern Manchuria, the average harvest is not very high due to the prevailing extensive farming methods. Due to land reclamation and improved technology, a large increase in production can be expected in the future. Therefore, the Japan-Manchuria food self-sufficiency policy can be strongly promoted. The problems in agriculture, in addition to the above-mentioned land reclamation and technical improvement, also include the differential gap between the price of agricultural products and the price of consumer goods, the commission fees for revenue officials, the tendency of the subdivision of large farms in northern Manchuria, and the supply of fertilizers and agricultural tools.

Recent Status of Immigration

It goes without saying that the national great mission of the Manchurian immigration policy. However, a large number of Japanese immigrants settling in Manchurian villages is indispensable for establishing a national defense system. This obvious fact should be fully recognized. In this emergency situation, the reason for further advancing the immigration policy lies mostly here. The settlement of land reclamation groups and volunteer corps should also consider the needs of national defense for placement. In terms of increasing production, the land reclamation groups have already achieved a 70% increase in production this year (1942), and now they are launching a campaign to double the increase in production next year. In particular, the transformation of those who used to consume goods in Japanese cities into farmers, and the transformation of Japanese consumers into Manchurian producers, are being carried out on a large scale. Although its strength is weak, it is still a wing to enhance production and is quite noteworthy.

The current situation of immigration is as follows: At the end of last year (1942), there were 573 land reclamation groups with 146,000 immigrants; the total number of youth volunteer corps who crossed over to Manchuria was 65,000 (including 26,000 who have been transferred from the volunteer corps to land reclamation groups); and the number of laborers dispatched to Manchuria was 38,000. The cultivated area of land reclamation migrants last year was about 175,000 chō, this year it is 239,000 chō, and next year it is expected to exceed 300,000 chō. The focus of the immigration policy for next year is first to supplement the immigration of each uncompleted land reclamation group. (The above is a partial translation of the Asahi Shimbun in December last year)

Aggressive Increase in Steel Production

The government of Manchuria, in view of the tension of the war situation, sees steel as the center of military power and therefore increasing its production is an urgent task. Therefore, after the integration of the power industry, it merged the three major iron and steel businesses in the country. The merger outline was passed by the Senate Council on the 17th and its contents were announced on the 18th. According to this, the Showa Steel Works (capital of 400 million yen), the Benxi Lake Coal and Iron Company (200 million yen), and the East Border Road Development Company (120 million yen) were merged. The new Manchurian Iron and Steel Co., Ltd. (capital of 740 million drawings, special corporation) was established. The new company has its headquarters in Anshan, and all contracts and procedures have been completed. Business is scheduled to begin on April 1. The purpose of merging iron and steel companies is to meet the urgent requirements of increasing steel production, to comprehensively, organically, and highly utilize the existing technology, raw materials, resources, materials, and equipment of the three companies to increase productivity. The ideal system of Manchurian iron and steel industry has been established so far. Showa, Benxi Lake, and East Border Road three iron and steel companies are sister companies within the scope of Manchurian smoked industry, and have close ties. Since the first five-year plan, they have actively moved towards the development of steel. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asian War, the raw material technology construction plan and other departments should be closer, so the merger of the iron and steel industry is an urgent task to complete the increase in production.

Merger Outline: The business entities to be merged are Showa Steel Works Co., Ltd., Benxi Lake Coal and Iron Co., Ltd., and East Border Road Development Co., Ltd.

Regarding the merger (A) Showa, Benxi Lake, and East Border Road three companies merged to establish a new corporation. (B) For the shareholders of the merged company, issue the equivalent new corporate stock.

The new corporation is a special corporation of Manchuria, with a capital of 740 million yen.

The new corporation's head office will be located in Anshan City (the location of the original Showa Steel Works).

Regarding the special quality of steel produced by Manchuria, be sure to ensure its quality and quantity.

The new corporation inherits all employees of Showa. Benxi Lake, East Border Road three companies. (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, February 19)

### Permanent Blackout to be Implemented in This City Starting Tomorrow, Joint Announcement by Japanese Army and Navy Anti-Aircraft Command

Central News Agency reports: Recently, the antics of the US Air Force in Chongqing have become increasingly violent. Recently, they have avoided the sharp edge of the Japanese Air Force and turned to major cities in peaceful areas for blind bombing. Under the strict defense of the Japanese Army in Shanghai and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, enemy aircraft cannot invade, but it is not difficult to predict that enemy aircraft will attempt to invade the suburbs of Shanghai at any time. Therefore, for the thoroughness of Shanghai's air defense, the Japanese Army and Navy authorities previously contacted the municipal government authorities and conducted joint air defense exercises several times to strengthen the air defense lineup. With all preparations now complete, permanent blackout will be implemented in the entire city of Shanghai from March 3rd. Regarding this matter, the Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Anti-Aircraft Command issued a joint announcement on the 1st as follows: After March 3rd, the blackout measures in Shanghai will be implemented in accordance with the attached table. The blackout will be implemented from sunset to sunrise.

### Yesterday the 12th Time: Manchukuo National Foundation Day; Manchukuo Consul-General Hosted the Press and Delivered a Speech

Central News Agency Report: Yesterday (the 1st) was the 12th National Foundation Day of the Empire of Manchukuo. Mr. Ye, the Consul-General of the Manchukuo Embassy in Shanghai, held a tea party at 3 p.m. yesterday at the China Hotel, Room 9, to entertain Chinese and Japanese journalists from this city. The Consul-General delivered a speech on the current situation and his thoughts on the 12th anniversary of the founding of the nation. Subsequently, Mr. Chen, the President of this newspaper, gave a speech in reply. The gathering ended at around 5 p.m. The following is a record of Consul-General Ye’s speech:

Speech by Consul-General Ye

Today (the 1st) is the 12th National Foundation Day of my Manchukuo Empire. In my capacity as the Consul-General of the Manchukuo Empire stationed in Shanghai, I would like to say a few words about my thoughts.

My Manchukuo was founded in the Datong year 1, which is the year 21 of the Republic of China, and has only been around for twelve years. However, the internal security is now completely stable, and there has been rapid development in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture. Externally, starting with Japan, we cooperate with friendly neighboring countries, and our diplomatic relations are becoming more intimate and consolidated. At the same time, with all our spirit, we are doing our best to assist in the completion of the unprecedented Greater East Asia War.

Below, I will briefly introduce the state of Manchukuo's struggle under the Greater East Asia War, for the reference of the new China, which stands on the same ideals and destiny.

Before the founding of Manchukuo, under the politics of warlord misgovernment and banditry, the national administration was chaotic, public security was disrupted, and the poverty of the people reached its extreme. As a result, it became the object of aggression and exploitation by European and American countries. For the sake of the whole of East Asia, the situation at that time was very worrying.

After the Founding of the Nation

However, since the founding of Manchukuo, under the absolute support and assistance of Japan, marching forward under the banner of the great ideals of the Kingly Way, Paradise on Earth, and Ethnic Harmony, public security was established, all administrative affairs were renewed, and culture was revitalized within a few years, forming a very vibrant and orderly state, completely renewing its former appearance. If we say that my Manchukuo is the pioneer of the East Asian New Order movement advocated by Japan today, and that it is the time when East Asian peoples are supporting each other, then it more realistically shows what great power our country can produce. I believe that it can suggest the direction of future progress for China and the countries of the Co-Prosperity Sphere.

On the one hand, we have been working hard with East Asia as the center. Because of the instigation of the insatiable Anglo-Americans, the situation has worsened day by day, eventually leading to the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident and the tragedy of brothers fighting each other. On the other hand, the endless desires of the Anglo-Americans have caused the Second European War on the European continent. As a result, there was also the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War in the year 30 of the Republic of China. In an unprecedentedly vast area and scale, fierce battles are being fought repeatedly. Manchukuo, in response to this change in situation, has also vigorously raised the power of the whole country and participated in the struggle to preserve the glorious East Asian world. The Greater East Asia War has repeatedly established brilliant war results in the South. The elite of the Kwantung Army are quietly working hard in the frigid North, but the new elite forces of the Manchukuo Army, which have been obviously enriched and perfected in recent years to help with this war, cannot be ignored. Between Japan and the Soviet Union, needless to say, the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Treaty is solemnly in existence. In the ever-changing current international environment, it can be said that the North is maintaining a state of tranquility.

Five-Year Plan

Because we had foreseen today, in the year 4 of Kangde, which is the year 26 of the Republic of China, we established the Manchukuo Industrial Five-Year Plan. Although we encountered various difficulties such as the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident and the outbreak of the European War, as a result of the concerted efforts of Japan and Manchukuo, officials and people, we not only reaped brilliant achievements, but also established the Second Five-Year Plan, attempting to rapidly increase the production of iron, coal, and Ming agricultural products and other materials essential to the war.

Among the grand industrial sectors included in the Five-Year Plan, development requires a large amount of fixed production equipment. In terms of the Dao relationship, the results of this kind of production cannot be expected urgently, but the iron and steel sector of Manchukuo has already completed the initial stage of this kind of foundation and has now entered the production period. However, it goes without saying that we must thoroughly and completely utilize this huge equipment in terms of management, so as to increase the production of war resources and complete the system. For emergency materials, we are currently in the process of expanding production facilities. When these facilities are fully activated, they will definitely produce a surprising amount of iron, coal, and so on.

Secondly, speaking of agricultural products, my Manchukuo has always been known as an agricultural country. Moreover, in wartime, when food resources are easily becoming insufficient, with the awareness and responsibility of being the base station for the Greater East Asia War, we have worked hard to expand farmland and strengthen the value of land utilization. As a result, we have also achieved very reliable results in this regard. Last year, we reached millions of tons of agricultural products. In early January, we had already handed over all of it. In addition to this, there is the so-called "repayment of kindness grain," and we are continuing to hand over agricultural products.

In this way, the former ethnic struggles and undeveloped border lands have been transformed into new countries with ethnic harmony and extremely prosperous industries, completely reaching the point of being a large arsenal and base station for the Greater East Asia War.

National Training

Furthermore, not only in terms of materials, but also in terms of spirit, as a result of implementing national training in line with a newly emerging country, we have achieved remarkable results. It is not an exaggeration to say that the greatest reason for the leap in materials mentioned above is due to the thoroughness of national training.

First, the Concordia Association, which was organized at the same time as the founding of the country and stands in a two-in-one position with the government, is endowed with the function of "proclaiming virtue and communicating affection." At the same time, it promotes the organization and implementation of youth movements, and trains the minds and bodies of the second generation of citizens. Secondly, even in wartime, it uses a large amount of national funds to work hard to revitalize educational undertakings.

Furthermore, in the year 7 of Kangde, which is the year 29 of the Republic of China, we implemented the National Military Service Law and promulgated the conscription system, with military training and national training as the greatest goals, and the results obtained have been extremely excellent. Recently, what can be particularly mentioned is the formulation of the Labor Service Law. As a result of this, from January 2nd of last year, we have institutionalized labor service as a national obligation. Therefore, last year, we mobilized hundreds of thousands of young people to engage in simple water management, road construction, and labor in important industries, achieving great results. What can be noted about this system is that it has many benefits for the country and the people in terms of cultivating the national spirit, strengthening the country, and increasing the welfare of the people in both material and spiritual aspects. In this way, although Manchukuo has been founded for only more than ten years, it has completed amazing development in all aspects within the country, which can be said to have a more profound significance for the current situation. In order to cope with this situation, on February 8th of the tenth year of the founding of Manchukuo, we announced the Outline of Basic National Policies of Manchukuo, reflecting on the past achievements of Manchukuo and clearly indicating the way forward for Manchukuo under the grand current situation. The main aim is to thoroughly implement the essence of the nation and uplift the national concept, to consolidate the national solidarity based on the spirit of ethnic harmony, and at the same time to strive for the revitalization of culture and education, to promote the spirit of hard work and national prosperity, so as to strengthen the national strength and stabilize the people's livelihood. Under such a grand policy, the military, government, and people of Manchukuo have become one, doing their best and focusing all their efforts on the completion of the Greater East Asia War.

Liberation Holy War

Thinking about it, the Greater East Asia War is a great holy war to liberate East Asia from the demons of the insatiable Anglo-Americans. It is indeed a great decisive battle concerning the rise and fall of hundreds of millions of people in East Asia. That is, whether the East Asian people are willing to forever submit to the exploitation and oppression of the Anglo-Americans, or whether they can complete the order of autonomous co-existence and co-prosperity of the East Asian nations, it all depends on the outcome of this decisive battle. In this sense, the Greater East Asia War is not only a war for Japan, but also not a war that occurred for Japan. In other words, it is a war for the entire East Asia, and a struggle that occurred for the entire East Asia.

Because of the faithful, loyal, and brave struggle of the Japanese army, within half a year after the start of the war, they had almost completely driven out the ugly-skinned Anglo-Americans. Although the decisive battle has not yet ended, there is already a clear and strong dawn of a new order within Greater East Asia. This is the independence of Burma, the establishment of the Republic of the Philippines, and the construction of the Provisional Government of Free India. The entire East Asia is actively moving in an atmosphere of construction. The Greater East Asia Conference held in Tokyo last autumn was a powerful start in the history of the East Asian New Order. The Great East Asia Declaration resolved at this conference is based on Eastern morality and the Japanese spirit. It is a great moral policy that the Anglo-Americans can never achieve. I believe that the pioneer and maker of it is my Manchukuo.

However, the enemy Anglo-Americans are relying on their powerful material and resource power to desperately continue their counterattack. We should not fear this serious fact, nor should we turn a blind eye to it. We should think more deeply about the meaning of this decisive battle, and vigorously rise up to destroy this enemy in one meal. When the East Asian nations unite, what is there to be afraid of? The final victory belongs to us, and we must win. The center of the Greater East Asian countries, needless to say, is naturally Japan, Manchukuo, and China. I think we should solemnly decide that no matter what kind of situation we encounter, we Japan, Manchukuo, and China must support each other and fight to the end in order to build a glorious history for Greater East Asia. I will end my speech here.

Thoughts of the President of This Newspaper

I remember that in the year 20 of the Republic of China, I went to Manchuria once. In half a year, I visited almost all the important places! At that time, Manchuria was still ruled by Zhang Xueliang. It was a typical warlord government. I never expected that after twelve years, such a bright and splendid newly emerging country would be produced in the northeast corner.

Just now, after hearing the speech of Consul-General Ye, we know that Manchukuo's new construction today has been achieved entirely through struggle in the face of difficulties! If the situation were peaceful, I believe it would be even better than it is now! However, it can also be said that it is precisely because it is in a turbulent situation that the government and people of Manchukuo are working together to make efforts, and only then have they achieved today's results.

Confucius said: "When three men are walking together, there must be one who can be my teacher!" Now, China, Japan, and Manchukuo are advancing on the road to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The spirit of Japan and Manchukuo in building the nation is worthy of our emulation. How can we abandon ourselves and not know how to pursue and emulate them?

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War two years ago, Manchukuo has fulfilled the mission and responsibility of a participating country's rear area. The efforts of the past ten years have enabled it to practice the mission of participating in the war with strength. Then, we must also ask ourselves, after our participation in the war, have we practiced our mission?

I have the following three thoughts on Manchukuo's achievements today:

They "say less empty words and bury their heads in work."

The lives of their people may be more difficult than ours on the surface, but the overall strength of the country has increased.

Their success cannot be denied because they have received a lot of help from Japan. But at the same time, we cannot deny that it is due to the joint efforts of the Manchukuo authorities and the people that they have been able to achieve today's success.

The above are just some temporary thoughts I have today. I hope that China and Manchukuo will work together to help our allied country Japan win the victory in the Greater East Asia War.

Perfect Distribution System; Mr. Nikko, Director of the Continental New Daily Editorial Bureau, Asked: "The Japanese distribution system is strictly implemented uniformly throughout the country. I don't know how the Manchukuo distribution system is?" Mr. Matsuda, the Vice-Consul of the Manchukuo Consulate, explained, saying: "The current distribution system in Manchukuo is divided into three types: labor distribution, urban distribution, and rural distribution.

First, during the wartime production increase period, the laborers of various national policy companies have heavier work than ordinary people and a greater mission. Therefore, the amount of distribution is more than that of ordinary citizens. Each person can get 25 to 30 catties of food per month. If the work is diligent and the performance is particularly good, there is still temporary extra distribution. This measure has an award and incentive nature, so everyone works with peace of mind, and the increase in production has become more and more developed.

Second, the urban distribution system is more complicated, so it is carefully considered. Because commercial areas are mostly concentrated in one place, and going from residential areas to stores to shop cannot be done without using transportation, which is quite troublesome. Therefore, according to the population of an area, the number of items in that area, and the number of stores stipulated in a certain area, residents near the store only need to register with it and receive various distributed items on time. In terms of food, people over 25 years old receive about 12 kilograms per month. Children and the elderly are adjusted according to age. The method is good, unlike the crowding of Shanghai citizens waiting in line to receive items.

Third, rural distribution is divided into three festivals a year, namely the New Year's Festival, the Dragon Boat Festival, and the Mid-Autumn Festival. In addition, during the autumn and winter rainy seasons when crops are harvested, there are also temporary special distributions. Food such as flour is distributed overnight, and other vegetables and fruits are all available in the countryside, so there is no need to distribute other scarce items.

In short, the distribution system in Manchukuo is already very perfect, and in terms of methods, it may be even better than Japan, so it can undertake this wartime mission.

Secondly, Manchukuo values agriculture highly, followed by heavy industry, and light industry relies on Japanese products. However, after the Greater East Asia War, in order to adapt to the needs of the times, we have strengthened heavy industry production on the one hand, and revitalized light industry on the other. In the past two years, we have achieved remarkable results. For items such as medicine, Ajinomoto, and stationery, not only do we not need to rely on imports from Japan, but we also have a large quantity that can be exported to North China and other places.

Economic News

### Thoroughly Suppressing and Stabilizing Prices Requires Addressing Both Symptoms and Root Causes; Cracking Down on Hoarding is the First Step

Recently, the price surge has been particularly severe. Yesterday, reporters visited the Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce and the major commodity trade associations to inquire about their opinions on the policy of suppressing and stabilizing prices, as well as the factors behind the recent rapid rise in prices. It was reported that the source of goods in this city is extremely difficult due to the impact of overseas transportation disruptions. Therefore, some merchants are taking the opportunity to hoard goods, manipulate, and engage in speculative activities, which ultimately occur one after another.

The Chamber of Commerce and other organizations, in view of this, have long issued notices urging merchants in various industries to abide by standard prices and avoid legal sanctions. If it is necessary to change the highest standard due to cost reasons, the industry association should first state the reasons and submit a cost calculation table to the competent authority for approval before the change is allowed. Otherwise, it will be regarded as privately raising prices. Therefore, the first step at present is to strictly crack down on illegal hoarding, so that all materials can circulate in the market. The next step is to dredge the sources, which can be said to be addressing both symptoms and root causes.

### Various Banks and Financial Institutions in This City Resume Overdraft Transactions

In order to stabilize finances and assist the government in suppressing prices, the Financial Inspection Department of the Central Reserve Bank restricted all banks and financial institutions last year to recover credit loans within the closing period. After the banks and financial institutions strictly handled the recovery of outstanding debts, most of the previously granted credit accounts have been closed. This year, the banks and financial institutions have also resumed overdraft transactions for closed customers, and the money market seems to be showing signs of loosening. According to sources, almost all of the current overdraft accounts are for production and industrial factories, and the loan targets are industries such as silk and wool weaving, new medicines, chemical raw materials and products, paper making, and tobacco.

### Ministry of Industry Sends Personnel to Investigate Prices

In order to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood, the Ministry of Industry previously convened a price coordination meeting in Shanghai. It has thorough methods for the price control plan. Currently, the ministry is contacting various relevant parties to take concerted action. At the same time, it has sent personnel to various regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces and the two special cities of Nanjing and Shanghai to investigate price conditions and material production conditions, so as to collect and verify information.

### The Issue of Teacher's Exemption from Military Service

Regarding the method of allowing exemption from military service for the self-defense corps, the first district and the eighth district are not very different. In other words, most teachers in the first district are not allowed to be exempted from military service, while teachers in the eighth district are all exempted from military service. In mid-November of last year, the Baojia authorities published exemption regulations, and teachers were also on the list of exemptions. The various joint Bao offices also issued separate notices informing teachers to apply to the Baojia Section for exemption from military service. However, recently, teachers in the former Eighth District are also not allowed to be exempted from military service.

The author is one of the teachers and knows the difficulty of teachers standing guard. I would like to sincerely briefly describe the hardship as follows:

Work Aspect: Teachers are different from ordinary merchants and workers. The work they do is to impart knowledge to the youth and children who most need to cherish their precious time. However, if the time for standing guard is during the day, it will cause dozens of hundreds of students to sit idle for several hours, and the loss cannot be compensated by money. If it is at night, then there is no time to review homework, and too much accumulates, which greatly affects the teaching schedule.

Physical Aspect: Most teachers are physically weak and many have poor eyesight, so they cannot provide much help in guarding. If they are assigned to stand guard at night, their energy will be exhausted, which will inevitably hinder their health. Late sleep and little sleep will affect their spirit the next day.

Economic Aspect: Teachers' salaries are meager. After being assigned to stand guard, if they ask for leave, the school will deduct salary according to the clock hours. If they ask someone to replace them, they have to pay the replacement fee. If they are found out, they will be fined. If they do not stand guard and do not ask someone to replace them, the punishment will be even more severe. With the meager income of teachers, how can they afford this extra expenditure?

Based on these three difficulties, teachers really need to be exempted from serving in the self-defense corps. It is rumored that the reason why teachers have not yet been exempted from military service is that there are many people who pretend to be teachers to apply for exemption. Therefore, we hope that the Shanghai Special City Education Association will follow the example of the Post Office and compile a list of members who have joined the association and teachers who are indeed employed, even if they have not joined, and submit it to the Baojia authorities for approval of exemption from military service. Then all malpractices such as impersonation and bribery can be avoided.

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Yu, translated by Hong Mou

On Naval Academy (3)

It is said that only with a certain kind of spiritual organization and system can there be such a golden tradition. The way can be imagined, but the foundation, when and by whom it was built, the writer doesn't know. Tracing back to the past, it's like being lost in a dense fog.

Looking into the history of this school, the Naval Training Center established in Tsukiji, Tokyo in the second year of Meiji is its origin. Later, it was renamed Naval Academy Preparatory School, then Naval Academy. In the eleventh year of Meiji, it was moved to Etajima, and the first principal was Junyoshi Kawamura, but it is not necessarily he who laid the foundation for this tradition. It is said that the first principal after the relocation to Etajima was Jinnojo Ariji, but that also seems incorrect. At the time of the relocation, all members boarded the steamship Tokyo No. 9 and came to Edajima. Until the school building was completed, education was conducted on the ship. We can imagine that the spirit of pioneering a new world must have been very fervent. At that time, it already possessed the current general traditions. For example, the squadron system already existed in the preparatory school era. The spirit of autonomy was already visible. The program of overturning dinghies originated from quite ancient times. If one asks current admirals and vice admirals, they can only answer that it existed in their time, but they don't know when and by whom it was invented. However, despite having such ancient traditions, the Naval Academy, with its seventy-year history, does not cling to old habits. For example, the "Five Reflections" mentioned in the previous chapter is a course that even people of the current lieutenant commander level do not know about. Writing weekend reflections in workbooks is also a recent practice. Over a long period, there have been various modifications, abolitions, and additions. However, the fundamentals remain unchanged. It's like a large river gathering small streams, growing ever larger.

In short, the Naval Academy's traditions are traditions, but its spirit is perpetually new. From the first principal to the current principal, there has been no one particularly noteworthy or who implemented a major reform. It is constantly innovating in accordance with the times, like adding new oil to a long-burning lamp. In this, we can understand the mysteriousness of tradition and the correct method of maintaining it. There is no need to force the origin of tradition. The origin probably predates the Naval Training Center. However, after becoming a Naval Academy, the main body of tradition's protectors and inheritors, both in the past and present, has always been the students themselves. This must be specially noted. In the early days of the Naval Academy, it followed the example of the United Kingdom, hiring many British teachers including Gross, to learn military affairs. This is indeed a fact, but it was entirely a relationship of employment. The naval authorities at the time had unexpectedly brilliant insights. It's like a singing or Go teacher. Although they are called "teacher," once the lesson is over, there is no further relationship. It was learning "academics," not spirit. Teaching "academics" was only for a very short period. Afterward, they remained at the Naval Academy as language teachers. The last language teacher left Etajima two years ago.

### Master of Xuanze Hall spends 100,000 on Charity Banquet

Master of Xuanze Hall recently completed a villa in West Shanghai. Those who knew him flocked to offer congratulatory gifts. The master, considering the difficult times, did not want to follow the extravagance of the world. He took the money saved from the banquet, totaling 100,000 yuan, and used it for charitable purposes. In addition to donating 20,000 yuan to public welfare projects in his hometown of Nanxiang, he donated 20,000 yuan each to the *Xinwen Bao* Poor Children Relief Fund, the Children's Welfare Institute, the *Shen Bao* Poor Medical Aid Fund, and Pushan Villa. The benevolence and righteousness of the Master of Yize Hall are truly admirable.

### New Pu Yu Hall appeals to all circles

The New Pu Yu Hall, located on Huojia Road in Nanshi, has been providing free care for over 110,000 elderly men and women, the disabled, abandoned infants, and the poor and sick for more than 30 years, and has provided diagnoses and medicines for over 2.4 million people. It currently still cares for over 1,000 people, and as prices soar, expenses have increased dramatically. The monthly food expenses alone require over 600,000 yuan. There is no commission and a lack of funds, relying entirely on donations from all sectors of society to maintain operations. Because funds are running out and there is a risk of going without food, we sincerely appeal to all sectors of society to generously donate funds for the entire year's expenses, and especially hope that major philanthropists can sponsor several needy people for several months. For the convenience of all sectors of society to make contact, starting from March 1st, a branch office will be established at 502 Daxing Road (formerly Route des Soeurs), Eighth District. Office hours are from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM daily. Donation collection points: *Xinwen Bao* and this newspaper's Social Service Department, Silk Industry Bank Trust Department at 460 Hankou Road, Jihuatang Pharmacy at 47 Yunnan Road, Huamei Pharmacy at 356 Fuzhou Road, and the Catholic Church on Yinyangbang Road, or notify the branch office to send someone to collect. Telephone number is 83700.

### Symptoms of Meningitis

Symptoms: This disease has a latent period of three to four days, starting with chills, followed by fever to around 39 degrees Celsius. Traditional Chinese medicine calls it "Spring Warmth Damage Cold." Its special symptoms are headache and stiff neck, so severe that one cannot bend forward or backward, bone pain, vomiting, opisthotonos, coma, and delirium. There are also cases of blurred consciousness and lucidity. The pulse is abnormally fine and rapid, over 100 beats per minute. Breathing is rapid, and the pupils constrict. The tongue coating is thick, greasy, and yellow, initially white and slippery, like the tongue coating of damp-warmth syndrome. Prevention: Isolate patients. Disinfect, for example, the patient's vomit, excrement, sickroom, bedding, utensils, etc. Minimize going to crowded places. Wear a mask when going out. Pay attention to health and nutrition. Eat more radishes and vegetables. Cause: This disease is generally caused by abnormal weather or by latent evil, damp heat, and phlegm stagnation. On the meninges, a stone-salty-juice-like exudate appears, and even the spinal meninges undergo similar changes, and there is a purulent fluid accumulation in the ventricles. This bacterium exists inside cells. Hence the name intracellular diplococcus. Treatment: For this disease, there is spinal puncture, drawing out pus from the spinal canal, injecting serum of this bacterium, and using an ice pillow on the head. However, traditional Chinese medicine mostly adopts "Sang Ju Yin" and "Yin Qiao Ling Yang San," etc. For those with mental confusion and convulsions, enemas and resuscitation and cardiotonic agents such as "Zi Xue," "Zhi Bao Dan," and "An Gong Niu Huang Wan" are also used, all of which are the main special medicines for this disease. In short, both Chinese and Western medicine have their own strengths in treatment. If you see this disease, it is best to seek medical treatment immediately, and do not delay treatment and cause danger. (Bomin)
