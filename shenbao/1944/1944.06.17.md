### Opportunities for Education

We hope that China will succeed as a strong and prosperous nation in the future, and to achieve this, we must first ensure that all our compatriots possess essential knowledge. To ensure that all compatriots have essential knowledge, we must first ensure that all compatriots have access to education. The current school system and student fees have made it impossible for most people to attend school. It is truly disheartening to see so many school-aged children unable to seek education and so many aspiring young people unable to advance. This is the biggest problem facing China's future.

Thanks to the support of our readers, this newspaper has organized scholarship assistance campaigns for six sessions, with the aim of helping students who have dropped out of school. In total, over 15,000 people have been assisted in the six sessions, with over 5.4 million yuan spent. This is entirely due to the great virtue of our readers. Tuition fees increase year by year, so we always feel that the funding is insufficient and that we cannot do as much as we would like each time we organize these campaigns. However, through effort and the assistance of countless readers from all walks of life, we have managed to overcome the difficulties. Therefore, we know that there is unanimous sympathy in society and that all Chinese compatriots are generally enthusiastic about educating the next generation. From this point of view, China certainly holds unlimited hope.

In addition to helping young people attend school, we also regularly monitor their academic performance. As we have said, "Readers donate their hard-earned money, assisted students repay with their hard-earned achievements, and the staff of this newspaper assist with their hard-earned work." We recently organized academic lectures to supplement the extracurricular knowledge of assisted students every Sunday morning at 10 a.m., and to train their note-taking skills and assess their usual academic ability. All assisted students are required to attend at least two lectures and take notes once, but many students voluntarily register to attend four or five times. The second lecture was on Sunday, June 4. That day, there was a strong wind and heavy rain, but not a single assisted student who had registered to attend was absent. Many arrived at the lecture hall as early as 9 a.m. and sat in the front row to facilitate taking notes. The young people that our readers are helping are so eager to learn, so your donations are not in vain. There are still many poor young people in Shanghai society who are quietly studying hard. Can we bear not to help them? When we told our friends about this, many lecturers volunteered to take the time to give one or two more lectures, and many friends volunteered to be lecturers to serve these lovely and aspiring young people. It is truly a case of "those with money contribute money, and those with strength contribute strength." This situation gives us organizers infinite joy and gives us infinite comfort in our hearts.

The scholarship assistance campaign has already gained the sympathy of society and has become the most pressing task at present. Poor young people, do not be afraid of not having the opportunity to be educated. Show your real achievements and your enthusiasm for learning, and society will surely help you. Compatriots, educating the next generation is the main task of our generation. Giving them the opportunity to be educated is the easiest thing we can do, and helping aspiring and impoverished students so that they can advance. The effect of scholarship assistance is ten thousand times greater than anything else. We are willing to do our utmost to promote its success.

The enemy forces attempted to carry out a third landing around noon on the same day, and the local Japanese elite forces are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy. It has been determined that the enemy planes flew from bases in the Marshall Islands, such as the Eniwetok Atoll, passing over the Japanese bases in the Marshall Islands and the strong Japanese bases in Truk and the Carolines. The enemy's strong desire to attack deep into the Marianas is evident, but the entire Japanese nation is united, and our defenses are as solid as iron. We have no fear of the enemy.

The fires caused by enemy bombing have all been extinguished by the morning of the 16th.

Military Facilities Undamaged

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): Of the approximately twenty enemy planes that attacked Kyushu, Japan, today, ten were shot down and destroyed. The enemy suffered a major blow in this operation, while Japanese losses were extremely minor. In an attempt to coordinate with the war in Europe, the enemy announced a counterattack against Japan. The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing had already suffered a miserable defeat with these guerrilla tactics when U.S. planes attacked Tokyo on April 18, Showa 17 (1942). The enemy planes that came this time were shot down by Japanese ground troops. Seven planes were downed by ground forces, and another five were destroyed, eventually burning down on their return route, while Japanese damage was minimal, with only a few deaths and injuries among ground troops. In addition, there was no damage to ground troops and military facilities. Although there were some fires caused by bombing, they were completely extinguished this morning thanks to the united efforts of officials and civilians.

The enemy planes were hindered by Japanese anti-aircraft fire and only bombed a national school outside of Kokura before fleeing. The remaining bombs were mostly dropped in the sea. The number of enemy planes that attacked this time was small, and they were unable to launch a concentrated attack. Therefore, from this perspective, the enemy's attack was only an attempt to disturb the people's morale.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): A dispatch from Seoul reports that the Korean Army announced at 3:30 p.m. on the 16th: Several enemy planes attacked southern Korea around 2 p.m. on the 16th, but we suffered no losses.

Japan Extracts Seabird Guano Deposits

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency): In order to extract 500,000 units of organic phosphate fertilizer, the Hokkaido Agricultural Experiment Station, under the leadership of technician Yamada, organized an inspection team last October to collect seabird guano from five uninhabited islands and analyze it. It was discovered that it contained 10% to 15% phosphoric acid. When experimentally applied to farmland, it had more than double the effectiveness. The guano layer on these five islands is approximately five feet thick, and all is exposed on the surface. It is very close to Hokkaido, and transportation is also convenient. In the coming year, it should be possible to extract half of the pre-war domestic consumption, or 500,000 tons.

### Japanese Troops Crossing the Liuyang River Advance to the Outskirts of Changsha; U.S. and Chongqing Air Forces Suffer Heavy Blows

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): Japanese forces in Central China, on May 27th, launched an offensive operation from both sides of Dongting Lake against the Sixth and Seventh War Zones of the Chongqing government. They broke through the Chongqing army's defensive lines everywhere, entered the area east of Liuyang (60 kilometers east of Changsha, a key point in central Hunan province), inflicted heavy damage on the Ninth War Zone's field units, and surrounded Liuyang, which they are currently attacking fiercely. Another unit of the Japanese army is encircling Changsha from the surrounding areas, attacking the Chongqing defensive forces. In the western Dongting Lake area, Japanese forces, after capturing key points such as Yuanjiang and Yiyang, advanced to the vicinity of Ningxiang, a key point south of Dongting Lake, gradually pressuring the Sixth War Zone army. The Japanese Air Force in China has been coordinating with the ground forces every day, further attacking the forward bases of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, such as Suining, Liangshan, and Enshi, and intercepting any Chongqing planes that move, inflicting heavy damage on them. Between June 1st and 12th, they shot down 21 Chongqing planes and destroyed 68, for a total of 143. In addition, they sank or destroyed 88 boats and ships loaded with soldiers and military supplies. Of particular note was the attack on Suichuan on the 11th, where they destroyed four large aircraft and 18 fighter planes, and destroyed a total of 35 fighter planes. During a surprise attack on the Suichuan airfield on May 12th, they burned more than 45 aircraft and destroyed one Chongqing plane parked at the airfield. Later, it was discovered that the Chongqing army had transported a large number of aircraft to Suichuan again. On the morning of the 11th, they launched a large-scale rapid attack on the area, overcoming the intense anti-aircraft fire of the Chongqing army, breaking into the airfield airspace, and bombing military facilities and important areas, destroying the main force of the Chongqing army before all planes safely returned to base. The Japanese Air Force's fierce offensive in May has almost completely wiped out the U.S. Air Force's ability to operate independently in the skies over China. Since June, they have been seeking assistance from India. Recently, their current number of aircraft is approximately 800, but in just half a month, another 143 have been shot down by Japanese planes. This shows how serious the damage suffered by the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has been. The 88 large and small boats and ships sunk by Japanese planes were the result of battles on the shores of Dongting Lake and the Yangtze River. Due to the massive loss of ships, the Chongqing authorities have suffered a significant blow. It is also reported that eight Japanese planes were self-destructed or failed to return to base in this battle.

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency): A telegram from Chongqing reports that the Chongqing military authorities announced on the night of the 14th: The fighting on the Changsha outer defense line of the Hu'er front is still very fierce. Japanese forces east of the city launched another westward offensive on the 13th and forcibly crossed the Liuyang River. The Chongqing army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with them on the riverbank. At the same time, Japanese forces in Yong'an are also advancing south, attempting to cross the Liuyang River, and began attacking a location ten kilometers northeast of Changsha on the night of the 13th. Both sides are currently engaged in fierce fighting in that area. In the eastern Changsha area, such as the northwest and southeast of Liuyang, fierce fighting is also taking place. Japanese forces in the Yiyang area, after reinforcements arrived on the night of the 13th, immediately attacked Ningxiang and are currently engaged in fighting in the northeast to northwest areas of the city. On the Henan front, Japanese forces advanced west from Daying, attacking Lingbao on the morning of the 11th and then attacking Yuanyang. The Chongqing army launched a counteroffensive on the night of the 12th and fought fiercely until the 13th. Japanese forces in Song County, after reinforcements arrived, began advancing west on the 12th, and the Chongqing army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with them.

Japanese Forces Implement Wave Bombing

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): The air war on the China front is now taking on a new look. Because it is almost impossible to carry out airstrikes during the day, the emphasis is now on nighttime attacks. Therefore, bombing formations are organized at night and take off from their bases to attack each other's bases, leading to fierce night bombing. The elite Japanese forces are well-suited to implement the new tactic of wave attacks. A wave attack means that when attacking an enemy base, one team bombs, and after a short interval, another team bombs, repeatedly attacking, just like the rise and fall of waves. Therefore, during nighttime airstrikes, the flames and forests of the targets hit by the bombs spread in succession, providing the best target for subsequent bomber teams. After one wave attack leaves, the second bombing team repeats the same attack, followed by the third and fourth times to carry out a thorough attack. Due to the ultra-low-altitude wave bombing, the Chongqing and U.S. aircraft in Suichuan, Hengyang, Liangshan, Weiling, and other places have no peace at night and are terrified. This nighttime wave attack tactic, since the beginning of the month, has already destroyed more than 10% of the enemy's air power on its first application. Therefore, U.S. planes are being destroyed by the elite Japanese forces. The Chongqing army's ground artillery has no countermeasures and has no choice but to flee.

Pingjiang Refugees Suffer Tragic Airstrike

Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency): The Japanese rapid forces occupied Pingjiang County, 70 kilometers northeast of Changsha, on the 10th. They immediately began to work to reassure the people, and the number of returning refugees increased daily. On the night of the 2nd, Chongqing and U.S. aircraft blindly dropped bombs on the refugee area of Pingjiang. In particular, six North American B-25 aircraft and sixteen Curtiss P-40 aircraft fiercely bombed the city streets, causing many civilian casualties. Machine gun strafing caused injuries to a large number of elderly people and women who were slow to evacuate. This blind bombing fully reveals the violence of the Chongqing and U.S. Air Forces. The Chinese people are against

### The Industry Ministry Begins Collecting Scrap Metal

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency): The Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage. To crush the Anglo-American ambition to invade, it is necessary for all nations of East Asia to work together. And for the conduct of modern warfare, a sufficient supply of resources is essential, especially the critical need for metals. In light of this, the government Industry Ministry, in April, issued a notice to all provincial and municipal governments ordering them to collect scrap metal and to ensure their subordinates followed the policy. Recently, supplementary measures were drafted to facilitate implementation and were promulgated. The Industry Ministry, as the competent authority for this matter, is reported to have begun collecting scrap metal. So far, it has about 2,000 kilograms of scrap iron, which it will soon donate to the National Government as an example for all provinces and cities. It is hoped that various places will continue to make contributions in the shortest possible time. The quantity will be considerable and will be of great benefit to the recovery of Greater East Asia.

In the first encounter with the aircraft attack, several people were killed or injured. Last night's air raid was more obvious, but there is no detailed report yet. The British side has made the greatest efforts to devise countermeasures."

### Fierce Battles on Both Banks of the Vire River; Successful Counterattacks by Elite German Troops; White Russian Volunteers Join the Battle at the Northern French Front

Central News Agency Dispatch from Stockholm, Sweden, 16th: A Huitong News Agency report from London reveals that the Allied forces are intensifying preparations for a large-scale offensive in France. Fearing that General Montgomery might launch a large-scale offensive first, German General Rommel might strike first with a large-scale counterattack. Currently, fierce battles are raging in the areas of Carentan and Montebourg.

Central News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 16th: A German News Agency report states that after suffering heavy losses, the British army continued its tank assaults on a narrow area on the morning of the 15th, but were repelled. German forces launched a counterattack near Villers-Bocage, making significant advances to the northwest. Tilly remains in German hands. The British forces in the entire area from north of Caumont to Tilly remain on the defensive. American forces attempting to advance from Balleroy towards Saint-Lô used a large number of tanks and motorized artillery units, forming a strong main force to attempt continuous progress. After bitter fighting, they broke through several gaps, but they were soon closed, resulting in the complete failure of their plan to break through to Saint-Lô. The White Russian volunteers fighting in the Carentan area are well-trained and are striving to repel the powerful American advance.

### The Significance of Bridgeheads in Modern Tactics

Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 16th: German authorities have announced the successful link-up of the Allied bridgeheads between the Ona and Vire rivers and the American bridgehead in the southwestern Cotentin Peninsula. A bridgehead is a position that protects a river crossing point, a concept that originated in France during the summer and autumn of 1940. When the German army attacked the Soviet Union, they established bridgeheads. In modern warfare with vast operational scales, a bridgehead represents an operational base. The initial bridgeheads were merely bases for landing operations, commonly referred to as tactical bridgeheads. Later, they became positions for major units equipped with heavy artillery and tanks, thus becoming the bases for subsequent major operations, hence they are also called wartime bridgeheads. The Anglo-American forces' attempt to link up their beachheads on the Cotentin Peninsula aims to transform the peninsula into a wartime bridgehead. Creating this type of bridgehead, although incurring significant losses, contributes greatly to the operation. During the Allied forced landing in Italy in the autumn, the gains at Cassino and Terracina were also due to the establishment of bridgeheads. Establishing a bridgehead often involves close cooperation between the army, navy, and air force. In the current North French campaign, the Allied forces first used bombing and air combat units to attack and cut off the German coastal defenses from their rear lines, isolating them. During the landing, naval forces based on battleships carried out artillery bombardments to cover the landing troops. Therefore, the Allied forces, possessing superior naval strength within the range of naval guns, i.e., within 20 kilometers, had a comparative advantage in establishing bridgeheads.

This recent serious illness almost cost me my life. It's truly a miracle that I'm still alive. However, I only learned about the severity of the situation from the doctor after I recovered. At the time, I had no idea and didn't feel that it was that serious.

This was the third time in my life that I had suffered such a major illness. The first time was when I was about nine years old. At that time, my father was serving as an official in Fujian, and I was living with my mother in the countryside of Yuanling. I can't remember what illness I had then, and even at the time, it wasn't clear what it was. In the countryside, there were no Western doctors, and even Chinese doctors were rare. As for skilled doctors, they were impossible to find. We vaguely sought treatment from unqualified doctors in the countryside for more than a month, but not only did my condition not improve, it worsened day by day. So, I was carried in a sedan chair to relatives' homes in the city to seek out famous doctors. At the time, the only so-called Western doctor was a foreigner at the Gospel Hall. Who would trust this foreign devil? To be honest, that American foreigner probably wasn't a very skilled doctor either. Among our distant relatives was a Zhang, a "bachelor of tribute" (拔貢). He ran a school in the city and practiced medicine on the side. He had a slight reputation as a doctor. So, we asked him to diagnose me. After treating me for about a month, he saved my life. I remember that after I recovered, my father sent back many gifts from Fujian to thank him. I still remember the face and smile of that old Mr. Zhang very clearly. That was the first major illness I had in my life. The second time was in November of the Republic of China Year 17 (1928). At that time, I had just resigned as the director of the political department of the Central Military Academy and had gone to Shanghai to start a new magazine, "New Life Monthly." One day, I was editing manuscripts for the magazine when I suddenly felt a heaviness in my head and body. When I got home, I developed a high fever and had to lie down. I asked Gu Shoubai, a classmate from Japan, to diagnose me. Although he had studied medicine in Japan, he was working as an editor at the Commercial Press at the time and wasn't practicing medicine. He diagnosed me with typhoid fever. Typhoid fever, also known as enteric fever, supposedly has no specific cure and relies entirely on nursing and recuperation. Although we had moved from a shared room in a Shikumen building on Carter Road (卡德路) to a more "modern" residence with sanitary facilities in the Avenue Joffre (霞飛坊), where we lived alone in a lane house, and our life was relatively comfortable, our financial resources didn't allow me to hire a special nurse. All the nursing duties had to be shouldered by Shuhui. It took more than a month before I slowly began to improve. That was the second major illness I had in my life. Both times, I wasn't treated by doctors who specialized in medicine, but by gentlemen who were scholars and doctors. Although it was accidental, it was also quite coincidental.

### After the Illness

— Zhou Fohai

The root of this recent serious illness had been present for several months. Since returning from Japan last November, I had felt tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing. Shuhui was worried and asked a doctor to examine my body with X-rays. According to the doctor, everything was normal and healthy, but my heart was slightly enlarged, although not severely. However, the shortness of breath and tightness in my chest worsened day by day. Friends advised me to rest, and doctors, needless to say, urged me even more strongly. But my body wasn't my own. I didn't have the freedom to rest whenever I wanted. Meetings that needed to be attended couldn't be missed, conferences that needed to be opened couldn't be postponed, official documents that needed to be read couldn't be ignored, words that needed to be said couldn't be left unsaid, and anger that needed to be vented couldn't be suppressed. Among these, the most mentally taxing were speaking and venting anger. Under these circumstances, how could I freely rest? However, I still consulted doctors and took medicine. Some friends said that Western medicine was good, while others believed that Chinese medicine was more effective. I am an impatient person. If Western medicine didn't work in a few days, I would switch to Chinese medicine. If Chinese medicine didn't work in a few days, I would switch back to Western medicine. Sometimes, I would take Western medicine in the morning and Chinese medicine in the afternoon. I went on like this for several months. Fortunately, I could still eat, sleep, and work. It was just that I had shortness of breath, tightness in my chest, and high blood pressure, so I didn't think it was a serious problem.

On March 4th, I suddenly caught a cold, with a headache, stuffy nose, and general discomfort. It was even worse on the 5th. But I didn't stop working because of it. Not only did I continue to work as usual, but also, because of an important event that was about to happen, I had to go to Shanghai. I took the night train to Shanghai that night and caught a cold again while working. On the 6th and 7th, I was busy for two days. On the evening of the 7th, I had a severe cough that lasted for hours, until I finally fell asleep around 4 a.m. It was scheduled for me to fly to Nanjing on the afternoon of the 8th, so I still went out to handle some business at 9 a.m. However, the cough was slightly less severe than the previous night. At 1 p.m., I went to the airport, but because it was raining in Nanjing, the flight was canceled, so I took the afternoon train back to Nanjing. After returning to Nanjing, the shortness of breath and tightness in my chest were still present, but the cough had decreased significantly. Therefore, I didn't pay much attention to it and continued to be active as usual. On March 12th, it was the memorial service for Premier Sun Yat-sen, and I went to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. The night before, I had agreed with Chen Gongbo to leave early because it was difficult to walk uphill, and it would be inconvenient if everyone arrived at the same time. It was best to take advantage of the fact that no one had arrived yet so that we could walk slowly. I got up at 7 a.m., put on my new Zhongshan suit, and drove to the mausoleum. Unexpectedly, Chen Gongbo had already gone up early. I slowly climbed the steps. My shortness of breath didn't increase, and I didn't feel tired. I comforted myself, "My body is still not bad." After the memorial service, we had to go to pay respects to the revolutionary martyrs. When going downhill, Chen Gongbo and I walked ahead, followed by a large group of officials. Everyone was walking quickly, and we were in front, so we couldn't slow down even if we wanted to. So, we ran down the hillside as fast as we could, took a car to Gegu Temple, and after getting out of the car, we ran back and forth in front of the crowd. I was sweating all over, and when a cold wind blew, I felt like I couldn't hold on after returning home, so I had to lie down. Coincidentally, that day was Sunday, and I could rest for the afternoon. On the morning of the 13th, although the cough came and went, it didn't get worse. In the morning, I went to the Ministry of Finance and the Central Reserve Bank to handle some business as usual. In the afternoon, I convened a meeting of the Materials Control Review Committee. These meetings usually took a long time, often starting at 3 p.m. and lasting until after 7 p.m. That day, I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to hold on, so I secretly planned that if I really couldn't make it midway, I could ask another member to take over as chairman, and I could sneak away to rest. Fortunately, the meeting only lasted for two hours before it ended, and I went home, but I was already exhausted. Soon after returning home, Ambassador Tani called, hoping to meet. I really couldn't receive guests, so I scheduled a meeting for 11 a.m. the next morning at the Central Reserve Bank. I planned to go to the Central Reserve Bank to meet with him after the Executive Yuan meeting was over the next day. That night, my cough worsened, and I barely slept all night. When I attended the Executive Yuan meeting the next morning, my limbs were very weak, and I could barely speak when reading the proposals. After the meeting, I went to the Central Reserve Bank to talk with Ambassador Tani, of course, with great difficulty. Seeing that my spirits were not good, he only talked for half an hour before leaving. Since returning to Nanjing on the 8th, many friends had said that Chinese medicine was better for colds and coughs, so I consulted two Chinese medicine doctors. Of course, Chinese medicine doctors don't use thermometers to measure temperature, and I myself was confused and didn't measure it either, and I didn't believe that I would have a fever. On the afternoon of the 14th, I took a thermometer and measured it myself, and it turned out that I had a fever of over 38 degrees. Then I knew I was really sick. The psychological effect is really amazing! When I didn't know I had a fever, I was casual and didn't take the illness seriously. Once I knew I had a fever, I immediately felt that my cough and illness had worsened, and I couldn't help but take it seriously. I had originally planned to go to Shanghai on the 16th, but now I decided to cancel it and called Shuhui, asking her to come to Nanjing immediately. In the evening, my cough really got worse, and it didn't stop for more than three minutes. Anxiously, I went to ask Dr. Tsuchiya, the director of the Tongren Hospital. He had treated me for illnesses before. This time, because it was just a small cold and cough, I didn't want to bother such a busy doctor. But now I had to ask him. Coincidentally, he wasn't at home that night, and he hadn't left his whereabouts, so his family couldn't find him either. I coughed all night, without stopping. On the morning of the 15th, he came, and after examining me, he didn't say a word, and his face was worried. I asked him if I could recover within a week. He lightly said that it would probably take more time. He came to see me again in the afternoon. That night, my condition seemed to worsen further. I heard that Shuhui was taking the night train to Nanjing that night and would arrive the next morning. My mind was a little unclear. It seemed that Shuhui had come, and it seemed that Tsuchiya had come to examine me again. Soon after, it seemed that there were three or four people in yellow military uniforms and several nurses in white standing around my bed. I felt that they were very busy. They put a frame on my bed to take an X-ray. When they were taking it, they asked me to stop breathing, and I actually stopped. After a long time, I felt a tall man in military uniform say to me: "Please rest quietly, don't move around. The nurses will stay and take care of you." Later, I learned that Dr. Tsuchiya, seeing that my illness was too serious, didn't dare to make a decision on his own, so he went to consult with the chief medical officer of the Japanese military commander. The chief medical officer, Lieutenant General Momoi, accompanied Dr. Tsuchiya and brought two military doctors and two nurses to treat me. Later, I also heard that they had discussed for a long time whether to be hospitalized or at home. Each had its advantages and disadvantages. In the end, they decided to stay at home. They took turns coming three times a day, morning, afternoon, and evening, and left two nurses to serve me. Later, because two people were too busy, they added another person. The tall officer who spoke to me was Lieutenant General Momoi. Later, everyone talked about it, and they all thought that it was lucky that this illness broke out in Nanjing. If it had broken out in Shanghai, I was afraid that I would have lost my life! Because in Shanghai, there would definitely be many people talking at once. You would say that one doctor is good, and he would say that another doctor is good. A would recommend a Chinese medicine doctor, and B would recommend a Western medicine doctor. In a medical emergency, people would seek medical help indiscriminately and take medicine indiscriminately, which would inevitably lead to failure!

It turned out that my illness this time was lobar pneumonia, combined with heart disease. It came on fiercely. After Lieutenant General Momoi treated me for a few days, he didn't dare to make a decision on his own, so he reported to the Japanese Embassy and telegraphed Tokyo to specially invite a famous doctor to China for treatment. The Japanese army authorities and the Ministry of Greater East Asia discussed it and invited Professor Sakaguchi, a heart and blood vessel disease expert at Tokyo Imperial University, to fly to Nanjing immediately. Because of the weather, they couldn't fly for two or three days. It wasn't until the 23rd that they arrived in Nanjing for diagnosis and treatment. Fortunately, during these few days, my condition had stabilized, hadn't worsened, and the fever had decreased slightly. Momoi and Tsuchiya were both Sakaguchi's students, so although there were three doctors, their opinions were easily unified. There was no problem of someone insisting on their own opinion or someone being polite and not expressing their opinion. The three of them expressed their opinions as much as possible, and then Sakaguchi made a conclusion, so this was also a reason why this serious illness was successfully cured. Otherwise, if everyone had their own opinions, I'm afraid they wouldn't even be able to prescribe a prescription.

### After the Reorganization of the Commerce and Trade Control Commission, the Organization Will Be Adjusted; Plans to Establish a Daily Necessities Control Commission

In order to strengthen the control of materials, the National Government reorganized the National Commerce and Trade Control Commission, and officially issued an order to appoint Wen Huaisha as the chairman and transferred Ku Shoutong, the former chairman, to the position of supervisor. The internal organization of the Commerce and Trade Control Commission will be streamlined to undertake the task of guiding and supervising all material control tasks. It will serve as a research, planning, and comprehensive organization. Its major material sectors will be directly under the Executive Yuan and reorganized into control committees. Currently, the Commerce and Trade Control Commission has received orders to begin the handover, preparing for the new leadership to take over.

Internal Adjustment

After the reorganization of the commission, the internal organizational structure will be adjusted because the major material sectors are all directly under the Executive Yuan. Therefore, it has been decided to reduce the scope and merge the original five departments, namely the General Affairs Department, the Association Affairs Department, the Finance Department, the Materials Department, and the Audit Department, into three departments: General Affairs, Materials, and Audit. The position of chief secretary under the council will be abolished and replaced with a graded secretary system. Several groups will be established under the three departments.

Material Control

The flour, wheat, oil, grain, and sugar professional committees, which originally belonged to the foreign organizations of the Commerce and Trade Control Commission, have been reorganized into the Flour and Wheat Control Commission by the government, and Sun Zhongli has been specially appointed as the director. The Oil and Grain Professional Committee will also be reorganized into a control committee. However, in order to centralize control, the authorities may merge it into the Flour and Wheat Control Commission in September. The Cotton Industry Management Office, which was organized under the Commerce and Trade Control Commission, will be merged into the Cotton Control Commission and reorganized into the Cotton Industry Control Commission. The Sugar Industry Professional Committee will be reorganized into the Sugar Industry Control Commission. It is said that in order to complete all material control, the government plans to establish a Daily Necessities Control Commission to implement control over matches, soap, candles, and other daily necessities, centralizing production and consumption. It is internally determined that Li Zufan will be the chairman. Although the above control committees are directly under the Executive Yuan, they are subject to the guidance, supervision, research, and planning of the Commerce and Trade Control Commission.

Wen's Remarks

A reporter from the Central News Agency visited the newly appointed Chairman Wen Huaisha to inquire about the date of taking office and his aspirations for future material control. He said that Chairman Ku Shoutong is ready to end his mission and will take over immediately. There will be no changes in personnel, because the staff of the past Commerce and Trade Control Commission have been able to competently handle everything with their service spirit and talent. As for the future task of material control, it will require the cooperation of all directors, supervisors, and relevant authorities. He (Wen Huaisha referring to himself) is not one to talk much, but his ambition is to do things successfully.

### The Rice Control Commission Submits a Petition to the Executive Yuan to Facilitate the Collection and Transportation of Rice

Rice and Grain Limited to Area A

The source of rice in the city has been relatively abundant in recent days, and the market price has slightly declined. The authorities have submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan to order the provincial governments to instruct their subordinates to facilitate rice merchants in collecting and transporting rice from various places, regarding transportation and procurement. The number of ordinary citizens applying for temporary certificates from the Rice and Grain Control Commission is overwhelming, and rice carried into the city by porters is constantly on the way.

Facilitating Procurement

It is said that local authorities in various places seem to be restricting the export of rice purchased by rice merchants in this city. The Rice and Grain Control Commission has petitioned the Executive Yuan to request the governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to instruct their subordinates to facilitate rice merchants holding the commission's passports without any restrictions, so as to make adjustments smoothly.

Important Notice for Obtaining Certificates

Since the free transportation of rice and grain of five dou or more and ten dan or less has been approved, the number of ordinary citizens going to the Rice Control Commission to apply for temporary transportation permits is extremely crowded. In order to facilitate citizens in applying for temporary permits, the commission's procurement department has formulated several points that applicants must pay attention to and announced them to the public: * Those who come should strictly observe order according to the order of arrival and must not rush ahead. * They should present their citizen ID card for verification in order to issue the permit. * Rice and grain are limited to Area A, that is, Suzhou, Wujiang, Songjiang, Kunshan, Changzhou, Wuxi, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Jinshan, and Taicang areas, and the suburbs of this city. * Each certificate requires a stamp tax of one yuan. * At the end of the certificate period, it must be returned to the commission on time. * The amount of food prepared by citizens for themselves must not exceed three months per capita. All citizens who obtain temporary rice and grain transportation permits must fill in the details on the form, including their name, ID card number, address, rice and grain type, quantity, place of departure, and place of arrival, and submit them together with their citizen ID card. They can pick up the entry permit the afternoon of the following day.

### South Seas Cultural Relics Exhibition Closes Today

The Sino-Japanese Cultural Association and the East Asia Transportation Company jointly held a South Seas Scenery Colored Photo Exhibition on the third floor of the Wheeler & Co. store on Nanjing Road, displaying dozens of scenic task photos of the South Seas Islands, Java, Shonan Island, Thailand, Annam, etc., which were full of beautiful things. The East Asia Transportation Company sent personnel to the venue to greet visitors and sell magazines such as "East Light," "Sunrise," and the Japanese National Book "Japanese History" and "Japanese National Character." It is reported that the exhibition is scheduled to close at 4:30 p.m. today (17th). All circles are welcome to visit.

### The Path Forward for Chinese Youth

— Yuusong Entai

Delivered on the 6th of this month at the National Shanghai University

Promoting Eastern Morality

I have repeatedly told you all to awaken the classical spirit of China; but that is not just advising everyone to study Confucianism and Buddhism, but rather to first use that spirit to nurture yourselves. It is better to respect morality than to respect politics. Even those who study science and technology must first practice the ways of the sages and wise men of Chinese tradition. It is more important to cultivate oneself than to pursue shortcuts to fame. Eastern morality starts with self-cultivation and family management, and expands to governing the country and bringing peace to the world. How can one eliminate the thieves in one's heart if one cannot subdue the thief within? It is good to have a spirit of integrity. How can China be placed as securely as Mount Tai without young people who are as content with poverty as Yan Hui? A spirit of impartiality and selflessness is indispensable. It is very important to not only consider one's own interests, but to dedicate oneself to the local community, society, and the nation.

Fifteen hundred years ago, the Japanese people, who learned the "ways of the gentleman, sage, and wise man" from China, did not put it on a bookshelf, but practiced it in their daily lives. Of course, there are also very noble gentlemen in China. As for university students and youth, I dare to say that Japanese youth seem to be slightly better at practicing this. The young students in my country know even better how to respect the elderly and have the beautiful tradition of respecting teachers and elders, which has not changed at all. Although there was a dangerous period when they were temporarily influenced by Europeanization, they have returned to their previous state in the past ten years. How can China have a bright future without such pure,廉減, selfless, and courteous youth? 正州感, political conscience, and the spirit of loving the people are the roots of the Three Principles of the People. Although the principles have been widely spread, it is not easy to put them into practice. This is what I expect from all of you Chinese.

Of course, I know that you are not in a good environment, so I must also consider that adhering to such outdated justice and integrity cannot lead to success. But I believe that one must first be true to one's own conscience and uphold one's own integrity, and then the driving force of the new China can emerge. If upright elementary school students, pure middle school students, and impartial and selfless university students are soon mixed up among corrupt officials after graduation, how can China have a bright future if this situation does not change? What I earnestly hope from you all is to cultivate noble morality. It is better to respect people of virtue than to respect power and wealth. One should distinguish between hypocrisy and true goodness, and should respect those who are content with poverty and engage in various pursuits. Who should you respect today? This question is probably still unresolved. I believe that one should respect those who have no land left after their death, and those who suffer with the people, and become one of them, so that China can be saved.

Japanese education is centered on absolute devotion to the Imperial Family. But it also offers many figures that can be respected. Who should Chinese youth respect now? Confucius, Mencius, Zhuge Liang, and Sun Yat-sen are all acceptable, but one should clarify one's own goals. Of course, I also consider Mr. Wang, who is currently alive in China, to be great. Surely some of you have a target of respect in your minds? However, when it comes to Chinese youth, it seems that there are not many figures in their hearts who can be respected. They seem to have a particular taste for judging the merits of people. However, students must first respect their teachers, and lower-classmen should imitate what their teachers and superiors do. That is the original classical spirit of China. It is absolutely forbidden to be misled by the freedom of European and American thought. One should approach and strive to be equal to the respected figures that one has in mind, which is called "seeing a virtuous person and thinking of becoming equal to them." Instead of reading political science, it is better to read the biographies of gentlemen, sages, and wise men of ancient and modern times.

You have probably also heard such talk of moral cultivation from foreign missionaries of Christian churches? I am grateful for these devoted missionaries who have been cultivated in China. However, unfortunately, they are neither Chinese nor Easterners after all. Therefore, Chinese youth naturally respect foreign figures. It is the sin of adults to regard Eastern gods as inferior. In terms of such morality, the East is even more noble. The money used to send those missionaries who promote morality comes from exploiting the surplus of China. Now, thanks to this war, we are fortunate to be able to secure the freedom of thought for the East. People, whether from their own perspective or from their thoughts, this pseudo-East is far superior to the West. The evidence of this superiority is the ten years of the Great East Asia War.

Japan is in an interesting position. It is a country where Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shintoism are harmoniously integrated. Buddhism is Indian civilization, Confucianism is Chinese civilization, and Shintoism is the original thought of Japan. Today, the one billion people of Greater East Asia can be broadly divided and colored by the above three civilizations. However, these three civilizations all have a history of three to five thousand years, and they can also harmonize with each other without contradiction. Japan is a good example of its harmonization. Perhaps these one or two civilizations, along with the progress of the Greater East Asia War leading to its victorious conclusion, will create a "Greater East Asia Civilization." Today, the task of your scholarship should be to take this "Greater East Asia" as the object. One should deeply understand this "Chinese of Greater East Asia." Of course, Western knowledge cannot be forgotten for reference. But its main goal must be replaced by "Greater East Asia." This is the task of your scholarship? As I said just now, I am a specialist in Buddhist studies. If I were to give an example of Buddhism, Buddhism originated in India and became Northern Buddhism, Mahayana Buddhism in the Western Regions, China, Mongolia, Manchuria, Korea, and Japan; and it originated in India and spread to Burma, Thailand, Annam, Sumatra, Java, mostly Southern Buddhism, Theravada Buddhism, and naturally there are also places where Theravada Buddhism is mixed. Although Buddhism has spread throughout the region in this way, its central idea does not change at all. That is "the negation of one's own mind," that is, the fundamental historical significance of selflessness. "Selfless devotion to public service," as well as the central ideas of Confucianism and Taoism, are thus intertwined. Therefore, we can come into contact with the commonality of the spirit of Greater East Asia. "What is the Eastern spirit?" This is the topic for you all in the future. If I were to answer this question in detail here, I am afraid it would diminish your interest. So I just want to say a few things that you can refer to.

The common spirit of the East starts with "harmony," a great harmony of synthesis. The predecessors of Chinese Buddhism also called it "roundness" and "center." The negation of self-interest is the central idea, so the way of thinking about things is not analytical. Whether it is rights or obligations, discussions that shirk responsibility are not suitable. Whether doing good or bad deeds, it is everyone's responsibility. This is the saying of "one body," "one suchness," "non-duality," and "interpenetration." China's chaos is the responsibility of Japan. It is an exchange of gratitude and任.尚 cannot be placed on the cold analytical theory like Western thought. Truth is beyond analysis, and the reality of life cannot be expressed in words. There is the intuitive world of the East. There is the gentle handshake of the peoples of Greater East Asia. In the past five thousand years, this sphere of co-prosperity of thought has already existed, and it is only today that it has become apparent. You should learn this Eastern spirit. There are many things I want to say to the beloved Chinese youth. But today I have really made you sit here for too long. I would like to leave many words for the next time. The above are just three or four kinds that I came up with by chance, and they only express my frank and unadorned hopes. In the future, I hope that China and Japan, these two 業 souls, will become even closer. My own eldest son has already graduated from university, so today I feel like I am talking to my eldest son's friends. Your path ahead is fraught with danger. Knowing this difficult future, I hope that you will first learn about Greater East Asia, first learn about Japan, and especially learn about the five thousand years of Chinese culture, to know why the stone Buddha at 　門　岡 is so valuable, and hope to recreate Chinese culture in the modern era. Finally, I wish you all good health (End)

### Director Matsushima Explains the Pacific War Situation

And refutes enemy exaggerations

The Press Department of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, as usual, invited Chinese reporters at 2 PM yesterday. Director Matsushima explained the Pacific war situation and the invasion operations of British and American forces in 默洲 as follows. . Japanese mainland air defense is tight

First, the US Department of the Army issued a Washington telegram on the 15th, stating that the 20th Bombardment Squad of the US Army had bombed the Japanese mainland with　　-type bombers. According to the announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters this morning, US aircraft had bombed 北九州　. It probably refers to this. When the US　　-type aircraft were discovered in China. I had long known of its plan to invade the Japanese mainland. 北九州 is heavily guarded, and the enemy has not succeeded at all, but has been shot down. The United States has repeatedly used the shame of retaliating against Pearl Harbor　 as a reason to agitate the people. This kind of agitation is extremely vague, especially in nighttime air　, and has no effect. Not only does it cause no damage to Japan, but it also increases the Japanese people's hatred of the enemy. It gives the Japanese a good result in completing the war. The 太人 is very happy that the war is becoming more and more heated. Inward operations wait for the enemy

Second, regarding the battle situation in the 寒班 area, the United States　 has reported that the US Pacific Fleet has landed, but Japan does not recognize this. The operation in this area is extremely important. As far as Japan is concerned, it can lure the enemy to the inner line, which is Sun Tzu's so-called "waiting for the enemy to be exhausted." Therefore, the enemy can come to the Japanese mainland, so don't　 panic. It can make us happy. The truth about the operation will be announced in detail later, but the enemy's exaggeration is too great. Although the surprising numbers it fabricates are a consistent method of the enemy, we must also pay attention to it. For example, Reuters claimed on June 13 that 13 Japanese warships were sunk and 16 were 系破 near the Mariana Islands. In fact, Japanese warships were not acting there at that time. Its eunuch-like propaganda method is just a Chaplin-style comedy style.

Thoroughly practice wartime life

Third, the enemy is anxious because of the lack of effectiveness of the invasion operations in Europe, so it hopes to expand propaganda in the Pacific to attract the attention of the world, especially to　 rope in the hearts of the Chinese people. But the war situation will become more and more serious in the future. Even in Shanghai, no matter when, encountering an air raid　 will not cause obstacles. If there is such preparation, we must eliminate all luxurious habits and thoroughly treasure practice wartime life in order to achieve the ultimate victory. German troops operate smoothly in Northern France

Fourth, it has been eleven days since the British and American troops landed in Europe. As of the current situation, the British and Canadian troops have created a bridgehead from the west bank of the 奥纳 River to the vicinity of the 維爾 River. In addition, American troops, centered on parachute troops, have also created a bridgehead in a certain area east of 瑟堡. The center of the fierce battle is in 克恩, 巴猶, 卡倫坦 and other places. The deepest bridgehead is only forty public feet. All places are subject to fierce counterattacks by the German army. The British and American forces are still in a difficult situation. The German army is calmly fighting in the lower reaches of the 維爾 River and using flood tactics and air battles to give the enemy a major blow. The German army is fighting calmly and is progressing extremely smoothly, and has great confidence. A total of thirty divisions of British and American troops have completed the landing, including the most elite British and American troops. This is probably its main force. In addition, there are several reserve teams of twenty divisions. It is quite an interesting question where they will land from. According to enemy propaganda, there seems to be a plan to land in southern France or the Balkans. American destroyers sailed to the Adriatic Sea the day before yesterday, but judging from the current situation, the current battlefield in northern France is probably the main battlefield in the future. The fate of Britain and the United States in the future is probably decided here. The enemy's recent goal is to seize the port of 瑟堡, but it has been two weeks since the landing and it has not yet reached a place close to the port of 瑟堡. I believe that the German army can seize this opportunity to give the enemy another Dunkirk-like blow.

### Reader Aid News

Donation of 5,000 Yuan for Scholarship Donated Portrait of Zhong Jinshi The Taibao Reader Scholarship Office received twenty-five 朱印 portraits of Zhong Jinshi from Shengde Charity Society yesterday. They were printed by Lingxue Society, drawn by Da Gong　, and inscribed by Wang Yiting. The printing is exquisite and cannot be viewed too often. The letter from the society stated: "Aiding scholarship is a human obligation. Those with money give money, those with goods donate goods, and everyone does their best. We respectfully offer the portrait of Zhong　 to those who donate 5,000 yuan to the scholarship fund as a souvenir." It is approaching the Dragon Boat Festival, and obtaining this precious item is enough to decorate the festival and is a timely good story.

Understanding students exempts them from pasting photos

According to the application form,　 attach a photo of a wooden man and a cow body for verification. Although the student certificates issued this time have been carefully considered and based on the standard of 5% of the students in each school, there are still more than 8,000 copies. Sticking thousands of photos is a considerable number. The office now understands that for the sake of 淸塞 students, it has decided to exempt them from pasting photos and use the student's residence identity card to distinguish the authenticity. In special circumstances, those who have not yet obtained the identity　 must still paste photos. However, students who have passed the old test and are approved must submit a half-length photo of two and a half inches when receiving the scholarship for verification. (Old students who received assistance in the previous session only need to submit their old registration certificates. The office will retrieve the original photos and attach them.

China Youth Defeated West Youth in the Final

The basketball charity tournament for scholarships organized by this newspaper, with the enthusiastic support of all sectors of society, has achieved outstanding results and was successfully concluded. In yesterday's final competition, China and West Youth met again. Both sides went all out to perform a stimulating and tense match. The score fell sharply. As a result, China Youth relied on its average talent to win the final victory. The result was 25 to 20, with the first half being 13 to 11. Yesterday, in order to enhance the interest of the competition, the winners of the men's bodybuilding competition, Liu　庵, Huang Hui, and Mao Guan　, were specially invited to perform muscle demonstrations during the rest period, allowing viewers to correct their past aesthetic concepts, with profound implications. After the basketball game, the president of Taibao, Chen, presented awards. China Youth and West Youth each received a large silver cup as a souvenir.

The war situation is tense and the battle has begun. China Youth sent a mixed team of Zhang Xian　, Fan Qinggong, Wu Chengzhang, Qu Xilin, and Ma Canxi to fight. In the battle of command, Qu Xilin opened the record with a long shot. At the end of the first half, China Youth led by 13 to 11. In the second half, West Youth replaced 奥柴辽 with 凯捷密洛夫, while China Youth still played with the original team. However, China Youth always led by two or three points. Fan Qinggong　 Xilin succeeded in scoring, and West Youth fouled again.陶勃林基 was sent off four times, resulting in a score of 25 to 20, and China Youth won the victory.

### After Illness

Proper care was also a reason for this recovery. The three nurses were truly conscientious and responsible, serving shifts day and night. Especially Nurse Zhongdao, the head nurse, was even more meticulous and kind. When the illness was severe, she was so anxious that she couldn't even eat. When the condition eased, she looked happy. Not only me personally, but my whole family is very grateful to them. Because of them, many people in the family, including Zi Shu, were spared a lot of trouble. They nursed me until May 1st before bidding farewell and returning to the hospital.

When the illness was severe, of course, visitors were strictly forbidden. Even after it eased, ordinary people were still not allowed to see me. When friends like Gongbo came, they could only exchange a few words. After April 2nd, I was able to discuss important matters with Gongbo on the bed. After the 3rd, I was allowed to read the newspaper.

Dr. Sakaguchi, seeing that I had passed the danger period, came specifically on April 5th to say goodbye, saying that he was busy in Tokyo and planned to go to Shanghai on the 6th and fly back on the 7th. After the last treatment, he told me that it was a miracle that I didn't die this time. Because for people with pneumonia, breathing 40 times per minute or more

(Continued on Second Edition) is already dangerous. If it reaches 50 times or more, death is inevitable. And for three days, I reached 62 or 63 times! Now that the pneumonia has subsided, the heart is still not healthy, so he also told me many ways to recuperate after the illness. When he passed by Shanghai, he went to see Gongbo and said that my recovery this time was not due to the doctors' efforts, but to my luck. He asked Gongbo to tell me that luck can only happen once, and he hoped that I would pay special attention in the future. This old man in his sixties flew back and forth for me, and I felt really uneasy.

Afterwards, I improved day by day. Although the illness relapsed twice, causing everyone to be nervous twice, it quickly subsided. So I practiced sitting up in bed, practicing getting out of bed and walking, practicing eating dry rice, and my spirits improved day by day. The doctor used to come three times a day, but after April 1st, he came twice a day, and after the 7th, he only came once a day. Every time he treated the area below my right rib, both Momoi and Tsuchiya were very serious, and I felt very suspicious in my heart. It wasn't until April 23rd that Tsuchiya told me that there was a phenomenon of pleurisy under my right rib, but he didn't dare to tell me before. It wasn't until the 20th that he couldn't hear any signs of pleurisy.

Seeing the nurse open the screen window, many willow catkins flew in, and I suddenly felt that spring was ending. Asking the nurse to help me to the window, I saw that the garden was already covered with brocade grass and green leaves, and the branches were full of fruit. This year's beautiful scenery of peach blossoms and green willows, I spent in bed, unable to enjoy it, and I truly wasted the great spring.

Friends all came to congratulate me, saying that those who survive a great disaster are bound to have good fortune in the future. In fact, whether my survival this time is fortunate or unfortunate is still a question. Perhaps heaven does not allow me to easily escape the sea of ​​suffering, but wants me to suffer more tribulations and disasters in the sea of ​​suffering before letting me leave this turbid world. Perhaps heaven does not allow me to die peacefully in my sleep, but will inevitably make me die tragically or unnaturally in the future, which is also unpredictable. I remember around 1931 or 1932, Yang Chang (Yongtai) and Xiong Shihui were summoned to fly from Shanghai to Ganzhou. Just after taking off, they crashed to the ground. Both of them were seriously injured and had to be treated for several months before they could recover. When I saw Changqing, I also congratulated him with the words "those who survive a great disaster are bound to have good fortune in the future." He thought that these words were unreliable and told me about an incident in his hometown in Guangdong. An old man lived by a river. One night, a mountain flood broke out, and the house collapsed. The old man lay on a bed board and floated for dozens of miles before being rescued. In less than half a year, he went out to relieve himself at night, accidentally fell into a manure pit, and died as a result. The old man did not die in the clear stream, but died in the manure pit, so the previous survival cannot be said to be fortunate. Changqing, who told this story, later held great power in the headquarters of the three provinces to suppress Zhang, and was powerful for a while, but in the end he was assassinated in Hankou and died by gunshot. I never hope for good fortune. At a time when the flames of war are spreading all over the world, no one should hope to enjoy good fortune. Moreover, when the people are trapped in dire straits, it is not the intention of a benevolent person to hope for personal happiness. I should consider that I have already died this time. The me from now on is no longer my me. Therefore, from now on, I can ignore success or failure, benefit or loss, praise or criticism, and based on my own beliefs, be loyal to the country and work hard for the nation, so as not to fail this remaining life.

Post-illness notes record this experience as a future memento. May 26th (Reprinted from "Ancient and Modern Semi-Monthly", Issue 49)

Naval Painter (2)

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyo, translated by Hong Yang

(Even if I can't become a wealthy family and a painter, I don't want to.)

After deciding on this mindset, Tatsuo's daily life was even more like an artist than before, but he himself didn't feel it.

He worked very hard. When he couldn't go out to sketch, he studied the naval paintings of his predecessors. However, as the painter Ichiki said, the small number of marine painters in Japan is surprising. It can even be said that there is not even one marine painter today. He admired the works of the deceased painter Kanji Maeda, "The Sea," but he was greatly disappointed to find that he was not a marine specialist painter. As a result, he believed that the only painter worthy of the name was Taro Tojo. The painter Tojo likes to depict warships and sea battles, which is exactly what Tatsuo intended.

During this period, he learned about a foreign marine painter. It began with finding the book "Marine Painter" in the Maruzen store. He was so happy that he danced with joy, and gazed at the color plates and photos with his eyes glued to them. In the paintings, there were collections of works by many painters such as Hermel and Veley of England, and Bergen of Germany. In the album, there were very subtle waves and clouds, yachts and merchant ships, and majestic warships. Problems that Tatsuo found most difficult, such as the advancing posture of the warship's bow, the wave-cutting posture, and the trailing waves of the warship's stern, were now easily solved one by one. Extremely sensitive to the sea, and if the knowledge of ships and warships is not accurate, then it is impossible to draw ships. When he read the introduction at the end of the volume, he realized that none of these writers had the experience of ordinary painters. Bergen was the captain of a submarine. The painter Wilkinson was the inventor of naval camouflage. Because they have such rich naval knowledge, they are the first to feel the beauty of the latest cruisers, and they must write more accurately than anyone else.

(Ordinary hard work is not enough.)

Tatsuo gradually understood the essence of hard work, and gradually understood the basis of work. He was a little uneasy in his heart about how difficult it was to become a marine painter. If he didn't study a specialized and more in-depth painting field, he would always feel sorry.

(Yes, although I have never been on a warship, I still want to depict warships. Because I didn't become a maritime officer, I paint sea battles.)

The final decision has been made. He realized that he wanted to become a naval painter.

Therefore, he often went to Yokosuka. This was in order to study and refine the types of various boats and ships, the spirit and actions of naval personnel. At the same time, in order to be able to draw warships, he bought a "Warship Photo Album," and in order to study the explosion of mines and shells and water columns, he repeatedly went to see the demonstration films of the US Navy. When he understood the essence of modern naval warfare, he had to study submarines and planes again.

Tatsuo continued to work hard without resting for a day. Two years passed like this. (101) Li Amao's Hygiene Mailbox
