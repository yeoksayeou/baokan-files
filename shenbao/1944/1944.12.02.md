Mr. Wang devoted all his efforts to seeking the freedom and independence of China and the liberation of East Asia. It is truly regrettable that he passed away before this great cause was completed. I firmly believe that while Mr. Wang's physical body has passed, his spirit will endure. Now that Mr. Wang has passed, the Chinese people, especially those under the severe rule of the government in Chongqing, should awaken. Mr. Wang died for the sake of saving China and liberating East Asia. Although the greatest leader of China, Mr. Wang Jingwei, has passed away, his comrades Chen Gongbo, Zhou Fohai, and patriotic individuals will bravely move forward.

Editorial

### Winter Relief

Yesterday, the westerly wind was piercingly cold, and the weather turned frigid. Everyone added warm clothes, but they still shivered and called out for warmth. However, let us close our eyes and imagine what will happen to our compatriots who have no warm clothes to add? This year, prices have unexpectedly continued to soar. Most poor families are without clothes or food, which is more widespread than in previous years. Those who are generally sleeping on the streets, struggling in the cold wind and howling, are even more miserable. How can we, who are fortunate enough to have warm clothes and full stomachs, not have sympathy and compassion for these compatriots?

The expression of sympathy and compassion is nothing more than donating what one can afford, giving clothes to those who have none, and providing congee to those who have no food. However, instead of doing this work in a piecemeal and fragmented way, it is better to do it in a centralized and holistic way, which is more universal and effective. In other words, it should be led and presided over by the government, raising funds, coordinating all efforts, and utilizing the skilled personnel of charitable organizations to carry out relief work. At the same time, the general public should donate what they can afford. Therefore, it is now an urgent time for the government to launch winter relief.

According to reliable information, the municipal government has decided to form a winter relief committee to handle this year's winter relief efforts. At the same time, this year's winter relief efforts have two noteworthy characteristics, which are gratifying. The first is sufficient funding. It is said that the authorities have decided on a relatively large amount of funding for winter relief and are confident in raising the funds. The second is sufficient personnel. It is said that the winter relief staff will be selected from the various charitable organizations in the city that have achieved relatively good results, temporarily transferring experienced personnel. Winter relief is an annual routine task, and this year's winter relief has these two characteristics, which are naturally more advanced than the winter relief efforts of previous years. Therefore, we also hope that influential members of society will fully cooperate to successfully complete this year's winter relief efforts and provide more assistance to impoverished compatriots.

The Municipal Advisory Committee of this city will hold a plenary committee meeting today. We request the members of the Advisory Committee to pay special attention to the work of winter relief this year and provide full opinions for the authorities to refer to. The members of the Advisory Committee have considerable status and prestige in society. At the same time, they also have practical experience in charitable work. We hope that they will discuss the most appropriate and practical solutions and suggest them to the authorities. We believe that the solutions decided upon by the Advisory Committee will be accepted by the authorities and trusted by the citizens. When appealing to citizens for cooperation, it will also be able to obtain the greatest response and effect.

Finally, while hoping that this year's winter relief work will proceed smoothly and that impoverished citizens will truly be relieved, we also have a few minor suggestions: The salaries of the staff and the office expenses should preferably not be paid from the relief funds, but by the government. All cotton cloth and rice used for relief should preferably be distributed by the rationing agencies, priced according to rationing prices, and not purchased on the black market, because black market prices are too high and lack standards, making it difficult to verify. The targets of relief should first be those who are sleeping on the streets without clothes or food. At the same time, taking advantage of the winter relief opportunity, these vagrants should be provided with shelter, or contact should be made with vagrant labor camps to send them to shelters. Secondly, there are those who are generally poor and also poor soldiers.

### Implementing Chairman Wang's Legacy; Letter from the Chinese Kuomintang to the People (4)

China and Japan Should Urgently Support Each Other

"China and Japan are two great nations, bordering each other, and neighboring friendship is natural and necessary. Our Premier established the outline when creating the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance, advocating the great union of the people of China and Japan. During the sixth year of the European War, he published the book 'The Question of China's Survival,' clearly indicating that the relationship between Japan and China is related to survival and security. Without Japan, there is no China; without China, there is no Japan. To seek the long-term peace of both countries, no misunderstanding can exist between them." In the spring of the thirteenth year, when discussing the Three Principles of the People, he also pointed out the necessity of uniting China and Japan and the nations of Asia in the Principle of People's Rights. In the winter of that year, when he went north to Japan via the northern route, he gave a lecture on Pan-Asianism, repeatedly expressing his hope that Japan would assist China and abolish unequal treaties. He also asserted that the two great nations of China and Japan are the driving force behind the independence movement in Asia, and that there is a necessity for them to unite and struggle. Our Premier did not live to see the concrete realization of Sino-Japanese cooperation, but the fundamental policy had already been established. The purpose of the National Revolution is to seek freedom and equality for China. To seek freedom and equality for China, it is necessary to simultaneously seek the independent solution of Asia. To seek the independent solution of Asia, it is necessary to unite the oppressed nations of Asia to struggle together, especially the two great nations of China and Japan. The logic is very clear. Over the past few decades, the two sides have gone in opposite directions, and the accumulated problems have led to a deteriorating relationship between the two countries. The reason for this is that external seduction is one aspect, but internal differences have their own responsibilities. Reflecting on the past, it is necessary to deeply reflect on and clarify their respective responsibilities, respect and understand each other, in order to seek a reasonable solution, so as not to cause pain to loved ones and joy to enemies. The Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement of the twenty-first year and the Tanggu Ceasefire Agreement of the twenty-second year were all based on this purpose, hoping that after the cessation of military actions, the reversed relationship between the two countries could return to a good state. This effort had made relevant progress by the spring of the twenty-fourth year. On the Japanese side, the three major principles of diplomacy towards China were announced in the Imperial Diet. On the Chinese side, the fundamental policy of Sino-Japanese diplomacy was also declared at the Central Political Conference. Since there was such resonance between the two countries, there was no reason why this could not resolve disputes and promote the beginning of friendship. During this year, international affairs were brewing changes, and imperialists took advantage of the situation, implementing their indirect manipulation during the third period. As a result, there was a mistake in the Rose Agreement of Britain, and then in the instigation and provocation of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party, and the fundamental policy changed again and again. In February of the twenty-sixth year, although the Fifth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Party still marked the policy of "seeking self-reliance internally and seeking coexistence externally," it recognized that to seek self-reliance internally, it was necessary to unite the people and pay attention to production and construction. To seek coexistence externally, it was necessary to follow the path of international peace to move forward, but the crisis was latent and imminent. The prevention of the matter beforehand failed to grasp the set policy, and the remedy after the event could not adapt to the times. Therefore, errors were made repeatedly, misled by the empty words of the British and Americans to come out and interfere within three months, leading to the Battle of Shanghai on August 13, which caused the war to extend from the Yellow River Basin to the north and south of the Yangtze River. Furthermore, due to the oppression of the Soviet Union and the threat of the Communist Party, the possible mediation could not be promoted, and a good opportunity was missed. In April of the twenty-seventh year, the Party's provisional declaration stated, "My wish is in peace, and our ultimate hope is still in peace," but the situation was rigid and the stalemate could not be broken, and the war continued. Afterwards, the country was increasingly in danger, and world affairs became more urgent. The country was filled with scorched earth and the wilderness with sorrow. At this point, the peace movement was like an arrow on the string and had to be launched. However, every time the peace movement entered a new stage, or when international affairs brewed a new change, our Chairman would painfully state the pros and cons and offer loyal advice to Chongqing, always hoping for a unified party and a unified country to seek unified peace together.

Deeply Hope to Work Together to Achieve Comprehensive Peace

On December 29th of the twenty-seventh year, our Chairman issued an advocating peace, which was based on this idea for what was suggested to Chongqing. In the autumn of the twenty-eighth year, after the Sixth National Congress of the Party, at the beginning of the German-Soviet War, followed by , he strongly stated that the hope of winning the war of resistance should not be placed on international assistance. The changes in the powerful countries are unpredictable, and the distant association and near attack of weak countries will only suffer from their misfortune. At this time of turmoil and shock, China and Japan should deeply combine and not put East Asia into this vortex. The expectation for Chongqing was also the same. In the spring of the twenty-ninth year, before the National Government returned to the capital, he again issued a , stating that "the foundation of the peace plan is already in place. What China can get is not only non-destructive conditions for the country, but also by following this path, China's independence and freedom can be guaranteed, and the construction of the Three Principles of the People can be achieved." "Only the realization of peace, the whole country is consistent, can be swift and universal." The issue of troop withdrawal is also the same principle, in order to prevent the national and civilian strength from being exhausted for a long time, it is imperative to "first devote all efforts to local peace, and still deeply hope to work together to achieve comprehensive peace as soon as possible." For those who have fallen, the responsibility is heavier and the expectations are thicker. In November of the same year, before the signing of the Basic Treaty of Sino-Japanese Relations, he again sent a message, "As the state of war still exists, the facts accompanying this state of war also have to be allowed to exist. This kind of pain cannot be completely eliminated until comprehensive peace is achieved. For this reason, it is essential not to delay, make a decision, and announce a ceasefire." This can be said to be the most sincere and candid advice. In the years that followed, in broadcasts, speeches, and various remarks, he deeply expressed his expectations for those who had fallen. In February of the thirtieth year, he launched the East Asian League Movement, revealing the four major outlines of political independence, military alliance, economic cooperation, and cultural communication. On December 8th of the same year, the Pacific War broke out. The Sino-Japanese Incident was transformed into a war to defend East Asia, eliminating aggression and returning the opportunity for freedom. Our Chairman constantly called on Chongqing to pay attention, but the reason why he persevered was also to hope that each other would work together to break free from the shackles that had been placed on our heads for a century (to be continued).

Central News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 1st: In the past two days, the artillery fire of the US First and Seventh Armies in the Aachen area of the Western Front has weakened, but from the perspective of the overall war situation, the sharp edge of the anti-Axis forces has been strongly checked. However, the major offensive is still progressing with difficulty. Regarding the anti-Axis forces' attempt to invade German territory, the German defense forces and people's assault teams are all determined to resist to the death.

Enemy US Fleet on the Verge of Collapse

The 7th of this month is the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. Looking back on the war situation in which the Japanese army annihilated the enemy over the past three years, it further strengthens our firm belief in inevitable victory. Especially in the past year, the Japanese army has achieved the goal of depleting the enemy's combat power, and has launched fierce decisive battles in the eastern waters of Taiwan and the Philippines. This decisive battle can be said to be the last attrition war. In the eastern waters of the Philippines, the enemy US fleet has suffered heavy blows and is on the verge of collapse. Strategically, the Japanese army has also destroyed the enemy's air force bases, which is particularly evident. Furthermore, in the past week, the Japanese air force has continued to dispatch brave attacks against the enemy, while the number of enemy attacks has gradually decreased sharply, which proves the decline in the enemy's combat power. The Japanese Navy's Kamikaze Special Attack Force and the Japanese Army's Special Attack Force have shocked the world, so the inevitable victory of the war is in our hands.

Belief in Inevitable Victory Can Be Divided into Two Points

Our firm belief in inevitable victory can be divided into two points: (1) The unique spirit of the Japanese army is absolutely superior, and (2) In terms of machinery, Japan is also superior to the enemy. Therefore, in the current war, Japan is undoubtedly superior. However, in the wake of this defeat, the enemy is expected to rebuild its forces and replenish military supplies in the future. Due to this relationship, the main goals of naval warfare are to destroy the enemy's transport ships, light fast boats, and destroy enemy air bases. For example, the Japanese army's fierce attacks on enemy bases on Morotai Island, Saipan Island, New Guinea Island, and Tinian Island, in addition to attacks on the enemy's aircraft carrier fleet mobile units. Whenever enemy ships are detected, the Japanese army will annihilate them. We are fully prepared to attack the enemy. For example, the land combat team's achievements on Leyte Island on the 29th of last month were remarkable. The eagerness of the Japanese people to volunteer for the special attack force has further inspired and strengthened the belief in inevitable victory. The crowded situation has made the authorities feel deeply unable to accommodate and accept them. Looking forward to the future, our belief in inevitable victory is even more firm.

Enemy Supplies on Leyte Island Cut Off

The Japanese army's main goal on Leyte Island is to encircle the enemy troops invading from the northwest to cut off the enemy's supply lines. What the enemy fears most is the cutting off of supply lines, which is the Japanese army's most important goal. In order to cover the landing troops, the enemy does not hesitate to use Morotai Island and New Guinea Island as air bases. They have now been repeatedly attacked by the Japanese army and have been severely damaged. In particular, the Tacloban and Tarac airfields on Leyte Island have also been bombed by the Japanese army several times and cannot be used. Therefore, the Japanese army has won the land battle on Leyte Island. Recently, the enemy US has announced that the defeat situation is becoming increasingly difficult and has been repeatedly frustrated, which has far-reaching significance compared to the past glorious situation of the Saipan campaign. Therefore, based on the above situation, the enemy army's assistance to the landing forces on Leyte Island must strengthen the bases on Saipan Island and the base in Chongqing, attempting to bomb the Japanese mainland and important Chinese locations. This is a desperate measure taken out of necessity to expand air bases. For example, the recent pressure of air raids on Tokyo has gradually increased. In the past two days, the enemy sent a small number of planes to attack Tokyo, blindly dropping bombs, injuring civilians and elementary schools, and blindly bombing the suburbs of Shizuoka, causing no damage. The citizens of Tokyo have been working hard to train in air defense, so the damage during air raids is extremely , which has achieved great results. However, special attention must be paid to the hope that the citizens of Shanghai will work hard to complete the iron wall of air defense. In the future, enemy aircraft will inevitably invade the Shanghai area, and it is hoped that civil air defense in Shanghai will be particularly strengthened.

British Fleet Weak

The British fleet in the Indian Ocean has increased in strength, but it is still unable to attack Japan. The British Navy can only be stationed in its home country and the Mediterranean Sea. If it were to fight in East Asia, it is believed that it would be fruitless and unable to withstand a single blow from Japan. On the 29th of last month, British Prime Minister Churchill's speech to the Japanese people was unable to judge the surrender of Germany, so Britain is helpless against Germany, and eliminating Japan is even more remote. In addition, the naval forces of France and Italy are weak and concentrated in the Mediterranean Sea, so the British fleet cannot be active alone. If it were to assist the Macarthur forces in the Philippines, it would not be possible to achieve this at present, and we have no to worry. Recently, some Americans have said that the joint war between the United Kingdom and the United States is between the United States and Japan, and that the enemy of Japan is also the United States. Therefore, with the strength of the United Kingdom, it is not an enemy of Japan.

### Rickshaw Fare Regulations; 15 Yuan Per Municipal Li

Recently, the number of trams has decreased, and citizens mostly use rickshaws as a means of transportation. Rickshaw pullers take the opportunity to demand exorbitant fares without any standards. The Public Utilities Bureau has specially set the rickshaw fare at 15 yuan per municipal li. For example, the entire distance from Jing'an Temple to Zhongshan Park is 2,250 meters, which is equivalent to 4 and a half municipal li, and the fare should be 68 yuan. In the future, citizens taking rickshaws can pay the fare according to this standard.

### Zhenjiang Native Place Association Expands Small Loan Fund

The Zhenjiang Shanghai Native Place Association, under the direction of Wu Yunzhai and Tang Shoumin, has established a clinic for providing medical care and medicine, a scholarship for impoverished students, and a small loan program. For several years, it has been supported by enthusiastic people and has promoted impartial fellow villagers to divide labor and cooperate, taking on welfare undertakings with remarkable results. Two years ago, Hu Chunlin, Chen Peide, Yao Hanbin, Chen Rongfa, and Zhou Daoqian were appointed to form a Small Loan Committee. For two years, borrowers have been able to repay the principal in accordance with the regulations. Recently, the cost of living has increased, and an increase in the amount of loans is necessary to meet the needs of those seeking assistance. Therefore, a fundraising campaign to expand the fund has been launched. Enthusiastic people have responded very enthusiastically to the call for donations. Donors are requested to send their donations directly to Zhou Daoqian of the association's Finance Section, who will issue a formal receipt. At the end of the year, the Lixin Accounting Firm will be invited to audit the accounts to ensure transparency.

### Sketches from the Shên Pao Reader's Scholarship Student Achievement Exhibition

— A Scholarship Recipient, Lè Tiān (Happy Heaven)

In the early winter season, everything carries a sense of decline, and the street scenes especially appear filled with mixed emotions. We, the general impoverished students, are not intimidated by this; on the contrary, our spirit of diligent study becomes all the more determined. Take, for instance, this "Achievement Exhibition" organized by the Shên Pao. When I received the principal's notice, "All Shên Pao Reader's Scholarship recipients must submit at least one item to participate in the exhibition," all of us scholarship recipients were delighted to comply, concentrating our efforts to create a piece of work that would attract attention, ready to send it to the Shên Pao.

According to news from the scholarship office: since the beginning of preparations, nearly a month ago, over six hundred elementary, middle, and high schools, with over four thousand scholarship recipients, have submitted achievements, reaching more than eight out of ten. Among them, most are regular schoolwork, with fewer specially made works. In terms of the total number of items, there are more than twenty thousand, averaging about six items per person. After review, about four out of ten were displayed. The preparations for this event were quite complicated, with over ten scholarship students from various universities specially invited to assist with sorting, cataloging, and arranging things. The YMCA also provided a great deal of support, not only lending the library for free as the venue but also sending personnel to help with the work, truly demonstrating their spirit of service to society.

Yesterday was the opening day, and the guests from all walks of life who came to visit were very enthusiastic. At the YMCA's second-floor "Achievement Exhibition," the red silk banner fluttered vibrantly. Upon entering the venue, the displays were arranged in order, first elementary school, then junior high, high school, and finally specialized schools and universities, winding around with ingenuity. Each group of achievements had its own special features and was colorful and dazzling. To summarize, the elementary and middle school groups mostly consisted of literary, artistic, craft, embroidery, and carving works; the specialized school and university groups consisted of theses from various departments, notes, experimental reports, surveys and statistics, specimen models, and things related to sound, light, chemistry, and electricity. It could be said that all kinds of novel works were available.

The achievements on display each had their own strengths. I personally deeply admire all the scholarship students and humbly feel I cannot compare. Among the most eye-catching were the university group's "John" architecture department's gymnasium design drawings, the new-style airplane model made by "Jiaotong" students, the "Shanghai" architecture design patterns, the "Tongde" nerve tract model and human anatomical view, the "Huadong" animal bone specimens, the "Datong" series lighting installation, the "Fudan" architectural patterns, the agricultural and textile specimens from "Nantong" agricultural and textile departments, and the Western paintings from "Meizhuan." In addition, the steel tools made by the industrial arts institute and the charts drawn by the obstetrics departments of "Guangci" and "Zhongde" were all considered excellent. Also, Shi Jiaxun, a junior high student from "Zhengyang," drew a map and created artistic lettering, which were very exquisite. For a seventeen-year-old youth to be able to create such detailed patterns, his future is surely limitless. The rest of the elementary and middle school works were mostly wonderful, but unfortunately, I cannot list them all individually.

Here, I must represent the scholarship students in thanking the Shên Pao authorities and the scholarship benefactors for spending so much effort and resources on our four thousand-plus impoverished students, managing the scholarship work for eight sessions already. Although the funds are donations from all sectors of society, the Shên Pao is prudent and thorough, using every penny for public benefit and not wasting public funds. How many charitable organizations in Shanghai can be found with this spirit of public service and self-discipline? From yesterday until the end of the month, the Shên Pao is launching a special fundraising drive, aiming for one thousand teams, with each team raising at least twenty thousand yuan. If twenty million yuan can be raised, then our four thousand-plus impoverished students will have the opportunity to continue their studies next semester. The statistical tables sent by the scholarship office for display also number over ten, analyzing the various aspects of the scholarship work very clearly. In the first session, the average scholarship given to each person was only thirty-three yuan, while in the last session, the average number has risen to three thousand and forty-seven yuan. The rate at which prices have risen in the past four years is truly alarming! The vast future, I do not know where it will end! As I write this, I cannot help but shudder; it is truly a case of uncontrollable emotion.

### Reader's Scholarship News: Achievement Exhibition Opened Yesterday, Guests Visited Continuously, Morning to Night

The Shên Pao Reader's Scholarship Office's achievement exhibition of scholarship students was grandly opened at the YMCA in Baxianqiao at nine o'clock yesterday morning. Guests from all walks of life, from morning till night, more than two thousand people, carefully examined the displays and were deeply interested. It is expected that the number of visitors today and tomorrow will be even more crowded. This newspaper hopes that social philanthropists and previous donors will all be able to attend and offer guidance, both to witness the achievements of impoverished students studying hard and to understand the profound significance of helping with education.

Sympathy from All Sectors for Special Fundraising

(1) A letter from the Shanghai Pencil Factory states: "Your newspaper's management of the Reader's Scholarship Fund benefits students greatly, providing relief to the poor and nurturing talent for society, which we deeply approve of.

(2) Yao Junzhi of the Xin Xing Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory wrote: "Having read in your newspaper the call for the Scholarship Fund to organize special fundraising teams, your enthusiasm is admirable.

The stationery industry is deeply and significantly related to education and culture. We hope that fellow leaders in the stationery manufacturing industry will actively participate in the scholarship movement in order to achieve our grand aspirations.

Ding Hui Kang and the Hongqiao Sanatorium he manages each formed a team yesterday, showing admirable enthusiasm. The pharmaceutical magnate Man Junzhi also responded to the call. It is hoped that fellow Western medicine practitioners and renowned doctors will jointly pool their efforts and do their utmost to raise donations and recognize teams for our newspaper's scholarship efforts.
