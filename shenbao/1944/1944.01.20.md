### Where is the Chongqing Regime Going? Chen Binhe

A: The international war is approaching the final decisive battle day by day. However, the future of the Chongqing regime, which is splitting China and holding onto the southwest, feels increasingly distant. It is particularly heartbreaking that the Chongqing regime's own mistakes have prevented our country from unifying. However, on the other hand, some people might be thinking: Regardless, the Chongqing regime has finally dragged on the war for six and a half years, doesn't this show their strength?

B: It seems that there are many people who hold this view, right? But the reason why the Chongqing regime has been able to persist for six and a half years can be summarized in one sentence: vast territory, abundant resources, and a large population. The length of the Chinese mainland war front, from Mongolia in the north to Guangzhou Bay and Leizhou Niudao in the south, actually reaches 7,000 kilometers, far exceeding the German-Soviet front; and one province, such as Sichuan, has an area of 455,900 square kilometers, which is far greater than the German mainland.

A: This means that the vast territory is conducive to protracted war, but the saying of abundant resources may not be correct. Isn't the supply of materials in the inland areas extremely scarce?

B: The productivity of the Chongqing regime's area is certainly not comparable to that of Japan and Germany, but because the people live in poverty and have low levels of consumption, the material supply is tight but still barely manageable. In addition, a more important factor is the large population. Based on the vast territory and abundant resources, the Chongqing regime uses the rich "human resources" as its power for protracted war, and also maintains its regime by taking advantage of the enemy, Britain and the United States.

A: So, the Chongqing regime can use these conditions to carry out a persistent protracted war?

B: The issue must be viewed from two perspectives. In the past six and a half years, it has indeed dragged on until now because of the above-mentioned conditions, but at the same time, it should also be recognized that the so-called vast territory already has nearly one-third of the land occupied by the Chinese Communist Party under the banner of "resistance against Japan"; the so-called abundant resources and large population are actually under backward production methods, and at the same time, the huge consumption of protracted war is deteriorating. As a result, the words "general counter-offensive" are no longer heard, and even if they want to hold on firmly, it is extremely difficult. The recent battle of Changde can be a clear example, and even the maintenance of people's livelihood internally is gradually becoming unbearable.

A: Yes, I heard that prices are soaring sharply in various places under the Chongqing regime. Last August, the price of rice was 2,200 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure) in Chongqing, and it had reached 3,200 yuan in Xi'an. Now it is even higher. So, how do the common people live?

B: According to a special dispatch published in the Japanese Asahi Shimbun on January 5, the price index in the Chongqing regime's area was about 81 times that before the incident in January last year. It was 166 times in August, and it had already approached 220 times at the end of the year. The amount of legal tender issued was 1.449 billion yuan before the incident, and it is now estimated to be about 30 billion yuan, with a monthly increase of 1.5 to 2 billion yuan, plus other miscellaneous currencies and bonds totaling about 60 billion yuan; at the same time, due to the increase in military demand and compulsory purchases, the revenue has decreased relatively. The Chongqing regime's budget for the 32nd year is:

The total budget is 30 billion yuan, and the total revenue is 18 billion yuan, which is only 60% of the budget. However, this 30 billion yuan has expanded to 14 and a half times compared to the 2.1 billion yuan in the 26th year before the incident. What other way is there to make up for the insufficient revenue besides issuing public bonds, increasing currency, and begging from the United States?

A: I see! That's why some people say that in Yu Jiang's so-called "Address to the People" on New Year's Day this year, he had to kowtow to Roosevelt in particular.

B: In fact, this is really too pitiful! In the past, it was said that using Anglo-American imperialism to resist Japan was a request for assistance. Now, where is the assistance? Where is the utilization? It is simply relying on the breath of the United States for everything, and obeying the orders of the United States! The United States lends money to control China's economic lifeline. Can Chongqing propose equal conditions? The United States is strengthening its air force in Chongqing to disrupt the rear of East Asia. Can Chongqing demand unified command of military power? It has been shouting for a year and a half, reopening the Yunnan-Burma Road to increase transportation and supply materials from India to Chongqing, but it is still empty talk.

A: In this case, the result of Chongqing's protracted war is that politics is becoming increasingly dark, people's livelihood is becoming increasingly miserable, and it is only creating opportunities for the CCP to occupy. In addition, on the one hand, it boastfully claims to be one of the four great powers, while on the other hand, it allows the military to be completely dominated by the United States, and sits idly by as compatriots are cruelly and brutally bombed without regard. Therefore, compatriots under the rule of Chongqing naturally yearn for peace more eagerly. And the Chongqing regime is really at the end of its rope.

B: Indeed.

### Japanese Naval Air Force Raids Gilbert Islands Airfields and Vigorously Attacks Enemy Positions in New Britain

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese military base in the Central Pacific reports: From the night of the 16th to the morning of the 17th, Japanese naval air forces twice raided enemy airfields and military installations on Tarawa and Makin Islands in the Gilbert Islands despite bad weather, overcoming intense enemy artillery fire and fighter resistance. Tarawa Island's airfield was hit on all sides, with two fires breaking out. The Makin Island airfield and nearby military installations were hit, destroying one location and starting a large fire in another. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a Japanese military base in the South Pacific, Japanese naval air forces, in coordination with Japanese ground troops near the enemy landing point in western New Britain, have been vigorously attacking enemy positions for several days. On the morning of the 18th, they attacked enemy positions on Billelo Island and Cape Magas again. Bombs dropped on Billelo Island completely hit enemy ground positions, causing a fire. They also engaged five P40 fighter planes, shooting down one. Bombs dropped over Cape Magas also accurately hit enemy positions. All Japanese aircraft safely returned to base.

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese military base reports: Twelve enemy North American "B25 twin-engine bombers" attacked Majuro Atoll on the Marshall Islands and Tarawa Island from ultra-low altitude on the afternoon of the 16th. Japanese naval fighter forces immediately cooperated closely with the naval garrison stationed on the island to counterattack, shooting down two enemy planes. The Japanese side suffered no damage.

### Newly Appointed Minister of Judicial Administration Zhang Yipeng's Speech: All Work Together and Fulfill Their Responsibilities

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) - After taking office as the Minister of Judicial Administration, Zhang Yipeng, made the following statement: "I am deeply apprehensive about being ordered to take charge of the affairs of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. Fortunately, I am following in the footsteps of Minister Luo, and hopefully I will not fall short and bring shame. The strength of a country lies entirely in its politics. Although judicial administration is only a part of the whole politics, the Ministry of Judicial Administration must be like the arm acting on behalf of the body, and the finger acting on behalf of the arm, in all judicial institutions, and the various institutions within the ministry must also be like the arm acting on behalf of the body, and the finger acting on behalf of the arm. Objectively, the minister has the highest position, descending in levels to the employees, with a distinction between superior and inferior. In reality, each part has its own dedicated responsibility, and each has its own relationship of connection. They support each other, both vertically and horizontally. The manifestation of political strength lies entirely in this. Although official ranks have different levels, everyone must focus on their actual duties, which is no different. While life should be stable, one's mind, body, and work, must be stable. As stated in the first chapter of the Great Learning, 'Knowing where to rest, then one has a fixed point.' The so-called 'knowing where to rest' means fulfilling one's own responsibilities, and 'having a fixed point' means not letting one's mind wander. From a fixed point comes tranquility, and from tranquility comes peace. Thoughts, when put forth, are naturally thorough and meticulous. From thorough and meticulous thinking, then one obtains the effect of doing things. The former Minister Luo has long laid the foundation and promoted great undertakings. The staff will certainly work together and fulfill their responsibilities. I am willing to take full responsibility and will never make things difficult for my colleagues, so as not to affect the stability of their work. Former Minister Luo has taken the position of Governor of Anhui Province. Although the two places are separated, Minister Luo has personally promised that he will continue to assist with the affairs of the ministry, which is something I am deeply grateful for."

They must not leave their posts without the order of the ministry. And the order should be transmitted to the subordinates, and comply with it. Ministry of Judicial Administration."

### Japanese Postal Savings Exceed 20 Billion Yen

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - At the beginning of the third year of the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese people, with a savings target of 27 billion yuan, are actively moving towards the path of saving to serve the country, so the number of savings has been increasing sharply. Among them, the total amount of postal savings from April 1st of last year to the 18th of this month has reached 4.2974 billion yuan. Although there are still more than two months before the end of the national savings period, it has already exceeded the postal savings target of 4.2 billion yuan. This is enough to prove the sincerity of the Japanese people in responding to the soldiers fighting on the front lines and destroying the British and Americans by saving to serve the country. In addition, the total number of postal savings has reached 17.25386 billion yuan as of the 18th, and it is expected to break 20 billion yen in the near future.

### Bose Publishes a Paper, Stating Ten Indicators, "Onward to Delhi" as the Next Move

Rangoon, 19th (Central News Agency) - Chandra Bose, chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, published a paper in the Free India newspaper on the 18th, titled "Forward", the gist of which is as follows: Since the beginning of this war, India's independence movement has overcome many obstacles and advanced rapidly. Looking back on the path of India's freedom movement, there have been many stages of progress that can be used as indicators. First, under the guidance of the Indian Independence League, overseas Indians have been organized to support the independence of their motherland from outside India. Second, the formation of the Indian National Army, which is a historical event in the Indian revolution and the most important indicator of India's struggle for freedom. Third, actively engage in political activities under unified guidance. Fourth, to obtain guidance in reorganizing the Indian National Army so that it can be sent to the battlefield for combat as soon as possible. The struggle for freedom has now reached the time of progress, moving further and entering the final stage of the struggle for independence. The establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India is the fifth main indicator. Sixth, Japan and other countries recognize the provisional government, and the countries participating in the Greater East Asia Conference provide a comprehensive guarantee of assistance to India's independence struggle. Therefore, the holding of the Greater East Asia Conference is the seventh stage indicator. Since I took over the leadership of the Indian independence movement in East Asia, I have appointed Nambiar as a minister without portfolio, which proves that Indians in Europe have joined forces with the East Asian independence movement. In turn, a national movement is organized, and the Japanese side has provided various assistance. Once complete contact is established with the independence movement in the motherland, the subsequent actions will be the easiest to guess. Now that a preliminary preparation for moving forward has been completed, the independence movement has leaped towards the path of final victory. Eighth, based on Japan's friendship, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands have been designated as Indian territories, becoming the territory of Free India. The relocation of the government and the Indian National Army to Myanmar has historical importance and will become clearer in the near future. The march to Delhi has ignited a historical struggle. "Crossing the border" is the tenth indicator, so we should use our strength to break through the Indian-Myanmar border and begin the march to Delhi.

### Japan Has Implemented Preparation for Important Industries, Moving to a True Combat Configuration

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to the basic guidelines for enhancing war power and preparing enterprises, the Japanese government has prepared the first type of industrial sectors and is actively promoting the application of textile, rayon factories, and other industries to military needs. The preparation of enterprises in the second type of industrial sectors has also gradually been finalized. At the regular cabinet meeting on the 18th, the Outline of Measures for the Preparation of Enterprises in the Second Type of Industrial Sectors was decided. Important industries related to aircraft, armaments, warships, machinery, and liquid fuel industries are being prepared to strengthen the division of utilization and production, and to refresh and strengthen production functions. This preparation is to move the nation's industries to a true combat configuration. The main points of the outline are recorded as follows: Based on the principle of production first, form a group of cooperative factories centered on government-designated purchasing factories (basic factories), and use factory cooperative organizations and group enterprises to prepare the enterprise system. The Ministries of the Army, Navy, Munitions, Transportation, and Communications will separately demarcate the fields of designated purchasing factories and utilization factories, and seek to adjust purchasing and realize specialized production. In this way, each cooperative factory is a branch factory within an enterprise, and the effectiveness of each group enterprise is obtained. As a result, the integration of the (Indian) production plan and implementation, and the unification and planning of production administration, which have been problems for many years, can be realized. At the time of implementation, it was decided to start with the machinery industry sector and gradually implement the implementation guidelines of each industrial sector rapidly.

### Three Provinces and Two Cities Decide to Implement Unified Management of Oil and Grain, and the Purchase Price Has Been Clearly Defined

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Material Control Deliberation Committee of the Executive Yuan believes that oil and grain are essential food for daily use and are related to military needs. Under the wartime system, unified management of oil and grain requires not only a strong organization, but also perfect management methods to ensure smooth sources and smooth allocation. This can avoid the various abnormal phenomena of rampant black markets and uneven supply and demand. Therefore, the committee has formulated the Provisional Measures for Unified Management of Oil and Grain, which have been approved by the Executive Yuan and put into effect. In the future, the unified management of oil and grain (including various edible oils and miscellaneous grains, excluding grains and wheat) in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, will be the responsibility of the National Commercial Control Association, which will be responsible for the oil and grain professional committee. If necessary, the committee may set up branch offices in various regions so that members of the oil and grain industry associations in various regions can handle the purchase and sale of oil and grain under its leadership. The purchase price has also been clearly stipulated, and the standard prices of various oil and grain should be determined by referring to the stipulated purchase prices of various important agricultural products (such as rice and wheat) and their previous ratios, and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. Therefore, it is expected that the operation of oil and grain in the future will be more smoothly under reasonable unified management, and the unified collection and distribution methods of allocated rice, grain, flour, wheat, cotton, etc. can make the entire material situation stable. The government's main aim of stabilizing people's livelihood will be more effective than expected.

### The Capital Launches a National Savings Movement, and Student Groups Store Money in the Central Reserve Bank

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - In order to commemorate the first anniversary of the war, the National Government is launching a universal national savings movement to encourage the general public to practice the virtues of thrift and savings, so as to achieve the goals of saving to serve the country, saving to serve the country, and completing the war. From January 17 to 22, it is designated as Thrift and Savings Week. Various agencies, groups, youth groups, and shops have organized fundraising teams to persuade people to participate in thrift and savings. Since the beginning, the general public has participated one after another. Our reporter visited the Propaganda Department for this purpose to inquire about the situation of encouraging thrift and savings in recent days. It is reported that this afternoon, Mayor Zhou convened professional associations and responsible personnel at a tea party at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association to encourage all sectors of the city to practice thrift and savings. The savings situation of civil servants in various agencies is also being actively promoted. As for the savings situation of other agencies, it is not possible to count for a while because the Propaganda Department has not yet received reports from the captains of various teams. However, the measures for promoting savings within the Propaganda Department are roughly divided into individual savings, with separate accounts opened for each division and office. The staff of each division and office will pool their numbers and collectively save. The maximum is set at 3,000 yuan, and the minimum is 1,000 yuan. Even the lowest-ranking soldiers are very enthusiastic to participate, and it is also promoted from the department to the subordinate agencies. It is expected that the future results will be quite impressive.

### Luo Junqiang Concurrently Serves as Commander of Anhui Security

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - The National Government has recently appointed Luo Junqiang to concurrently serve as the commander of the Anhui Provincial Security.

### Nanjing Dance Halls Decide to Close as Scheduled

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - Since the capital's youth were motivated by patriotism and justice and launched the anti-opium, gambling, and dancing movement on December 17 of last year, they have achieved great results. However, the dance hall workers, due to the sudden closure, are having difficulties with their livelihoods, so they petitioned the government to extend the deadline for closure to the 15th of this month. At that time, the government, considering their livelihoods, agreed to extend the deadline. The deadline has already expired the day before yesterday, so the representatives of the two dance halls, Zhou Weixin and Zhou Guoxiang, went to the headquarters of the China Youth Corps to state their determination. In the future, they are willing to stand on the position of youth, do their best to support the anti-opium, gambling, and dancing movement, so as to achieve success in eradicating toxins.

### Chongqing's Inflation

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the New York Times special correspondent in Chongqing, the plight of Chongqing under the long-term war of resistance and the state of its inflation are as follows: According to Chongqing's publications, prices have risen a hundredfold compared to 1930, and some fine products have reached five hundredfold, an increase of eightyfold compared to a year ago. Currency inflation is deteriorating day by day, and prices in Kunming are particularly expensive compared to other places. The impact of currency inflation on people's lives can be seen from the reporter's personal living expenses. For example, the rent of the reporter's residence was 300 yuan in January last year, but in this year, the rent has increased to 600 yuan per month, and it may be raised to 900 yuan next month. The reporter's living standard is average, but compared to the extremely low material living standards of the soldiers, the Chongqing officials are better off. The situation of crops in various parts of Chongqing this year is good, except for the poor harvests in Hunan and Guangdong provinces. Chongqing's economy is almost entirely based on agricultural products, so the quality of its harvest is closely related to Chongqing's finances and has a great impact on Chongqing's ability to resist the war. Chongqing's industrial production is currently declining. Among the 364 modern factories in Chongqing and its surrounding areas, 55 have closed and 13 factories have suspended work. Although cotton production in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces increased last year, the number of yarn mills decreased in the same year. Although alcohol production increased last year compared to the previous year, coal production also increased by 10% compared to last year. The total production of minerals in the area has declined significantly. Tungsten ore production decreased sharply by 50% last year compared to the previous year, and antimony production is declining due to increased production and market recession. Tin production in Yunnan Province increased by 10,700 tons in 1928, the highest production volume, which gradually decreased thereafter. Last year, there was only a minimum production of more than 2,000 tons.

### Special Insurance for Civil Servants Approved by the Executive Yuan

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - Since the return of the National Government to the capital, the salaries of civil servants have been considered by the National Government in many ways, and temporary salary increases have been implemented. However, due to the continued rise in prices, their difficult situation has not been completely resolved. If there is an accident or the death of a family member, it is even more difficult to cope with. At this time of war, ensuring the livelihood of civil servants and improving their work efficiency is a crucial social problem. In view of this, the Ministry of Social Welfare recently ordered the Provisional Regulations on Special Insurance for Central Civil Servants, which were approved by the 193rd meeting of the Executive Yuan. There is considerable assistance for central civil servants when they are sick, disabled, die, or give birth. It is also heard that the ministry will convene the first meeting of the Special Insurance Committee for Central Civil Servants on the 20th of this month to discuss the implementation of the matter.

### Free Midwifery Program for Teachers in the Capital

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Central Social Affairs Department of the Chinese Kuomintang, in accordance with the virtue of Leader Wang, is organizing a free midwifery program for teachers in the capital. According to the program, when the family members of teachers at all levels of schools in the capital, or the teachers themselves, are about to give birth, they can register with the department and apply for free midwifery.

### Soviet Ambassador to Czechoslovakia Presents Credentials

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to a London dispatch, the Czechoslovakian government in exile signed a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance with the Soviet Union on the 12th of last month. According to the treaty, the Soviet government has appointed V. Lebedev as the ambassador to Czechoslovakia, and he presented his credentials to President Benes on the 18th.

### Soviet-Polish Border Dispute: The US Willing to Mediate, Hoping to Break the Deadlock

Lisbon, Central News Agency, 19th – According to Washington sources: Well-informed circles in the US capital believe that Secretary of State Hull will, within a few days, dedicate himself to mediating the dispute between the Soviet Union and Poland and encourage the two countries to restart border negotiations. The border issue has been the point of contention from the start, and the Soviet newspaper *Pravda*'s hesitation regarding Poland has been fiercely criticized. It is widely believed that Hull will not directly specify the border issue but will pave the way for a principled agreement between the two countries. His motivation for dedicating himself to this matter is encouraged by the situation in which the American people value the Soviet Union's attitude. The New York Times expressed a specific opinion, stating that *Pravda* does not reject foreign interference, so this matter has become a difficult task for British and American diplomacy.

Stockholm, Central News Agency, 19th – According to reports in the London newspapers, British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons today regarding the Soviet-Polish situation: "Our wish is to enable the two countries to reach a friendly resolution. This achievement is extremely important for the future of Europe. A favorable resolution is not yet hopeless. It is widely believed that Prime Minister Churchill's return to London will bring new developments to the situation."

Stockholm, Central News Agency, 19th – Polish newspapers within the Soviet Union have published the future border of Poland's western frontier. Poland will include Silesia, Pomerania, and East Prussia, stating that the Germanization of the aforementioned provinces is not a reason for not including them in Poland's territory. The situation in Danzig is the same. However, the newspaper did not mention the eastern border of Poland.

### US Naval Commander Admiral Stark Arrives in England

Lisbon, Central News Agency, 19th – According to a broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation today: Admiral Stark, Commander-in-Chief of the US Naval Forces in Europe, has returned to London after consulting with President Roosevelt and Admiral King in Washington.

### Churchill Returns to London; Rumors of a Cabinet Reshuffle

Stockholm, Central News Agency, 19th – According to Reuters correspondent Bush in Algiers, North Africa: British Prime Minister Churchill's return to London is related to the Allied invasion plan of Europe. When Churchill left London in November of last year, the invasion of Europe was a major concern for him, but due to two illnesses, he did not have enough time to dedicate himself to this plan. Upon his return to London, he will concentrate all his energy on this plan. Churchill, still recovering from his illness, held talks with Allied Supreme Commander for the Invasion of Europe, Eisenhower, in Marrakesh.

Stockholm, Central News Agency, 19th – According to a report from Havas News Agency, London: Rumors of a British cabinet reshuffle have resurfaced following Prime Minister Churchill's return to London. Lord Beaverbrook may succeed Grigg as Secretary of War. If this rumor becomes reality, it would be a great success for Beaverbrook. Beaverbrook has strengthened his political position in recent months. During Churchill's convalescence, Beaverbrook was the only official who accompanied Churchill.

### Burma Air War Diary

Since the start of the third year of the Greater East Asia War, the air battles between the Japanese air force stationed in Burma and the British and American enemy forces have intensified. Wherever Japanese planes go, reporters follow them, and the following is a "base diary" that has been inspiring recently. Burmese front-line base, sent by special correspondents Kawate and Qin on January 3rd!

December 5th

The ripened rice ears create waves in the boundless fields. The reddish-brown sun seems to be sinking into the horizon within arm's reach. Somewhere in the plain, the beautiful evening is buzzing in the sky. These are the planes returning after completing the raid on Calcutta, bringing back memories. Relying entirely on the single beam of light illuminating the runway, one plane after another lands. The posture of the giant planes seems slightly weary.

Soon, the fighter planes also land. The planes have a refreshing feel, and their pilots are very approachable. Looking at them in the night, they turn out to be young men around twenty years old.

This is Staff Sergeant K, who came from the ranks of young airmen. This young man flew over a long distance to the expedition in Calcutta, established glorious military achievements by shooting down enemy planes, and returned singing triumphantly. Under the flickering candlelight, he instantly opens a jackfruit can, and devours a large pile of dinner bowl after bowl. Seeing this hearty-eating young man, the reporter cannot help but feel a sense of mystery.

December 13th

Before the fighter and bomber joint formation took off for the bombing of the Myitkyina airfield, I also went to see them off. Both air force captains, 〇〇 and 〇〇, had satisfied smiles on their faces. At the 〇〇 base, today, like usual, the boundless fields are filled with the sparkling sunlight of the southern country. The skin feels slightly cool, which is the winter in Burma. One captain said: "Today we will definitely succeed, because it is such a magnificent large formation." Another captain said: "I think so too. Today's formation is truly great!" Now, they are going to cheer on the subordinate pilots. The captains immediately determined the victory of this day due to the courageous and high-spirited attitude of the departing pilots.

On this day, the reporter saw the planes flying back neatly. Upon inquiring about the battle results, it was said that 32 enemy planes were destroyed. Only then did I understand that the two captains' conviction was by no means a one-sided conjecture but rather a sharp conclusion drawn from countless past experiences.

The airfield in the Myitkyina area is indeed the main base of the American and Indian air forces, so the enemy's defense is very solid. Although the enemy planes came late on this day, the counterattack was quite fierce, so several Japanese planes returned to the base very late. The unit commander confidently said: "Today, in addition to the two planes that we already officially know self-destructed, all the others will return." Sure enough, as the black curtain of night was about to fall, shielding the T enlisted man's plane with only one engine turning, three injured Allied bombers slowly returned to the base.

On this day, the unit commander stood on the grassland beside the runway, watching the last plane, for a total of four hours.

December 18th

The reporter from the news team who went to bomb Kunming, photography technician Mr. Y, returned to the base and started complaining. To his colleagues who came to greet him, he said:

"When the I warrant officer's plane that went with us to carry out the bombing mission self-destructed today, my spirit and attention were completely attracted by the fact that it was self-destruction, so I overlooked the calm attitude of the warriors at that time and the intense scene of the battle in my camera lens. It is really a pity that I did not get to photograph the entire battle situation!"

December 19th

Flying in the sky just as it was getting dark, I saw many cactus trees. Under the trees, they gathered in groups, one group on the left and one group on the right. These were the black shadows of the warriors who had just returned from bombing the Yunnan airfield. P40 type, anti-aircraft guns, self-destruction, etc., were all the topics they were talking about. It seemed that there had been a fierce war today. The pilots who returned to the base happily shook hands with each other and said, "We meet again!" This was just like meeting close friends who had not been seen for a long time. Although they always chatted casually, what they talked about today was the great battle results and the fierceness of the battle. Apart from Lieutenant M's plane self-destructing, there were still four planes that had not returned to the base, which was a pity. That night, I dreamed that the planes that had not returned were flying back, flying and landing.

December 22nd

The bombing squad leader who returned from bombing Kunming again reported to Unit Commander 〇. The two fighter squad leaders, U and F, also landed one after another. After each briefly reporting to Unit Commander 〇, the bombing and fighter attack squad leaders, as well as their subordinates, all surrounded the unit commander, expressing their gratitude to each other and discussing matters like friends.

"Well done! You fought very well today. There were so many enemies, but the harvest was so great. Thank you all!"

"No, no, I'm really sorry that two planes self-destructed. It's terrible!"

After a while, he lightly raised his hand and said, "Goodbye!" Then the squad leaders returned to their respective bases. I always feel my hot tears bursting out, my heart longing intensely, and my face burning up. (Translated by Da Lu from the Asahi Shimbun, January 5)

### Food Bureau Strictly Prohibits Exceeding Price Limits; Convenes Discussions with Various Industries; Sharing the Burden, No Violation of Control Policies Allowed

Central News Agency Report: Recently, the supply of food for the people has been relatively smooth, and the surge in the black market has stopped. However, the prices of general goods, whether essential or necessary items, have shown a trend of instability. As the Spring Festival approaches, this kind of abnormal price increase has occurred, which clearly disregards the law and violates the price limit policy. It has a direct and indirect impact on the entire social livelihood. Therefore, the Municipal Food Bureau specially convened a discussion meeting with the industry associations under its jurisdiction at 10:00 am yesterday to promote that all industries share the burden and strictly prohibit exceeding price limits.

Industry Associations Summoned to Attend

The industry associations of various major and secondary industries in the city that were summoned to attend the discussion meeting of the Municipal Food Bureau at 10:00 am yesterday included Shi Yucun of the Sugar Industry Association, Chen Ziyi of the Edible Oil Industry Association, Zheng Yuyuan of the Egg Industry Association, Zhang Jialin of the Tea Industry Association, Xie Meisheng of the Mattress Industry Association, Chu Jiasheng of the Fresh Pork Sales Industry Association, Xu Yangqiao of the Cured Meat Industry Association, Huang Zhenshi of the Aquatic Products Industry Association, Ge Weian of the Seafood Industry Association, Wang Buxin of the North and South Groceries Industry Association, Yang Guanqi of the Local Products Industry Association, Liu Songyou of the Restaurant Industry Association, Bi Bingyong of the Western Restaurant Industry Association, Xie Xiaochu of the Seasoning Industry Association, as well as more than 50 associations such as the Noodle Production and Cooked Food Industry, Flour Noodle Industry, Tofu Industry, Cooked Water Industry, and Dim Sum Industry.

Blindly Raising Prices Backfires

First, Bureau Chief Ji Hua stood up and said: "Recently, with the cooperation of all parties, the improvement of food for the people has made great progress. The Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Food have been implementing matters related to material control. The six major food associations in the city were established in a short period of time, and the various secondary food associations are handled by the Food Bureau. These will be adjusted separately in the future. The soundness of each association's organization is of great importance. All industries should pay close attention to the price issue. Before and after the Spring Festival, merchants blindly raise prices, which will inevitably backfire. I hope that everyone will share the burden and not violate wartime regulations. The future of the people's livelihood depends on it."

Changing Price Limits Will Be Severely Punished

Next, Huang Zhikai, Secretary and Chief of the Third Section of the Bureau, said: "The result of the increase in household rice allocation has already prompted the black market prices to fall. However, commodity prices have suddenly risen abnormally, which is contrary to the original intention of the Bureau to adjust various associations. The Bureau will take strict steps in the evaluation of commodity prices in the future. Price increases in all industries must be reviewed by the Bureau and then sent to the Evaluation Committee for a resolution before implementation. In addition to the legal profits that merchants should receive, they must not arbitrarily violate them. All industry associations should guide and implement this. If there are any violations or private changes to the price limits, they will be severely punished once discovered. All associations that increase production should also take on this mission to ensure that supply and demand are balanced. At present, materials are scarce, so we should try our best to conserve. Therefore, the Bureau will also restrict non-major manufacturers. Alcohol, soda, candy, biscuits, and canned food are all restricted to meet the purpose of conserving material resources."

### 60th Period Rice Flour to Be Sold Universally Starting Tomorrow; 2.5 Sheng of Japonica Rice, 1 Jin of Grade 1 Flour

The 60th period of household rice flour has been announced by the District Public Office and will be universally sold starting tomorrow. Those with the 60th rice purchase certificate coupon can purchase 2.5 sheng of white japonica rice for 20 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Those with the 60th flour purchase certificate can purchase 1 jin of Grade 1 flour for 8 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. The sale of rice for this period will last until the 30th of this month, but all rice shops will be temporarily closed for four days on January 25th, 26th, 27th, and 31st. The regulations in this announcement do not apply to the territories newly incorporated into the district.

Three Periods of Matches Sold Simultaneously

Regarding the third period of matches, it is also scheduled to begin selling tomorrow (21st). All retail stores should sell a small box of "Golden Tripod Brand" or "Jinjiang Brand" or "Dahua Brand" matches for 1 yuan in national currency upon receiving each coupon marked with the store's registration number. If any retail store is found to be in violation of the regulations, they can report it to the nearest police station for investigation. The retail stores will be temporarily closed on the 25th, 26th, and 27th.

### Deputy Director Su Gave Instructions to Inspectors Yesterday

Central News Agency Report: The First Police Bureau of the city has been actively improving the police administration and rectifying police discipline. Now, it is determined to strengthen the organization of the Inspectorate to meet the responsibilities of police inspection and investigation. Mr. Su Chengde, Deputy Director of the Bureau, convened all the chief inspectors and inspectors at the Police Club of the Bureau at 4:00 pm yesterday (19th) to give instructions.

### Deputy Director Su's Personal Instructions

He stated: "The work of the Inspectorate in the past has not been able to fully meet the requirements of police inspection and investigation, which has led to dissatisfaction with the police from the outside world. It is very regrettable. You must know that the establishment of the Inspectorate occupies a very important position in the Bureau. It is necessary to strictly supervise and inspect the police, and even teach the police, so that every police officer abides by discipline, assumes responsibility, follows police ethics, maintains law and order for the society, and benefits the people. Especially after the recovery of the concessions, we must improve the police affairs more accurately, to complete the construction of Greater Shanghai, so that we will not fail the sincerity of the Allied countries in assisting in the return of the concessions. In the future, we should lead by example, be a model for the police, and work hard together regardless of nationality. But we must be honest and law-abiding ourselves before we can encourage others. In short, I hope that everyone will work together to make Shanghai a model police area. In order to strengthen the organization of the Inspectorate and achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation, it has been decided to add three groups to the Inspectorate: administrative, inspection, and investigation, and to establish five inspection areas: central, eastern, southern, western, and northern. All inspectors will be mixed and deployed, regardless of nationality, day and night, to work hard to check and supervise the work, so that the police work can be guaranteed from top to bottom. The personnel of the group area will be announced within a few days after adjustment."

Mr. Wen Ting has served the community and is enthusiastic about public welfare, but he is old and his energy cannot bear the heavy burden. For the sake of public rest, colleagues have requested from all walks of life last year that they should not be invited to banquets. Lan Lao has been happy about this for half a year. Recently, Zha Lao has been burdened by the matter of officiating weddings. Every auspicious day, several weddings a day cost time and effort, and he feels very distressed. Therefore, colleagues would like to respectfully inform Lan Lao's friends that he should not be asked to officiate weddings. Sincerely hope. South, Zhang Yipeng, Chen Binhe, together, January 17

### Dockside Travel Service Actively Promotes Work; Formulates Plans to Welcome Travelers

Shanghai is a large commercial port for land and sea transportation in East Asia, but the order of the docks and the methods of management are far inferior to those in Europe and America. This is because they have long been occupied by hooligans and gangsters who extort and deceive, causing travelers to lose money or luggage, or be beaten and insulted. All kinds of disturbances make the international community laugh. Now, the Ministry of Social Welfare has ordered the China Social Work Association to organize the Shanghai Dockside Travel Service to actively rectify the situation and has requested the Shanghai Municipal Government to provide protection and assistance from the Allied military police. Worker registration began on January 15th at 202 Jiujiang Road. Recently, those who have gone to register have been very enthusiastic. In the future, they will be carefully examined, retaining the good and eliminating the bad. Qualified people will be issued service badges, and guard posts will be set up with supervisors assigned to regularly stay. Workers will be trained in service ethics. As for welcoming travelers, plans have also been formulated and will be implemented soon: Receiving and sending off travelers, Purchasing tickets for customers, Transporting luggage for customers, Clearing customs for customers, Insuring for customers, Packing for customers, Guiding travelers, Hiring cars for customers, Booking cabins, Transporting luggage by lighter, Measuring and booking cabins, Booking hotels. Once Shanghai has achieved success, it will be promoted to other ports.

### Japanese Army Press Department Held Regular Meeting Yesterday

Central News Agency Report: The regular press meeting held by the Japanese Army Press Department in Shanghai was held as usual yesterday (19th) at 3:00 pm on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road. The spokesperson of the department answered the questions raised by the press corps in the city in detail. The meeting did not end until around 5:00 pm.

### Canal Management Preparatory Office Entertained Various Circles Yesterday

In order to establish close contact with various circles in the city, the Canal Management Preparatory Office held a tea party at the Cathay Hotel on the eighth floor at 4:00 pm yesterday, entertaining Chinese and Japanese officials and celebrities from all walks of life. Section Chief Ru Geng, along with Secretary Ren Santian, Planning Group Leader Lin Gengyu, and others, cordially hosted the event.

### Shenbao's 6th Student Aid Fund; Various Circles Enthusiastically Donate; Junior High School Second-Year Students Register Today

The newspaper was released at 7:30 yesterday. The 6th Shenbao Readers' Student Aid Fund has been organizing application registrations in groups since the 17th and will be completely closed on the 22nd. During this period, it has been enthusiastically promoted by various circles, and the enthusiastic donations are deeply inspiring. The numbers cannot be said to be small, but in terms of distribution, they are much shorter than in previous sessions. The sharp increase in tuition fees and the increase in the number of applicants, with an average aid of 500 yuan per person, means that the existing aid funds are only enough for 5,000 people. The remaining more than twice as many students will not be able to receive assistance. Although donations can still be obtained from various circles, the current situation has made colleagues hesitate to start distributing the funds. The original target of the current session of the newspaper's student aid fund was 3 million yuan. In addition to the balance from the previous session, only half of that amount has been obtained so far. Seeing the students coming to apply, their urgent need for help is very sympathetic. The purpose of student aid is to be universal. Among the more than 16,000 applicants, we cannot bear to see even one person being rejected. While colleagues are doing their best, we deeply hope that enthusiastic people will pay special attention to the current student aid fund, generously donate to complete the project, and offer sincere prayers.

Application Forms for Junior High School Second-Year Students Will Be Accepted Starting Today. Each student must fill out the form item by item and pay attention to affixing the seal of the school authority and the guarantor, as well as other required procedures, to avoid trouble at the last minute.

Forms Submitted by Schools in Batches

Because the current session is in a hurry during the winter vacation and also coincides with the New Year holidays, the newspaper must speed up the handling of various student aid affairs. Please make sure that all students complete the registration procedures within the specified date. If it is not allowed by the facts and the report card has not been issued yet, they can wait until the scores are available and have the school authorities send them together to complete the registration.

Guangdong Public Association Aiding Fellow Villagers

The Shanghai Guangdong Public Association will provide a student aid fund of 20,500 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes from its school operating expenses to cultivate talent and help poor fellow villagers from Guangdong Province, Guangzhou City, and Zhaoqing who are willing to study agriculture and engineering. The association has entrusted Mu to handle this. All those who have received limited applications for student aid from this association are eligible to apply, which is worthy of emulation.

Social Figures Donate One After Another

Yesterday, Mr. Zhu Zhenhua, Mr. Xu Xingsheng, and Mr. Chen Zuoting each generously donated 10,000 yuan to the student aid fund. Mr. Lu Hanbang and Mr. Qu each donated 5,000 yuan. Their concern for the poor is deeply admirable.

Yesterday, we received letters from Mr. Yu Yixin and Mr. Zhang Yi'e, which stated: "Your newspaper's student aid program has achieved remarkable results, benefiting the poor and making a great contribution. We are ordinary store employees with meager monthly incomes, and we cannot help much. Now, we are sending 1,000 yuan to your newspaper's student aid fund. This is a small amount, but it represents our heart." The feelings are sincere, and the enthusiasm is admirable.

The China Radio Friendship Society held an anniversary rehearsal at the Golden Grand Theater on the 16th of this month. The gifts sent by various circles were converted into cash to donate 1,950 yuan to the newspaper's student aid fund, saving waste to help students, which is of great significance.

Student Aid Fund Received Yesterday

The following is a list of student aid funds received yesterday: Guangdong Public Association 20,500 yuan, Zhu Zhenhua 10,000 yuan, Xu Xingsheng 10,000 yuan, Chen Zuoting 20,000 yuan, Lu Hanbang and Qu each 5,000 yuan, Pudong Bank 4,000 yuan, Chen Xinchang, Liang Guanliu, and Chen Weifu jointly 3,000 yuan, Gongzhu Liu Shangtang's 60th birthday celebration transferred to Jiang Xue each 3,000 yuan, Zhang Yisun 2,000 yuan, China Radio Friendship Society 1,950 yuan, Song Jalu 1,080 yuan, Wu Rende, Ma Jinzhang, Lu Xianzhang, Li Jingting, Zhuang Pushu, Zhou Manhua, Hu Yangwu, Yan Ji, Zhe Ji, Xue Ji (above two households raised by Mr. Chen Duoru) each 1,000 yuan, Xu Xinfu, Fan Huichun, Ye Jingliang jointly 1,000 yuan, Zhong Jun 530 yuan, Wu Yaozhong, Yu Yixin, Zhang Yi'e, Sheng Fanfu, Shen Xuan, Xia Shengfeng, Fan Wenxin, Wang Juju, Ms. Zhang Shaozhen each 500 yuan, Gu, Nie, Wang, Shi, Nie, Zhang, Liu, Nie, Shi jointly 500 yuan, Zhang Zhihong, Shen Weiqing jointly 500 yuan, Zhong Boyi 400 yuan, Heji 382 yuan, Fan Wen 300 yuan, Ruichang Cloth Store, Qiu Yunzhang, Zhao Weixin, Chen Shanzhang, Li Zhaolan, Zhao Yang, Chen Shao each 200 yuan, Ms. Liu Xiuzhen 120 yuan, Xi Dingfu, Zhao Yinchang, Zhao Maochang, Luo Zilin, Zhu Gengfu, Gao Meng , Wang Xincun, Huai Songtang, Shen Huiping, Chunyuan Qianzhuang each 100 yuan, Shi Da 25 yuan, Pu Qiting 10 yuan, totaling 99,197 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes.

### Commentary: How to Help Suppress the Black Market?

Under wartime controlled economy, the existence of a black market is ultimately unavoidable. Even in countries with the most stringent controls, it is probably impossible to avoid the existence of a black market. It is just a matter of the breadth of its scope and the degree of its rampantness, which depends on the success of a country's control efforts and the degree of cooperation from its citizens. Poor government management and lack of public cooperation are both sufficient to drive the black market to a rampant and uncontrollable path.

In an environment where various black markets in the city are unusually rampant, the increase in household rice allocation to 2.5 sheng from the end of this month and the special increase in coal ball allocation for one month can have a considerable impact on the black markets for rice and coal. At the time of the Lunar New Year, this move is most welcome to the people's psychology. However, we hope that this kind of good measure should not be regarded as a timely gift. Only then can the so-called "double happiness" forever benefit the people's hearts.

The chairman of the Shanghai Grain Rationing Adjustment Committee made the following remarks in his speech on the gradual increase in the allocation of food rice to the citizens: "The future quantity of rationing can generally maintain the current level, but I hope that the citizens will work together to assist the authorities in suppressing the black market, so as to maintain the people's livelihood." Then, the responsibility of the people themselves in the future lies in assisting the authorities in suppressing the black market. As for how to assist, it is nothing more than: Practicing thrift; within the scope possible, we must try our best to tighten all daily consumption. Buy and hoard less; unless the rationing quantity feels too far from the standard, do not engage in unlimited buying and hoarding. In this way, the supply of materials can be smooth, and the rampant situation of the black market can be gradually eliminated.

### Regulations for Deferred Payment Promissory Notes in Various Industries, Approved for Implementation by the Financial Inspection Office

Following instructions from the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Bank of China, various banking and financial institutions, in order to stabilize the financial situation, have been restricting deferred payment promissory notes. The respective trade associations of these two sectors proposed four measures and sent representatives to present their views, hoping they would be adopted and implemented. According to inquiries made by reporters yesterday to banking and financial institutions, the Financial Affairs Inspection Office has adopted these views, approved accommodating measures, and sent a letter to the Banking and Financial Institutions Association, instructing member institutions to comply. Under the principle of restricting deferred payment promissory notes, all financial institutions that must issue deferred payment promissory notes due to borrowing funds from other institutions or other unavoidable business reasons must record the following items according to Article 27 of Chapter 3 of the Bills Law, signed by the issuer: the term "promissory note," a fixed amount, the name or business name of the payee, an unconditional guarantee of payment, the place and date of issuance, and the place of payment and due date. As for the promissory note format, it has been drafted by the association and approved by the Financial Affairs Inspection Office.

### Tight Credit at the End of the Lunar Year, Lackluster Performance of Chinese Stocks, China Bookstore Uniquely Soars and Does Not Fall Back

Yesterday, the trend of Chinese stocks was the same as the previous day. Prices fell in the morning without rebounding, and gradually stabilized and strengthened in the afternoon. Due to the end of the lunar year, it is difficult to expect credit to ease temporarily, resulting in a lack of momentum for prices to rise. The stocks of various industries generally experienced small declines again. Only the China Bookstore in the cultural industry soared twenty yuan amidst rumors of capital increase. Commercial Press, on the other hand, fell back a significant one hundred fifty yuan. China Film and other stocks remained stable. Wing On and other department stores each fell by small amounts of three to two and a half yuan! Wing On Textile Factory fell by a small amount of two and a half yuan; Sino-Textile was the weakest. Pharmaceutical stocks declined, with Sino-French retreating close to the seventy yuan mark. Chemical stocks also proved unsustainable. Public utility stocks remained unchanged as before. Among real estate stocks, Jianlong was uniquely strong. Other stocks such as Kang Yuan Canned Food, Lihua Industrial, and New Asia Construction also saw small declines. Today's closing prices for each stock are recorded below: Stock Name, Evening Closing Price: Commercial Press 5,450.00; China Bookstore 575.00; World Bookstore 138.00; China Film 92.50; Wing Cheung Printing 26.50; Wing On Company 237.50; Sun Sun Company 155.00; National Goods Company 159.00; New China Company 24.75; China Underwear 68.50; Wing On Textile Factory 230.00; Sino-Textile Factory 93.00; Xinhe Textile Factory 98.00; Rongfeng Textile 90.50; Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving 78.00; Tongfeng Printing and Dyeing 28.00; Wuhe Weaving 77.00; Lunhua Dyeing and Weaving 66.50; Jingfu Shirt and Socks 38.75; Jinglun Shirt and Socks 28.50; China Silk Industry 477.50; Mayer Silk Weaving 300.00; Sino-French Pharmacy 71.00; Synte Pharmaceutical Factory 505.00; New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory 35.50; New One Line 21.25; Star Perfume 44.50; Great China Match 750.00; Senmao Chemical 27.00; Nanyang Tobacco 760.00; Standard Flavoring 17.25; Gongxin Electric 20.00; Kang Yuan Canned Food 101.00; Shanghai Enterprise 17.25; Datong Business 25.00; Jiu'an Industrial 41.25; Lihua Industrial 57.00; New Asia Construction 29.00; New China Industrial 24.50; Zhongxing Zhenye 17.25; Quanfeng Real Estate 22.25; Jianlong Real Estate 22.75; New Yih Real Estate 27.75; Yongyu Real Estate 36.50; Lianhua Real Estate 35.00

### Naval Ambition (9) by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang

Zhenren put down the book he had finished reading on the desk and turned his gaze out the window. The view from the reading room was excellent, but in an instant, large raindrops fell from the heavily clouded sky, hitting the windowpanes. The tall willow trees were also covered with a green cap.

Sakurajima, covered in clouds and rain up to its waist, looked unusually dim today. The shadows of seabirds were also indistinguishable. Near the Tenpozan, Daimon, Benten Pier, and Gion Island fortresses, the tips of the houses in the misty rain seemed to be standing in a great flame.

Zhenren stared at this novel scene with a very strange gaze. This weather was very similar to the conditions on the first day of the Anglo-Satsuma War. Moreover, the historical scenery was different from the usual scenery. It was a strange thing to be able to feel such novelty in the scenery that he had become accustomed to seeing for sixteen years.

It seemed that this dim scenery had sent countless famous generals to the Japanese Navy. The book also wrote that his hometown had certainly suffered all kinds of pain during that war. After the death of Lord Nariakira, who was often called "Dutch Expert," the old men who had started using matchlock guns again finally had to admit that gunpowder was unusable after being soaked by wind and rain. There was no room for comparison between the power of round bullets and conical bullets. Moreover, England could not be certain that it would not come to attack again. So, what would happen in the future?

At this time, the seniors in his hometown, without being bound by temporary face-saving or traditional prejudices, turned around and allied themselves with England. This was indeed worthy of respect. It was not a submission to England. It was certainly before the superiority of Western military science at the time that they performed the ceremony of apprenticeship—the author of the book wrote this. On the English side, this friendly relationship was quickly established in order to check France.

In Keio 3 (1867), three English warships, including the "Royal Prince" vessel, entered Kagoshima Port. Aboard were Admiral King and Minister Parkes. At that time, the forts of Shimazu were also firing cannons, but they were no longer the cannons of war, but rather welcome salutes. At the welcoming banquet hosted by the feudal lord, there were more than forty kinds of dishes and champagne. The English guests only ate chicken and pork dishes, and did not touch the other dishes at all, but they drank a lot of champagne and beer. Where did the champagne and beer at that time come from? This also showed the painstaking efforts to entertain the distinguished guests. At the same time, the seniors did not forget to demonstrate the trial firing of the cannonballs created by Nakahara Yunosuke, half out of respect and half to show off, for the guests to observe. Wearing black wool red-lined coats and dress trousers, the officers first saluted the feudal lord and then ordered the six field guns to fire. Each one accurately hit the target far out at sea. The English also began to applaud in unison.

This was the spirit of Zhenren's seniors. The army and navy both adopted the British style, and dispatched students to England, but their kind of spirit did not change. Soon after, the Tokugawa shogunate's naval training school also hired English teachers. His successor, the Naval Academy, was almost a miniature of a British naval school, and, what was the result?

(Mutsu and Nagato were the most powerful warships in the world, Ryufu once said this!)

Zhenren stared at this dim scenery again.

### National Forum: Rice in the Qingxiang Area

We live in the southwestern corner of the Qingxiang area, which was formerly in Jiangsu Province and is now under the jurisdiction of Shanghai Municipality. We are only three kilometers away from the rice-producing area, but because of the blockade line, we are also eating relatively expensive rice.

Because of its proximity to the rice-producing area, smuggling is rampant. Their methods involve using boats or shoulder poles. When using boats, they simply use the "trick of swapping the sky for the sun" to pass through the blockade line and proceed unimpeded, masquerading as local rice and claiming that it was not smuggled. In fact, insiders can tell at a glance that the rice outside the blockade line is completely different from the rice inside the blockade line. As for shoulder poles, a large group of people often cross the fence at night or even during the day. They are all driven by hunger and truly have no other choice. Currently, black markets are also frequently found in the rice-producing areas, exceeding the fixed price by about 70% to 80%. In our area, which is separated by "a single fence," the black market exceeds the fixed price by one and a half times, approaching two times.

If you take a look at our area, you'll see mostly smuggling markets. If the authorities are determined to crack down, they can do so with a single move. However, before the authorities resolve to crack down on smuggling, I hope they will consider two points: 1. The amount of household rice should be increased to a substantial quantity. 2. For Qingxiang areas such as Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, and Beiqiao, which have never received household rice allocations, they should also devise a proper and practical solution. (Citizen)

### Rice in Baoshan District

The Shanghai Municipality has announced that the military rice levy in Baoshan District will be 1.5 liters per mu, calculated at the government-fixed price of 820 yuan per shi, which amounts to 12.3 yuan in storage coupons per mu. However, the actual levy is 39 yuan in storage coupons, equivalent to 1,600 yuan per shi, an overcharge of more than three times. We respectfully request the municipal authorities to thoroughly investigate and strictly handle this matter, relieving the people from their dire straits and performing boundless good deeds.

### This Newspaper Issues Scholarship Honor Vouchers, Valid from the Lunar New Year's Day

Since this newspaper exclusively contracted the Kuguan Troupe to perform a charity performance for scholarships, we have been deeply gratified to receive support from all walks of life. The Kuguan Troupe will present the comedy "Double Happiness at the Door" day and night at the Palais Theater starting from the Lunar New Year's Day. The plot is full of twists and turns, and the performance is lighthearted, which will surely create a sensation in the artistic world. This newspaper is issuing 1,000 "Scholarship Honor Vouchers," each ten vouchers bound together in a booklet, with each voucher sold for 200 yuan. After deducting the new seat price of 80 yuan, an additional 120 yuan will be donated to the "Scholarship Fund." These vouchers are beautifully printed, making them particularly sincere gifts for relatives and friends. Both watching a famous play and contributing to scholarships can be said to be a win-win situation. Moreover, these vouchers are valid for general use within three months. Currently, in addition to this newspaper and the Kuguan Troupe separately promoting sales, if enthusiastic people from all walks of life are willing to purchase, please contact the business department of this newspaper. The names of all purchasers will be published in the newspaper to demonstrate credibility. The brief rules for the honor vouchers are listed below: 1. During the Kuguan charity performance period, purchasers can use this voucher to reserve the best seat at the Palais Theater. (The charity performance period runs until the end of March 1944). 2. Purchasers of this voucher must reserve their seats three days in advance and must state that it is an honor voucher. If the seat reservation is made too late and the show is sold out, please change to a seat for another show. 3. When reserving an honor seat, please provide your address so that the seat voucher can be delivered and the honor voucher can be collected for verification. 4. The Palais Theater will reserve the best seats for each show specially for voucher purchasers, but the seats will be held until three hours before the show at the latest, after which they will be released. (Those who have reserved seats are not subject to this rule). 5. Purchasers of this voucher will not be required to pay any additional entry fees. 6. The names of those who purchase a full booklet of these vouchers will be published in the Shen Bao one after another for commemoration.
