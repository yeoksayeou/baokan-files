### Weekly Review: Agriculture and Industry

— Liao Jianan

Recently, many people have questioned whether, at this stage of developing China's industry and revitalizing the economy, we should prioritize agriculture or industry. While most people know that China is an agricultural country and that, to date, the foundation of our society and economy is still built on agriculture, with the national economy and people's livelihoods still dependent on it. Therefore, increasing production should start with agriculture, which is relatively quick and easy, and is what is meant by a key policy. However, some people believe that the development of industry is more important than agriculture in China today. We must develop industry and establish a large-scale, mechanized production system, that is, heavy industry. Its establishment is the fundamental task of China's economic revival. The June 12th *Xinwenbao* (News Daily) editorial, "On Agriculturalism," can be taken as an example. The starting point of this commentary is to refute Jiang Jihu's "Anti-Communist Plan" regarding the issue of "implementing agricultural fundamental education." We do not want to defend Jiang, and we also believe that there are indeed debatable points in the reasons Jiang listed for "implementing agricultural fundamental education." However, we believe there is also room for discussion in the "On Agriculturalism" article. Therefore, we are stating our humble views so that the general public can understand which path should be taken at this stage of industrial development, economic recovery, and improvement of people's living standards!

First, it is true that no modern country can develop without a developed industry, but we must know that the development of industrialized countries invariably stems from the development of agriculture. Japan is a progressive industrialized country, but it still attaches equal importance to agriculture. The United States is the country with the most advanced applied science, yet it also values both agriculture and industry. Although the British Isles lacks agriculture, Britain's textile industry is backed by Australian wool and Indian cotton. The establishment of Soviet heavy industry during the two Five-Year Plans has obvious signs to be found, and it was originally built on agriculture. Germany is a world-renowned country with the most developed industry, but Germany's emphasis on forestry and research on fertilizers is also the best in the world. Other countries such as France, Belgium, and the Netherlands are all industrial countries that attach great importance to agriculture, and special agricultural medals are awarded in government policies. All of these are sufficient to illustrate that the development of industrialized countries invariably stems from agriculture. It should be known that most agricultural products can be used as raw materials for industry, and agriculture and industry are inherently interconnected and inseparable. Therefore, even industrialized countries still cannot abandon agriculture. How can we, a country whose industrial base has not yet been established, abandon agriculture and try to run before we can walk? What will be the result? Therefore, constructing light industry from the development of agriculture, and constructing heavy industry from the development of light industry, is a certain sequence, and there is no possibility of luck. We do not hope that China will permanently remain in a primitive agricultural state, so we are making every effort to promote science, emphasizing both industry and agriculture. Chinese people should be more aware of China's national conditions. We not only hope that our country's heavy industry will be established immediately, but we have also actually investigated the state of industry in various parts of the country. To abandon agriculture and build military industry as sufficient to restore the economy is as erroneous a way of thinking as that of those who claimed to be familiar with foreign affairs in the late Qing Dynasty, arguing that as long as ships were strong and cannons were powerful, they could defeat foreigners. They did not know that ships and cannons must first have people to use them; otherwise, strong ships and cannons can only be used as decorations or given away! What good would that do? Therefore, we can solemnly declare and inform the people of the country that prioritizing agriculture or agricultural fundamental education is precisely in line with the current needs of China. Although we must also develop light industry and build heavy industry at the same time, there is no reason to abandon agriculture at any time.

Second, the "On Agriculturalism" article advocates that "Even if we want to revitalize China's agriculture, we believe that we must start with the mechanization of agricultural production, and this is inseparable from the completion of industrialization." We believe that mechanization is not enough to improve agriculture. This term is not very accurate when used in agriculture. To improve agriculture, agriculture must be scientific. Is using tractors to cultivate fields and using electricity to power equipment sufficient to encompass agriculture completely? Agriculture is a comprehensive science. In addition to fertilizers, seeds, and soil, meteorology, pests and diseases, agricultural engineering, and cultivation techniques, agricultural tools, etc., must all be improved with sophisticated scientific research. It is definitely not something that can be accomplished with just some machinery. Moreover, in the provinces where agriculture is developed in southeastern China, the complexity of crop types, the division of cultivated land, and the situation of customary inheritance laws make mechanical cultivation not only uneconomical but also irrational and impossible. This is another example of arguing from theory without regard to the facts. The use of mechanical agricultural tools or electric irrigation on a small scale does not count as agricultural mechanization. Moreover, mechanical cultivation is only one of the tasks to improve agriculture and may be applicable when developing the southwest and northwest in the future.

Third, "China has too many rural people. Developing new industries to absorb the surplus labor in rural areas, thereby reducing the people's dependence on agriculture, and making it possible to use the land more advantageously, has become very necessary." We have conducted 20 years of research on rural areas, and we deeply feel that before the Incident, due to the failure to plan rural construction in advance, when urban enterprises gradually developed, farmers were induced to leave their villages, and the decline of rural labor was one of the reasons for the collapse of rural areas. However, if politics is on the right track, farmers' knowledge is popularized, and rural organizations are sound, the concentration of population in cities is also a phenomenon of evolution. At that time, rural areas can apply scientific methods to make up for the lack of manpower. There is also a problem with saying that China has too many rural people. We only know that the distribution of the rural population in China is too uneven. In the southeastern coastal areas, the population is densely concentrated in a small area, averaging 149.4 people per square kilometer, and the population density has reached saturation. In the northwest, the population density averages only 3.4 people per square kilometer. In the southwestern border areas, there are fewer than one person per square kilometer. There is a lot of land, but no one is cultivating it. This is a fact we have personally investigated. At the same time, abandoned arable land is everywhere, and it is still impossible to reclaim wasteland. How can we use the land more advantageously? If we do not solve the collapse of China's rural economy from agriculture itself, is it possible to build factories on all the wasteland? This is even more fundamentally impossible!

Fourth, mining is indeed not within the scope of agriculture, but if there is no agriculture after the entire country is industrialized, can the workers fill their stomachs with mineral products? Fishing cannot be said to be completely unrelated to farmers' duties. In the land of fish and rice in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, it is everywhere. Fishing is at least equal to animal husbandry and is a sideline of rural areas. As for promoting agriculturalism because "food is expensive during wartime, and agriculture can obtain huge profits," this is an absolutely wrong view, and this statement is based on a speculative point of view. Due to the abnormality of the current social and economic system, farmers are exploited. No matter how high the market price of agricultural products rises, farmers will not get profits, and all the benefits will be occupied by middlemen. Therefore, we want to promote agriculture, not because we can speculate and make profits. On the contrary, we want to enable farmers to obtain the legitimate profits they deserve and not be cleverly exploited by middlemen, believing that maintaining the national economy and people's livelihoods and continuing the life of the nation can only be achieved by starting with agriculture, which is the right path!

Historically, China's political policies have been aimed at agriculture. We do not deny that grasping the general trend of politics and economy, and thus determining what should be promoted and what should be abolished, is a necessary measure to save China from danger and death. However, we believe more that developing agriculture and building rural areas are the key points to grasp at present. Agriculturalism and agricultural fundamental education may not be enough. We must think from the perspective of revitalizing the entire Chinese countryside. Do not easily go astray!

### US New Aircraft Carrier *Bunker Hill* Sunk; Fierce Battle on Western Pacific

Central News Agency Telegram from a Japanese Base, 24th: The Western Pacific, centered on Saipan and Guam, has now become a battlefield of fierce fighting. The US Navy, operating in the waters off the Mariana Islands, possesses 20 aircraft carriers, more than 10 battleships, and more than 100 transport ships. Since the invasion of the Mariana Islands on June 11, they have been successively dispatched to the waters off the islands to seize Saipan, responding to the landing forces on the island, and conducting repeated bombardments and bombings. A part of the Japanese Combined Fleet was also decisively dispatched to the Mariana waters to strike and reduce the enemy's US fleet. Since the 19th, it has launched a preemptive strike, attacking the large mobile unit formed by the famous US fleet in the waters west of the Mariana Islands. After two days of fighting, the enemy fleet has been severely hit. In addition, the Japanese Combined Fleet participating in this battle is only a part of it. If its full power is exerted, the Mariana waters will surely become the burial ground of the US Pacific Fleet.

Central News Agency Telegram from Tokyo, 24th: The enemy aircraft carrier *Bunker Hill* was sunk by the Japanese Combined Fleet in the Mariana waters from the 19th to the 20th. Its tonnage is 27,000 tons and it is an *Essex*-class aircraft carrier, equipped with 16 five-inch guns, carrying more than 80 aircraft, and with a speed of 32 to 35 nautical miles per hour.

### Air Battle Over Omiya Island (Guam)

Central News Agency Telegram from Tokyo, 24th: The enemy air force, in response to the Saipan landing operation, bombed Omiya Island (Guam) on the morning of the 23rd, with a combined formation of 70 fighter-bombers attacking the island. The Japanese air force immediately intercepted them. A certain commander personally piloted a plane and broke into the enemy aircraft group, engaging in a heroic air battle. In this battle, 15 enemy aircraft were shot down (including 4 unconfirmed), and the Japanese army suffered minor damage. After repelling the enemy aircraft, the Japanese air force on the island discovered an enemy aircraft carrier near Omiya Island. Commander Shiun led the way and fiercely bombed the enemy fleet, dropping many bombs.

Central News Agency Telegram from a Japanese Base, 24th: On the morning of the 23rd, the Japanese air force fiercely attacked the enemy mobile unit in the waters off Saipan, immediately severely damaging two of its aircraft carriers. Two Japanese aircraft did not return.

### Admiral Suetsugu Discusses the Pacific Naval Battle: Japanese Army on Saipan Prepared to Annihilate the Enemy

Central News Agency Telegram from Tokyo, 24th: Former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet, Admiral Nobumasa Suetsugu, recently received reporters at his private residence in Tokyo and made the following remarks regarding the battle in the waters near Saipan: The Japanese army is now launching an attack on Saipan, and the people of the whole country must not stand idly by. It will be difficult for the enemy's mobile unit to escape from the periphery of Saipan, because the enemy is still 3,300 nautical miles away from Pearl Harbor, the replenishment base, and is closer to the Sea of Japan. Whether from the Yuan army's incursions on the border in history, the Baltic Fleet during the Russo-Japanese War, or the Spanish Malma-built fleet and the Battle of Sarannis, there is no precedent for good fortune in reaching the operational area relying on objects. The American enemy is currently in great danger and dares to invade. The Japanese garrison has been preparing and waiting for the enemy. Although this enemy attack has not yet inflicted a destructive blow on the enemy, the Japanese fleet will rely on its superior air power to strike the enemy fleet that comes to challenge. The enemy fleet that is far away from its home base has always destroyed itself by attacking. The enemy is now in danger and dares to challenge us, launching a demonstration landing on Saipan. The enemy is like a criminal sentenced to death on Saipan. This operation is the last chance to win. Although the news of the complete annihilation of the enemy has not yet arrived, the next moment will be a precious moment for the Japanese soldiers to express their anger and kill the enemy. Please wait quietly for good news.

### Colonel Takase Issues Statement

Central News Agency Telegram from Tokyo, 24th: Colonel Goro Takase of the Navy Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters recently issued a statement on the Pacific war situation, the gist of which is: The enemy is now using aircraft carriers to compensate for the lack of a strong forward base within the sphere of influence of its forces in the Marshall and Caroline Islands, and is using its so-called powerful mobile unit to counterattack the Mariana Islands. However, the rear supply route of the enemy's so-called operational sphere has been repeatedly extended, and it has to plan for the shortening of operations. The organization of the counterattack force must be particularly strong, so the war is becoming increasingly decisive. The war cannot be decided by material quantity alone. After the battle line is extended, the amount of material must be increased accordingly, and transportation becomes more difficult. Under such circumstances, it is most difficult to maintain equilibrium. Once a flaw occurs, the entire operational organization is in danger of collapsing. The enemy army relies on material quantity, and this danger is even greater. As for the content of our army's operations, although it cannot be stated clearly, the purpose is to break the balance between the enemy's quantity and distance. Now, the opportunity to take advantage of the gap to smash the enemy's intentions has come. After about 100 Communist bandits attacked, the Japanese army collected 155 bodies of Communist bandits. According to the comprehensive anti-Communist results of the Japanese army in June, a total of 244 bodies of Communist bandits were collected and 99 people were captured.

### Japanese Army in Hunan Reaches Hengshan; Threat to Hengyang Increases

Central News Agency Telegram from Lisbon, 24th: According to a Chongqing telegram, the Chongqing military authorities told foreign reporters on the 23rd that the Japanese army in Hunan has reached Hengshan, 40 kilometers north of Hengyang, and is still advancing south. Its battle line has been extended to a length of 95 kilometers, and the threat to Hengyang, which is strategically important, is gradually increasing. The Chongqing correspondent of the *Daily Telegraph* also stated that if Hengyang is not defended, the eastern provinces of China, such as Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, and northern Guangdong, will be isolated.

### Chongqing's Pessimistic Tone

Central News Agency Telegram from Guangzhou, 24th: According to a telegram from Chongqing, Zhang Pingjun, a counselor of the Chongqing Executive Yuan, made a pessimistic explanation of the fall of Changsha when he met with foreign reporters on the 21st. He said that although Changsha has fallen, our land forces and the US Air Force in Chongqing have done their duty to consume the Japanese military's combat power. In the future, some more areas may fall into the hands of the Japanese army.

### Recent Battle Results of the Japanese Army in North China

Central News Agency Telegram from Taiyuan, 24th: The Japanese army in North China, together with the anti-Communist army in China, attacked about 20 Communist bandits who attacked on June 2 in the Lingchuan northern area in southeastern Shanxi Province. The Communist army suffered heavy losses and collapsed the next day. More than 900 Communist bandits were killed or wounded in this battle. In addition, the Japanese army units once carried out a surprise attack near Fenghailing (10 kilometers northeast of Fushan) and Wangcun on June 6.

### Roosevelt Claims Disappointment with Naval Battle

Central News Agency Telegram from Lisbon, 24th: According to a Washington message, President Roosevelt stated at a press conference yesterday that he and his chiefs of staff were deeply disappointed that the US fleet failed to destroy the Japanese fleet during the recent Pacific naval battle.

Central News Agency Telegram from Lisbon, 24th: According to an Associated Press report from New York, the Japanese mobile unit participating in the operations west of the Mariana Islands was not the main force of the Japanese fleet, nor was it all of its strength. It is still impossible to destroy Japanese naval power with the current battle, and it is pointed out that the strength of the Japanese fleet is still considerable.

### Indian National Army of Berrier Bravely Advances in the Rain; Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat on the West Bank of the Nu River Day and Night

Central News Agency Telegram from the Indian Front, 24th: The Indian National Army in the Berrier area is still very active despite the heavy rain, continuously advancing its positions and has achieved great results in all aspects. A powerful unit advanced to Jiannobei (5 kilometers southwest of Yoknobal) around the 20th, suddenly attacking a British army unit, killing a British general, and forcing them to collapse. Another team of the National Army also responded to this, engaging the enemy. 32 British soldiers were killed or wounded, and the Indian National Army captured countless military supplies.

Central News Agency Telegram from a Japanese Base on the Nu River Front, 24th: The Japanese army is engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the Chongqing army (Southern Expeditionary Force) on the west bank of the Nu River day and night. The Chongqing army attacked the highlands north of Longlu on the 10th, but was repelled by the Japanese army's counterattack. They abandoned more than 300 corpses, five heavy machine guns, and a lot of other ammunition. The Japanese army is now pursuing and annihilating them. Elsewhere, the Japanese army intercepted and attacked the Chongqing army moving in the Lameng area. After fierce battles on the 18th and 19th, the Chongqing army abandoned 170 corpses and abandoned three mortars and eight heavy machine guns before retreating. Also, the Chongqing army that was advancing on the vicinity of Pingyou was counterattacked by the Japanese army and suffered heavy losses. Therefore, the 60,000 Chongqing army entrenched on the Nu River has been on the verge of collapse since the counterattack a month ago. The so-called Nu River offensive has completely failed.

### East Asia Weekly War Situation

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - Weekly war situation on the East Asian front:

China Front (Land Warfare): In the Chao'nan area, since the start of operations, Japanese forces have defeated fifteen divisions of the Chongqing army and successively occupied key locations in Hunan, including Changsha, Liuyang, Liling, Ningxiang, and Xiangxiang. They are now advancing towards Hengyang, the air base of the Chongqing and American forces. Japanese naval units, cooperating in Hunan,突入 (tū rù - suddenly entered) the coast 40 kilometers north of Changsha on the 17th, securing the waterway from Baidongting Lake port to Changsha. In the Henan area, after defeating the troops of the First War Zone, Japanese forces engaged in a battle south of Lingbao. From the 1st to the 14th, the results included: 5,177 Chongqing army corpses, 538 captured, 20 Chongqing/American aircraft shot down (7 unconfirmed), and the seizure of 7 mortars, 110 heavy and light machine guns, and 1,559 rifles. Japanese casualties numbered 421. (Air Warfare): In addition to closely supporting land operations, Japanese air units frequently seized opportunities to raid Chongqing army air bases, thoroughly defeating the enemy's war-making capabilities. The arrival of Chongqing and American aircraft totaled 143 times in mid-June, involving 746 aircraft. Japanese forces shot down 16 of them (4 unconfirmed), destroyed 16, and caused 12 to catch fire, totaling 44.

Burma Front (Land Warfare): In the Kohima area, the enemy forces, in an attempt to open the highway between Imphal and Kohima, repeatedly launched fierce attacks day and night with superior forces. Japanese forces, defending positions near Kohima with a smaller force, defeated them. Starting from early June, they changed the disposition of rear positions to the most suitable battle lines, repeatedly repelling enemy counterattacks. North of Imphal, Japanese forces have secured key points and are preparing to attack the enemy in Imphal. In the Palel area, the enemy had been showing signs of wavering since the evening of the 7th. Since the 5th, except for Punjabi troops holding the front line, British units appeared to have completely retreated towards Palel. Japanese forces and the Indian National Army are currently mopping up the remaining enemy forces, while also fiercely pursuing the retreating enemy. On the 11th, they occupied Koodi Khunou and Mapik Khunou, located 12 kilometers northeast of Palel. Furthermore, on the 15th, other Japanese forces occupied Kungbi, located 10 kilometers northeast of Palel, and the high ground 436 to its northwest. In addition, they are continuing to attack towards Palel from various directions, expanding their gains. With the cooperation of reinforcement units, Japanese forces are fiercely attacking enemy troops with tanks along the highway and securing advantageous positions southwest and northwest of Bishnupur, currently preparing for an advance. In northern Burma, enemy airborne units retreating north from the Sinssat area and enemy forces gradually moving south from the Hpungan area were annihilated near Kamaing and Myitkyina, respectively. Chongqing army forces invading from the Nu River front and airborne units invading from other areas suffered heavy losses and fled in disarray after Japanese counterattacks. Since the start of operations in this area, Japanese forces have achieved the following results: Nu River front: As of June 11th, the Chongqing army had left behind 5,426 corpses, with 74 captured. The seized items include 24 mortars and 85 heavy and light machine guns. Japanese casualties numbered 321. Myitkyina area: As of the 12th, the enemy had abandoned 2,500 bodies. (Air Warfare): The Indian front has entered the rainy season, hindering air force activity. Japanese army aircraft shot down 4 large enemy transport aircraft in the Myitkyina and Myitkyina areas on the 22nd.

Central Pacific Front: In the battle for Saipan, enemy forces, under the cover of a strong fleet, continued to land, with an estimated strength of about two divisions. The battle involving their land, sea, and air forces is unprecedented. Enemy forces are gradually expanding their landing points and have occupied Aslito Airfield, appearing to be starting repairs. Japanese forces have secured key points in Garapan and the high ground to its southeast and are continuing to fight fiercely. The Japanese artillery on Tinian Island heavily shelled the enemy fleet covering the Saipan landing on the 15th, with one enemy battleship hit and set on fire. From 1:00 PM to 3:30 PM on the 16th, a combined formation of 100 enemy fighter-bombers, launched from aircraft carriers from Iwo Jima, attacked Japanese positions, with 11 shot down. (To be continued)

### European Front, South: Transition to Trench Warfare, Battles Developing in the Caen Sector

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - Havas reports: Authorities stated last night that the southern European front has transitioned to fixed trench warfare.

Marshal Rundstedt's Headquarters, 24th (Central News Agency) - A Havas war correspondent reports: In the past 24 hours, approximately 1,000 American artillery pieces bombarded the outer perimeter positions of Cherbourg. This is the largest concentration of artillery seen so far on the European front. The commander of the U.S. First Army has deployed three American divisions and eleven artillery groups on the Cherbourg front. Aerial bombardment has also continued without pause. The German army's courage in fighting against overwhelming odds is evident. The enemy's concentrated attacks with heavy weaponry aim to quickly occupy Cherbourg to prevent the destruction of important facilities. The enemy is using ten special engineer units to enable their troops to safely cross German minefields and fortifications. New battles are developing in the Caen sector. German aircraft bombed 40 enemy transport ships in the Orne River estuary again. Despite heavy losses, another British division has landed and is likely to advance on Caen. In the past 24 hours, the seas off the Normandy peninsula have been very rough, making the landing of supplies difficult.

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - German authorities announced that since June 1st, German forces have shot down 2,407 Allied aircraft, composed of large four-engine bombers, over Germany and the northern French front.

### Increased Production and Delivery Campaign to be Implemented from July 1st

### Central Offensive on the Eastern Front: Concentrated in Four Areas, Fierce Fighting Southeast of Vitebsk

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - On the 23rd, the German command announced the situation of the Soviet summer offensive as follows: The major offensive launched by the Soviet army on the central front is currently concentrated in four areas: first, the area from south of Mogilev to the Smolensk-Orsha highway; second, the areas on both sides of Vitebsk; third, the area from east of Borody to west of Nevel; and fourth, the area northeast of Ostrov. This offensive is gradually approaching the line from the Berezina River to the Latvian border, forming the front line to Ostrov. The focus of the fighting remains north of Vitebsk.

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - The German Führer's Headquarters announced on the 23rd that after fierce fighting in the central sector of the Eastern Front, the Soviet offensive was挫折 (cuò zhé - frustrated). The local breakthroughs formed by the Soviet army have been closed by swift German counterattacks. Fierce fighting continues in Vitebsk.

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - Havas military correspondent Lieutenant Colonel Orb reported: The Soviet summer offensive has only been launched in the central sector of the Eastern Front. There has only been artillery fire and local battles in the southern sector. Artillery fire has intensified between Ostrov and Vitebsk. The Soviet army has attacked the Smolensk-Orsha highway more than twenty-four times. Southeast of Vitebsk, the Soviets launched a fierce attack with seven infantry divisions and tank units, achieving only a local breakthrough on the Obel River. The fighting was still intense as of yesterday. The enemy suffered significant losses on the first day of the summer offensive, with 73 tanks destroyed. Although the fighting is currently limited to the central sector, there is a possibility of it expanding to the southern sector at any time. The local offensive in the southern sector extends as far as Ternopol. There have also been local battles south of Pripet and Stryi. On the Finnish front, the Soviet army continues to attack fiercely. Its main force is advancing along the road to Finland, while also advancing north between the Vuksa and Ladoga lakes. Between Ladoga Lake and Lake Onega, Finnish forces have retreated beyond the Svir River. On the Murmansk Railway, the Soviet army is advancing towards Petrozavodsk, and Finnish forces are also fiercely resisting.

### Fierce Fighting in Italy

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - Havas military correspondent Orb reported: German forces in the mountainous area between Ancona and Perugia on the central Italian front continue to conduct avoidance maneuvers, undisturbed by British forces. The British army's progress along the few roads in the valley is hindered by mines and other obstacles. There is no longer any danger of the German army being encircled, and the enemy has no possibility of breaking through in the Perugia area. The enemy's advance on the western flank has been stopped between Grosseto and Perugia. North and northwest of Perugia, between the Tiber River and Lake Trasimeno, German resistance is extremely fierce, preventing the enemy from breaking through and encircling the main force of the German army in the mountains of Umbria. West of Trasimeno, German forces, under the cover of the rearguard, have occupied new positions in the mountains.

The United States, relying on its abundant resources and mechanical technology, flaunts its construction volume and speed and uses this as the foundation for its general counteroffensive, mass-producing wartime standard ships such as the Liberty type and Victory type. In Japan, since last year, the nation's Class A shipyards have also been building various wartime standard ships at an even faster pace, and they have been launched one after another. Last year's steel ship construction volume was excellent, overcoming various difficulties, and recording an amazing record of will and technology. This year, each shipyard is advancing with the goal of exceeding last year's construction volume. Based on the experience of the past year, mass production methods have been established due to the expansion of equipment and the unification of designs, coupled with the indomitable fighting spirit of maritime Japan and Japan's world-renowned shipbuilding tradition. Japan's shipbuilding industry is now advancing by leaps and bounds with the force of a raging tide. On May 6, at the Kure Naval Arsenal, which achieved a great production result in strengthening war power, the achievements of the Harima, Mitsubishi, and Mitsui shipyards were particularly outstanding, and they were commended by the Minister of the Navy. In order to explore its contents, we visited the Mitsui Shipbuilding Plant, and the following is an overview of the plant.

"National Defense Dedicated Ship"

At the factory's main gate, the Z flag is hoisted high. What first catches the eye of visitors is the five-foot-square white characters on a red background carved on the wall of the workshop: "National Defense Dedicated Ship." In addition to the construction volume designated for the factory, it plans to build more merchant ships to dedicate to the country. These four large characters clearly indicate the意氣 (yì qì - spirit) of the excellent factory and the旺盛 (wàng shèng - exuberant) fighting spirit that permeates the entire factory.

In the confidence that it is leading the nation's factories in the ship dedication movement, one can feel the iron-like will and strength of the shipyard. After overcoming various difficulties and completing the designated number of ships, on the night of March 31, this ship dedication movement was born. On April 11, Deputy Chief Takeda, responsible for technical matters, announced the implementation guidelines. That is, in this year, further improve production efficiency, shorten the completion period, and save the labor required to build a ship. In terms of materials, as a result of research and effort, the iron and wood required for a ship were also saved. After completing the designated number of ships, use the saved materials and labor to build献船 (xiàn chuán - dedicated ships) to be delivered.

### No Days Off

In order to build last year's designated number of ships, the daily working hours were extended by two hours, and there were no days off, no Sundays, and no holidays throughout the year. The 1st and 16th of each month were days for those with urgent work to report to work. For jobs where mechanical power was insufficient, a day and night shift system was used to make up for the shortage. Rear Admiral (Technical) Takeda Shōzō, with a spirit like a raging fire and a will of iron, took office as the factory manager at the end of January last year.

The Mitsui Shipbuilding Plant is a part of the Mitsui Company. The factory's character is mainly to build ships for its own use. It has now adopted a military organization, separating positions and identities,抜擢 (bá zhuó - promote) new talents, and setting a goal for each factory every month, such as improving attendance, increasing production, and establishing discipline, focusing the factory's strength on one point and constantly training. In July last year, the goal of "six times increase in production" was promoted. Every worker memorized the slogan of "Donation of money, donation of goods, donation of skills, dedication of self," which resulted in the結晶 (jié jīng - crystallization) of the national defense ship. The establishment of the job title system and the vigorous spiritual movement carried out earlier were unfolding in the factory, and the emergency shipbuilding order also came down during this upsurge. The factory only heard the sound of hard work.

### Conditions for Mass Production

The three shipyards commended by the Minister of the Navy this time are all located far away from the heavy industrial zones of Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, and Kobe, and each has a relatively long history. In terms of production factors such as raw materials, equipment, personnel, power, and factory area, the three factories all occupy excellent positions in terms of geographical conditions.

For example, in the case of the Mitsui Shipbuilding Plant, because there are no large-scale factories and business locations in the prefecture, it is possible to constantly use the setting of power outage days. The quality of workers is also superior to that of cities. The vastness of the factory site is second to none among shipyards, which is a necessary condition for mass production. The ability to make good use of these geographical conditions and adopt measures that are intelligent, far-sighted, and research-oriented can stimulate production. The foresight in material management and the utilization of materials in hand allow materials to circulate smoothly to the shipbuilding and engine manufacturing departments without wasting time waiting for work.

Hirata, the chief engineer of the carpentry factory in the fitting and repair department, often changed the standard ship types. On the premise of employing a large number of female workers, and in order to simplify the work, he classified the original seven drawings into 〇〇 drawings, and even carefully noted each drawer on the drawings. Within three months, two drawings were completed. The deployment of the materials department was completed at this time. Next, the work shift was changed. Soldiers who had returned from the army were selected from the workers and promoted to corporal, sergeant, and non-commissioned officer, and skilled workers were promoted to squad leader to serve as escorts. They retreated to the second line, but due to the regulations within the department, various obstacles arose in personnel matters. Technician Hirata firmly refused to withdraw and, with a large number of drawings and readily available materials, took the lead. The promoted young squad leaders had personally experienced the responsibility of each ship on the battlefield, coupled with vigorous energy, physical strength, and gratitude for their遇 (yù - encountered) the recognition, they risked their lives to carry out new tasks, working hard for three consecutive nights without rest. Their fatigue can be imagined. The female members of the 挺身隊 (tǐng shēn duì - volunteer corps) worked according to the extremely detailed and easy-to-understand drawings. The detailed analysis, the many drawings, and the vitality of the young people ensured that the construction of each ship could proceed on schedule.

### Concentrate All Efforts on New Model Ships

In the engine manufacturing department, the process was thoroughly analyzed, and the work procedures and schedules formulated based on this analysis were made into extremely easy-to-understand drawings and displayed in each workshop. Even newly hired workers remembered the responsibility for the work schedule. This resulted in the simplification and efficiency of work, and the speed competition among the departments. In the shipbuilding department, the focus was on cultivating workers' confidence in new types of ships. Once it was decided to start building a new type of ship in 〇 month, the other ongoing projects were stopped midway, and all efforts were concentrated on the new type of ship. Drilling, installation, welding, and all kinds of work were focused on the new type of ship. Of course, this was a temporary attempt, and this method was not sustainable. However, by concentrating all forces on the new object, completing it before the scheduled date, and launching it, a firm conviction was sown in the factory for the construction of the same type of ships that must be mobilized in large quantities in the future.

In the "National Defense Ship Progress Chart" displayed on the square in front of the factory, the curves of the ship body department and the mechanical department's increased 工數 (gōng shù - man-hours) and the utilization of steel residue have indeed exceeded the ship dedication baseline, showing the盛 (shèng - flourishing) vigor of the entire factory and gradually rising.

### First District Office: Discussing Improvement of Transportation, Transportation Improvement Committee Resolves Three Measures

In order to improve the transportation order within the Ningbo district and to enhance the convenience and safety of citizens in transportation, the First District Office of the city has established a "Transportation Improvement Committee." The committee held its first meeting at 3:00 PM on the 21st of this month in the conference room of the First District Office. The attendees included Chairman Wu (District Chief), standing committee members Zhang Jianchu, Xu Guansan, and Jiang Shoubao Ping, committee members Bo Bian Ding, Chen Shantong, Wu Genyuan, Mr. Fan (Vice Consul, representative of the Japanese Consulate), Mr. Huang Rong (representative of the Municipal Public Works Bureau), and observers Liang Senzhang, Qu Sunyi, Xi Lemin, and Sha Guozheng. The meeting was chaired by Chairman Wu. The important issues raised for discussion included the following: The issue that the police department is somewhat estranged because vehicle licenses are currently issued by the Public Works Bureau, and that the two parties should maintain close contact. Resolved that the Public Works Bureau should send a copy of each vehicle license to the First Police Department for record as soon as possible after issuance. The issue of amending the traffic regulations established by the former Public Works Bureau to facilitate travel. Resolved that the Traffic Section of the First Police Department should draft a proposal within one week, submit it for review, and then submit it to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. The issue of promptly restoring the former rickshaw parking lots, adding parking lots for rickshaws and tricycles, and that empty cars should not be allowed to travel or stop on designated trunk roads in order to maintain traffic order. Resolved that the First Police Department should handle this matter in advance, with the assistance of the Public Works Department to erect parking lot signs. Subsequently, Chairman Wu announced: The establishment of this committee is because the transportation problems in this district urgently need to be improved. It is hoped that all committee members will pay close attention to any issues related to transportation in the future and conduct detailed examinations. This committee will convene a regular meeting every two weeks.

### Joint Graduation Ceremony Held by All Primary and Secondary Schools in the City, Mayor Chen Personally Present to Award Prizes and Deliver Instructions

The second joint graduation ceremony of the municipal primary and secondary schools of this city was solemnly held at the Great Light Grand Theater at 9:30 AM yesterday (24th). Officials present included Mayor Chen, Director of Education Lin Jiong'an, Executive Director of the Education Association Zhou Huarren, Chief of the Education Office of the First District Office Tan Tiankai, President Chen of this newspaper, and guests from all walks of life, as well as more than two thousand graduates from all primary and secondary schools, gathered together, and the mood was熱烈 (rè liè - enthusiastic). The ceremony proceeded as planned. First, Chairman Lin, Director of Education, delivered the opening remarks, followed by Mayor Chen's instructions. The mayor then presented graduation certificates and awarded prizes. Afterwards, the faculty and staff of all municipal primary and secondary schools jointly presented Mayor Chen with a silver鼎 (dǐng - tripod) to express their gratitude. Subsequently, the student representative from Kangle Road Primary School delivered a farewell speech, and the student representative from Maicai Middle School delivered a speech of thanks on behalf of the graduates. Finally, Tan Tiankai delivered the closing remarks, and the entire student body sang the graduation song together. The ceremony concluded at around 11:00 AM. It is also learned that during the summer vacation, the primary and secondary schools in the First District will hold graduation examinations. Xu _, Huang _yin, and Situ Meilan, who achieved the best results, were each awarded a silver shield by Mayor Chen to show encouragement. At the same time, the first graduate of each school also received "Japanese Navy" one book.

Director Lin's speech briefly stated: Today is the second time we are holding the joint graduation ceremony of municipal schools after the recovery of the concessions. A total of seven middle schools and ninety-nine students, and nine primary schools and five hundred and eleven students participated. In the past, education often worshiped Europeanization. In the future, we must重 (zhòng - value) our own country and enhance the national spirit, and work hard with great courage. The teachers of municipal schools are excellent, and the students are excellent. We will surely be able to become门 (mén - a type of scholar) of the new China and revitalize China.

Mayor Chen's speech briefly stated: I would like to take this opportunity to talk to you about a few important issues. Everyone knows that the Chinese people are not stupid, but very smart. Compared to a foreigner, a Chinese person is very good, but compared to several foreigners, the Chinese people seem to be lacking. Now, people in general society say that civil servants and military police have no discipline, but are they not Chinese? Of course they are. They all come from society, schools, and families. They have also received education before. Why do they violate their education? The reason is that the organization is not strict and strong enough, and the usual national修 (xiū - cultivate) is not deep enough, so society has become so chaotic, and discipline has deteriorated. These are the current phenomena. We must not let the second generation continue like this. This responsibility lies with all the faculty and staff and all the younger siblings. The chairman handed over the affairs of the Military Commission to me. Seeing that the discipline of soldiers and officers is not good, they have been educated. Their discipline was very good when they were at school, but it became bad after they left school. This must be because the youth now are full of自由思想 (zì yóu sī xiǎng - free thinking). Once they leave school and come into contact with society, their shortcomings are exposed. A country must be strong, and a good army must start from the陆军小学 (lù jūn xiǎo xué - army primary school). This is my personal opinion, and I hope that parents, in addition to raising their own good children, also安 (ān - understand) how to raise a good citizen.

Furthermore, due to the approaching meeting date and the heavy workload, the office will still be open as usual today, despite it being the Dragon Boat Festival and a Sunday.

### Economy Association to Have Minister Zhang Broadcast Tonight

With the intensification of the war situation in the Datong-Weifang area, the mission of the Shanghai Special City Economy Association to promote national economy and increase production has become even more important.

### Streetcar Workers in the Old No. 1 District Are Discussing a Solution

The labor dispute involving streetcar workers in the old No. 1 district of this city had been satisfactorily resolved through labor-management negotiations, and work was scheduled to resume yesterday morning. However, due to unexpected changes, only lines 1 and 7 resumed normal operations yesterday, while all other lines remained out of service. It is now known that the company is continuing discussions with relevant authorities to find a solution.

### Rice Transportation to Shanghai Still Faces Obstacles in Various Places; Authorities Have Sent Telegrams Ordering Thorough Investigation

Rice merchants in this city are facing restrictions on the transportation of rice from various provinces and cities. After receiving reports, the Rice Management Association telegraphed the Executive Yuan to request instructions. The Executive Yuan issued a general order to the Nanjing Special City and the governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, instructing all counties and districts that the transportation of rice should not be restricted for those holding passports issued by the Rice Management Association, and that assistance should be provided to facilitate regulation. The association recently issued transportation permits for rice in quantities of five dou to ten shi, allowing citizens to freely transport rice to Shanghai from fifteen counties, including Suzhou, Songjiang, Wujiang, Kunshan, Changzhou, Wuxi, Yixing, Changshu, Jiaxing, Qingpu, Jinshan, Jiangyin, Jiashan, and Pinghu. The sample of all permit forms has been sent to the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Security Office, Police Department, Blockade Management Headquarters, China Railway Company, Shanghai Inland Water Transport Company, and offices in various districts, instructing security teams, county police stations, inspection stations, train stations, and preparatory committees of industry associations in various regions to investigate and ensure that those holding the permit are given absolute convenience and not obstructed. However, it has been found that there are still cases of obstruction in places such as Wuxi, Jiaxing, and Jiashan, which is a blatant disregard for government orders and the people's food supply. After receiving the report, the authorities have sent telegrams to the relevant agencies to thoroughly investigate and deal with the matter. The rice quantity on the passports and permits issued by the Rice Management Committee is based on the production volume of each rice-producing area, taking into account local consumption, and only allowing transportation of the surplus, which does not affect the local food supply. Therefore, the authorities believe that the obstructions along the way are suspected of undermining the law. Once verified, the offenders will be punished according to the law in order to ensure the stability of the grain policy.

The Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp, from the start of preparations, has been actively proceeding. The work service of the camp is limited to "rural labor", and the camp site must be located in the suburbs. Therefore, personnel have been sent to various places to survey, and the old site of the Zhongzheng Camp (near Huacao Town), more than twenty li from the city, is considered the most suitable. The camp's board of directors has submitted a request to the city government for allocation. The old site of the Zhongzheng Camp covers more than 300 mu, but was completely destroyed during the incident, with bricks and wood being dismantled. More than 100 mu suitable for planting have already been illegally cultivated. The rubble field that requires more effort is still abandoned, which is a pity. Therefore, it is very appropriate to allocate this place as the site of the labor camp. It is reported that the city government has ordered the Fourth District Office to investigate and reply to the original submission of the camp's board of directors, and it is bound to be allocated smoothly.

### Reader Scholarship News: Collecting Sample Test Questions from Various Schools

The seventh session of the newspaper's reader scholarship application has been selectively recommended by various schools, and the number of applications from each school is limited, so at least 90% of the applicants are indeed impoverished and excellent, and worthy of subsidy. However, because tuition fees will inevitably increase significantly in the next semester, based on the amount of donations received, it is feared that only 20% to 30% can be subsidized. Now, the only way is to make every effort to raise more donations so that more students can be helped, and the other is to prepare for a preliminary examination to ensure a fair selection. The office is now requesting sample test questions from various schools for reference. For all grades above the fourth grade of elementary school and various subjects in junior and senior high school, as well as test questions for general subjects (Chinese, English, Mathematics) in universities, we hope that schools will provide a copy and indicate the grade level. If possible, please add the percentage of correct answers per question to show its difficulty. The purpose of collecting these test questions is to ensure that the questions are appropriate for the level of each grade, and we believe that schools will support this. Please indicate "Test Questions" on the envelope and send it to the scholarship office of this newspaper.

This morning, the fifth academic lecture series will be held at 10:00 AM at Huizhong Middle School in Xieqiao. Mr. Xu Fengshi will be the speaker, and the topic will be "Chemistry and Life." Those who have listening tickets are requested to arrive on time.

### Gold Speculators' Trial Postponed

On February 10th and March 8th of this year, the First Police Station arrested eighteen gold trading speculators, including Tang Shiqing, Chen Zhonghan, Hui Huisheng, Wang Wenhai, Chen Zhinian, Shi Hong, Su Changshu, Xu Songyan, Song Yaohua, Zheng Yingquan, Yao Xingnong, Li Wenshu, Ji Ziqing, Xu Changnian, Zhang Liang, Jin Yibao, Bai Zongchun, and Pan Qiaosheng. They were transferred to the Shanghai Local Procuratorate and detained. After investigation, they were transferred to the local court for trial. Judge Fu once interrogated them, but because the trial could not be concluded, it was postponed. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the continued trial, but because it is still necessary to investigate whether gold is a major commodity under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry and whether gold is one of the "five metals" that are major commodities, the defendants were brought to the court but not interrogated. The court then postponed the trial again.

### Central District Vehicle Traffic Sets Rules

The First Police Bureau of this city, in order to strengthen traffic order and maintain pedestrian safety, has specially formulated temporary rules for vehicle traffic and temporary penalty regulations for traffic police, which will be implemented from today. A reporter recently interviewed Lu Qi, the administrative director of the First Police Bureau, who said, "Due to the dense population in this city, the traffic situation has always been complex. Since the emergence of tricycles and the elimination of the original boundaries for the operation of public and private vehicles after the takeover of the concessions, the central area has become even more crowded with vehicles. The Police Bureau has been paying close attention from the beginning and has been rectifying and cracking down at any time under the principle of convenience for the public. However, the traffic order problem is becoming increasingly serious, especially in the roads in the central area. In general, drivers of eastern vehicles neglect traffic rules and drive arbitrarily, causing traffic order to be chaotic. In view of this situation, this bureau has to take effective countermeasures, and decided to stipulate temporary regulations for the operation of the Xuan Dynasty, prohibiting the operation and parking of two-wheeled vehicles and rickshaws (empty) on various roads in the central area, such as Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, West Road, and Ningxia Road; and prohibiting the parking of tricycles and rickshaws (empty) on Sichuan Road, Fuzhou Road, Jiangxi Road, and Henan Road, because tricycles and rickshaws (empty) are most likely to hinder the traffic order, and drivers of tricycles and rickshaws are also the least likely to pay attention to traffic rules. In addition, temporary penalty regulations for traffic violations have been stipulated, and specific penalties have been set for vehicles that block traffic and violate traffic rules, and the original fines will be doubled for those who violate other regulations, so that they will know what to be vigilant about. All the temporary regulations for the operation of vehicle traffic and the temporary penalty regulations for traffic police will be announced and implemented in the next few days, and the traffic police of each branch will strictly enforce them, and personnel will be dispatched at any time to strictly supervise the traffic-intensive services to ensure that the regulations are thoroughly implemented, but on the one hand, the cooperation of citizens is still needed. I went to "" last month to inspect the police administration, and the traffic situation in Tokyo is complicated, but there are no "" traffic police, and pedestrians and vehicles are proceeding in an orderly manner, with no "". This shows that the progress of the country and the popularization of people's education have been fully demonstrated in terms of traffic order."

### Traffic Regulations

The First Police Bureau has specially formulated temporary traffic regulations in order to maintain traffic safety. The following is an excerpt: It is strictly forbidden for all tricycles (public or private) and rickshaws (public or private) empty to pass on the following designated trunk roads. Any such vehicles with passengers should turn into the nearest side road after passengers disembark on the following trunk roads, and should not turn around or linger. If the side road (such as the intersection of Nanjing Road and West Factory Road) is also one of the designated trunk roads, the empty car should turn into the nearest side road again, but this restriction does not apply to empty cars crossing trunk roads. First Trunk Road: Nanjing Road (the section from the Bund to West Factory Road), Second Trunk Road: Jing'an Temple Road (the section from West Factory Road to Huangpi Road), Third Trunk Road: Xizang Road (the section from Great Shanghai Road to Beijing Road), Fourth Trunk Road: Ningxia Road (the section from Great Shanghai Road to Yushan Road). It is absolutely forbidden to park any empty cars in the following designated sections: Fuzhou Road (the section from Sichuan Road to Xizang Road), Henan Road (the section from Great Shanghai Road to Suzhou Road), Jiangxi Road (the section from Great Shanghai Road to Beijing Road), Sichuan Road (the section from Great Shanghai Road to Xianzhou Road). (Note 1) The restrictions on Jiangxi Road and Sichuan Road do not apply on Saturday afternoons and Sundays. (Note 2) Military and police vehicles are not subject to this restriction. (Note 3) During the period of implementation of the temporary traffic regulations, all "parking spaces" for tricycles and rickshaws stipulated on the above-mentioned trunk roads in the first and second items shall not apply.

### National Forum: The Erroneous Concept of Choosing a College

— By Ling Huajian

— Dedicated to this year's high school graduates

Based on many years of schooling experience, I feel that the average high school graduate has a wrong concept of choosing a college. This concept and its consequences can be discussed in two aspects:

(1) Most students who think they are naturally gifted, do not seek to improve themselves, and aim to obtain a diploma, choose colleges such as literature and commerce, because they can have easy courses and a leisurely life. As a result, after four years, a group of unlearned people, who pay attention to "style", American-style empty talk politicians, writing literary figures, hoarding bankers, etc. are created.

(2) Generally, thoughtful students, in view of the country's poverty and the backwardness of industry and scientists, many choose colleges such as engineering and physics, with the intention of serving the country in the future. As a result, many have lung diseases, and many have become bookworms who do not know the outside world, and still have little benefit to the country and the nation.

Of course, there are also good students in each college who truly understand the true meaning of learning; however, we must correct the mistakes of most students, because there is no doubt about the prosperity and strength of a country; however, the development of industry and science cannot be achieved without a political and economic environment that is on the right track. From this point of view, the responsibility of politics and economics is more important than that of students in engineering and science, and now these two colleges are full of muddled people. How can they be asked to take the fundamental responsibility of improving the national environment? At the same time, a group of promising young people are sacrificing their lives by studying hard. How can we expect the country to become prosperous and strong in the future? The remedy can also be discussed in two aspects:

(1) Improve the standards of literature and business colleges and implement strict moral and physical training, so that confused and lazy people cannot mix in them and harm the society and the country in the future.

(2) Engineering and science colleges may as well tend to utilitarianism, focusing on practical science, and within the possible scope, they may as well slightly ignore the overly profound pure science theory, so that students can have time to engage in activities that enhance their physical fitness.

This is just a general idea. A detailed improvement plan still needs to be formulated by educators. If improved according to this method, the wealth of the country and the strength of the nation can be achieved soon. (Moved to help school)

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang

Naval Painter (7)

Takafusa took a small sip of the beer that was brought over, and Kanjito also had a glass, so a thin layer of red hung on his face, and happily put down his fork and said:

"I knew you came to Tokyo to be a painter, to be honest..."

"How did you know?"

Takafusa unconsciously spoke a dialectal phrase. Kanjito also said in his native dialect:

"Not long ago, the warship Isuzu came to visit, and that's how I found out you were in Tokyo. It just so happens that you've changed your appearance, and you've grown your hair long, so even if I ran into you, I might not have dared to recognize you."

The two of them later began to speak standard Mandarin.

"Then did my father tell you about my purpose in studying art?"

"Oh, I heard. He said you wanted to be a marine painter. You liked the sea when you were little, didn't you?"

"No, I don't want to be a marine painter anymore. I want to be a naval painter."

"You want to be a naval painter?"

"Yes, I want to depict the spirit and beauty of the navy. I paint warships, and I paint naval battles.... At the same time, I also paint soldiers.... Some people say that's advertising art, and I really don't understand."

Takafusa wiped the beer foam off his lips, still upset about what he had just said, but Kanjito didn't understand.

"But your father said that people hate the navy and that's why you became a painter..."

"Let's not talk about that! I'm a little embarrassed."

Takafusa pushed his long hair up to the top of his head and said, "Once a man makes up his mind, it's not easy to change it again. Although I've made up my mind, my reason doesn't agree with me. Maybe I'm still an immature person. Now that I can't be a naval officer, I want to be a naval painter. Once I made this decision, it was as if a hundred-year dream had awakened. From now on, I plan to study the navy for the rest of my life, so Kanjito, please help me!"

"I'm afraid I can't help. As long as I can help, I'll do anything. But now it's good, there was a time when I was very worried about you, and I couldn't even sleep at night."

"I'm really sorry. Kanjito, although I extremely admire you, I didn't want to write to you."

"But how is your health?"

"It's strange to say, although I failed the naval academy and naval radar and other schools, and even failed the conscription, I haven't been sick once since I came to Tokyo. My body may not be suitable for a soldier, but it's always okay for a painter."

Takafusa said this, and Kanjito responded with a hearty laugh. And unconsciously, they returned to the way they were five years ago, talking freely and openly. (106)

### Let's Talk About How to Eat Miscellaneous Grains

Adzuki beans, soybeans, buckwheat, barley, corn, etc. are all miscellaneous grains that can fill the stomach. Eating them is also very nutritious for the body. Adzuki beans and soybeans can be mixed with rice after they have plumped up (immersed in water for a day or a night), when cooking rice or porridge, about a pound can offset the amount of half a liter of white rice.

Barley and buckwheat can be cooked and eaten alone. There are several ways to eat them: (1) Grind them into fine powder, stir-fry them, and mix them with boiling water. (2) Grind them into wheat grits, bring the water to a boil, and then pour the wheat grits down to cook them (about a bowl of water can be mixed with five spoons of wheat grits). (3) Grind the wheat into small pieces, which can be cooked with rice, and it is very sticky.

There are two kinds of corn flour: fine powder and crushed grains. Crushed grains can be cooked with porridge and rice. Fine powder can be mixed with a small amount of flour and "baking soda" to make cakes, or it can be stir-fried, spooned into the mouth, and washed down with some boiling water. It can also be mixed evenly with cold water, poured into a pot, and cooked with vegetables to become corn paste, which is also very filling. If corn flour is used to cook porridge and rice, one pound can offset the amount of seven hectoliters of white rice. (Hu Changxin)
