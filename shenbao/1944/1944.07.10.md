### Increasing Education Funding

The increase in tuition fees for all levels of schools starting next semester has already been decided. The amount of tuition is "said to be based on the rice price in August, a certain amount of斗 for elementary school, a certain amount of 斗 for middle school, and a certain amount of 斗 for university. Looking at the current situation of rice grain control and purchase, stabilizing rice prices is certainly impossible, and the amount purchased is extremely small, which is not good for the country or the people. However, the black market rice price has instead increased. If this situation continues, imagine what the rice price will be in August, and what the tuition fees will be next semester. It is truly chilling. Countless people with aspirations to study but without the ability to pay can only sigh outside the school gates. Those who remain in school are only a small number of people who can afford to pay but do not necessarily have the ambition to study. The aristocracy of schools can be said to have reached its peak.

The majority of common people do not have the opportunity to receive education. This is a loss for the nation, a loss for the country and the people, and a responsibility that the government should bear. At this critical moment, a wise government should, during this summer vacation, on the one hand, actively adjust schools, allowing those with substantial content to continue operating and immediately closing those without. On the other hand, it should increase subsidies for education funding, so that excellent teachers can have a stable life and poor students will not lose the opportunity to study. Officials in charge of education and finance, this is the only opportunity to serve the country and the nation, and to serve future generations. People born in a great era must do some great things, and the government in a great era has an inescapable duty.

Educating the people is the foundation of any country. All citizens have the right to be educated, and after receiving education, they all have the obligation to serve the country. Therefore, civilized countries mostly have compulsory and free elementary education, the so-called compulsory national education. For middle schools and universities, there are also public schools with extremely low fees, thus enabling outstanding children from poor families to pursue further studies. Why does the country do this? Because in this way, the next generation of citizens can be more excellent than the previous generation, and the next generation of the country and nation can be more advanced than the previous generation. Excellent citizens create progressive countries, and progressive countries can last forever. Unprogressive countries will inevitably decline. The strength of Japan and Germany is the result of excellent citizens and the achievement of emphasizing education. There are countless examples of countries becoming prosperous through education in world history.

Every penny the country spends on education is an extra foundation for the country and an extra boost of new strength for the next generation of citizens. The government should not allow the high commercialization of private educational institutions. While cracking down, it must also provide assistance. The government should not sit idly by and watch young people drop out of school without helping. It must find ways to provide relief. Supporting educational undertakings is a need for everyone, and increasing education funding is even more approved by everyone. Therefore, even if the government borrows money to increase education funding, it is just like parents borrowing money for their children's education, and there is the same urgent need.

### Japanese Planes Bomb Enemy Fleet Vigorously; Hand-to-Hand Combat Unfolds on Saipan; 14 Enemy Planes Shot Down in Attack on Omiya Island

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch from a Japanese military base in the Central Pacific): Fierce hand-to-hand combat is now unfolding everywhere on Saipan Island. In response to this battle, Japanese artillery positions on Tinian Island bombarded Aslito Airfield on Saipan Island fiercely on the night of the 6th. Furthermore, Japanese air units also bombed enemy positions, airfields, and other locations on Saipan Island at dawn on the 8th. In particular, they accurately bombed enemy positions southwest of Mount Tapochau, even under resistance from enemy night fighters and intense artillery fire. Meanwhile, late at night on the 6th, Japanese air units launched a fierce attack on enemy cruiser and destroyer groups southeast of Saipan Island.

Japanese military base in the Central Pacific, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): On the 6th, around 50 enemy carrier-based planes attacked Omiya Island. Local Japanese forces shot down 6 of them, repelling the attack. On the 7th, approximately 70 more enemy planes attacked, and 8 were shot down. Japanese losses during these two days were minimal.

### War Situation of Japanese Troops in Various Parts of East Asia in the Past Week

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): The war situation in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere over the past week is as follows:

Northern Front

There were no major changes in this area. A total of 25 enemy planes attacked in late June. Enemy forces in the Central Pacific and Aleutian Islands have been reinforced, so vigilance should be maintained.

China Front

Japanese troops in Hunan are advancing south along the Yuehan Railway. They occupied Hengyang Airfield on the 3rd, and the westward-advancing forces occupied Shenyong on the 4th and are still attacking. In South China, Japanese troops suddenly launched a northward attack on June 27, and successively captured key points such as Longhua Market, Longmen, Conghua, and Qingyuan between July 1st and 4th. Another unit occupied Xinning Qian, a strategic point of Heng Keshan, on June 29th. Furthermore, Japanese troops dispatched from Shanghai attacked Quzhou. After completing their objective, they returned to their original state. The results of the battle up to the 2nd are as follows: Japanese troops recovered 5,080 corpses of Chongqing troops, captured 664 prisoners, seized 25 artillery pieces, 131 heavy and light machine guns, 330 rifles, and a large amount of ammunition. In addition, the Japanese Air Force launched several sudden attacks on Zhijiang, southwest of Chaonan, on the 3rd, destroying 6 enemy planes on the ground and damaging 3. Another team of Japanese planes bombed Changde. On the 4th, they launched a surprise attack on Badong in Sichuan and Xi'an in Shaanxi. On the 8th, more than ten enemy planes flying from China intruded into western Kyushu. However, due to the Japanese air defense array, the enemy failed to achieve their aim and fled.

Burma Front

Enemy troops, in order to open up the Kohima Highway, brought in supplies and attacked desperately. On June 23, the Japanese army secured all key points at the 5797 Highlands east of Mytkyina. Furthermore, the Japanese troops guarding the key points southwest of Bishenpur inflicted heavy damage on the attacking enemy. (In the Bailel area) Japanese troops secured the northeastern highlands and repelled the counterattacking enemy troops. Enemy troops in the Mytkyina area began a counterattack on the evening of June 28, but the Japanese troops inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. Also, in late June, enemy planes attacked Thailand and Vietnam twenty-one times, with a total of thirty planes.

South Pacific

Although the key stronghold of Biak Island was occupied by the enemy, Japanese troops charged into the enemy's position with a small force. On the 2nd, under the protection of heavy enemy naval guns and aircraft, the enemy landed on Bombay Island. The western part of Biak Island seems to have been occupied by the enemy. In Rabaul, Solomon Islands, from June 29 to July 5, a cumulative total of 588 enemy planes attacked. The Japanese defenders on the island maintained high morale and fiercely fought back against the enemy. During the same period, a cumulative total of 124 enemy planes attacked Kavieng, and a cumulative total of 26 enemy planes attacked the Buka area. From June 29 to July 5, the Japanese-held area in southern Bougainville Island was attacked by a cumulative total of 289 enemy planes.

Central Pacific

The land battle on Saipan Island is currently raging in the Garapan Tapochau area. According to the Japanese headquarters announcement on the 6th, the enemy, under the cover of aircraft, warships, and artillery fire, invaded Japanese-held territory. The Japanese Air Force, responding to the valiant fighting of the ground forces on Saipan Island, has been bombing enemy warships and transport convoys cruising in the waters near the enemy's positions on the island for days. From June 20 to 30, the confirmed results of the battle include the sinking of 1 enemy battleship, 3 cruisers, 2 destroyers, and 2 transport ships; the destruction of 2 aircraft carriers, 2 destroyers, and 5 transport ships; and the shooting down of 211 enemy planes. Currently, a strong enemy fleet is still cruising in the Mariana Sea. Moreover, there is a mobile unit centered on makeshift aircraft carriers operating near the sulfur mining island of Iwo Jima in the Ogasawara Islands and near Omiya Island. The enemy often attacks with large aircraft. The Japanese Air Force bombed enemy positions on Saipan Island fiercely, causing fires at two locations near the airfield. On the night of the 1st, they bombed Aslito Airfield, destroying 5 enemy planes. Also, a Japanese reconnaissance plane discovered an enemy submarine in the waters west of the Mariana Islands during daylight on the 1st and bombed it. Currently, the enemy air force is intensifying its bombing of Aslito Airfield, gradually increasing its strength. The situation on the island has become serious. Along with the changes in the battle situation on Saipan Island, the activities of enemy mobile units have become increasingly active. On the 1st, they attacked Tinian, Omiya Island, and Rota Island with 50 to 70 planes. On the 3rd, several enemy cruisers attacked Omiya Island and shelled it, and 30 planes bombed the island. Around the same time, about 10 enemy planes attacked Rota Island. An enemy mobile unit appeared in the waters near Iwo Jima on the 3rd and engaged in combat with Japanese forces for two days. Also, a cumulative total of hundreds of enemy planes attacked Iwo Jima, and several enemy cruisers and destroyers shelled the island.

### Rainy Season Defense and Offense on the India-Burma Front

The India-Burma front has entered the true rainy season. At present, the Japanese army is continuing its superhuman "offensive without a rainy season" on various fronts, braving thunder and torrential rain. Recent news from the front lines indicates that hand-to-hand combat is taking place continuously for every inch of land. Therefore, while the war appears to be in a stalemate on the surface, fierce defensive and offensive battles are actually unfolding.

Just in terms of the rainy season, the rainy season on the border now is very different from our mainland's "plum rain." However, the start of the rainy season varies somewhat in time. The area around Imphal, which has now become a decisive battlefield, entered the rainy season from the end of April this year, and the area around Fort White from the beginning of May. Every year from then until the end of October, they are trapped by constant heavy rain for the length of the lunar year.

From then on, the amount of rain falling in a single day can often equal one-third of the annual rainfall in Japan. Bridges and roads are washed away. Engineering teams challenge the turbid currents, wading up to their waists in the mud. The bodies of the trucks slide. First-line supplies are carried out in this situation.

The planting of rice seedlings in Rangoon-Mergui at this time may be suitable for plants, but for human life, it is truly unbearably bad. The general temperature is 32 to 37 degrees Celsius. When the rain subsides slightly and one puts on a military uniform, the clothes have already grown bugs. Injuries, cholera, dysentery, fever, and various epidemics are endless. Airfields turn into a vast expanse of water, and the number of planes gradually decreases.

In the past, battles in this area, once the rainy season began, would no longer be actively offensive, but this time is an exception, with the launch of a rainy season offensive. Because the enemy's attempt to open up the Kohima-Imphal highway has not been successful, they are relying on their large amount of supplies and the cover of a strong air force to carry out a counteroffensive against the strong air force outposts. The Japanese army is meeting them everywhere, and the enemy has not succeeded. The enemy on the Bailel front is using the natural hazards of the terrain and launching desperate counterattacks from fortified positions, especially attempting to strike the Japanese army's flanks from near the Kognoma-Nungshigum crossroads. The elite Japanese troops, braving all kinds of hardships, are repeatedly conducting human-bullet night raids. In recent days, the enemy's main force has quietly retreated.

Once the rainy season enters the Bishenpur area, the enemy's air transport capacity into the Imphal plains decreases. In this air space, the enemy is gradually feeling the pressure. The Buyit area is also suffering from the disaster of the rainy season. The enemy is using airborne units to drop new American-style Chongqing troops to desperately reinforce the New First Army, which is on the verge of being isolated in the area, and is trying to establish communication with the Chongqing Expeditionary Force crossing the Nu River. In the Mytkyina area, the enemy is attempting to reinforce with new sharp troops to reverse the decline. The Japanese side is also gradually increasing new sharp units, and hand-to-hand combat will soon unfold.

In short, the stalemate seen on each front is actually a characteristic of rainy season warfare caused by the obstruction of harsh natural conditions. The enemy, the British and Americans, are disregarding these harsh conditions. They are still determined to recapture northern Burma and open up the Ledo Road. Recently, they have been treating the India-Burma front and the Pacific front equally, replenishing fighter planes, artillery pieces, tanks, and combatants. Near Kohima, as many as 5,000 artillery shells are fired in a single day. According to enemy broadcasts, "The anti-Japanese forces are attacking the Japanese army fiercely in the rainy season, turning into an unexpected bloody battle," admitting the difficulty of the operation.

In conclusion, the rainy season defense and offense on the India-Burma front not only truly reflects the depth of the current war situation, but also, because this battle requires overcoming harsh natural conditions in order to carry out operations, it has a great influence on the current situation of the East Asian war.

### Japanese Air Force Attacks Ganzhou Airfield; Xincheng Airfield Also Heavily Damaged

Japanese military base, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): On the night of the 7th, a squadron of Japanese Air Force bombers bombed the forward base of the Chongqing-US Air Force, Ganzhou Airfield, and Xincheng Airfield, 25 kilometers east of Ganzhou, inflicting heavy damage. The squadron bombing Ganzhou Airfield, amid intense artillery fire from the Chongqing-US forces, fiercely bombed the gliding runways and shelters of the airfield, destroying two fighter planes, damaging five fighter planes, and damaging one large bomber. In addition, they also destroyed many military facilities. Furthermore, the squadron of Japanese planes that attacked Xincheng Airfield bombed its gliding runways, rendering them unusable for a considerable period of time. In both of these operations, the Japanese planes returned to their defense safely.

Enemy Planes Invade the Airspace of Lianyungang

Qingdao, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): At 1:30 AM on the 8th, an unidentified enemy plane intruded into the airspace of the Lianyungang area in Huaihai Province. Regarding this matter, the Qingdao Special Naval Base Headquarters announced the following: At 1:37 AM on the 8th, an unidentified enemy plane (three engines) invaded from the west and blindly bombed the Lianyungang area, dropping all its bombs into the sea. It fled at 1:55 AM. Local land facilities and city streets suffered no damage.

Enemy Planes Attack Anqing Unsuccessfully

Central China, Japanese dispatch, military base, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): Three enemy B-25 bombers and four P-51 fighter planes attacked Anqing at around 12:30 PM on the 7th of this month. They were intercepted by Japanese army and navy air defense squadrons and were unsuccessful. Two enemy fighter planes were shot down (one of which has not yet been confirmed), and the rest escaped into the clouds. Japanese losses were minimal.

Results Achieved by Japanese Troops in Western Hebei

Shijiazhuang, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): The comprehensive results achieved by the Japanese army and the security forces in Hebei Province in the western Hebei area in June are as follows: Number of engagements: 57; total number of Communist bandits: 7,905; corpses collected: 355; prisoners captured: 291; seized rifles: 178; ammunition: 235; pistols: 10; ammunition: 126; hand grenades: 33; foreign cannons: 75; landmines: 69; destroyed facilities: 164.

The Defeat of Chongqing Troops Affects the Overall Situation

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): The Japanese army's offensive on the China front has had a great impact on the anti-Axis camp. According to a London dispatch, the British "New Statesman" weekly pointed out on the 8th that the defeat of the Chongqing troops has had a great impact on the war situation. The gist of it is that the Chongqing troops hardly resisted. In the current new operation launched by the Japanese army along the Yuehan Railway, if the Japanese army's offensive continues at the current speed, then the Chinese mainland will soon be cut in two, and the Japanese army will be able to secure the land transportation line from Manchuria to South China. Once Hengyang falls, the forward base of the anti-Axis air force will be lost, and the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing will not be able to continue to provide effective assistance to Chongqing.

### Chongqing Army and People Deeply Moved by Sino-Japanese Statement

Hankou, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch from Chongqing): Since the Chinese and Japanese governments simultaneously issued statements, the entire army and people were deeply moved after the news reached Chongqing. The Chongqing army and people had long been doubtful about the blind resistance, especially regarding the various atrocities committed by the British and American troops in Chongqing, which were even more infuriating. The Sino-Japanese statement declared that the common target of combat was to destroy the ambitions of the British and Americans to dominate East Asia, not to annex China. Therefore, they deeply realized that those who were truly aggressing against China and East Asia were the British and Americans, not Japan. Therefore, the anti-war sentiment is currently extremely low. The atmosphere of peace is becoming increasingly strong in various places. They were especially encouraged by the statement issued by the National Government. The leaders of Chongqing were deeply disturbed by this situation and, despite their painstaking efforts to use their tricks, the people's desire for peace was overwhelming, and their sinister schemes only served to highlight their futile efforts.

### Burmese Government Cables Congratulations to Bose

Rangoon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): On the occasion of the "Anniversary Celebration Week of the Inauguration of Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India," the Burmese government sent a telegram of congratulations to Mr. Bose. The gist of it was that His Excellency, with his unparalleled talent and the qualifications of a leader, has made these two years not only the most noteworthy years in Indian history but also in the entire history of East Asia. For the sake of the future of the entire East Asia, we earnestly hope that India will gain freedom as soon as possible, and at the same time, we earnestly hope that Your Excellency will maintain your health and give strength and opportunity for success to the most valuable and greatest cause of the present world.

### German Troops Fight with All Their Might; Caen Becomes a Ruin; US Troops Launch a Corresponding Offensive

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): The German military authorities announced that British troops had continuously shelled the city of Caen from the night of the 7th to the 8th, and the city has been reduced to ruins. It is generally believed that this shelling of Caen by the British troops is the prelude to a new offensive. British bomber squadrons also fiercely bombed German positions on both sides and south of Caen on the 7th.

Stockholm, Sweden, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): Reuter's news agency reports that British and Canadian patrol teams and tank convoys advanced to the west bank of the Orne River in the center of Caen last night.

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): Since the British army began its new offensive in the Caen area, fierce battles have unfolded on the entire front line from Caen to La Haye-du-Puits in the western Cotentin Peninsula. The British Second Army in the Caen area has placed its emphasis on the semicircular front line seven miles west of the city and is currently continuing its fierce offensive with all its might. Meanwhile, German troops are repeatedly attacking with heavy weapons south and southwest of the city. Currently, the two armies are continuing a seesaw battle one and a half miles from the center of the city. Furthermore, near Saint-Lo, eight miles north of Caen, on the Carentan-Périers road, and in the city of La Haye-du-Puits, the offensive and defensive battles at the center of the war have gradually intensified. Furthermore, according to a report from a German staff officer, the anti-Axis forces' operational plans have been frustrated due to the fierce resistance of the German troops in the Normandy bridgehead on the 8th.

One Enemy Battleship Heavily Damaged by Bombing

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): The German air force bombed an enemy main battleship last night, resulting in the ship being heavily damaged. The ship unexpectedly fired back and ran aground outside the mouth of the Orne River.

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): Responsible sources revealed that a large number of anti-Axis warships have gathered at the mouth of the Orne River and have been greatly reinforced in the past 24 hours. There are at least about 20 enemy transport ships there, in addition to countless tank landing ships. The air force has also densely deployed barrage balloons to prevent air raids.

### Collection of Scrap Metal to Be Managed by the Ministry of Industry

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): The National Government authorities have formulated measures for collecting scrap metal, which were approved by the Executive Yuan meeting on March 21st this year and entrusted to the New Life Movement and other relevant agencies to implement, launching meticulous work. Recently, supplementary measures for the collection of scrap metal have been formulated, ordering the Ministry of Industry to be the central agency in charge of the collection, and a meeting will be held at the ministry on the 10th. The New Life Movement will be invited to discuss the matter internally.

### Lin Xuanzhang's Broadcast to Chongqing: "Striving for an Initiative-Taking Way Out"

(Continued) Not only that, but in Chongqing, there are also people like Lu Baiming who belong to the left wing. On the one hand, they unite with the Communist Party to foster opposition, and on the other hand, they entice Mr. Chiang to accept so-called democratic demands. However, in the Communist Party's strategic decisions, these people are only regarded as petty-bourgeois democrats, no different from the die-hard conservatives and reactionaries of the right wing. The Communist Party itself has made it clear that it will never again be a song and dance troupe for opportunists, but will only use these opportunists as temporary allies in the anti-Chiang struggle. Once there is an opportunity, after the struggle, they must immediately put forward their own demands. From the very beginning, distrust should not be placed on the reactionary parties that have been overthrown. On the contrary, it should be placed on the comrades who have always united with them. I wonder what these so-called left-wing opportunists think of these original resolutions. When we read them, we really feel sorry for them.

War is an extension of politics. When a war breaks out, no one is willing to say that it is for the sake of war. They always want to raise a political banner to call for support, but in fact, it is very ridiculous. For example, Britain and the United States are fighting under the banner of democracy, claiming to be anti-fascist. However, because of the war, the internal political institutions and economic systems of Britain and the United States have been conquered by fascism step by step, losing the spirit of democracy. Roosevelt and Churchill are calling out every day. Those Americans and British who love freedom and democracy are fighting against Hitler and Mussolini, who are fascists. If Americans and British truly love freedom and democracy, shouldn't they quickly rise up and overthrow Roosevelt and Churchill, who are becoming fascists? To give another example, the Soviet Union is fighting against fascism under the banner of communism. Again, once the war started, the Third International was abolished, and the Internationale was also abolished, replaced by a new Soviet national anthem to replace the Internationale. The Internationale is the song most loved by the Chinese Communist Party. I don't know if they can still sing this new song. Inside, it is full of the motherland's freedom and independence, without a single word about communism or the proletariat. It seems that fascism has not been overthrown, and communism is no longer needed. As for our China, ten years of suppressing the Communists have resulted in the situation we have today. The longer the war drags on, the more powerful the Communist Party becomes. How can we clean up the mess in the end?

It is said that Mr. Chiang is not unaware of the difficulties of continuing the war and the unreliability of Britain and the United States, but he has reached a point of no return. He is in a dilemma, and has no other choice but to let others control him and continue the war. We believe that this is of course a blow from the failure of tailism. Such plans will only become deeper and deeper, and the deeper they go, the more difficult it will be to extricate themselves. To extricate themselves, they must immediately recognize the trap of Britain and the United States and strive to take the initiative. Now there is a clear and bright road to save China and protect East Asia. Why abandon it and instead willingly fall into the trap of Britain and the United States and bind themselves?

It is also said that Mr. Chiang is not unwilling to seek peace, but he also believes that a third party is needed to guarantee it. We must raise three points here, hoping that Chongqing will pay attention to them. First, there have been too many painful experiences in diplomatic history over the decades with this so-called third-party guarantee method. Second, the relationship between China and Japan is a matter for the two major nations of China and Japan, and the handling of the East Asian situation is a matter for the East Asian nations. Why should we be at the mercy of others? Third, the greatest guarantee of peace and friendship is, first, sincerity, and second, strength. Only when both sides show sincerity and establish the principle of co-existence and co-prosperity, and also show strength to maintain this principle, can there be a great guarantee. One's own destiny, the most reliable thing is one's own sincerity and one's own strength. The most reliable thing about a common destiny is also common sincerity and common strength. So-called sincerity is relative, not one-sided. If one wants to rely on others, it is nothing more than trickery and tactics. So-called strength, Japan's strength, Japan's strength is not only the strength to protect Japan, but also the strength to protect East Asia, which no one can deny. This strength should be cherished. We, too, must have the strength to do our part in order to be qualified to share responsibility, and this strength should also be cherished. If we lose even this little capital, and we have no basis of our own, how can we talk about co-existence?

Fellow generals, comrades, and compatriots in Chongqing, given your current situation and mood, I really don't want to say much. However, for the sake of the safety of the country and the nation, and for the future of East Asia, I must speak. What I have said are all realistic situations, without a single point that can cause debate. I don't know if it's high-sounding or low-key. High-sounding and low-key theories are of no help to reality. I only deeply hope that everyone recognizes the seriousness of the current situation, recognizes the development of the war, recognizes their own motherland, recognizes neighboring Japan, recognizes common East Asia, recognizes Japan's strength, recognizes the true meaning of Japan, and recognizes the independent way out that we should strive for. (End) The missing words and sentences in Minister Lin's broadcast speech yesterday are supplemented below: For ritualistic country (Do they understand in their hearts that such a "war of resistance" has become...a war of resistance?) Also discussing the situation (dangerous intentions), also currency (raising), also corvée labor, etc., also conspiracies (emerging), also want to (use troops?) (Central News Agency)

### Director Huang's Broadcast Yesterday

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) Director Huang of the Guidance Department of the Propaganda Department, gave a special broadcast at the Central Broadcasting Station at 9:20 p.m. yesterday, entitled "A Message to Compatriots in the Southwest."

### Contending for Vilnius: Street Fighting in Progress; German Troops Retreating West from Baranavichy

Stockholm, Sweden, 9th (Central News Agency) The Eastern Front battle situation, centered on the areas of Kovel, Baranavichy, Vilnius, along the Vilnius-Daugavpils railway, and the five main battle areas of Daugavpils-Pskov, has become increasingly intense. The battle situation in each area is added as follows: In the Kovel area, according to German sources, Soviet troops attacked German positions along the Bug River west of Kovel with five divisions of riflemen and one group of tanks, but failed. German troops have withdrawn from the city of Baranavichy (an important railway hub southwest of Minsk, within the old Polish border). However, Soviet troops are aiming their offensive at the cities of Bialystok and Brest-Litovsk and are continuing to fight fiercely west of Baranavichy. In the Vilnius area, the greatest focus of the Soviet offensive is the city of Vilnius. According to the latest news, street fighting is continuing in the city. According to German estimates, the Soviet forces in the area consist of seven motorized rifle divisions and four tank groups. Along the Vilnius-Daugavpils railway, although Soviet troops have worked hard to cut off the railway, according to German front-line news, German troops are fighting bravely along the railway, and Soviet troops have not yet succeeded. German authorities claim that German troops on the Southern Front have retreated to the west of the Pripyat River.

### Yesterday was the 7th Air Defense Day; Various Drills Held; City's Mood Quite Tense and Enthusiastic

Yesterday (9th) was the seventh Air Defense Day. The Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command and the Shanghai Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters held various air defense drills to make the public proficient in various air defense measures. The details are recorded as follows:

Tense Mood for Warning and Alarm

From early yesterday morning, warning ropes were spread throughout the city, and shops and residents piled up yellow sand, reed mats, water buckets, iron hooks, and other air defense equipment at their doors. All the Baojia air defense personnel were mobilized and concentrated at the Baojia office to make various preparations. The entire city entered a state of air defense. The first warning alarm was issued at 10:00 a.m. and lifted at 10:30 a.m. The second warning alarm was issued at 3:00 p.m. and lifted at 3:30 p.m. During the warning alarms, police officers and Baojia personnel from the police sub-bureaus directed pedestrians to walk to the left for five minutes before resuming travel. The Air Defense Headquarters sent special inspection teams to check the sound-making equipment of vehicles in various areas. Inappropriate equipment was corrected immediately. At the same time, Japanese planes took off and soared in the sky to inspect. The entire city was in a tense mood.

Traffic Control Still Needs Improvement

During the two warning alarms, traffic control was carried out in accordance with the methods personally set by the authorities. After the alarm was issued, pedestrians had to wait quietly in a line on the sides of the streets. Traffic could only begin five minutes after vehicles and pedestrians were lined up. According to reporters' inspections in various places, there were still some places where pedestrians ran around and vehicles drove fast after hearing the alarm. It seems that this still needs improvement. The authorities and Baojia authorities should correct and improve this.

Three Alarms and Blackout

The third warning alarm was issued at 9:00 p.m. In addition to implementing traffic control and vehicle sound control in accordance with the previous methods, a blackout was also implemented. Special inspection teams from the Air Defense Headquarters, together with police officers from the police sub-bureaus and Baojia personnel, inspected the light leaks in the houses in each neighborhood and the light shielding and dimming equipment of various vehicles. Those who were not perfect were corrected. Those who deliberately violated the blackout regulations had their house numbers and household head citizen certificates recorded and severely punished in accordance with the methods announced by the authorities. Therefore, the results were better than in the past. Japanese planes also flew high to inspect various areas of the city, and the alarm was lifted at 10:30 p.m. In addition, various air defense drills were held in various neighborhoods of the city yesterday. The special air defense groups of various factories and buildings also had these air defense drills. The results were better than in the past.

### Rice Below 10 Shi Should be Exempt from Compulsory Purchase; City Government Suggested to Rice Control Committee Yesterday

Since the Rice Control Committee implemented the compulsory purchase policy on July 1st at a maximum price of 3,200 yuan per shi, rice prices have been stimulated and risen. On July 7th, the committee also compulsorily purchased rice from anyone transporting five dou of rice. The amount purchased has increased slightly, but it has fallen back to the same level the next day. It is reported that in the rice-producing areas, except for Chongming, Xingang, Huojiaqiao, and other places that still maintain the original market price, and the area along the Zhejiang railway, because the Zhejiang Provincial Government ordered its subordinates not to make excuses to detain or illegally extort rice that passed through the border and had passports from the Rice Control Committee, transportation was more convenient. In general, rice merchants, in order to escape compulsory purchase, mostly broke up the rice into smaller amounts and carried it into the market, but this was far from the actual demand. It has been learned that the city government authorities, in view of the seriousness of the current situation, specially sent a letter to the Rice Control Committee on the 8th, suggesting that rice transported in amounts below ten shi should be exempt from compulsory purchase. If this measure can be realized, it is believed that the sources of supply will become abundant and rice prices will also fall accordingly.

### Grain Protection Patrol Team Working Smoothly

Chen Gongbo, the Commander of the Shanghai Special City Security Command, in order to be concerned about the people's food supply, specially ordered the Special Task Force of the Security Department on the 4th of this month to organize a grain patrol team, with Zhang Duo, the Deputy Captain of the Special Task Force, as the captain. The team has been carrying out patrol work for many days. In order to understand the actual situation, the reporter specially visited Captain Zhang. According to Zhang, the main task of the team is to protect rice and grain and prevent local thugs, ruffians, and unscrupulous civil servants and troops from extorting money. This was clearly stipulated in the plan for the establishment of the team in the department. In order to clarify the work objectives and provide guidance, it is hereby stipulated that if any of the above-mentioned bad elements use excuses to extort money from rice-transporting villagers, and the prevention is ineffective, they should be arrested immediately and handed over to the law for handling, in order to curb greed and achieve the purpose of protecting the transport of rice and grain. Since the implementation of patrol and grain protection work, extortion along the way has decreased day by day, and the results are satisfactory. However, recently, in the area of the West Railway Station and Xujiahui Station in western Shanghai, due to special circumstances, there are still abnormal extortion activities. We are currently paying more attention to this, and once it is found out, we will arrest them impartially and strictly. In order to ensure that the people have no worries about food and to ensure public security, we hope that all agencies will assist the team so that the government's policy can be completed as soon as possible.

Mayor's Congratulatory Speech

"Dear Indian comrades: The headquarters of your country's Independence League has been established for a year. Just as all the nations of East Asia are celebrating, the opening ceremony of the Free India Volunteer Army Training Institute in Shanghai today makes me feel exceptionally excited.

India's resistance to Britain has a long history and has accumulated sufficient experience. Therefore, after the establishment of the Independence League headquarters, the patriots of your country who went to the front line have been brave and overcome the enemy, establishing extraordinary feats. In the past year, under the hard work of the patriots of your country, they have advanced into the country, recovered part of the lost land, and established a provisional government. Under the leadership of Chairman Bose, they have launched a more vigorous anti-British war and a broader independence movement.

China, standing in the position of an allied country, should do its best to assist the independence movement of your country, because we firmly believe that India's achievement of independence and liberation is also the achievement of freedom and liberation for the nations of East Asia. India's independence movement is closely related to the revolutionary movements of various East Asian countries, especially China.

Comrades, you will begin training today, and you will naturally be able to study seriously. After completing the training, it will be time for you to arm yourselves and put the independence movement into practice. Your responsibilities are very great. At the same time, the honor you deserve is also great. I wish you all a rapid progress in your studies, and I wish your country's independence to be completed. Finally, I wish the 1 billion East Asian compatriots to be liberated soon and share a life of freedom, equality, and happiness."

Usami's Speech

"Chairman Bose of the Free India Provisional Government appeared in a corner of East Asia last June under the world's attention. In the year since then, the organization of the Indian Independence League, the establishment of the Indian Independence Provisional Government, and the birth of the Indian National Army, and the practical movement for Indian liberation, are making epoch-making progress. Especially this spring, the entry of the Japan-India Allied Forces into Indian territory is the century-long Indian independence movement that has broken into its final stage. One billion East Asian compatriots unanimously express their heartfelt support and pledge to give all their cooperation. This is because the declaration of unification of the Republic of China and the achievement of Indian independence are the two major pillars of East Asian liberation. And it is really impossible to refrain from the love of comrades. At this time, the Shanghai Indian Volunteer Army Training Institute is holding an opening ceremony, which is truly an unforgettable and deeply meaningful event.

Chairman Bose once swore at the establishment of the Provisional Government: 'I will keep the oath of liberating India until the last moment of my life. I will devote all my efforts to the freedom of the Indian people. Even at the time of India's liberation, I also vow to contribute my life to India.' Trainees, take Chairman Bose's oath as your own, engage in vigorous training, and believe that after accumulating various training, you will all participate in the front lines of the independent movement, leading the way for this great leader. We are comrades of you, and we sincerely pray, work hard, and strive to do our best. With this presentation, I respectfully offer my congratulations."

### Streetcar Notification Device Changed to Whistle

Since the implementation of the queuing system for boarding streetcars, the phenomenon of crowding and jostling has been eliminated. It has been learned that the pull bells installed on the platforms of various streetcar lines, which were used by ticket sellers to notify the driver that people could start driving, have been removed and replaced with whistle notifications. Therefore, the general public should be careful when getting on or off the streetcar in the future.

### Myanmar Special Investigation Group Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday from Nanjing; Visited Various Chinese and Japanese Authorities in the City

The Myanmar Special Investigation Group, in order to investigate the construction status and cultural undertakings of our country, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (9th) morning by plane from Nanjing with a party of six, led by Dr. Pa Ning, the country's fear. Those who went to welcome them from the city government included Wu Songbi, the Secretary-General of the City Government, Liang Xiuyu, the Director of the Propaganda Department, Zheng Wukui, the Section Chief of the First Section, and senior city government officials. From the Allied side, Izubuchi, the Army News Minister, Matsushima, the Fleet News Minister, and Matsudaira, the News Minister of the Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office, were present. At 10:20 a.m., the special plane of the Myanmar Special Investigation Group landed at the airport amidst the resounding military music of the city government band. After the six members of the group disembarked, Group Leader Dr. Ba Henge shook hands with Secretary-General Wu as a greeting, and introduced the members of the group to meet Secretary-General Wu separately. Then, the welcoming personnel shook hands with the group members as a greeting. The whole group then walked out of the airport under the leadership of Secretary-General Wu, and were escorted by Chen Gongzhan, Lian Desheng, and other representatives of the city government in limousines to the Hua Mao Hotel for rest.

Luncheon Reception

At 12:00 noon, Liang Xiuyu, the Director of the City Propaganda Department, and Matsudaira, the News Minister of the Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office, jointly hosted a luncheon at the 9th floor of the Hua Mao Hotel to welcome them. During the meal, everyone raised their glasses and chatted happily. The party ended at about 1:00 p.m.

Visit to the Mayor

At 2:30 p.m., the group, led by Group Leader Dr. Ba Henge, visited the Mayor at the City Hall. Secretary-General Wu Songbi received them. After leaving at 3:00 p.m., they rested briefly. At 4:10 p.m., they visited Minister Usami at the Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office. The mood was very harmonious at 5:30 p.m.

Impressions of Group Leader Ba Henge

Dr. Ba Henge, the leader of the Myanmar Special Investigation Group, met with a group of Japanese reporters at 5:30 p.m. and expressed his impressions as follows: Before I set off, I didn't know how Japan had prepared to cope with the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, when I arrived in Japan, I inspected the Japanese military factories. As a result, I was deeply convinced that Japan could indeed cope with the Greater East Asia War. What moved me even more was that, rather than saying how many items the factory could produce, it was the fact that the chiefs and employees were all united. The national unity and the energy to overcome difficulties are not seen in the UK and the US, who work for money and slack off because of insufficient wages. From this, I have realized that this kind of spiritual strength makes Japan's military productivity have a surprising increase. One more point is that the spirit of Hakkō ichiu has been popularized throughout the country, and the fact that its people respect the imperial family in unison is inevitably moving.

Construction of Manchukuo

In a word about Manchukuo, Manchukuo is a model country for the new era. In just twelve years, it has rectified the chaotic security situation at the beginning of its establishment and become an orderly country. There are many things that we can learn from it. The rich buried resources have been rapidly developed in a short period of twelve years, which has helped to enhance the war effort of the Greater East Asia War. Manchukuo has been able to work so hard and become a modern emerging country, which has made us amazed and praised. The resources that have been developed today are only a foundation that has been laid.

The future development of Manchukuo is really limitless. What makes us even more admired is that all ethnic groups get along with each other exceptionally well. The Japanese people, who are in a guiding position, definitely do not have the attitude of the British and Americans who teach, employ, and enslave. The people of Manchukuo, on the other hand, are also very willing to cooperate. We firmly believe that this is especially a driving force to further promote this country to a model country.

Revival of China

Regarding China, today's China has more difficulties in construction than Manchukuo. Although it has rich underground resources that are not inferior to Manchukuo, unfortunately, there is the existence of the Chongqing side, which is used by the British and Americans, which is detrimental to the Greater East Asia War and the East Asian nations, and at the same time hinders the progress of national construction. However, I firmly believe that when the future opportunity arrives, the diligent Chinese people will be able to exert their traditional spirit, develop resources, and advance towards the road of revival and construction, and become the backbone of the East Asian nations.
