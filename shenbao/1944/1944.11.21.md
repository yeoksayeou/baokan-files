### Chongqing-Guilin Defense Forces Completely Annihilated, Over 13,000 Captured

Guilin, 20th (Central News Agency) - In the Guilin capture operation, the Chongqing army left over 5,600 bodies and had over 13,000 captured. Subsequent investigations revealed that, in addition to the commander of the 31st Army, who defended Guilin, committing suicide, and the commander of the 131st Division dying in battle, there were many captured officers such as deputy division commanders, brigade commanders, and regimental commanders. Therefore, the Chongqing Guilin defense force has been completely annihilated. The Guilin defense force, under the command of Wei Yunsong, deputy commander of the 16th Group Army, consisted of the 171st Division and elements of the 188th Division of the 31st Army, the 170th Division of the 46th Army, and the 2nd Replacement Regiment of the Guilin Garrison Area, totaling about 20,000 men, and formed a large army. Equipped with heavy artillery and mountain guns, they engaged in defensive work. Although the Chongqing authorities strictly ordered them to defend Guilin to the death, under the overall attack of the Japanese army, by the 10th, these Chongqing troops were defeated. On the morning of that day, the main force led by the commander of the 31st Army, attempting to escape from the city, was also pursued and annihilated by the Japanese army. Lieutenant General He Weizhen, commander of the 31st Army, committed suicide in the mountains southwest of the city on the same day because he was directly responsible for the loss of Guilin and thought it would be impossible to escape punishment from Chongqing. Lieutenant General Guan Weiji, commander of the 131st Division, and Chen Jiyou, chief senior staff officer of the 4th Group Army Commander-in-Chief, were both killed in battle in the city on the 9th. Among the captured were also Major General Chao Wei, deputy commander of the 170th Division of the 46th Army, as well as three colonels, seven lieutenant colonels, eight majors, and other officers. Judging from the number of Chongqing troops who abandoned their bodies and were captured, it is clear that the Chongqing Guilin defense force has been completely annihilated.

North of Yishan, Pursuing the Chongqing Army

A certain Japanese base west of Yishan, 19th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army broke through Jiashan, they divided into several teams and fiercely pursued the Chongqing 15th Division, which was scattered and fleeing, not giving them a chance to reorganize. On the evening of the 16th, near Guanailongtou, about 10 kilometers north of Yishan, they pursued the main force of the enemy's 21st Army, which was attempting to escape from Yishan towards Tianhe (30 kilometers north of Yishan). 20 kilometers southwest of Yishan, north of the Yongding River, they pursued a part of the 93rd Army and the 38th Division. Near Huaiyuan, they pursued the main force of the 27th Division. Fierce annihilation operations are currently being carried out separately.

American Planes Shot Down Over Guilin

Guilin, 20th (Central News Agency) - At about 2:30 PM on the 18th, a total of sixteen American P51 and P40 fighter planes attempted to intrude into the airspace over Guilin from the north and south. Japanese anti-aircraft fire immediately concentrated its attack, shooting down two P40-type planes and repelling them.

Transportation North of Jinchengjiang Ineffective

A certain place on the mainland, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing army on the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway suffered continuous fierce attacks from the Japanese army and fled in disarray. Materials from the Guilin-Liuzhou base cluster were also concentrated near Jinchengjiang, attempting to be transported towards Guiyang. Because the fall of Guilin and Liuzhou was too rapid, transportation north of Jinchengjiang could not proceed as planned. After the Japanese army quickly reached Yishan, there were dozens of train cars loaded with soldiers and materials running back and forth in extreme chaos on the railway between Yishan and Guiyang. On the 17th and 18th, seven cars were destroyed by Japanese aircraft. The railway lines at key points near Jinchengjiang were also cut off by the Japanese army. Currently, 100 kilometers of railway line between Yishan and Jinchengjiang has lost its transportation capacity.

American Commander Fears Attack on Guiyang

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, the newly appointed American commander in Chongqing, Wedemeyer, told reporters on the 18th that since taking office, he had met with Chiang Kai-shek several times and had proposed a simple and complete plan for future operations against Japan. He said that he was confident that the difficulties of the anti-Axis alliance could soon be overcome. Japan's future target of attack is to go south from Liuzhou, seeking to establish contact with the Japanese army in Vietnam, or to advance westward from the Liuzhou area and attack Guiyang. In terms of terrain, this is difficult to achieve, but we should still devise sufficient countermeasures within all possible scenarios.

Japanese Army in Guangxi Approaches Huaiyuan

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a United Press correspondent in Chongqing on the 19th, the situation in Guangxi is as follows: The Chongqing Military Headquarters admitted on the night of the 19th that the Japanese army was advancing northwest along the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway, approaching Huaiyuan Town (86 li west of Liuzhou). It also admitted that the Japanese army's left-wing troops occupied Xincheng (64 kilometers southwest of Liuzhou) on the 17th. Meanwhile, the Japanese army advanced westward from Baoqing, and Guizhou Province felt extremely threatened. Therefore, the Chongqing authorities admitted that the Japanese army reached a point 29 kilometers west of Baoqing on the 17th, and it is expected that the target of the Japanese army in that direction must be to capture Zhijiang (a key point in western Hunan Province leading to Guiyang).

### Chairman Wang's Instructions

(1) The first thing we must do is endure hardship. Those who cannot endure hardship cannot be healthy and upright. Those who are not honest and upright cannot serve the country and the people.

(2) As long as the direction is correct, our efforts will surely succeed one day.

(3) The complete attainment of China's independence and freedom must be sought in the liberation of East Asia.

(4) The greater the difficulties and hardships, the greater our responsibility.

### Friction Between Britain, America, Soviet Union, and Chongqing Becomes Increasingly Overt, Internal Division Within the Anti-Axis Front

(Central News Agency) - Since Britain, America, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing, the four powers of the anti-Axis alliance, have been increasingly at odds, it is as if they are sharing the same bed but dreaming different dreams. After the recent angry return of American Commander in Chongqing Stilwell and Ambassador Gauss to America, the conflict between America and Chongqing has become almost impossible to conceal. Even the direct political system in Chongqing admits the recent reality of diplomatic friction between Britain, America, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing. Upon the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, America lost its composure for a time. In the beginning, Britain was also daily concerned that Germany would cross the Channel and invade the British Isles. At the same time, large amounts of Soviet territory were likely to quickly fall into German hands. At that time, in order to protect themselves, Britain and the Soviet Union quickly invited American President Roosevelt to the front lines of the war. On the surface, America then honorably assumed the role of host of this Eurasian war. Chongqing, already in a state of desperation, took advantage of the opportunity of the Greater East Asia War to enter the White House and sit on the anti-Axis conference table. However, because America was out of sorts, it no longer investigated how much power Chongqing actually had or whether the Chongqing government had any real governing ability, and instead recognized Chongqing as a powerful partner, hoping that Chongqing could contain Japan by fighting on the mainland during the Pacific War. However, disappointed, America has been driven by Chongqing, but America has never given up trying to use pressure to send special envoys to Chongqing to turn the tide. However, the diseases afflicting Chongqing are so serious that they are in fact incurable. Internally, it cannot unite; externally, it cannot resist the war. After the battle of Hunan and Guangxi, America resentfully withdrew Stilwell and Gauss. The reason for this lies in the complex military and political situation. America now has the feeling of a mute swallowing coptis chinensis - unable to express its bitterness. Before Roosevelt ran for his fourth term as president, he had to change his policy, and he dared to be angry but dared not speak out against Chongqing. On the one hand, he used the sympathy of Britain's Churchill, who let loose in the British House of Commons, bitterly denouncing Chongqing, saying that Chongqing had always been opportunistic and had not made any effort in the anti-Axis war. On the contrary, it consumed a lot of anti-Axis military strength and munitions, and the aid from Britain and America was enough to strengthen the opposition between Chongqing and Yan'an. The civil and military officials below Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing felt even more disappointed and did not want to implement democratic politics at all. After bitterly criticizing Chongqing, Churchill seriously proposed the greatness of Tagore and suggested to the anti-Axis countries' conferences that the status of the Tagore government be discussed again. Chongqing, after learning of Britain's criticism, felt extremely serious and tried its best to explain to America, while at the same time expressing concessions to Yan'an again. At the same time, it made a defense to Britain, saying that the Chongqing regime had discussed many times how Britain had abandoned Chongqing. The reason was not to sympathize with America in fighting alone in the Pacific, but to be concerned about China's position after the war. Britain knew that its fate would be affected, and it also understood that its colonies would be difficult to protect in this war. Now that Canada has become Americanized, India has become East Asianized, and Singapore, Hong Kong, and other places have all become problems, Britain's suppression of Chongqing is to seek the preservation of its colonies in the future. Therefore, the future strength of China directly affects the survival of British colonies. The capitalist countries of Britain and America have a consistent view on China. Whether the Soviet Union will not interfere in the Far East is very unlikely. Therefore, Britain and America made a preemptive move to express goodwill to Yan'an to see the Soviet Union's attitude. They also asked Stalin to clearly express his views on the Pacific War. Stalin believed that the time was ripe and could be used to his advantage. First, he asked America to continue the lend-lease treaty for three years. At the same time, the Soviet Union allowed America to make a statement, acknowledging that America had a reasonable position in the Pacific War.

### Germany Completes New Defense Line to Defend Territory, American Troops Occupy Geilenkirchen Fortress

Western Front, 20th (Central News Agency) - Houtong News Agency: The second four-week plan for the construction of fortresses on the Western Front has also been completed. When the anti-Axis forces approached the German border in early September this year, Head of State Hitler ordered the establishment of a solid fortress line along the existing front line at that time. A four-week construction plan was drawn up. Seeing that the first phase of the plan was not deep enough, the second four-week plan was implemented. Thanks to the efforts of the people of the whole country, several solid new defense lines were completed behind the original defense line. All gun emplacements and shelters are of the latest type. In short, these new defense lines are more solid than the Atlantic Wall.

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - Houtong News Agency: On the fourth day of the Battle of Aachen, the American 9th Army broke through the German army's main defense line north of Aachen and occupied Geilenkirchen, and is now continuing to advance northeast. After the American 3rd Army entered Brohl, the fighting is taking place south of Metz. The American left-wing of the Metz foreign defense line is increasingly pressing on the old German border. There is fierce fighting in the area around Wallendorf and Brimdorph west of the Nied River.

### Soviet Army Actively Preparing for Winter Offensive, Fierce Fighting to Seize Hongdu

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - Houtong News Agency: The weather on the Eastern Front is gradually turning cold, and the muddy roads have begun to freeze. It is expected that the Soviet army's winter offensive will be launched soon. German aircraft have detected that the Soviet army is making major preparations between the Narew River, East Prussia, and as far as the Kurland region. The fighting between Hong Kong Budapest and Mickolsz is becoming increasingly fierce. The enemy is attacking along a broad front with 35 divisions, and the German and Hungarian armies are fighting back hard. The enemy broke through several places east of Hong Kong and south of Mickolsz, and once entered Tula south of Heart, but was soon driven back by our army.

### Belgian Resistance Forces Agree to Disarm

Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Central News Agency) - Houtong News Agency, Reuters: After the anti-Axis commander announced that British and American troops would interfere with the disarmament of Belgian resistance fighters, the resistance personnel have expressed their willingness to hand over their weapons. The commander of the anti-Axis expeditionary force in Belgium issued a communiqué yesterday stating that the leaders of the Belgian resistance have decided to hand over their weapons and have asked the military authorities to prepare to receive them.

Editorial

### National Testing

A nation's independence and autonomy must be fought for with blood and sweat. When we read Japan's modern history, we see that since Japan was invaded by American Perry, the oppression, humiliation, and other facts it suffered, and all the unequal treaties it signed, were no different from what other East Asian nations have suffered in the past century. However, the Japanese nation endured humiliation and bore burdens, worked hard and endured hardship, and struggled from the most difficult environment, finally creating an independent and autonomous country, competing with Britain and America on an equal footing, and making the British and Americans respect and admire them. The government and the people were of one mind, and the experience of enduring hardship and the courage to never give up were truly moving.

Now, the Allied nation of Japan is not only satisfied with the independence and autonomy of one country, but is also leading all the nations of East Asia to jointly fight for liberation, hoping to obtain the independence and autonomy of the entire Greater East Asia nation. The desire for liberation is the wish of everyone. Especially in China, Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of Pan-Asianism is essentially the independence, autonomy, and mutual assistance of Greater East Asia, so the Chinese people feel even more happy to fight. On the one hand, the Chinese people see the history of the Japanese nation's successful struggle. At the same time, they recall the past martyrs, their painstaking efforts, and their hard struggle with the British and American aggressors. Now, they have identified their goals, continued the legacy of the martyrs, and are faithfully working hard. This is the most appropriate and convenient time.

A nation has experience. The Japanese nation's experience of blood and sweat has created a glorious history. This is a pioneer for other nations and a mirror for other nations. In the past, the liberation of Japan was a separate test of the Japanese nation. In this test, the excellence of the Japanese nation has been shown to the world. Now, the liberation of East Asia is a test of the entire Greater East Asia nation. In this test, the excellence of the Greater East Asia nation will surely be shown to the world, and the liberation of Greater East Asia will surely succeed by following in the footsteps of the liberation of Japan.

Because it is a great national test, every citizen must be careful, focused, and persevering in the testing ground. First, we must establish national self-confidence. We must maintain our past excellence. We must frankly admit our weaknesses. The strength of the Eastern nation lies in perseverance and endurance, and never giving up. This is the national character of Japan and China. In the testing ground, we must especially promote this. We must be more persevering. We must be more enduring. In the past, we used this strength to maintain the survival of the nation for thousands of years. Now, we will use this strength to create the permanent liberation of the nation. Secondly, our weakness lies in the lack of industrialization. Because the Eastern nations have all lived a stable life of agriculture in the past. Until the last hundred years, because of the results of the European industrial revolution, they were invaded by them. Then, they realized the importance of industrialization and only then did they build an industrialized society. Therefore, historically, our degree of industrialization is relatively backward. However, Japan, with the spirit of "catching up", used the latest methods in less than a hundred years, not only caught up, but also made more rapid progress than Britain and America. Now, in the national testing ground, the Chinese nation should work especially hard. In addition, Japan has experience in resisting the aggression of Britain and America. Japan has been dealing with Britain and America for nearly a hundred years, and is very familiar with the psychology and power of Britain and America. This experience is our compass. We must take big strides in the direction of the compass.

The survival of the country is closely related to the nation, and the survival of the nation is closely related to the citizens themselves. This is something that everyone in Greater East Asia should always remember.

### Chairman Chen's Address: Advancing Along Established Policies

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - Chairman Wang announced the three major policies of "Peace, Anti-Communism, and National Reconstruction" in March of the 29th year of the Republic (1940) and returned the capital to Nanjing. From then until October of this year, four years and seven months have passed. Unfortunately, he passed away, and the whole country mourns. Having received the mandate when Chairman Wang left the country for medical treatment, and now being appointed responsibility amidst the grief, I, Gongbo, dare not lightly alter the original intention of following Chairman Wang due to my limited talent and heavy responsibilities. Nor can I shirk my responsibility during this difficult time for the nation. All policies set by Chairman Wang will be the policies that Gongbo will implement. All measures established by Chairman Wang during his lifetime will be the measures that Gongbo will continue now. As I take office, I sincerely express my thoughts and ask the colleagues of the National Government and all the military and civilians of the country to work together.

Always Opposing Imperialism

First, the Kuomintang of China reorganized in the 13th year of the Republic (1924) and issued the declaration of the First National Congress. Regarding foreign policy, it primarily advocated the abolition of unequal treaties. The late Father of the Nation, in his will, also urged comrades to abolish unequal treaties in the shortest possible time to show the people of the country. All of these are the consistent and long-held aspirations of the Father of the Nation and the Kuomintang comrades, representing the people of the entire country, to oppose imperialism and seek freedom and equality for China. In March of the 14th year of the Republic (1925), the National Government was established in Guangzhou and advocated independent anti-British sentiment. Up until January 9th of last year, when we joined the Greater East Asia War, all were based on the long-standing aim of opposing imperialism to seek the liberation of China. Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, although Britain and the United States have suffered setbacks, they have shown no intention of abolishing their illegal interests in China. Recently, the British Secretary of State even declared in the House of Commons that Britain has no intention of abandoning Hong Kong. This shows that there is absolutely no possibility of liberation for China and all of East Asia unless British and American imperialism is defeated. Last year, the National Government joined the Greater East Asia War to fight for principles, for liberation, and even more for the Father of the Nation's Greater Asianism. No matter how the war progresses or how urgent the situation becomes, the military and civilians of the entire country will not waver. In the future, the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia will cooperate further to strive for the final victory. Because opposing imperialism is the long-held aspiration of the National Government and the determination of the people of the entire country, I am determined to move forward courageously, regardless of success or failure.

Achieving the Goal of Peaceful Unification

Second, the purpose of the National Government's return to the capital lies in seeking comprehensive peace between China and Japan, and then seeking peace in all of East Asia. This aspiration has been consistently pursued by Chairman Wang and the National Government without any relaxation to achieve it. It was the case on the day of the return to the capital, it is the case today, and it will be the case in the future. From the beginning, the National Government had no intention of being hostile to Chongqing. The people of Chongqing are also the people of the National Government, and the comrades in Chongqing are also our comrades. We have always believed that peace needs to be realized urgently and that the country should not be divided. This sincere desire is understood by the whole country. Over the years, we first established the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty with Japan, then signed the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and participated in the Greater East Asia Declaration. In the meantime, with Japan's cooperation, we were able to recover the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. All of these are the National Government's sincerity to the outside world, establishing the foundation for good neighborliness, and its credibility to the inside, seeking the reality of unification. In the future, the National Government will adhere to the legacy of Chairman Wang to achieve the great aspirations of the inseparable Party and the country and the urgent need for unification, no matter how difficult the foundation, it must be completed. I hope that the military and civilians of the whole country will work together, share the same position, so that China and Japan return to peace, and the country returns to unification.

Cleansing Officialdom and Advocating Integrity

Third, since the National Government returned to the capital, there have been frequent changes. Initially, it was because the Sino-Japanese Incident had not been completely resolved, and then it was because the Greater East Asia War finally broke out. The government focused on long-term plans and inevitably neglected local officialdom. Reviewing the past, there is nothing to excuse. Those responsible for various aspects, either turned a blind eye out of consideration for the difficult lives of officials, or reduced penalties based on past merits of subordinates. As a result, officialdom became increasingly corrupt, and government affairs were neglected. We must know that peace and national salvation are the natural duties of the people, and there is no merit to speak of. Clear rewards and punishments are the great principles of establishing a nation, and forgetting them is ignorance. Now, people are accustomed to suffering deeply, and Communist disturbances are full of thorns. Adding to that, corruption will destroy the country. From now on, the National Government is determined to cleanse officialdom to live up to Chairman Wang's original intention of promoting clean politics. Anyone who harms the people and endangers the foundation of the country, no matter who they are, should be regarded as traitors and abandoned by all.

Increasing Production and Focusing on People's Needs

Fourth, to complete the Greater East Asia War, it is imperative to focus on production. This year, Chairman Wang gave instructions on increasing production. We must implement these instructions. Even if there are various difficulties in raw materials and power during wartime, we must continue to work hard to continue production, so that both military and civilian needs are given equal importance. We must know that military needs are of primary importance, but civilian needs cannot be ignored. Because if civilian needs are not met, it will inevitably lead to instability in people's lives, and the entire production will come to a standstill. In recent times, both military and civilian needs have been in trouble, and it is not yet possible to achieve victory. Therefore, it is hoped that the military and civilians of the whole country will understand this point, cooperate fully, and take both into consideration.

Establishing Security and Rectifying Politics

Fifth, establishing security is also the legacy of Chairman Wang, but the establishment of security lies in military advancement, especially in the rectification of politics. From now on, military and political affairs should be coordinated. Those responsible for military affairs should rectify discipline and strengthen education. Those responsible for political affairs should advocate integrity and implement construction. It is imperative to ensure local peace and stability, so that the people have a place to return to. From now on, both military and political officials must practice what they preach so that local security can be ensured and the foundation of the country can be consolidated.

All of the above are the policies decided on the 20th and are the guidelines for future implementation. Remembering that in the past, we had definite policies but failed to fully express the enthusiasm for practice, we must now wash away the sluggish style and encourage the pursuit of practicality. Furthermore, the establishment of a nation depends entirely on self-reliance. If the government is not built on the people, the foundation will be difficult to strengthen. It is hoped that colleagues will base themselves on the spirit of independence to seek the independence of the country. Furthermore, with perseverance, we must eliminate the mentality of reliance. Then China can be revived, and East Asia can be protected. This humble sincerity is what I wish to share with the colleagues of the National Government and all the military and civilians of the country.

Certain Japanese Base on the Front Lines in the Philippines, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese ground units on Leyte Island are engaging in fierce battles against the enemy landing forces. The Japanese air force is also cooperating in launching three-dimensional attacks. They are carrying out daring attacks on enemy transport ships and airfields that are busy reinforcing supplies with a small force. The total results achieved in the first half of this month are as follows (including the results of the Mandalay and Fuso teams): Shot down 158 aircraft or more, sunk one battleship, and 14 transport ships. In addition, 42 airfield facilities were destroyed, and one searchlight was destroyed.

Japanese Base in the Philippines, 20th (Central News Agency) - To gain air supremacy over Leyte Island, the Japanese air force has been launching daily attacks to strike enemy airfields and supply routes. On the 17th, they attacked enemy transport convoys in Leyte Gulf, and one ship was hit and caught fire. Another team attacked the Tacloban airport and destroyed two enemy material storage depots, burning them. On the evening of the 18th, they repeatedly attacked the Tacloban airport, causing three fires, and shelled two transport ships in the waters off the coast, causing them to catch fire. All Japanese planes returned safely to base.

Japanese Army Battle Results in the Tagami Area

Manila, 20th (Central News Agency) - In the Tagami area of Leyte Island, Japanese troops have been engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. The combined battle results of the Japanese forces in this area from the 1st to the 15th are as follows: (1) 900 enemy bodies left behind, (2) 3 tanks stranded, (3) Captured 5 enemy machine guns, 3 light machine guns, 1 rocket launcher and mortar each, 3 automatic rifles, and more than 800 rifles and pistols.

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) - When MacArthur's forces landed on Leyte, they initially attempted to build a base and mobilized various propaganda agencies to promote the progress of the battle. However, they are currently facing strong resistance from the Japanese army, so they are strictly suppressing unfavorable news. On the 19th, MacArthur's headquarters specifically announced the US military losses since the start of the battle in Leyte, including 1,143 killed in action, 126 missing, and 4,432 wounded in action, totaling 5,701. They indirectly admitted the difficult battle, stating that the Japanese army deployed artillery and tanks in the area, indicating the difficulty of the Leyte battle.

### Chatting by the Fireside with Cao Rulin (2)

-- Wu Gong

The Twenty-One Demands and the Nishihara Loans

The Twenty-One Demands were signed during Yuan Shikai's presidency. Although called the Twenty-One Demands, they were later revised, and only about fifteen or sixteen articles were recognized. Among them, the most important was the issue of the development and mixed residence in the three northeastern provinces. However, even regarding this issue, only lease rights were recognized, and it was stipulated that their residents must abide by local Chinese laws. According to Mr. Cao, as long as this was the case, mixed residence between the Chinese and Japanese people would not be a problem. For example, there are many overseas Chinese living in foreign countries, especially in Southeast Asia, who hold significant economic power in those regions, but they mostly abide by local laws and do not harm the local population. Furthermore, China needs Japanese assistance in the development of all industries, so this mixed residence issue may even be beneficial to us. He greatly admired Yuan Shikai. When he (Mr. Cao was then the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs) received the foreign minister, Lu Zhengxiang's, report regarding the Japanese demands, they went to see Mr. Yuan that night. Mr. Yuan was already in bed, and Mr. Lu immediately went inside to report, while Mr. Cao waited outside the room. Mr. Lu came out less than ten minutes later, which greatly surprised Mr. Cao. Mr. Lu then reported the situation to Mr. Yuan, saying, "The President didn't even look at the note. He just said that he had anticipated this move from Japan a month ago, and now there are only two options: war or peace. War is absolutely impossible." Furthermore, Japan at that time really had no intention of war, so he told them, "Then go and negotiate with the Japanese ambassador immediately." In fact, after the Twenty-One Demands were signed, they were never implemented because Mr. Yuan later orchestrated American intervention in the eastern provinces, which eventually led to the Washington Naval Conference and the Nine-Power Treaty.

The Nishihara Loans were handled by Mr. Cao when he later served as the Minister of Finance and Minister of Transportation, which was around 1919 or 1920. At that time, the European war had ended, and the Terauchi Cabinet in Japan wanted to assist China's unification and reconstruction. Unfortunately, the Beiyang government was too incompetent. This is what happened: Initially, a loan of five million yuan was needed to reorganize the Bank of Communications. Negotiations had already been conducted with Okura, but they stalled because the conditions were too harsh. At that time, a Japanese businessman named Nishihara came to China and, upon hearing this, resolutely agreed to provide the full amount of the loan because foreign loans were always discounted. This one was full amount, and there were no conditions attached, except for the nomination of Mr. Cao as the president of the Bank of Communications. Therefore, this loan for the Bank of Communications was established. Subsequently, Mr. Cao frequently contacted both parties, hoping to achieve unification and reconstruction in China, but unfortunately, the Beiyang government used the money entirely for government expenses, and the unification effort failed completely. Reconstruction was out of the question. According to Mr. Cao, the Beijing government at the time relied solely on customs surplus and salt taxes for revenue, which amounted to no more than seventy million yuan and twenty million yuan, respectively, totaling less than one hundred million yuan per year. So what was the importance of the Nishihara Loans? It was truly a good example of the initial friendly cooperation between China and Japan. Originally, it was intended that Japan would assist China in unification and then develop the three northeastern provinces that had been seized. All resources would be used for China first, and the surplus would be sold to Japan. Is that not still harmful to China?

Discussing Joining the War Again Amidst the Flames of War

China has already gone through two world wars. In the last world war, it stood on the same side as Japan. Unfortunately, in this world war, the battlefield has spread to the entire East Asia, but China and Japan are on two completely different sides. Although, since the return of the National Government to the capital, they have become allies with Japan, sharing life and death. Mr. Cao discussed this issue. Clearly, there must be many emotions welling up in his heart. He said that at that time, China and Japan had initially agreed to join the war together. Although there were military actions in Qingdao, the relationship between the two countries was extremely friendly. Therefore, when China sent delegates to Europe for the peace conference, Japan originally intended to provide large-scale hospitality to the Chinese delegation. The Beijing authorities also originally intended to appoint Mr. Cao as one of the delegates, but he declined because he was not proficient in European languages. At that time, the chief of the delegation was Mr. Lu Zhengxiang, and others included Gu Weijun and Shi Zhaoji. Wang Zhengting was also hired as an advisor to the delegation because he belonged to the Kuomintang's delegation.

Because Japan and China both belonged to the Allied Powers, when the Chinese delegation passed through Japan, not only was warm hospitality prepared, but the Emperor, who was at the villa, had specifically returned to Tokyo to meet the Chinese delegation. Everything had been arranged, and it was believed that the relationship between China and Japan could establish a basis for improvement. However, when the ship arrived in Japan, the Chinese delegation suddenly changed its mind for some reason. On one hand, they claimed illness, and on the other hand, they refused to go ashore. In the end, they only met the Japanese foreign minister at the time. Especially absurd, the important briefcase they were carrying suddenly disappeared, and all the prepared materials were completely lost, causing chaos in Paris. This was the initial shadow cast on the relationship between China and Japan!

Therefore, China gradually drifted apart from Japan. For the sake of the Qingdao issue, they almost ended up in ruins. In fact, Japan had long signed an agreement with China to return it to China after the war. When the Japanese army occupied it, it also returned the police power to China afterward. After the war, it only hoped for a concession. However, those representatives, in order to show off, insisted on handing over Qingdao to the peace conference, and then having the peace conference return it to China. In the end, President Wilson of the United States, after hearing the weeping of the Chinese representatives, also felt helpless and, citing the fact that China had signed an agreement with Japan first as an excuse, hoped that China would negotiate directly with Japan. Later, Gu Xiaochuan blamed Mr. Cao for this matter, which led to his residence being destroyed by the crowd, the so-called May Fourth Movement. After hearing this, and thinking about the fact that the Chinese diplomatic authorities had insisted on submitting bilateral issues to the League of Nations for resolution before this war, I could understand even more. Although the time was a decade or two apart, the lack of diplomatic strategy remained the same. What a sigh!

Finding a New Path to Open Up the Current Sino-Japanese Situation

Mr. Cao is from Shanghai. When I spoke to him, he spoke fluent Shanghainese, which really stirred up my feelings of home. He is very healthy. We later talked about the future of the country and I felt deeply concerned about the general shallow optimism. He is a politician who has practiced Sino-Japanese cooperation. He deeply hates the fact that those who handled Chinese diplomacy in the past lacked a long-term vision and only considered the immediate situation, which led to the country being in such a state. Although he is currently enjoying his retirement, it is easy to see from the enthusiastic expressions during his conversation with the reporter that he is not a pessimistic person. I asked him, "Can a new path be found to open up the current Sino-Japanese situation?" He said, "The new path is sincerity." How to make both parties have sincerity is indeed an issue that we should pay attention to at this time! When discussing the issue of heartfelt thoughts with the Takeda News Department this morning, I presented a view that in order for both parties to have sincerity, there must first be a new ideology that combines the two major ethnic groups.

Finally, I also asked him about the situation of the Jingxing Coal Mine. According to him, the Jingxing Coal Mine mainly produces bituminous coal, so it is an important mine for military needs. For this reason, and related to military applications, production is constantly being increased. However, he hopes that we understand that it is also necessary to attach equal importance to civilian needs, and that it is hoped that unreasonable controls can be resolutely abandoned! However, the treatment of coal miners is now much better. Each person is given three pounds of flour every day, and family members are given one and a half pounds of flour per day, limited to four people. In addition, there are daily necessities and coal, so although the salary is only several tens of yuan per month, it is much more comfortable than for middle and lower-level civil servants here. It is said that once, the police station in a certain place arrested some workers to work, and everyone was very afraid at the time. But when they returned after a month, each of them had inexplicably received half a bolt of cloth and a bag of flour (forty pounds), and everyone was overjoyed!

I really wouldn't feel tired of such a conversation even if we talked for another two hours, but it was already too late, so I said goodbye in the twilight! (Sent from Beijing)

### Japanese Naval Ministry Announces Commendation of Meritorious Units

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese air force unit at a certain base and the new unit under its command, as well as the air force unit at a certain base, have encircled the main force of the enemy mobile units in the waters around the Nansei Islands, Taiwan, and northern Philippines since October 10th and have launched a fierce attack on them. A certain attack unit, in particular, has repeatedly attacked enemy forces in the waters east of Taiwan for three days since the 12th, achieving remarkable results in the great air battle off the coast of Taiwan. Japanese Commander Toyota specifically presented commendation certificates on October 23rd, and it was reported to the Emperor. This matter was announced by the Japanese Naval Ministry on the 19th.

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Naval Ministry announced on the 19th: Since the beginning of September, the Japanese army and naval forces on Peleliu Island have been engaged in heroic battles for more than two months, bravely fighting to strike enemy naval forces and landing forces, inflicting great damage on them.

Certain Japanese Base on the Front Lines, 20th (Central News Agency) - After being fiercely attacked by the Japanese army, the enemy forces on Leyte Island have recently been stepping up their reinforcements, dispatching air force and supplies from Morotai. The Japanese air force, starting from the morning of the 18th, achieved great results in fighter plane battles. Another team bravely advanced into Leyte Gulf and happened to discover enemy transport ships fully loaded with soldiers and military supplies sailing in the bay. They repeatedly launched fierce dive bombing attacks on two large and two medium-sized ships, and all four enemy ships were hit and caught fire. Another team raided enemy landing craft and repeatedly bombed and destroyed eight of them. They also attacked the enemy's front-line artillery positions near Harold, daringly carrying out dive bombing attacks, burning down two ammunition dumps and artillery positions. All Japanese planes returned safely to their defenses.

### Strictly Enforce Light Control; Revise Penalties for Power Outages; Police Bureau Orders Subordinate Branches to Carefully and Strictly Handle

The Municipal Police Bureau has repeatedly instructed on strengthening light control in the city, and in July of this year, ordered each branch bureau to thoroughly crack down on violations of light control in accordance with the Provisional Measures for Handling Light Control Violations. However, investigations reveal that past results have been quite unsatisfactory. The Army, Navy, and Air Defense Headquarters are deeply concerned about this, and military and police authorities have sent letters to the bureau urging decisive action.

Strictly Crack Down on Light Leakage

Therefore, the Police Defense Department has re-ordered each branch bureau to strictly enforce light control. Light control is the greatest obligation of the people during wartime and has been widely publicized. Even the slightest gleam of light is not allowed to leak. However, even now, there are still instances of light leakage due to inadequate equipment or carelessness. Personnel responsible for control either ignore it or use it as an excuse for extortion. All of these are unforgivable acts. Each branch bureau chief should understand this and instruct subordinates to strictly crack down on such behavior. At the same time, lookout posts should be properly utilized so that light control within their jurisdiction can be thoroughly implemented. Careful verification and strict handling are required to meet the needs of the current situation.

Revised Measures for Sealing Electricity Meters

As for the penalties for those who violate light control, they should be handled in accordance with the stipulated penalty regulations. The method for sealing electricity meters has been revised, and each branch bureau must exercise its delegated authority in accordance with the regulations in order to achieve complete success in light control. The revised method for sealing electricity meters is recorded below:

(1) Branch bureau chiefs should consider the severity of the violation and the intent of the offender when determining penalties. If the offender has unavoidable circumstances, the branch bureau chief may seal the electricity meter for five days or less, ordering the offender to complete the light control equipment setup within the sealing period. Upon expiration of the period, the equipment should be inspected to ensure it is complete before unsealing.

(2) If the offender has no unavoidable circumstances, the branch bureau chief may seal the electricity meter indefinitely and report the circumstances for review. The authorities will inquire about the details in writing based on the branch bureau chief's report and then decide on a period for power outage punishment. Therefore, the branch bureau chief's report must be carefully and accurately made.

(3) Branch bureau chiefs may adopt a system of joint and several punishment based on the local situation and the condition of residents, taking a 'jia' (a unit of households) or a household as a unit. When implementing this system, the public in the area should be notified in advance that if three violations occur in the area continuously, the power lines of the entire area will be cut off.

(4) If an offender whose electricity meter has been sealed for five days or less by the branch bureau chief fails to complete the equipment setup by the expiration of the sealing period, or if the same family commits a second violation, the branch bureau chief should report the circumstances for review.

(5) The measures decided by the branch bureau chief should be reported every five days, as per practice, regardless of whether there are violations, and in accordance with the matters stipulated in Police Defense Order No. 15. In addition, when applying for the exercise of delegated execution, a factual report should be made each time.

### Japanese Minister to Shanghai, Tsuchida, Gives Inaugural Address; Semi-Review and Implementation of Policies on Various Central China Issues

Mr. Usami, the Japanese Minister to Shanghai, has been ordered to transfer to another post, and Mr. Yutaka Tsuchida has been appointed as his successor. Minister Tsuchida took office on the afternoon of the 19th of this month. On the morning of the 20th, he visited various relevant agencies in the city and gave his initial instructions to the staff of the Shanghai office of the Japanese Embassy in China. Starting at 1:00 PM, he met with the press corps for the first time and made the following remarks:

Speaking to reporters: I am very pleased to be stationed in Central China for the second time. However, compared to my first time in China, the situation has changed greatly, so the administrative policies are also very different. There are many important issues in Central China that need to be resolved urgently, such as adjusting prices, adjusting coal weight, adjusting trade, how to gather the overall strength of Central China to achieve enhanced power, and assisting in the Greater East Asia War, and how to establish the decisive battle posture of Japanese residents in China. These important issues must be reviewed in detail with reference to the opinions of all parties, and then decisions should be made to seek reasonable solutions.

Further news, Mr. Sazo, Minister of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy in China, has been transferred to serve in the Greater East Asia Ministry. His vacancy will be filled by Mr. Tsuchida, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Peiping. His vacancy will be filled by Mr. Yoshitaka Hanawa, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Manchuria.

### Press Conference Held Yesterday at Japanese Embassy Office

The regular press conference of the Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy was held at the 　 Hotel at 2:30 PM yesterday (the 20th). Mr. Matsudaira of the Information Department was unable to attend due to important business and was represented by Vice-Consul Fukuma. He met with Chinese journalists from this city and spoke in great detail about the recent international situation, lasting for two hours.

### Match Unified Tax Rate Increases Twofold

The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance believes that the black market price of matches has soared in recent months, several times higher than the original unified tax valuation. Tax revenue should be increased by adjusting the valuation. However, matches are a daily necessity for the people. While national taxes should certainly be increased, the people's livelihood should also be taken into consideration. Therefore, it is proposed to temporarily add 200% to the current tax rate, while still collecting 10% per 100. It is now scheduled to take effect today (the 21st).

### Agricultural Assistance Association Evaluates Agricultural Products

The Central Agricultural Assistance Association, affiliated with the Allied Embassy, is holding an agricultural product evaluation meeting at the Hongkou Shanghai Shrine today to understand the harvest situation in various regions this year, to assess the quality of agricultural products, and to encourage farmers to promote increased production. Various agricultural products from various counties are collected and displayed for public viewing to promote increased production. Mr. Tsuchida, the president of the association, Vice President Okazaki, and Mr. Zhao Zhengping, president of Shanghai University, are responsible for the evaluation, and awards will be given for superior products.

### Sailors and Seamen Graduate Regularly

The Central Sailor Training Institute has been conducting training for naval sailors and merchant seamen since its establishment. To date, there have been eleven classes of sailors and one class of seamen. It is learned that the graduation ceremony for the 15th class of sailors will be held at the end of this month, and the graduation ceremony for the first class of seamen will be held at the end of December.

### Education Bureau Regularly Distributes; Increased Funding for Municipal Schools

Funding for municipal primary and secondary schools has doubled starting in September and has been approved by the municipal government. It is heard that the Education Bureau has received the funding for September from the municipal government and is scheduled to distribute it to the Hu Nan District, Hu Zhong North District, and Hu Zhong Zhong District on the 21st; to the Hu Xi District, Hu Bei East District, and various municipal middle schools, normal schools, and social education institutions on the 22nd; to the Hu Bei West District and Hu Dong Nan District on the 23rd; and to the Hu Dong Bei District and various municipal schools on the 24th.

### A Visit with Minister Tsuchida

— Wu Gong

When I was coming north as a reporter, an old friend of mine mentioned Mr. Tsuchida, the Counselor of the Allied Embassy in Beijing. It is said that he is a promising new figure in the Japanese diplomatic world and is very close to Foreign Minister and Minister of Greater East Asia, Shigemitsu. After arriving in Beijing, I was too busy with mundane matters and forgot to visit him at the embassy, ​​which was certainly a regret. However, since I read the news in the newspaper here that Counselor Tsuchida had been transferred to become the Allied Minister to Shanghai, I naturally could no longer delay and immediately decided to visit him before he took office.

Deep Parting with Old Friends

Minister Tsuchida only has one single name, called "Yutaka". He has been working at the Allied Embassy in Beijing for six or seven years, so he has a deep friendship with most of the important political figures here. After the news of his departure from Beijing was announced, everyone mourned his departure. Therefore, he was extremely busy before taking office, and I was afraid that he would not have the time to talk to me. One day I talked to that friend about it, and he explained that Wang Yitang was holding a farewell dinner for Minister Tsuchida and also invited him to be an escort, and he could help me arrange a meeting date and time in advance. Unexpectedly, the next day when I was about to ask him if it was all set, he suddenly called and said that Wang's banquet had been canceled because Minister Tsuchida really could not find the time. Therefore, I had no choice but to take the letter of introduction from my old friend and visit him at the embassy myself. But there was one difficulty, which was that I did not understand Japanese, although according to my old friend, Minister Tsuchida spoke very fluent French.

The Beijing Office of the Allied Embassy in China is right next to the Military Headquarters. I have been there several times to see News Director Takeda, so I am familiar with the route. Especially because the Allied personnel here, whether in the military or political aspects, are very polite to our people, it is naturally much more convenient for me, who do not understand Japanese, to visit a Japanese agency!

Marked with a Red Flower

At 3:00 PM on November 15th, I left the Six Nations Hotel where I was staying and took a rickshaw to the embassy. It was already 3:30, but the receptionist said that Minister Tsuchida had been very busy these days and had not yet returned. Therefore, they gave me a red flower, which is a symbol for visiting guests, and asked me to go to the General Affairs Department office upstairs to inquire. But when I went upstairs, there was no one there. I knocked on the door twice lightly, but there was no response. Just as I was in a dilemma, I suddenly saw a clerk coming over, so I regarded him as a savior. I quickly greeted him and asked him to help me inquire inside. As a result, because the General Affairs Director was not there, a Mr. "Motoki" came out to talk to me. I asked him when Minister Tsuchida would return. He said he did not know, but since I had come here, I naturally could not let this opportunity pass lightly, so I requested to wait here. But at that moment, I suddenly saw a handsome middle-aged man, wearing a national defense uniform and a black woolen overcoat, walking in with big strides and sitting down at his desk. Without asking, I knew that this was the General Affairs Director.

Not Recognizing Each Other

After the General Affairs Director was introduced by Mr. Motoki, he came over to greet me and sat down. I immediately asked the General Affairs Director his name, because I saw that he had a dignified appearance and a moderate and peaceful attitude. I had no doubt that he was a capable diplomat. At this moment, Mr. Motoki laughed, because he was the Minister Yutaka Tsuchida I wanted to visit. Until his transfer, the Minister concurrently served as the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Embassy Office. This made me very ashamed, and I quickly expressed my apologies! But Minister Tsuchida was very humble and even asked me when I came to Beijing. So I expressed my apology for not visiting him for more than two months since I came here.

After I knew that he was Minister Tsuchida, I immediately said, "Minister, you have been honorably promoted to Minister to Shanghai this time, I think you must have new ambitions. May I ask you about them?" He said, "Yes, I will discuss everything with you after I arrive in Shanghai. I will definitely fly to Nanjing on the 18th, and I am scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 19th! I don't know when you will return south, sir, but I hope to be in touch with you often in the future!" Then I entered the main topic: "Yesterday I received a telegram from President Chen of your newspaper, asking me to convey his welcome and greetings!" Minister Tsuchida immediately stood up to express his gratitude upon hearing this.

Concerned about People's Livelihood and Future

Slowly, our topic gradually entered the main port. I first said: "The current prices in Shanghai are really scary. I have recently learned from friends and newspapers that the price of rice has risen to more than 20,000 yuan per shi. At this rate, the future of the people's livelihood is really worrying. I wonder if the Minister has any new ideas?" Minister Tsuchida immediately replied that: "The people's livelihood is the basis of all administration. After I arrive in Shanghai, I will carefully discuss appropriate countermeasures with all parties, and I hope you will assist me at any time."

Afterwards, I asked about the economic control issue and said: "Many people in your country also admit that my country's national conditions are different from those of your country. It is indeed necessary to review economic control in my country. I wonder what the Minister thinks about this?" Minister Tsuchida's answer was simple and concise. He said: "Yes, I also hope to discuss this issue with all parties after I arrive in Shanghai." The reporter then asked: "What are the Minister's excellent views on Sino-Japanese cooperation?" He said: "The Tokyo Permanent Bureau has already made a decision on this, and there will be significant developments soon." Finally, the reporter asked: "Recently, Chairman Wang passed away, and Mayor Chen of Shanghai has been promoted to acting chairman. I wonder if the Minister has any opinions on the new candidate for Mayor of Shanghai?" He said: "The issue of people is not a problem. Although Chairman Zhu was unfortunate not to see the completion of full peace, the decision of both China and Japan on it has been unwavering."

After the important questions were completed, the reporter engaged in a more relaxed conversation. During these talks, I learned that Minister Tsuchida was from Tokyo and graduated from Tokyo Imperial University in 1922. Later, he joined the diplomatic service and has been to Europe twice, staying in France for a long time, so he speaks extraordinarily fluent French. He looks no more than 46 or 47 years old, and his gentle and refined demeanor shows at a glance that he is a promising talent among the new diplomats of the Allied countries.

"See You in Shanghai"

Soon, people came in one after another to contact Minister Tsuchida about important business, and I had also heard from Mr. Motoki that he had an important meeting to attend at 4:00 PM, so I shook hands with him and said goodbye. When saying goodbye, we all said the words "See you in Shanghai." Mr. Motoki also sent me to the door and told me that he was Minister Tsuchida's secretary and would also go with him to take office, so I could contact him after I returned to Shanghai, because he speaks Chinese as well as a Chinese person!

### Textual Research on Anecdotes of Mr. Wang Jingwei

On the 16th of this month, this newspaper published anecdotes about Mr. Wang. Yesterday, the reader Mr. Wu Fushui sent a letter to add textual research. The original letter is as follows: Dear Editor, in yesterday's issue of your newspaper, "Anecdotes of Mr. Wang Jingwei, Part 2," in the section "According to...", "The young man who bombed Fenghuang Mountain on the fourth day of the ninth month of the Xinhai year was Zhou Zhizhen, a native of Shunde, Guangdong..." This does not conform to the facts. The young man who bombed Fenghuang Mountain that year was Li 　, courtesy name Yingsheng, from Huiyang, Guangdong. The young man who went to Beijing to visit the prison on the night of December 28th of the Gengxu year was also Mr. Li, not Zhou Zhizhen. Mr. Li is now in Hanmen. The 　 movie 　 star Li Dandan, later changed to a pilot, renamed Li 　qing, is the daughter of Mr. Li. To clarify the history of the Party and the country, I hereby testify. Wu Fushui.

### Why Need a License for Lodging?

I, a humble person, am lodging with my relative 　 Hu on Huangshan Road this spring. Because of our close relationship, I do not pay rent or have a lease. There is no landlord-tenant relationship between me and my relative. (According to Article 421 of the Civil Code: "A lease is a contract in which one party agrees to rent a thing to the other party for use or profit, and the other party pays rent.") Therefore, there is no need for a house sublease license. However, at the end of last month, a person who delivered house sublease licenses came to inquire, saying that I must apply for a license and that it is now impossible to apply for it and I must pay a fine of 10,000 yuan, but if I bribe them, 5,000 yuan can settle it. At that time, because my relative and I were not at home, they did not get what they wanted and left, but I think they will still come to harass us soon.

House sublease licenses were originally intended to protect subtenants from excessive exploitation by sublandlords, which is a very good intention. Now, it is heard that since I am merely lodging and not renting, my relative is certainly not bound by the house sublease regulations, and I do not need to ask for the protection of those regulations, nor can I allow my relative to suffer innocent losses. However, a few unscrupulous people in that office distort the law and use it as a shield for extortion, which is contrary to the purpose of the authorities' legislation. (To a Loyal Heart)

### Layman Rong Boyun Donates Fees to Help the Needy

### Chinese Moral Improvement Society - Winter Relief Efforts

The Chinese Moral Improvement Society on Zheng Guan Road has consistently undertaken charitable activities such as providing congee, distributing cloth, providing free medical treatment and medicine, providing small loans, and running an orphanage, sparing no effort. As winter approaches and the weather turns cold, the poor are not only suffering from a lack of food but also lack warm clothing to protect themselves. They have no one to turn to for help, which is truly pitiful. Therefore, the Society is expanding its winter relief efforts by providing congee and clothing. It plans to raise 200 shi of rice and 4,000 sets of clothing, requiring over 10 million yuan. Deeply concerned about its limited capacity, the Society appeals to philanthropists from all walks of life for their support to jointly undertake this righteous cause.

### Convenient Remittance to Nantong

I live in the eastern countryside of Nantong—Yudongtou Jiahai. Previously, due to the needs of my family, postal remittances were not possible, and there was no convenient way to bring money back, which was quite difficult. Later, a friend told me that the He & Co. at Room 314, No. 33, Sichuan Road provides remittance services for customers, which are fast and reliable. After contacting them, Mr. Shui Zhou helped me remit the money. I have now received a letter from my family saying that they have received the money correctly. It only took one week, which is very fast. Given the current transportation difficulties, I am borrowing a corner of your newspaper to inform my fellow villagers who want to remit money. (Scholar)

The Relationship Between Blood Type and Personality

Five hundred years ago, when a Roman teacher was in critical condition, three boys were used for blood transfusions, but all four died. One hundred years ago, sheep's blood was used for transfusions, but none of the recipients survived. This was because the secret of life fluids had not yet been discovered, and this precious blood could not be used. It was not until after the First European War that blood types were clearly classified, and it was then that people realized that blood types are divided into four major categories and understood the compatibility of blood donors and recipients. From then on, blood transfusions became safe and risk-free. After much research, the relationship between blood type and heredity has also become clearer, and the relationship between blood type and personality has only recently come to our attention. The quality, strength, and weakness of a nation are also directly affected by the blood type index. Recently, it has become known that the frequency of various diseases also varies depending on blood type and constitution. Most notably, although blood type is controlled by heredity, siblings do not necessarily have the same blood type, and parents and children do not necessarily have the same blood type. Therefore, the ancient Chinese method of "blood kinship recognition" is no longer valid. However, we are now able to use newly discovered sub-blood types to resolve such forensic disputes. At the same time, we can also explain the differences in personality between father and son, and brothers, which is related to blood type. Each person's body has its own hidden characteristics, which are divided into four major categories according to blood type. These latent tendencies and each person's fixed blood type remain unchanged throughout life.

The Japanese scholar Furukawa believes that people with type O blood are of the willpower type. Most of them have a very strong will and spirit and are not easily swayed by external emotions, which is what Wundt called phlegmatic. However, these people are subjective in their actions and do not easily integrate with others, so they do not have many friends. Type A blood is the thinking type. Most of them are gentle, cautious, careful, humble, good at socializing, and have a spirit of compassion and sacrifice, which is what Wundt called the nervous type. However, these people are taciturn and lack decisiveness and courage. Even when lending money to others, they do not have the courage to ask for repayment and are easily constrained by emotions. Type B blood is the feeling type. Most of them are lively, innocent, cheerful, optimistic, friendly, sensitive, bold, and decisive, which is what Wundt called sanguine. However, these people have a weak will and are easily swayed by events. However, many people like to associate with them, so they have many friends. Type AB blood is the contradictory type. Most of them appear cheerful and open-minded, but they are very deep in their hearts. Therefore, these people are the most difficult to grasp and understand. They have the temperament of type B blood on the outside, but they have the strengths and weaknesses of type A blood on the inside. However, their temperament is unstable and they are not easy to flatter.

Type AB blood is the rarest in all ethnic groups. In China, you won't find one in ten people. In southern China, there are more people with type A blood than type B blood, while in northern China, there are more people with type B blood than type A blood. There are also more people with type O blood in the south than in the north. Therefore, determining your own blood type is not only for preventing accidents and blood transfusions, but also for understanding your inherent potential personality, so that you can fully develop your strengths and eliminate your weaknesses. As for students choosing subjects based on personality and employees choosing occupations based on their aptitudes, all of this can be greatly benefited.

### The China Children's Welfare Association Hopes for Continued Donations
