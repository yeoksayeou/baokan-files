### Weekly Review: Collection of Essays by Tosuke Yoshida, Volume 2 - Preface

— Tosuke Yoshida

The second volume of my essay collection and the Japanese version of "Japan's Reflection and China's Innovation" have been published simultaneously. This book also includes the preface to the Japanese version of the essay collection. Readers only need to read it once to understand my intention in publishing this book, so this volume does not require a dedicated preface. However, here, I need to say a few more words to Chinese readers. I believe that the readers who can best understand my words at this stage are not the Japanese people I most want to read this book, but the Chinese people. I believe that Japanese readers, especially those who quickly left China and do not understand the actual situation on the ground, have not yet fully understood my words. I firmly believe that in the near future, Japanese readers will understand my intentions as well as Chinese readers. However, at present, those who fiercely criticize my words as heresy still echo across the river. Furthermore, I believe that perhaps because of this book, I will be rejected by the people of my beloved motherland. Even in that unfortunate situation, I still firmly believe that my view of China is the correct direction for Japan to take. At the same time, I also believe that Chinese readers in that situation will support my correct words even more. This is because Chinese readers are the most qualified judges of articles about China.

However, some readers may feel uncomfortable because the author of this essay collection is Japanese. Therefore, they conclude that all Japanese words, even if they seem correct at first glance, definitely have ulterior motives at heart. I understand the feelings of these readers very well, and I want to answer them. No matter what position I take, I am still Japanese. Being Japanese, I love Japan and hope for Japan's development. So, for the sake of Japan's development, if sacrificing China is necessary, then perhaps I would use cultural work to deceive or anesthetize the Chinese people for this purpose. Now, let's take ten thousand steps back and assume that I am such a person, and assume that I am publishing this essay collection for such a purpose.

Consider a Japanese story. A certain villain wanted to deceive a compassionate feudal lord in order to get the lord to reward him. So, this person, who was usually not filial, carried his elderly mother on his back in a place where the lord could see him, feigning filial piety in every possible way. The lord saw this and greatly admired his filial piety, immediately bestowing a sum of money upon him. However, later, it became clear that he was a notorious rogue who was pretending to be filial to his mother in order to deceive the lord and get the reward. The lord's family members were very angry and wanted to catch the villain and punish him. But the lord did not allow it, saying: I knew long ago that this fellow was a bad egg. However, even if he is a bad egg, if he pretends to be a filial son, he can get a reward. If people understand this point, they will imitate this bad egg and pretend to be filial. If the whole society pretends to be filial, then there is hope for creating good customs and beautiful traditions in a society of bad people.

Just as that feudal lord correctly pointed out, no matter what the actor's motivation is, once the behavior is expressed externally, the behavior itself is divorced from the actor's motivation and has its own objectivity. For example, a person who is not good at drawing wants to draw a tiger subjectively. With a stroke of the brush, what is drawn does not look like a tiger, but like a cat. Then, objectively, this is a cat picture. Now, even if I subjectively intend to deceive and anesthetize the Chinese people by writing articles, if the articles themselves are objectively truth, then they naturally have cultural value. What I want to solemnly point out here is that the cultural work itself and the author's personality are not the same thing, but have their own objectivity. I hope that readers will objectively criticize the articles collected in this essay collection, saying that what is correct is correct, and saying that what is wrong is wrong. As for saying that the same work is wrong if written by a Japanese person, and correct if written by a Chinese person, this kind of nationalistic attitude is already outdated. Japanese and Chinese people are originally all nations whose emotions are easily aroused. If strong emotions are guided by good reason, they can do good things. However, if they are used by external bad people, they can make big and terrible mistakes. When the emotions of the two major nations are intense, it is difficult to calm them down. However, the current era is very urgently demanding that the two major nations calmly listen to reason. In short, this essay collection should not be judged based on whether the author is Japanese or a Hottentot. All objectively correct statements should be praised as correct, and no judgments should be made based on whether the author is Chinese or an Eskimo, and all errors should be severely criticized as errors. Moreover, in this era, I firmly believe that Japan's development is impossible if China does not develop. At the same time, true Asian liberation is impossible if the two major nations of China and Japan do not truly unite. I hope that Chinese readers will not criticize my articles based on the fact that I am Japanese, but will use reason and discuss the articles themselves. If I am wrong, please correct me with a comrade's attitude. This is my earnest request to Chinese readers. (Translated by Lu)

### Marshal Koga's Honorable Death in Battle: Our Government and Public Extend Condolences; Minister Ren Hai Chang and Minister Lin, Among Others, Express Their Thoughts

Nanjing, June 6th, Central News Agency report: The Allied General Headquarters announced yesterday that Admiral Mineichi Koga, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, honorably died in battle this March while commanding operations on the front lines. Vice Admiral Soemu Toyoda has been appointed to succeed him. After the news was released, all sectors here, from the government to the public, expressed deep condolences. Since taking over as Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet last April, Admiral Koga had overcome difficulties, stood at the forefront, commanded calmly, established brilliant achievements, demonstrated the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy, and inflicted great setbacks on the enemy. His spirit of not fearing sacrifice, of being loyal and brave in serving the country, and of fighting for the liberation of East Asia, strengthens the determination of the one billion people of East Asia, amidst mourning, to destroy the old enemy and complete the war.

Central News Agency report: Marshal Koga of the Ming Union Japanese Joint Fleet, commanded the battle on the front lines and honorably sacrificed his life. Yesterday, the reporter especially visited Ren Hai Chang, and Principal Jiang of the Central Naval Academy, and the following are their expressed thoughts:

Ren Hai Chang:

Admiral Koga has assisted our country's navy construction very much, and my personal friendship with him is very deep. This time, following Marshal Yamamoto, he gave his life for his country, and the people of both countries extend their condolences. But "death in battle" is the supreme glory for a soldier. Because of Admiral Koga's grand sacrifice, the people of both countries will increase their hatred for the enemy and their determination to work together, and become even more invigorated. If so, then Admiral Koga's spirit can be comforted, and victory in the war can also be demonstrated as a result, because the operation of the army depends entirely on the morale of the soldiers. Looking at the repeated victories of the Allied Navy after Marshal Yamamoto's death in battle, the destruction of Britain and the United States can be expected in the near future.

Principal Jiang:

I had many opportunities to get close to Commander Koga when he was in Shanghai, and I have long admired his high personality. Later, when he was honorably transferred to the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, I felt that his extraordinary courage was worthy of congratulations. Recently, I was shocked to hear the news of his death in battle, and I deeply feel that my past admiration was not in vain. In terms of the Greater East Asia War, we extend our sincere gratitude to him, but with the admiration of the past, my heart is truly overwhelmed with sorrow. Since I placed myself in the New Navy and cooperated with the Allied Navy officers and soldiers, I have greatly admired their learning and training, and their officers' strict and pure cultivation, especially, is beyond our reach. Admiral Koga's awe-inspiring and immortal spirit is not only a model for the spirit of our New Navy, but also a guarantee for the victory of the Greater East Asia War.

Minister Lin:

Nanjing, June 6th, Central News Agency report: Marshal Koga, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Navy, was honorably killed in action. Our government and people are in mourning. Propaganda Minister Lin, especially expressed his remarks yesterday, The Allied Navy Combined Fleet Commander-in-Chief Marshal Koga, did not avoid danger this time, personally went to the front lines to command operations, and therefore died in battle. The people of the National Government, in addition to their grief, deeply admire the greatness of the traditional spirit of the Allied Navy. The Allied Navy held this spirit, all officers and soldiers were determined to serve the country, bravely made sacrifices, and were loyal to their duties. Therefore, since the outbreak of the war, they have been victorious in every battle and invincible in every attack. When the war situation becomes more intense, they can be more strictly prepared to meet the enemy, so that any conspiracy of the enemy's counterattack has nowhere to use its skills. This spirit is the greatest grasp of decisive victory in the naval battle of the Greater East Asia War, and also the most solid cornerstone of the Great Wall of Ten Thousand Miles in East Asia. General Toyota took over as Commander-in-Chief. The Allied Navy is determined to inherit the spirit of Marshals Yamamoto and Koga and continue to struggle. To repay the family, to protect East Asia. Although Marshals Yamamoto and Koga did not see the final battle results, the glorious victory of the Greater East Asia decisive battle will surely comfort the spirits of the two marshals in heaven, and can be predicted.

The Emperor Bestowed the Title of Marshal

Tokyo, June 5th, Central News Agency report: The Japanese Information Bureau announced on the 5th: His Majesty the Emperor, in recognition of Admiral Mineichi Koga, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, for his offensive actions, especially bestowed the title of Marshal, listed him in the Marshal's Office, awarded him the First Class Order of Merit, the Order of the Rising Sun Paulownia Flowers Grand Cordon, and was awarded the third rank.

### In the West of Yu-Ping-Han Railway in Henan, the Japanese Army Repeatedly Won Victories, Occupying Jia County, Yu County, and Linru.

Henan Frontline, June 6th, Central News Agency report: Yu Army and the 91st Division Commander Jin Yingbai, 93rd Division Commander Yang Wei, and the 21st Division Commander Liu Chen, directly under the 31st Army Group, all under Ma Liwu's command, totaling more than 10,000 men, attempted to go north from Yu County. The elite Japanese troops divided into multiple task forces and launched a surprise attack. The Japanese army went straight to Yu County (70 kilometers southwest of Zhengzhou,) and surrounded it from three sides, further cutting off its route to the north. The Japanese army launched a fierce attack on the city on the 3rd. The Yu garrison of more than 8,000 men engaged in a fierce bayonet battle. In the evening, they broke into a corner of Yu County.

Afterwards, the main force of the Japanese infantry launched a frontal assault from the east, with a portion also advancing from north to south. That evening, the enemy finally could not withstand it, and the Japanese army completely captured Linru, breaking into the enemy's deep defense line. Linru is Tang Enbo's second line of defense, with a dangerous terrain, built with cement fortifications, and equipped with a training institute for Yu special agents. It occupies an important position both geographically and politically.

Tokyo, June 5th, Central News Agency report: Henan Frontline report on the 6th, the Japanese army completely occupied Jiao County (70 kilometers west of Xuchang), which was defended to the death by the Yu 22nd Division, on the 3rd.

### Yu and the US Attempts Were All Foiled

Hankou, June 6th, Central News Agency report: The First War Zone Army under Jiang Dingwen, possessing 40 divisions, totaling 400,000 men, lost its only stronghold in North China since the Central Plains Battle in the 30th year. At the same time, its combat power declined. For three years, it could only lie dormant along the Jinghan line on the south bank of the Yellow River and the Funiu Mountains. After the enemy and the US forces began their counter-offensive against Japan, the army received the Chongqing order of "victory in the war", attempting to launch a general counter-offensive against Japan, hoping to recapture North China, and began preparations. On May 1st of last year, Jiang Dingwen, commander of the First War Zone, began to formulate methods. The first was to strengthen the army's divisions, implement military construction, replenish equipment, and form mechanized units. The second was to build storage depots in the war zone to prepare for air control against Japan, or to bomb Manchuria. The third was to improve the increase in combat power, focusing on the increase of morale, and mobilizing the people's power of the entire war zone. The center of the enemy's war zone defense is the mountainous area west of the Yellow River, mainly in Fanshui, and the large plain of Henan along the Jinghan line. The main battlefields were Fanshui and Dengfeng Linru, on the battle line between the Funiu Mountains, with a total length of 200 kilometers and a width of tens of kilometers, with many war-army heavy artillery. Furthermore, trenches were dug in the Xin Yellow River area, covering trenches and various positions to prevent the Japanese army's tank offensive. In particular, Tang Enbo, the most trusted by Chiang Kai-shek among the Chongqing generals, was transferred as an adjutant to grasp the actual power of defense in that war zone. The affiliated troops totaled 4 army groups, reaching 250,000, working hard to cultivate combat power, and changing the deployment of various armies last fall, in order to enhance the defense of the Yellow River. At the same time, Jiang Dingwen held a military conference in Luoyang on January 20 to discuss the plan for a general counter-offensive against North China. On the one hand, US generals and officers in Chongqing inspected the military situation in war zones such as Luoyang Yecheng and other places. US Air Force in Chongqing expanded and prepared air force bases in more than a dozen places such as Nanyang and Yecheng in Henan, so that the heavy bomber force could take off and land freely. They were actively preparing for a general counter-offensive against Japan on both land and air. Unexpectedly, in this Henan operation, they were attacked by the preemptive attack of the Japanese army, and annihilation operations were launched one after another in various places. The Chongqing army not only failed to launch a counter-offensive, but instead suffered this heavy blow.

### Japanese Aircraft Bomb Guangxi

A certain base, June 6th, Central News Agency report: A Japanese army dive bomber squadron raided the US Air Force forward base in Danzhu Airport, Guilin Province, on May 5th, and the attached military facilities were severely damaged. On that day, the Yu aircraft did not intercept, nor did anti-aircraft fire retaliate. All Japanese aircraft have safely returned to base.

### Rainy Season Approaches in India Front; Japanese Air Force Bomb Enemy Airfield; Enemy Troops' Morale Shaken by Large-Scale Formation

Rangoon, June 6th, Central News Agency report: The enemy air force dare-to-die team has been trapped in a state of blockade as a result of the Japanese air and land attack. Now that the US Air Force seems to be starting to stir again, the Japanese Air Force, in view of this, raided the enemy's Linamitham Calling Airfield with a low-altitude bombing squadron on the 4th. The airfield was parked with six Douglas No. 3 aircraft and eleven large gliders. Flying in from a distance, the enemy aviation soldiers were walking on the airfield, seemingly unaware of the Japanese Air Force's attack. After the Japanese Air Force flew from the clouds to the airspace above the airfield, the squadron leader immediately led the implementation of ultra-low-altitude bombing, dropping many giant bombs, completely destroying six Douglas aircraft and eleven gliders. More than a hundred enemy soldiers were caught off guard and were all killed. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.

Tokyo, June 6th, Central News Agency report: A Japanese army base on the India-Burma front reports that after the news of the approach of the Japanese-Indian allied forces to Imphal reached the Assam region, the residents of the area were extremely excited.

Taking advantage of the fact that the British were unable to suppress them, they densely gathered on the outskirts of Imphal and discussed the strategy after the arrival of the Japanese and Indian armies.

Tokyo, June 5th, Central News Agency report: According to a dispatch from a certain place on the India-Burma border front, the India-Burma front will enter the rainy season. After the enemy troops were lured into the Imphal basin, they are now deploying a large rotating formation, receiving food and ammunition from the air, and desperately resisting the fierce attack of the Japanese army, waiting for the arrival of the rainy season. Now, the enemy troops in this large rotating formation are extremely demoralized due to repeated failures.

### Gandhi's Health Weakens; Regains Freedom Yesterday; Many Confidants Also Released on the Same Day

Lisbon, June 6th, Central News Agency report: German News Agency reports: According to New Delhi sources, the Indian government announced today the release of Gandhi. According to the announcement, this unconditional release is based entirely on Gandhi's health considerations. After his release, Mr. Gandhi was sent by Prison Inspector Colonel Barndari to the home of Mrs. Kalhor Saif in Balnagar, a close friend of Mr. Gandhi. In May 1934, Mr. Gandhi fasted for ten days in Mrs. Kalhor Saif's home.

Lisbon, June 6th, Central News Agency report: According to a telegram from Pune, after Gandhi left the Aga Khan Palace on the 6th, his symptoms were published by two attending physicians as follows: Gandhi has been in poor health since April 10, and his symptoms worsened on the 14th. Since the 16th, his body temperature has increased, showing malaria-like symptoms, and his blood pressure is low. Although he is very weak, his spirit is still cheerful. Friends and acquaintances hope that he can fully recuperate.

Amsterdam, June 6th, Central News Agency report: German News Agency reports: According to reports from Pune, in addition to Gandhi himself, the British-Indian authorities have also released Miss Miraben, the daughter of a certain British navy lieutenant general, as well as Dr. Kilde Mayer (a former member of the Bombay government) and Gandhi's female secretary.

### England's Cunning and Vicious Policy

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – An individual deeply familiar with the situation in India recently criticized England's cunning policy of releasing Gandhi as follows: The authorities of violent England released Gandhi on the 6th. There are two reasons for releasing Gandhi: Since Japan's successful invasion of India, the morale of the people within the country has been shaken. England has had no choice but to compromise with the Indian people. This is a shift from a policy of suppression to a superficial democracy, and it symbolizes their deceptive tactics towards the masses, which have remained consistent from the past to the present. Gandhi recently suffered from malaria and was on the verge of death. England feared that Gandhi would die in prison and, to avoid responsibility, released him. Judging from the announcement by the Governor-General of India, the first reason is quite believable. After news of Gandhi and Nehru suffering in prison spread, the Indian people unanimously demanded the release of the leaders of the Congress Party, but the Governor-General of India consistently refused. The fact that Gandhi is now being released is due to his advanced stage of illness. The shrewd English, seeing that Gandhi is about to die, aim to avoid responsibility and, at the same time, appease the Indian people with this move. Their vicious cunning has reached its peak. Why does England only release Gandhi and not Nehru and others who are suffering in prison? From this perspective, England's true intentions are very clear.

### Enemy Aircraft and Boats Clash Near Rabaul

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) – According to a telegram from San Francisco, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Headquarters announced on the 4th that during an "unfortunate battle" near Rabaul, American fighter planes and fast boats lost two aircraft and suffered multiple casualties. A broadcast from the Tras base in New Guinea also reported that on the 30th, American fighter planes mistook friendly fast boats for Japanese boats and attacked them, causing them to run aground. The fast boats also shot down one of the fighter planes. Other fast boats that came to rescue the grounded boat were also attacked by fighter planes, but one of the attacking planes was soon shot down. Both aircraft sustained heavy damage.

### Military Attachés from Various Countries Stationed in Japan Inspect Captured Weapons

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – Military attachés from Japan's Axis allies, including China, Germany, Italy, Romania, France, Manchuria, and the Philippines, formed a tour group and visited the Tama River Exhibition Hall at 2 PM on the 5th. As they were all military experts, they were very enthusiastic when observing the enemy's weapons. The group paid particular attention to the spoils of war captured in Singapore. At that time, Lieutenant Colonel Asakuno of the General Staff Headquarters and Lieutenant Colonel Sawada of the Army Press Department provided detailed explanations of everything. After an hour-long tour, a discussion meeting was held. Romanian Major General Radolescu expressed his gratitude, saying: "Seeing so many captured weapons symbolizing the Japanese army's victory, I can only express my gratitude and wish the Japanese army continued success."

### Korea Actively Increases Rice and Grain Production; Youth Training Achieves Excellent Results

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – The recent situation in the Korean peninsula is as follows: Since the Governor-General of Korea announced the implementation of the conscription system on August 1st of last year, the 25 million compatriots on the peninsula have been filled with joy and gratitude. A total of 220,000 people are eligible for conscription, of which 110,000 have not yet received education. As a result of special youth training since Showa 17 (1942), excellent results have been achieved. In the past, when the volunteer system was implemented in Showa 13 (1938), there were already two who served as second lieutenants, more than one hundred non-commissioned officers, and dozens who died in battle. It is believed that the conscripts this time will definitely inherit this aspiration and become outstanding members of the Imperial Army. Regarding the public sentiment within Korea, it has gradually become solid, and there is no cause for concern. However, the ideological trends of the masses on the peninsula, who lack education, cannot be said to require no attention. To address this, education must be continued, and loyal elements must be thoroughly valued to prevent them from being taken advantage of by unstable elements. Regarding rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains, harvests in the 17th and 18th years were not as good as in previous years due to natural disasters. However, a production responsibility system has been established for this year. The production target is 26 million koku of rice (the average annual production is 23.3 million koku), and 20 million koku of wheat and miscellaneous grains (the average annual production is 16 million koku). The production responsibility has been shared between landowners and producers. Furthermore, due to favorable weather this year, it is expected that the honor of Korea as a granary can be restored without any problems. Since free maritime transport between the mainland and Korea has been changed to land transport, the transport bridge between the mainland and Korea and the Korean transport business are becoming increasingly strengthened. The previous transport rate for passengers and goods has now changed, with passengers accounting for only 16%. In addition, both the Gyeongui and Gyeongbu lines are being urgently rebuilt as double tracks, but there are some difficulties in terms of transporting materials.

### England and America Lift Oil Embargo on Spain

Bilbao, 6th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: The Spanish oil tanker "Sotelo" departed from here yesterday for Aruba to transport 10,000 tons of oil back to Spain. In addition, five oil tankers in Malaga, Seville, Barcelona, and Piva-Ixia will soon depart for Central America to transport 38,000 tons of oil. Therefore, according to the treaty recently established between Spain, England, and America, 41,000 tons of oil will be supplied each month, and the amount supplied in May will safely reach Spain.

### Air Raids on the European Continent Every Day; Many American Planes Shot Down Attacking Romania

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports, military news: A large formation of American bombers attacked the Romanian capital yesterday afternoon, and at least 52 were shot down. Before the enemy planes even reached Romanian territory, the German and Romanian air forces shot down more than ten of them over the Danube River. The Romanian capital used concentrated anti-aircraft fire to repel the enemy planes. Several enemy four-engine planes were hit in the air and destroyed. It is believed that in addition to the above-mentioned 52 planes, many more were damaged and unable to return to their bases.

### Roman City Area Bombed Again

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: Yesterday, American bomber groups heavily bombed the densely populated eastern area of Rome. This was the first large-scale bombing after Irish Prime Minister Eamon de Valera requested the belligerent nations to protect Rome and Germany guaranteed that Rome was a demilitarized city. In the past 24 hours, there have been no major developments in the air war in Europe. The anti-Axis air force continues to focus on bombing transportation lines in German-occupied areas of Western Europe and Western Germany. Several enemy planes targeted France last night and dropped bombs in the Cologne and Mannheim areas. Eleven American planes were shot down.

### Turkey Holds Air Defense Drill

Istanbul, 6th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: A test air raid alarm was issued here on the evening of the 5th, and the public remained calm as usual. It is reported that there had been no blackout or air raid drills since 1940.

### England and America to Hold Invasion of Europe Prayer Day

Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: According to a message from London today, the Church of England authorities plan to hold a national prayer day when the invasion of Europe begins. The United States also has a similar proposal, and New York Governor Dewey has ordered that all churches in New York State must hold prayers on the day the invasion of Europe begins.

### War News from the Eastern Front

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency military reporter Saito commented on the current situation of the European war, stating that the possibility of an Anglo-American attack on Western Europe is becoming increasingly apparent. The Soviet army's offensive northwest of Iasi on Tuesday can be regarded as a major battle preceding the expected large-scale offensive. Before this large-scale Soviet offensive, there were only local battles, and both sides were generally improving their offensive and defensive positions before the outbreak of a major battle.

### Today's Education in China

— Fan Zhongyun

Educators Inferior to Rickshaw Pullers

In this day and age, most people consider matters of education and culture to be insignificant and despise them. Because in times of war, "victory is first"—and second, of course, is not "failure," but it is certainly not education. As a result, the funding for education and culture is the smallest proportion of the national budget, and the rewards for those engaged in education and culture are meager compared to any other profession. They are truly "beggars" (educators) today. Or perhaps you think I'm exaggerating, then look at the compensation of rickshaw pullers, generally considered the lowest class of society, which far exceeds that of university professors at prestigious national universities. As for primary and secondary school teachers, that goes without saying. So some people think that the Shanghai slang "pain three," should be written as "hua shan," meaning someone who holds a pen and wears a long gown, or "pen three." Because there are many long-gowned figures who hold pens, not necessarily school teachers, but teachers use pens more than others. They use pens in peacetime, red pens to correct papers, and chalk in class. They use three pens in one body, so there is good reason for them to be reduced to "pen three."

Therefore, teachers are the most looked down upon people in today's society, practically equivalent to outcasts. The general view seems to be that teaching is what the most unsuccessful people do. Although there used to be the saying, "All occupations are lowly, only studying is noble," a group of ignorant people can become millionaires overnight. They have money, and money represents everything. According to the Anglo-American view of materialism, money is the meaning of so-called "success." The English word "Success" is all about 洋 (dollars). So wealthy businessmen are today's successful figures. On the other hand, teachers who have fallen to "pen three" or "beggars" are undoubtedly losers in the struggle for survival and deserve to be abandoned.

But having said that, although teachers in primary, secondary, and universities are despised by some people, everyone attaches great importance to the students in these schools. They know that young students are the most useful and precious. Therefore, politicians who strive for advancement are willing to use the money they have worked hard to obtain to subsidize and buy off students. They need a crowd that can cheer them on, and students are the most numerous. They need followers who can blindly obey, and students are the most valuable to exploit. So they need students for welcomes and farewells, and they also need students for meetings and speeches. During parades and celebrations, the most organized ranks are students. And when it comes to destroying opium dens and gambling houses, the most capable thugs are none other than students. However, this is a peaceful area now, so the passionate patriotic stunts from before the incident are no longer needed.

The Commercialization of Students

Originally, the meaning of being a student, literally, is to learn everything in life. The most important thing in life is undoubtedly how to live and seek a prosperous life. But today, the result of studying is that the more you study, the more helpless you become. Look at the university professors with PhDs from gold-standard countries, aren't they having trouble with even three meals a day? Aren't the students who study hardest and get the best grades in school mostly relegated to lower positions after graduation? On the other hand, aren't those students who spend their days in meetings and engaged in activities, receiving generous subsidies while in school and enjoying superior positions after leaving school? So now, studying is not only useless but also harmful. It used to be thought that "there are golden houses in books, there are beautiful women in books," but the result of "studying to death" today is bound to be "reading to death." What is needed now is "reading living books." Zilu in the Analects also said, "Why must one read books before learning?" Leaving the classroom and going into society is the right thing to do. Then why have schools at all? Then I can answer that for the sake of future life, qualifications and diplomas are essential. In other words, today's schools are just factories or shops that produce qualifications and diplomas for sale. And our so-called universities especially show the nature of this kind of commercial buying and selling.

The Style of University Students

Because of this, as far as Chinese education is concerned, the worst is the university, followed by the middle school, and the comparatively better is the primary school. But in terms of the national funds spent on education, the largest proportion is for universities, followed by middle schools, and the smallest amount is for primary schools. (The League of Nations inspection team before the incident clearly pointed this out.) Why is the funding for primary schools less than that for middle schools and universities? The reason is very simple, because primary school students have little utility value, at most they can be used as crowds to wave flags and shout slogans in front of some important people. Then why are the results of primary schools, which receive the least funding, the best? Then one sentence can answer: because there is too little funding, relatively few people try to stir up trouble, the school is relatively stable, and although those running the school are in hardship, they can have some plans and gradually seek to realize them. On the other hand, because universities have more funding, and the so-called university students are the most exploitable followers, universities have become objects that politicians trying to develop their careers must compete for. Educational institutions often change with the rise and fall of political tides, so of course they will not have good results. And we can say that this situation was the case before the incident, and this trend has not changed after the incident. At the same time, there is no difference between the war zone and the peaceful zone.

As for the quality of the results of primary, secondary, and universities, I can cite one or two examples based on my usual observations to illustrate. We know that one important purpose of education is to cultivate a kind attitude towards others in children. Therefore, in the Six Arts of the Confucian school, etiquette is the most important. And today, the most impolite among young people are university students who have received higher education. We see that primary school students as a rule stand and bow to teachers, middle school students are not so. They still know how to show respect to teachers, mostly nodding their heads. As for university students, they are arrogant, with no one in their eyes, seeing but not seeing, like strangers on the road. Primary school students regard teachers as elders, middle school students regard them as peers and friends, and university students regard them as no different from servants. Originally, the disrespect for teachers has been around for a long time. Han Yu deeply lamented it, but in any case, it has not degenerated to the level of today's Chinese university students—especially Shanghai university students. If students usually treat teachers like this, one can imagine how they treat other people. Therefore, general companies and businesses often do not want students, and prefer to use people who come from the old-fashioned apprenticeship system.

Lack of a Spirit of Inquiry

Another important thing in education is the attitude towards reading and studying. Then today's university students lack the spirit of inquiry the most. If primary school students don't understand something, they will often persistently ask teachers and parents. Middle school students don't ask so much. As for university students, they consider it shameful to ask others, so they simply ignore what is going on. For example, in class, primary school students are truly in class listening to lectures, middle school students are mostly absent-minded, their bodies are in the classroom, but their minds are outside the school. As for university students, they simply don't go to class. If all the university students are present in class, with no one absent, that would be a complete novelty. As a rule, they are scattered, late and leaving early. So some people say that primary school students truly read books, middle school students pretend to read books, and university students don't read books. In fact, university students have too many things to care about. They have to participate in political organizations, engage in social movements, and in addition, love, watching dramas, and dancing are also important programs in daily life. How can they manage to be so busy? Therefore, if you ask today's students and young people about famous events or figures in Chinese history, they will often be confused and give irrelevant answers, but if you talk about movies and stars, they will be familiar with their stories and characters, and regard famous male and female stars as objects of worship and faith. The pictures pasted on the walls, placed on the desks, and clipped in the books are all pictures of stars. When stars arrive, the city is empty, and most of them are male and female students. I really don't know what kind of education this is! But now those above are advocating it, and those below are following it. Important people support stars, using special cars for welcome and farewell, and personally hosting them. As a result, the whole country follows the trend, and the remaining influence is just beginning.

### Fifth Air Defense Day Conducts Evacuation Training; Air Defense Headquarters Announces Matters of Citizen Responsibility

The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters authorities issued the following statement on the fifth Air Defense Day on the 9th of this month:

The air defense training planned for the fifth Air Defense Day will focus on evacuation and seeking shelter. These two aspects are considered passive air defense measures. Citizens often consider them unimportant and neglect them. They know to work hard on fire prevention and rescue, and the results are obvious. As a result, the training in evacuation and seeking shelter is far behind what is expected. They don't know that during an air raid, if evacuation and seeking shelter can be planned perfectly and carried out thoroughly, it can reduce the workload of firefighters and rescue personnel and make it easier for them to cope. Therefore, each protection group should consider the scope of danger in a time of crisis, open as many air raid shelters as possible, set up as many evacuation and seeking shelter places as possible, and practice diligently at all times so that when an incident occurs, they are already skilled and can cope easily. The selection of instructors should be given special attention, as these supervisors must be able to lead the masses so that they can maintain order and not do whatever they want, even when they are afraid and disoriented. We sincerely hope that citizens will plan in advance and implement the three training items of "pre-evacuation," "emergency evacuation," and "preparing to hide" on the fifth Air Defense Day.

On-site Observation

Secondly, in order to give each protection group the opportunity to learn from each other, on-site inspections of the training exercises will be conducted on the fifth Air Defense Day. The number of participants in the exercises should be in accordance with the pre-arranged plan, and they should deal with everything in the spirit of encountering an air raid, so that they are skilled, courageous, and agile, and the observers can know it at a glance. Those watching the exercises should also pay attention to the movements of the performers with a learning attitude, so as to learn from them and help improve themselves. After the meeting, the learners will propose the material studied as information for research and improvement. Therefore, when conducting on-site inspections, it is imperative to refrain from smoking, talking and laughing loudly, or standing by with folded arms.

On the fifth Air Defense Day, evacuation and rescue exercises will be conducted in schools of China and Japan. Instructors and rescue personnel have already started training classes, and it is hoped that within a reasonable amount of time, the trainees will take on the role of instructors for evacuation and rescue.

Regarding strengthening the organization of special protection groups, this headquarters has repeatedly mentioned it. On the fifth Air Defense Day, in addition to the training of ordinary protection groups, personnel from the Army and Navy Air Defense Command Headquarters, bookstores, and the Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters will go to various high-rise buildings and factories for inspections in order to conduct exercises. All those within the scope of the group should strive to arrange everything so that there is no regret.

Blackout

A blackout will also be implemented on this day. Those responsible for directing and controlling the lights must be able to shorten the time from issuing the order to completing the task. It would be even better to record and save the time taken to complete the blackout for future reference.

The inspection of air defense equipment is also very important. It is regrettable that some citizens have been injured while participating in air defense exercises recently. Those who are in charge of guiding the training must inspect all necessary equipment one by one before the exercise is held, so that the participants will not be injured due to oversight. Special attention is requested for this pre-inspection.

### Central Naval Academy Holds Third Graduation Ceremony: Naval Minister Speaks on Behalf of Chairman

The Central Naval Academy held its third officer student graduation ceremony at the academy on Lunghua Road on the 6th. High-ranking officials and guests gathered together for a solemn ceremony. Details are as follows:

High-Ranking Officials and Guests

Attendees included: Rear Admiral Chikazane, Naval Attaché from allied Japan; Rear Admiral Maeda, Chief Naval Advisor; Rear Admiral Mori, Chief Instructor; Major Teshima; Instructor Kida; Minister Saemi; from the Chinese side, in addition to President Jiang of the academy and all faculty members, high-ranking officials and guests present included: Naval Minister Ren Yuan, representing Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek; Director Wu, representing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Zhao Zhengping, Xiong Lian Dong, Huang Jingzhai, Xu Liqiu, Chen Bin He, and over 300 others.

Grand Ceremony

At exactly 10:00 AM, after the ceremony began, President Jiang first reported on the issuing of graduation diplomas and awards from the Chairman. After the awards and certificates from Naval Minister Ren, Army Minister Ye, and the President were given, Naval Minister Ren, representing the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, gave a speech. Chief Advisor Maeda, President Jiang, and Chief Instructor Mori followed with speeches. Subsequently, guest Zhao Zhengping delivered a speech, followed by the reading of congratulatory telegrams from various parties. Finally, Ma Qingpo, a graduate of the academy, delivered a response on behalf of all students. The ceremony concluded with the entire assembly singing the Naval Anthem and the Academy Anthem.

Chairman's Address

China's revival depends on nurturing naval talent. The Central Naval Academy was established with this intention, as the Navy Department's sole school for nurturing naval talent. Students, with your outstanding qualifications, were selected to enter the school. After three years of rigorous training, you hold your graduation ceremony today, dignified and full of spirit, which is truly gratifying. However, the training of naval commanders requires stringent conditions. After graduation, practical training on warships is a necessary process. During the internship, students should draw upon school discussions and personally experience practical work. The most important point remains adhering to military discipline. Military discipline encompasses a wide range of cultivation. If students can practice it diligently, then no matter how important, how trivial, or how difficult the work, they will be able to handle it with ease. In peacetime, you will be able to lead subordinates, and in wartime, you will be able to defeat the enemy. Even in academic research, if you can embody the essence of discipline, you will be diligent in your studies. In short, naval officers must possess profound knowledge and, more importantly, a rigorous spirit. Having undergone training at the academy and practical training on warships to nurture profound knowledge, I further hope that you can understand military discipline to cultivate a rigorous spirit. I, as Chairman, have high expectations of you.

Advisor Maeda's Address

Today, as the Central Naval Academy holds its third student graduation ceremony, it is my honor to participate, and I am truly delighted. Recalling your time as naval students at this academy, it has been three years since you entered. Under the tutelage and education of the President and instructors, you have dedicated yourselves to learning and constantly striving forward. To have achieved the honor of graduating today is truly cause for celebration. The rise and fall of the navy directly affects the strength of a nation. To make a country strong and equal to the world powers, the navy must be strengthened first, and control of the sea must be secured. The nascent Chinese navy has laid the foundation for a unified national navy through the extraordinary efforts of your predecessors and is advancing rapidly. Its further development and ultimate success rests on your shoulders. Now, as we face extraordinary times of war, your paths are numerous and far-reaching, immeasurable. Therefore, your responsibilities can be said to be heavy and great. Therefore, you must apply the military spirit and academic skills cultivated during your studies to practical work, striving diligently to complete your duties. At the same time, you must constantly refine and study, using your personal achievements to contribute to the navy's success, and only then can you become pillars of the nation. Now, as the war situation expands, military personnel, in particular, must not be constrained by their own interests or seek momentary comfort. You must thoroughly understand the situation, be cautious in peacetime, and fight bravely on the battlefield. You must pursue your mission with the ambition to sacrifice the individual for the greater good, fulfilling the duties of a soldier and achieving the great task of defending the nation. As you embark on your journey to the front lines, I wish you all the best and encourage you to constantly strive forward. This is my simple congratulatory message.

President's Remarks

At a time when the flames of the Pacific War are raging, our third class of twenty-five students from the Central Naval Academy, under the banner of the new navy, have completed three years of continuous, intensive training as planned. Today, we hold this graduation ceremony, and we are deeply grateful and honored to have so many high-ranking officials and guests present to give us guidance. As these third-class students prepare to join the ranks of the new navy, we feel joy on the one hand, and on the other hand, we feel that this is a major turning point. Therefore, at this critical juncture, we cannot help but offer a few more words of caution, focusing on what is needed: Learning has no end. The third-class students must redouble their efforts and be more vigilant to avoid the shortcomings caused by complacency. Skill comes from practice. As the saying goes, "Accumulating good deeds creates good fortune; do not neglect small good deeds. Accumulating evil deeds brings disaster; do not commit small evils." "Unripe grains are worse than weeds; imperfect benevolence is worse than recklessness." Only with well-honed skills can you apply them; only with practiced application can you achieve victory. The way to mastery is to exert a hundred times more effort than others or a thousand times more effort than others. "Thinking, thinking, the ghosts and spirits will assist you" is the key to solving all difficult problems. Command ability is built upon obedience experience. Serving as a bridge between superiors and subordinates should be your primary task in the future. The strength of a group lies in organization, coordination, and unity, as well as the strength and vigor of each individual unit. Promote the effectiveness of the academy. Those who take the initiative must have self-control; those who are self-confident must have self-knowledge. The lotus flower grows from the mud, and the beautiful jade is formed through polishing. The more difficult the environment, the more passionate the ambition. As the saying goes, "Stir the heart, temper the nature, and increase what one is capable of." By establishing precedents, they can then serve as examples. Warming up the past with new knowledge can be an instructive teacher. The third-class students who have completed their final lesson and graduation ceremony today are our academy's guarantee for the future of the new navy. Therefore the subsequent classes should not complain about their surroundings but take responsibility for them. Everything that goes wrong should be appreciated, and should be energized to pioneer the new environment and the new world of the emerging career field, with a consistent spirit of aspiration and physical constitution. After training the emerging cadre qualifications, the third-class students should also pay their respects to the supreme leader, pay respects to the Naval Minister and other officials, pay respects to the academy's guidance department and all officers and officials with true career sincerity. At the same time, the country, the nation, and the future of East Asia place boundless expectations on this group of young and bright thirty-five future star officers.

Student Response

Today is the graduation ceremony of the third class of the Central Naval Academy. Naval Minister Ren, representing the Chairman, as well as Chief Advisor Maeda and all the officials and guests, have graced us with their presence and given us guidance. This is the supreme honor for all of us in the third class. We students pay our respects to the guests and vow that we will all work hard together, never giving up due to difficulties or becoming complacent due to minor achievements. We are determined to follow the teachings, muster great courage, make great resolutions, and strive for self-improvement and excellence, in order to contribute everything to the new development of the Navy and the victory of the Greater East Asia War. We are filled with gratitude and await our orders.

### Measures for Fundraising to Subsidize Living Expenses of Elementary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff

The salaries of teachers and staff in municipal elementary and secondary schools in this city are meager and insufficient to sustain their livelihoods. Yesterday, Mayor Chen and Minister Ding Canghui invited representatives from all sectors of society to discuss subsidy measures and decided on several principles. The methods for donating to subsidize the living expenses of teachers and staff in public and private elementary and secondary schools in this city are as follows:

Donation Methods

Measures for Donating to Subsidize Living Expenses of Teachers and Staff in Public and Private Elementary and Secondary Schools in Shanghai:
The various sectors of Shanghai, in order to help teachers and staff in Shanghai's public and private elementary and secondary schools, improve their treatment, and improve their lives, have jointly decided on these measures.
All public and private elementary schools in Shanghai with tuition fees of less than one thousand yuan per semester, and secondary schools with tuition fees of less than one thousand five hundred yuan per semester, may collect donations from students' parents according to these measures.
The aforementioned donations will be collected monthly in four amounts: twenty yuan, thirty yuan, fifty yuan, and one hundred yuan. Students' parents may choose the amount according to their financial situation. Those who can donate more are welcome.
The aforementioned donations will be collected starting in May of the 33rd year, but to save on procedures, donations for three months may be collected at once. The first collection, for the months of May, June, and July, is scheduled for May.
All donations will be submitted by students' parents to the school their children attend. Each school should deposit the funds in a bank (designated by the Municipal Bureau of Education). The funds may not be withdrawn without the approval of the Municipal Bureau of Education.
All donation receipts will be printed by the Municipal Bureau of Education with serialized numbers and affixed with the bureau's seal. The receipts will be distributed to the schools. When collecting donations, the principal and the person collecting the donations should sign and affix their seals.
After each round of donations, each school should post a list of donors within the school and prepare a clear list, along with the receipt stubs, to be submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Education. ○ The donations collected by each school according to these methods should be used to subsidize the living expenses of the school's teachers and staff in principle. However, schools with higher donation revenues may use part of their excess funds to help schools with lower donation revenues. The method of allocating these funds will be separately determined by the Bureau of Education.
The Municipal Bureau of Education should prepare a report on the donations received by each school in each round and the allocation of funds, and make it public.
Students' parents who donate more than the amount stipulated by these methods will have their donations reported by the school principals to the Municipal Bureau of Education for commendation. Those whose monthly donations exceed ten thousand yuan should be reported to the Municipal Government for public praise.
School principals or teachers and staff who perform outstandingly in handling donation matters will be rewarded by the Municipal Bureau of Education.
Parents who are not students of elementary or secondary schools but are concerned about education and frequently provide subsidies to teachers and staff in elementary and secondary schools are encouraged to submit their donations to the major [unclear characters] in this city. The major newspapers should announce these donations promptly and submit them to the Municipal Bureau of Education monthly for unified allocation. The methods for rewarding and praising these donors will be implemented in accordance with the provisions of item ten.
The major newspapers in this city should collect donations for the living expenses of teachers and staff in elementary and secondary schools on behalf of the public, announce them promptly, and submit them to the Municipal Bureau of Education monthly for unified allocation.
Teachers and staff in elementary and secondary schools in this city may, with the approval of the Municipal Bureau of Education and the Bureau of Social Welfare, jointly organize a welfare association to improve their living conditions through their own efforts and promote continued support from all sectors of society.

Our Newspaper's Collection

Based on our compassionate heart, this newspaper is willing to do its utmost to appeal to all sectors of society, with a goal of one million yuan. The reports of collections will be published once every other day and will conclude within two weeks. In addition to the 50,000 yuan donated by this newspaper, yesterday we also received a generous donation of 50,000 yuan from Mr. Luo Hongyi, and 20,000 yuan each from Mr. Ding Boxiong, Zheng Fangxi, Xu Changchun, and Zhang Ruitang, and 10,000 yuan each from Mr. Gu Nanqun, Chen Riping, Xiang Kangyuan, and Chen Bin Chi.

Brief Commentary

### A Plea for Elementary and Secondary School Teachers

In the editorial on the fourth day of this month, our newspaper discussed "Improving the Treatment of Elementary and Secondary School Teachers." We believe that education is a fundamental plan for cultivating talents for a hundred years, and teachers are the driving force for advancing education. Whether teachers' treatment is appropriate is directly proportional to the quality of educational effectiveness. Therefore, we advocate for a thorough improvement of teachers' lives, striving to ensure a minimum level of stability. In particular, the number of elementary and secondary school teachers is more widespread, and the government should find ways to provide subsidies. On the afternoon of the fifth, Mayor Chen and Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare held a tea party to invite representatives from all sectors of society to discuss this matter and decided on several measures.

Our newspaper is making every effort to support this matter and intends to raise donations from all sectors of society. It is assumed that one hundred groups are targeted, with each person taking on one or more groups, and each group donating 2,000 yuan per month. Those who pay in full for six months at once will be accepted. After six months, the Municipal Government will have a solution for education funding. During this transition period, we sincerely hope that warm-hearted people will jointly support us. Yesterday, Mr. Luo Hongyi and others took the lead in advocating for donations, and in one day, over 220,000 yuan was raised. Their enthusiasm is truly commendable.

Recently, our newspaper has been making every effort to promote social welfare undertakings, hoping to follow in the footsteps of people from all sectors of society and promote them together. However, anything related to public welfare must involve donations. Donors may not mind, but those soliciting donations feel uneasy. Considering the social situation, there are too many gaps that need to be gradually filled. Therefore, we do not hesitate to be tedious, disregard public praise, and do what we believe is right. However, our role is to emphasize promotion, and after receiving social donations, how to make good use of them and live up to social expectations is a matter that we hope those involved in various public welfare undertakings will take seriously. At the same time, we will also fulfill our responsibility to supervise from the sidelines. Briefly touching on what we feel, we also discuss it here.

### Shanghai Medical Association Establishes Medical Research Association for Consultation by Judicial Authorities

The Shanghai Medical Association, in order to protect the rights and interests of its members and promote medical affairs, has established a Medical Affairs Research Association, which will be jointly led by famous doctors in this city. Yesterday, it specifically submitted a report to the various levels of courts in this city and the two procuratorates of each region, stating that if there are any cases involving medical disputes in the future, the association can be consulted at any time for legal reference.

### Thoughts on Attending the Tea Party

— Yang Jinzhao

Mayor Chen and Minister Ding held a tea party to discuss raising the salaries of elementary and secondary school teachers and staff. As the principal of a municipal elementary school, I attended the tea party and had many thoughts after listening to everyone's insightful remarks.

First, the treatment of teachers in municipal schools is worse than that in private schools. This is an undeniable fact. Before the salary increase, the following three phenomena occurred: Excellent teachers abandoned their profession and changed careers. Those who remained were not content with their positions. Those who are known to slack off are also in the teaching profession as samples of the [unclear] transition era. As soon as there is another job, they abandon it. The hiring of senior class teachers is more difficult than ascending to heaven. Now it is not about poor teachers, low student levels, etc., but what to do when good teachers leave? The crisis in the education sector has long been lurking due to low salaries, and it is even worse now. At present, the principle of subsidizing the living expenses of teachers and staff from May to the summer vacation has finally been determined. But we must not forget that in addition to teachers and staff, there are also school workers, who are also laborers in the education sector. The monthly salary of municipal school workers is only 426 yuan, which is far from enough to make them feel full and satisfied.

Secondly, the principals of municipal schools jointly requested that the municipal government increase the salaries of employees to 4,500 yuan per month per person. The municipal treasury is struggling, and this is just wishful thinking. It remains to be seen whether the municipal finance can be adjusted in the second half of the year and education funding can be reasonably increased. Assuming that salaries are increased by 2,000 yuan per month, parents should empathize with the plight of teachers and make monthly donations this semester. Taking our school as an example, there are a total of twelve grades, twenty teachers, and five school workers. Because the school is located in Shanghai Fourth District, most of the students' families are poor. More than 600 students donating 30 yuan per month each would raise about 20,000 yuan, which is still 30,000 yuan short. There are others whose economic situation is worse than ours. According to Director Lin's report at the tea party, there are 1,500 municipal school teachers, so 3 million yuan would be needed, but at least 1.5 million yuan would be missing. Including private schools, the shortfall will exceed 5 million yuan by the end of July. It is impossible to solve the problem without the warm-hearted assistance of students' parents and all sectors of society.

Secretary-General Wu said: "To do things well, you need a combination of system, personnel, and funding," and the focus of these three is still funding. For example, education funding: Before the war, public schools in Shanghai had better treatment than those in the interior. In recent years, the education sector, especially municipal schools, has been declining. Lack of funding and poor treatment are the main reasons. A year or two ago, a banquet donation expanded the collection of special consumption taxes. Before the special consumption tax, how the collected donations were spent is something we hope the financial authorities will announce. If it has not been diverted, we expect it to be used for the temporary improvement of elementary and secondary schools this time.

I myself admit that there are indeed many people in the education sector who are determined to work hard with the spirit of "If I don't go to hell, who will?" However, many comrades have been devastated by life and have become depressed. They are in a semi-idle state, leaving a bad influence. However, that is wrong! After attending this tea party, I felt the keen expectations of society for us. Everyone has great sympathy for the painful lives of the educators. The establishment of scholarship funds by various newspapers has had a particularly significant impact on our morale. As someone in charge of school administration, representing a unit, I express my gratitude to all concerned parties and am willing to dedicate myself to the education cause. Educators, rise up and move forward, and make efforts in your own positions! I wish a bright future for Shanghai education!

### Suggestions for Promoting Scientific Research

—

Chuan Qizhao

The greatest tragedy of our nation's politics is excessive wastefulness. The administrative structure is vast and cumbersome, with too many superfluous branches, leading to a lack of unified goals and steps. The result is fragmented governance and no tangible achievements. Moreover, everything is done perfunctorily without seeking thoroughness. If we want to promote scientific research, the government must have clear goals, comprehensive plans, rigorous standards, and unwavering commitment. It must spare no expense to promote scientific progress. In my humble opinion, the most effective and rapid ways to achieve this are as follows:

Improving the Education System: The deficiencies of our country's education system are well-known. We must urgently improve our education system, emulating countries like Japan and Germany, and establish comprehensive higher technical and industrial schools. This will enable students with lower aptitude to acquire specialized skills and serve the country, while those with higher aptitude can advance to universities for more in-depth research. This system can cultivate technical personnel and leaders in the scientific community, and actively develop industry. The state must also provide graduates of higher education institutions with convenient career paths, such as in agriculture and ceramics, so that people are not deterred from pursuing them.

Strictly Regulating University Curricula: The responsibilities of a Chinese university student are actually greater than those of a British Member of Parliament. Therefore, university students must undergo the most rigorous training. Establish practical industrial universities, like MIT in the United States. Within universities, strive to ensure the stability of professors' lives, so they can concentrate on research, and urgently eliminate those who are merely filling positions. Provide students with ample facilities for research. Each national university should specialize in specific courses to attract students, allowing them to choose and avoid wasting time.

Expanding School Experimentation: Experimentation is the mother of science. A most pitiful phenomenon in today's Chinese universities is the lack of experimentation. Natural sciences without experimentation are equivalent to not studying at all. Although there is a shortage of materials, and chemical reagents are often used for military purposes, the government must maintain experimental work in all schools, no matter what. Universities in Shanghai are all mired in the tragic state of suspended experimentation, and the government should make every effort to provide relief.

Promoting Public Interest in Science: Establish more public lectures and open experiments to generate public interest in science and encourage practical applications.

Establish National Research Institutes: Such as the Academia Sinica, to amass books, publish journals, collect materials, establish standardized measurements, and recruit advanced researchers. At the same time, provide various economic and academic assistance to private research with achievements. Establish national annual awards to encourage researchers' discoveries, and reward powerful social organizations and industrial and commercial organizations for establishing small-scale laboratories to support the research work of their employees.

National Construction Projects: Instruct researchers to focus on research or hire foreign consultants, but do not allow foreigners to operate projects on their behalf.

Strictly Inspect the Products of Chemical Factories, Pharmaceutical Factories, and Instrument Factories: Ensure that they meet standards, and prevent the public from losing faith in domestic goods.

Sending Experts to Study Abroad: Must have specific objectives, and be able to make contributions after returning to the country, otherwise it is a waste of resources.

Formulate Plans: Like the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, a certain number of factories and research institutes must be established within a specified period, such as sulfuric acid plants, pigment factories, and gold ingot research institutes.

Pay Handsomely to Hire Foreigners as Instructors: For the most basic machinery, such as steam engines for trains and internal combustion engines for automobiles, we must strive to manufacture them ourselves.

The government must put forward the central ideology of "talent supremacy, production supremacy." Under this ideology, students, researchers, and professors should move forward courageously. While the progress of foreign countries should be introduced, the progress of our own country should be even more publicized to give people full confidence.

Make every effort to protect new industries that are scientific and industrialized, and gradually improve old-fashioned handicrafts to make them scientific.

### Navy Iwata Toyoo Zen Hong

— Ocean Translation

To go to Tokyo, I deliberately took a detour on the Nippon Main Line train to avoid, in any case, sitting on the same train as Masato, who was returning to school. Takao took a boat from Beppu to Osaka, and then boarded a train marked "To Tokyo" for the first time.

When he arrived at Tokyo Station, he had a little more than three hundred yuan left in his pocket. He stayed at a hotel in the Hongo district, advertised in the travel guide with one-and-a-half yuan per night in the largest font. The next day, he ran to an art school in the Ueno area to request admission, but was turned away because it was not the enrollment period and because he had not graduated from middle school.

(Damn it!)

Takao thought that not entering a national art school was not a big deal. He believed that Tokyo was big. There must be countless private schools on par with national art schools. As a result, he found the attractive name of "Tokyo Fine Arts Graduate School" in the newspaper advertisement column.

Tokyo Fine Arts Graduate School was located in a remote alley, Teramachi Street, in the Yanaka district. It was a school with neither a school gate nor a school building. Of course, it was not completely devoid of everything like the Shoka Sonjuku, so it should not be underestimated. It was a two-story rectangular building, and there was the sound of a baby crying behind the lattice door, which was a truly unique school.

"Excuse me, may I come in?"

Takao tried to speak standard Mandarin.

First, a lady holding a baby came out, and then a master with a beard and wearing a wide coat came out.

"We don't teach directly."

He looked at Takao carefully and said, "Then why is it in the advertisement..."

"Although it is in the advertisement, classes will only start when there are enough students. At the same time, people who receive special direct teaching, according to our regulations, must first read the lectures and acquire basic knowledge..."

It turned out that Tokyo Fine Arts Graduate School was a place that published picture lectures. In the end, Takao had no choice but to buy a year's worth of lectures, tied them with thick rope, and took them back to the hotel in Hongo. Buying lectures, of course, cost him more than twenty yuan, just like everyone else. However, when he looked at the content of the lectures, it turned out that it was all gibberish arranged in type, which was actually to be expected.

However, Takao was not discouraged by this.

(Damn it!)

The next day, he strolled around again to find a new art school. Tokyo's famous scenic spots, movies, tea houses, etc., did not attract his attention. He was single-mindedly thinking about becoming a painter. Deep in his heart, he could not settle down unless he started learning to become a painter as soon as possible.

A few days later, he gradually realized the true face of Tokyo, such a vast and mysterious metropolis.

### Using Nature to Restore Children's Health: Reading and Resting

The problem of child rearing in our country is not given enough attention. Most families do not understand the personality and physical condition of their children in detail. Furthermore, due to the differences in environment and habits, school education is unable to provide differentiated facilities. As a result, the physical and mental health of children is greatly affected. If there are weak lungs, tuberculosis, adenoiditis (pulmonary hilar lymphadenitis or cervical lymphadenitis), bone tuberculosis, anemia, rickets, paralysis, and nervous abnormalities, and if the treatment is not proper, it is very dangerous! If the physical and mental conditions are not considered, and they still enter ordinary primary and secondary schools, then irregular living and heavy schoolwork will lead to aggravation of the disease and damage their lives. If they drop out of school and go to an ordinary hospital for treatment, they will be confined to bed for a long time, wasting their time and missing the opportunity to learn. In all developed countries in the world, there are facilities for open-air schools and forest schools, so that weak children can receive special education in a natural environment. They can cultivate their bodies, increase their knowledge, and take care of both rest and learning. This is a good method to learn from. Therefore, if we can imitate the methods of open-air schools and forest schools in places with elegant scenery, lush trees, fresh air, and plenty of sunshine, and have medical facilities, so that they can rest and study at the same time, and take extra care, it is hoped that weak children can turn from weak to strong, and from ignorant to wise, and gradually restore their physical and mental health through the cultivation of nature. Today, if we have a healthy child, we will have a healthy adult in the future, which is not only about the welfare of a small number of children, but also about the welfare of the entire nation. I hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will come together to support it. (Yang Wenguo)

### Gathering of Elders Initiates Retirement Home

On the afternoon of the fifth of this month, the elders of the Qiying Association gathered at the Foguang Nursing Home on Lantian Road and initiated the organization of a retirement home in a secluded place with beautiful scenery as a place for rest. The public opinion was the same. Preparations are now underway.

### Stolen Sewing Machines: School Unable to Continue Opening

The original purpose of establishing our school was to cultivate women who love to learn sewing and to provide them with practical opportunities. Unexpectedly, after only two terms, the three sewing machine heads that were placed were stolen in the middle of last month, so that we could not continue to enroll students this year, which is a pity. Although we have been investigating in all directions, there is no clue, and we are extremely anxious. I thought that this was just a rumour, probably because we are investigating, so it has not been sold yet. Now I will let you know that I am not willing to accept it, and I will move it to the scholarship fund to benefit the people. Sincerely, Weijia Stocking Sewing School, No. 638, Alley 4, Changle Road.
