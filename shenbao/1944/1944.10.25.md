### The Essence of Control

The purpose of wartime control is to manage resources and strive for the early attainment of victory in war. The method of control is, on the one hand, to conserve materials and eliminate even the slightest waste, and on the other hand, to increase production to replenish the necessary consumption of war. For the soldiers fighting on the battlefield, it is necessary to continuously supply the necessary materials so that they can strive for war without being affected by material problems. For the citizens who are not on the battlefield and do not directly participate in the war, it is necessary to stabilize their basic living conditions so that they can exert their maximum production power, and then be able to continuously increase production and continuously supply the needs of the entire front and rear. Therefore, the most ideal effect of wartime control is that the soldiers at the front and the people at the rear can live the simplest life, cooperate and divide labor, the front kills the enemy and achieves results, the rear strives to increase production, and the entire nation is like a machine, and the strength of the people is uniform and concentrated. Germany and Japan have been the most successful in wartime control. After suffering a great loss from the economic blockade during the last World War, Germany was even more meticulous this time. Since 1939, almost all the people in the country have had food to eat and work to do. The government wants to ensure that everyone has food to eat and must work. The government will never allow those who can work to reduce their ability to work due to living difficulties, and will never allow factories that can produce to reduce their production due to problems such as power and raw materials. For those who work, the necessities of life are allocated to them, and for the factories that work, the power and raw materials are allocated to them. Therefore, the products produced from the factories are also managed by the state. Under detailed planning, military and daily necessities are supplied to the front and rear respectively. In this cycle, the soldiers have food to eat and military weapons to fight, the people have food to eat and work to do, there are no idle people in the country, and no barren land, and they can be sure of winning any long-term war. Such a control system requires the government to have long-term preparations before the war. As for China, it is pitiful to say that there was no preparation before the war, and no adjustment after the war. The current control system has not been able to achieve the ideal goal, and it is even more likely to cause a bad impression on many people. Take Shanghai as an example, there are so many people, but it has not been possible to ensure that everyone has a job. And for those who have a job, if they rely entirely on rations and do not think of ways to get things from the black market, survival is impossible. There are so many factories in Shanghai, but it has not been possible for every factory to start work. And for factories that can start work, although their products can be sold freely, if they are sold entirely according to the price limit, it will definitely not be enough to cover the cost of power, raw materials, labor, etc. Everything is just a contradiction and just an opportunity for bad people to take advantage of. The entire control method urgently needs to be adjusted immediately, otherwise the future is unimaginable. This is not杞人憂天, but a factual and inevitable result.

### ### Japanese Air Force Fiercely Bombs Enemy Fleet in Leyte Gulf

### New Japanese Warplanes Appear on the Front Lines in a Steady Stream

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Japanese fleet braved adverse weather on the 19th to launch a strong attack on Leyte Gulf, sinking two enemy battleships and one destroyer. During the attack on the 20th, the Japanese army used a joint fleet of fighters and bombers to brave the adverse weather and fiercely bombed the enemy aircraft carrier group near Suluan Island at around 8:00 a.m., destroying two enemy aircraft carriers. At around 4:00 p.m., they again sank a large enemy transport ship and destroyed another transport ship in Leyte Gulf.

A Certain Base in the South Pacific, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Japanese rear production line is now actively manufacturing aircraft day and night. The sound of this fierce air battle will have a great impact on the next line. Now, the newest warplanes are being sent to the front lines one after another. All the Japanese frontline soldiers and officers are overjoyed. The achievements of the production line cannot be erased when they are continuously striking the British and Americans. The new Japanese warplanes currently available are the essence of the Japanese scientific community and have the speed and performance of the American B-29 Superfortress. The new Japanese warplane formations are rushing into the high sky in a majestic manner. They have the power to destroy the enemy and achieve great results in every engagement with the enemy. Therefore, the officers and soldiers at the forefront of the Japanese army are unanimously expressing their gratitude to the industrial soldiers who produce these new warplanes.

### ### Japanese Military Expert

### Discusses the Battle Situation in the Philippines

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Japanese military expert Mr. Ito Seito discussed the American attack on the Philippines and stated that the great naval battle in Taiwan can be compared to the attack on Pearl Harbor, and its content is also similar. In 1941, when the American army fought and served as the main attacking force, the Japanese army wiped out more than 50% of it in one fell swoop. In 1944, when the American army used aircraft carriers as the main attacking force, Japan destroyed its central force in one fell swoop on the sea off Taiwan, inflicting heavy damage on its main force. Although this is the same as the Pearl Harbor attack in terms of value, it is different in terms of conditions because it is different in offense and defense. From the perspective of the overall strategic situation, the United States is in a defensive position in terms of tactics. Therefore, the counterattack that began after Pearl Harbor required a long period of preparation. However, recently, for the entire tactical offensive system, although it suffered a major defeat in the air and sea battle in Taiwan, it still attacked the Philippines within a certain period of time. The enemy's continuous offensive is what Japan has been seeking. The battle situation has already reached a major stage. When the foundation for victory is consolidated, another great victory is achieved, which is truly gratifying. What the enemy Americans are thinking about is also the future operations. After another setback in the sea off Taiwan, the overall battle situation has already shown signs of defeat.

### ### Sea Area off the Nicobar Islands

### Japanese Air Force Battle Results

### Remarks by a Staff Officer of a Certain Unit

A Certain Japanese Base on the Front Lines, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Japanese air force launched a preemptive offensive against the enemy British mobile force in the sea area off the Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean, sinking and destroying a total of four ships. The Japanese Headquarters announced this battle result on the 20th. Later, the detailed process of the operation was clarified, and it was announced in the form of a staff officer's remarks from a certain unit on the 23rd as follows: After the American mobile force invaded Leyte Gulf, the British mobile force approached the Japanese Nicobar Islands the closest on the 17th at Kani Nicobar Island. However, a certain Japanese air force unit boldly dispatched on the 19th and achieved a great victory by destroying one enemy aircraft carrier and one destroyer. The battle situation was very fierce. The Japanese unit was tasked with destroying this enemy force. On the 19th, a fighter squadron advanced to the vicinity of Kani Nicobar Island. Before the start of the operation, the deployment status of the enemy mobile force was roughly as follows: ○ A group of one cruiser and two destroyers was advancing westward in the sea area 15 miles southeast of Kani Nicobar Island. ○ One battleship or cruiser was stationed 20 kilometers south of Kani Nicobar Island, shelling Kani Nicobar Island. ○ One strike force of one battleship and six destroyers was advancing in its western and eastern directions. ○ One strike force of one Indian Midaburu-class aircraft carrier, one battleship, and three cruisers or destroyers was advancing southward from the sea area 20 kilometers southwest of Kani Nicobar Island. The Japanese aircraft flew to the enemy airspace southeast of Kani Nicobar at around 12:00 on that day. After discovering the enemy forces in the clouds, they immediately attacked them. At that time, about 20 enemy fighters suddenly attacked from the front. Although the Japanese air force had various unfavorable conditions in terms of altitude and maneuverability, they bravely engaged the enemy in combat. After about half an hour of fierce fighting, they shot down four enemy aircraft, and another seven were unconfirmed, for a total of 11 aircraft shot down. It was also confirmed that one enemy cruiser or destroyer caught fire and sank. At that time, the Japanese Abe squadron had flown to the uppermost airspace. Although the squadron leader's aircraft was unable to confirm it, according to what was determined on the ground from Kani Nicobar Island, the Japanese aircraft discovered the enemy aircraft at around 12:20 on that day and immediately launched an aerial battle. They then disengaged from the enemy aircraft's attack and descended to a low altitude. Three aircraft approached the enemy mobile force with all their might. It initially appeared to be Lieutenant Abe's aircraft, which used a warplane to dive and descend directly towards the enemy Indian Midaru-class enemy aircraft carrier. The fuselage was carrying torpedoes and bravely collided with the enemy aircraft carrier. In an instant, it was surrounded by black smoke. When the black smoke dissipated, the silhouette of the 27,000-ton enemy aircraft carrier disappeared from the sea. The second aircraft of the Abe squadron similarly collided with an enemy destroyer, sinking it. The third aircraft continued to advance from the southeast and crashed into the enemy with a fierce impact, causing it to be heavily damaged. Thus, this fighter established the great feat of sinking an enemy aircraft carrier. As such, the Japanese army only used one fighter of several tons to sink an enemy aircraft carrier, which was something they never dreamed of.

### ### Japanese Front Lines in Guangxi Province

### Heard Bombing Sounds in Lingchuan

Guangxi Front Lines, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The elite Japanese troops on the Guangxi front have been attacking blindly in the rain for days. In the past week, bombing sounds from the direction of Lingchuan and the north of Guilin could be heard from the first line, and smoke screens were seen rising. It is known that the Chongqing army seems to have decided to abandon Lingchuan, so they are destroying the military facilities and important institutions inside and outside the city.

### ### Japanese Army Ministry Announces Commendations for Two Air Squadrons

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Japanese Army Ministry announced on the 23rd that the Army Commander had recently awarded commendations to the Sabang Air Dispatch Unit and the Shimada Air Unit, respectively, as follows:

1. Sabang Air Dispatch Unit Commendation: Under the command of Army Captain Yoshiichi Hiasa, the right dispatch unit was responsible for patrolling the Indian Ocean. On July 25th of this year, when an enemy mobile force attacked near Sabang, the squadron leader's aircraft was engaged in patrolling and did not miss the opportunity to report its situation, ensuring the complete preparedness of the Japanese army and navy units in that area. At the same time, while continuing to patrol and discovering an enemy submarine at sea, they used a heroic and courageous spirit to carry out fierce anti-aircraft gun fire, spewing out explosive flames, and finally sinking it, completing the heroic death of the entire team. In addition, Lieutenant Ono's aircraft did not allow other enemy submarines at sea any leeway to submerge, ensuring that all the bombs dropped hit their target and sank them. In addition, the ground maintenance personnel quickly repaired the aircraft and airports that were damaged by bombs under enemy air raids and shelling, enabling the aerial combat power to be fully exerted. The above actions were the result of the dispatch unit members, with the squadron leader as the center, upholding the great spirit of unity between air and land, and fully exerting the spirit of aerial combat power without regret. Their military achievements are outstanding, and this commendation is hereby awarded.

2. Shimada Air Unit Commendation: Under the leadership of Army Captain Saburo Shimada, the Shimada Air Unit engaged in maritime protection operations in northern Australia from 1943 to early August 1944, repeatedly achieving outstanding results and inflicting heavy damage on enemy submarines that threatened Japanese transport convoys. According to the records, the unit engaged in maritime operations in northern Australia a total of 8,008 times. Over 300 Japanese transport ships were protected by it. It also frequently gave full play to its reconnaissance capabilities, ambushing enemy ships and achieving the results of sinking seven enemy ships and destroying three. It completed the task of protecting the convoys, and its contribution to the preparations for operations in the northern Australian area was extremely profound and significant. In particular, Unit Leader Shimada was able to use his outstanding skills to personally lead the troops at the front lines and command the operations, personally sinking two enemy submarines. On July 28, 1944, he encountered twelve enemy F38 aircraft over Amahai Bay. The squadron leader's aircraft engaged them for 30 minutes before heroically sacrificing himself. However, the morale of the unit became even more vigorous, and on April 8 of the same year, they achieved the result of sinking another enemy submarine. This can truly be said to be due to the enlightened leadership of the unit leader, who was able to create a strong unity and a growing spirit with the unit leader as the center. Therefore, his military achievements are truly worthy of immortality, and this commendation is hereby awarded. August 22, 1945, Japanese Army Commander.

3. Army soldiers Kojima Fumio and Aso Bishu have repeatedly engaged in operations to protect important transportation routes in the waters of northern Australia, where enemy submarines have been rampaging fiercely, and have sunk many enemy submarines since November 1943. When the enemy forces began landing on Halmahera and Morotai Islands on September 15, 1944, the two soldiers dedicated themselves to air combat as squadron leader's staff aircraft on the 16th and discovered an enemy cruiser heading north near the waters off Morotai. They immediately launched an attack, and the first bomb hit the stern of the warship. At the same time, they themselves were also injured. They then crashed into the vital part of the enemy warship, causing it to explode and burn, and then sacrificed themselves heroically. This was entirely due to their lofty ideal of serving the country loyally, which enabled them to demonstrate their great spirit of sacrifice. This commendation is hereby awarded to commend them.

### ### Main Soviet Forces Encircled

### Soviet Troops Push Along the Danube River in Hungary

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Huitong News Agency: The fighting on the East Prussian border is currently taking place from Tilsit to Augustów. The German army's line of defense in Tilsit has crossed the Memel River and moved south. Soviet troops only managed to break into the German base on the Kaunas-Gumbinnen highway and expand their gains westward towards Goldap. After the German army moved west from Schirwindt, fierce fighting took place between Schirwindt and Goldap. After fierce street fighting, the city of Goldap was lost.

Berlin, 244th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Huitong News Agency: South of Gumbinnen, German tank units have encircled the main Soviet tank force and at least three infantry divisions, and are in the process of annihilating them.

At 1:00 p.m., the regular broadcast suddenly stopped, and Regent Horthy's proclamation was read out, stating that the Hungarian government, in view of the Soviet attack, had sought to replenish a million troops from the German army in order to defend the country, but the German army had not implemented it. Therefore, the government had decided to enter into peace negotiations with the enemy. At this point, the entire country of Hungary fell into chaos. Later, a group of people who opposed peace shouted the name of Ferenc Szálasi, the Arrow Cross leader, and the sound of resistance filled the streets and alleys. At that time, the peace faction occupied the royal palace, and the Arrow Cross leader began to exert his power, armed suppression, and regarded the regent and the peace faction as national enemies and arrested them. A few hours after the Regent's proclamation was broadcast, at the 8:00 p.m. special broadcast, the Arrow Cross leader Szálasi's broadcast announced to the people that the battle for Hungary's honor was still beginning, order was restored, and the people's hearts were stabilized. The new Prime Minister Szálasi is the most fierce opponent of the United States and leads the people to unite with Germany to eliminate the bad situation left over from the past in Hungary and move towards the construction of a new order.

### Special Report on a Visit to Eastern Hebei

I. The Strategic Significance of the Eastern Hebei Special District

Speaking of Eastern Hebei, it shouldn't be an unfamiliar term! Before the Incident, a so-called "Anti-Communist Autonomous Government" was established there, encompassing twenty-one counties and known as the "Switzerland of the East" at the time. Following the Tongzhou Incident, the "government" dissolved, and after the establishment of the Provisional Government, the Dao Yin system of the past "Beijing Government" era was restored. Now, the newly established Eastern Hebei Special District in North China is largely the former Eastern Hebei Dao, but its scope is smaller than the previous Anti-Communist Government, as the Special District only includes ten counties and one city of the Eastern Hebei Dao, with Tangshan as its capital.

Tangshan is also a familiar city, not only because Tangshan Jiaotong University was once located there, but also because it is the center of the Kailuan Coal Mine. The Kailuan Mining Bureau is still there, and its employees are the envy of ordinary North China civil servants. This is because, for the lowest-ranking employees of the Kailuan Mining Bureau, the salary is 3,000 yuan, and they receive a bag of flour and one ton of coal per month. As for middle-level employees, the salary reaches 5,000 to 7,000 or 8,000 yuan, and they receive two to three bags of flour and about three tons of coal per month. The benefits for senior officials are, of course, even better, and their treatment can be described as the envy of all in North China. Therefore, in North China, no matter what military-managed enterprise or Sino-Japanese joint venture, their employees cannot compare with those of Kailuan! Because of the Kailuan Coal Mine, Tangshan can attract a large number of workers, so the market is very prosperous, and recently many roads have been renovated, with the bustling roads mostly paved with cement.

That Eastern Hebei has such a capital is of course very significant. Especially in the era of increasing production to win the war, Eastern Hebei, as the most affluent area in North China, enjoys the reputation of being a "granary" and includes this coal mining center, so its strategic mission will naturally increase. However, as the Communists eyed North China, Eastern Hebei was regarded as an important area for activity. Therefore, the North China Political Affairs Commission, in order to prevent problems before they arise, resolutely abolished the Dao system and established the Special District this summer (July). The so-called Special District differs from the former Dao in two characteristics: it is directly under the North China Political Affairs Commission, and it combines the total power of the military, government, and people to establish a new system for good governance. Today, Major General Jiang Fengfei, the first Administrative Director of the Eastern Hebei Special District, concurrently serves as the Director of the Tangshan Camp of the General Headquarters of the North China Pacification Army, so under this new system of military-political integration, its political future can naturally be expected to become brighter.

II. A Glimpse of Tangshan in Six Hours

Before the reporter came, I had intended to go to Tangshan to inspect this experiment of the new governance in North China, so I asked my old friend Chen Banhou (the current Secretary-General of the Pacification Commissioner's Office) to introduce me to the authorities in Eastern Hebei. The only characteristic of the new politics implemented in Eastern Hebei is the unification of the military and the government, and the authorities responsible for implementing the administration are mostly former members of the Pacification Commissioner's Office or the Pacification Army. Therefore, I was able to get all the assistance I needed there without any difficulty.

From Tianjin to Tangshan, it only takes three hours by express train, and even by slow train, it only takes four hours. It is still a light journey, especially as passengers can see the Toyota near Tanggu along the way, and three hours seems too short. Traveling in North China is indeed much easier than in the South. If you take a first-class or second-class ticket, I can guarantee that the comfort is the same as before the war. Here, there are none of the difficulties encountered in the South, such as buying tickets on the black market, crowding to get tickets, or even various undue demands. However, what impressed me most strongly during the journey was that most male passengers wore brown national uniforms or other uniforms, and most female passengers wore short clothes. This is because the railway authorities here stipulate that both men and women must wear air-raid clothing during the journey. The so-called air-raid clothing is that everything short can be applied, except for the prescribed style. Therefore, in the train, women wearing cheongsams can be said to be extremely rare.

The streets of Tangshan have been very tidy recently. After the reporter arrived at the station at noon, I hired a rickshaw to tour the city for a week. The most bustling areas are Guangdong Street, Pianyi Street, and the New Market area. The reporter drank alone in the Xiaotaoyuan Restaurant in the New Market. Prices in Tangshan are generally cheaper than in Tianjin. The reporter ordered half a catty of white liquor, a cold dish (white chicken and preserved egg), a plate of fried liver, and twenty dumplings in Xiaotaoyuan, spending only forty-eight yuan. Because of the low prices, according to the waiter, most of the materials here flow to Tianjin. On the day the reporter went to Tangshan, all sectors were busy preparing for the Mid-Autumn Festival. The Special District Administrative Office was holding a Mid-Autumn Festival farmers' celebration, and special efforts were being made to suppress prices. Now I will briefly report some simple prices. For food, rice is twelve yuan per catty, and flour is seven yuan and five jiao per catty. For meat, mixed crabs are nine yuan per catty, large prawns are twenty-six yuan per catty, carp is twenty yuan per catty, live chickens are twenty-seven yuan each, goose eggs are one yuan and three jiao each, tomatoes are three yuan and two jiao per catty, eggplants are one yuan and six jiao per catty, potatoes are two yuan and two jiao per catty, pork is twenty-one yuan per catty, beef and mutton are twenty-two yuan per catty, Guangdong mooncakes are sixty yuan per catty, and for wine, a large bottle of Shaoyang wine here sells for twenty yuan, and a small bottle sells for ten yuan.

### Chongqing Army's Counterattack on Longling Fails

Central News Agency Dispatch from the Nujiang Front Line, 24th: After the Chongqing army, at great sacrifice, finally recaptured Lameng and captured two major fortresses of Jingyue, it poured in the main force of the 9th Division of the Nanda Expeditionary Force and launched a fierce attack on the strategic stronghold of Longling. Upon the Japanese army's counterattack, it collapsed. It is currently engaged in reinforcing its strength and weapons. The Japanese army in Longling received reinforcements of fresh troops on August 27th, broke through the encirclement of the Chongqing army, and counterattacked with other friendly forces. The Chongqing army built Lameng, and the Chongqing army from Yueyue southward concentrated in the northern area of Longling. Due to excessive consumption and no counterattack, the second and third lines of defense were built.

### Official Gazette Extra Publishes Japanese Prime Minister's Instructions to Government Officials to Set an Example for the People

Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 24th: Japanese Prime Minister Koiso, in response to the brave battles of the soldiers on the front lines, especially requested that government officials set an example for the national people and take the lead in rising up. He published the Cabinet's instructions in the official gazette extra on the 23rd. The main points are as follows: I. Official duties have a great influence on the victory or defeat of the war, so officials should serve with sincerity and set an example in their actions and behavior, thereby inspiring the general public's belief in victory. Without a fair and upright heart, even playing with beautiful words is difficult to move the heart. Therefore, officials should clearly show the fundamental spirit of taking the lead in setting an example, especially primary officials and local officials who are close to the people should pay special attention to the points. II. Laws and regulations are dead documents, and the skill of their operation lies in the heart. If national urgent matters are to be implemented, etc., it is also possible not to adhere to trivial matters. In order to implement wartime service, efforts should be made to simplify affairs. III. The promotion of social morality is the beautiful tradition of Japan. The decline of social morality in wartime is a common practice in all belligerent countries. Therefore, officials who are public servants of the country should do their utmost to prevent the deterioration of trends. At the same time, they should be open-minded, insightful, and perceive the subtle mechanisms of human feelings, so that officials and people can cooperate and move together towards the path of victory.

### Self-Defense Corps Members Will Assist in Traffic Safety Campaign

Forming Service Teams to Take on Guidance Tasks by District

The Municipal Police Bureau, in order to maintain traffic safety first, has set this month on the 26th to implement a Traffic Safety Campaign Week, vigorously publicizing traffic rules, so that citizens comply. At the same time, in order to assist in promoting traffic safety, each district's Self-Defense Corps has formed a (Traffic Safety) Service Team, with four people in each team, dispatched to the territory of each branch bureau in the city, designated locations, and assigned the task of traffic safety guidance. The main points of its organization and tasks are as follows: I. The (Traffic Safety) Service Team consists of four members of the Self-Defense Corps per team. Each person should stand on the left side of each intersection to guide pedestrians and vehicles to comply with (traffic safety) rules. II. When various vehicles arrive at an intersection and encounter traffic police blocking traffic, these vehicles should stop outside the parking line and must not cross into the (pedestrian crossing street line). In addition, fast and slow vehicles should stop in order when blocked at an intersection and must not overtake at will. If there are no parking lines or other signs at the intersection, the pedestrian crosswalk line shall prevail. III. The main task of the (Traffic Safety) Service Team is to assist in guiding people to comply with (traffic safety) rules, so they must be amiable and sincere in dealing with the people, and avoid unnecessary disputes in particular. IV. The duties of directing or managing traffic at each intersection are still the responsibility of the traffic police of the respective branch bureau in charge. Members of the (Traffic Safety) Service Team do not need to participate. V. When performing their tasks, members of the (Traffic Safety) Service Team should wear a white armband with red characters (Safety First) and a number issued by the Shanghai Special Municipal Police Bureau on their left arm to identify them. The armband should be distributed and kept by the captains of each brigade. VI. When performing their tasks, if members of the (Traffic Safety) Service Team encounter cases of traffic violations or accidents, they should hand them over to the nearest police officer or branch bureau for handling. VII. Service dates are from October 26th to November 1st. Time: A shift: 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM, 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM. B shift: 11:45 AM to 12:45 PM, 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM. VIII.

### Ethnic Groups in the Border Areas Support Peace Movement

Ethnic groups in the three provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai and parts of Xinjiang, in view of the severe threats posed by the British, American, and Chongqing forces and industry in various border areas, which have caused various anxieties in life, are aware that the peace movement is the best policy to restore politics. They have publicly elected representatives to visit the government authorities to express their support. The plenipotentiary representative, Ya Leng Pilie, arrived in Shanghai on official business. It is said that the struggle between the Chongqing and Communist forces has plunged the people of the border areas into dire straits. The sincerity of the peace movement is clearly understood and supported by all ethnic groups in the border areas. They deeply hope that the government authorities will promote it and that the Allied powers will cooperate to promote its early completion.

### Recompilation of the Huayan Commentary Completed

### Major General Arima Fought Bravely and Sacrificed Himself, Minister Matsushima Expressed Deep Condolences

In this aerial operation in the eastern waters of the Philippines, Japanese commander Major General Arima Kenbun took the lead in battle, charging towards the enemy fleet in his plane and perishing together with an enemy American aircraft carrier. Minister Matsushima of the Press Section of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, who had been trained by Major General Arima, especially published his thoughts yesterday: (Major General Arima was from the Satsuma region of Kyushu and had a very kind appearance. At first glance, one would never expect the major general to be a heroic warrior. His strict father was an educator. When we entered military school, Major General Arima served as an instructor and provided very strict guidance to us. The major general, who came from an artillery background, switched to aviation in Showa 12 and repeatedly established military achievements. When Guangzhou was captured, one of his subordinates' planes was forced to land midway. The major general stepped forward to rescue him. At that time, Jiang Ruzhou, the general manager of the Sanmin Trust Company, who helped with the rescue, also expressed deep admiration for the major general's kindness and bravery. The last time I received Major General Arima's care was in the spring of Showa 15, when I was ordered to transfer to the Yokosuga Naval Base as the Director of the Press. The major general, as the deputy commander of the air wing, gave a very detailed explanation of the content of the new aircraft and the spirit of the Japanese naval air wing, with the utmost sincerity. Major General Arima, who adhered to the spirit of perseverance and indomitability, now perishes together with the enemy aircraft carrier, which can also be said to be a fulfillment of his aspirations. In military school, I often heard the major general's admonition (Matsushima-kun, please be mindful of this. I still remember it to this day.)

Mr. Wang Ruzhou Published His Thoughts

Since the enemy Americans began to stir in the Philippines, the Allied Japanese forces met them head-on and inflicted heavy damage, creating this brilliant achievement. Major General Arima, the commander of a unit in its air force, heroically sacrificed himself by exploding his plane. His friend Wang Ruzhou specially published his thoughts on this: In Showa 13, when Arima was the Chief Staff Officer of the (Tenryu) warship, I served on the warship. He usually treated people kindly and was especially concerned about the Sino-Japanese issue. He deeply believed that China and Japan, with the same script and race, should not engage in domestic strife and hoped that people from both countries would work together for the future of our East Asian nations. Later, he was promoted to captain of the (Shinshu) warship, and we separated. I remember that when the warship was operating in the south, it was anchored outside Shantou River. Two reconnaissance planes belonging to it were forced to land in Meixian, in the territory of the Chongqing army. After receiving the report, Major General Arima did not sleep all night, thinking hard about how to rescue them. In addition to sending planes to drop food and weapons from the air to provide assistance, he also telegraphed (Tenryu) to fly to (Shinshu) to discuss solutions together. At that time, he wanted to personally fly to Meixian with me to rescue them. His subordinates also planned to discuss Sino-Japanese issues directly with the local Chongqing commander. However, fearing that this matter would not proceed smoothly, he secretly dispatched his subordinates to sneak into the area to engage in extreme rescue. From this, it can be seen to what extent Major General Arima loved his subordinates. It is even more admirable that he regarded the Chinese army as brothers. This time, he spared no expense to sacrifice himself, charging towards the enemy American aircraft carrier and exploding his plane, his spirit of sacrificing himself for righteousness is even more worthy of our praise.

### Special Report on a Visit to Eastern Hebei

Continued from the first page.

Three: An Evening Talk with Administrative Chief Jiang.
Meeting Administrative Chief Jiang, he seemed to be a vigorous and practical person in his prime. In North China's military and political circles, he is undoubtedly an outstanding talent. He graduated from the Japanese Army War College and had always served in the Northeast Army. After the incident, he became a key cadre in the Pacification Army. Although he has been in Eastern Hebei as Administrative Chief for less than three months, he has been working vigorously since taking office. Soon after taking office, he went to various places to inspect in person, held symposiums with gentry and merchants, and personally visited the people's concerns. Therefore, when he went to Linjian County, several Eighth Route Army cadres surrendered with their weapons. Around August 24th, in the latter part of August, under the call of Administrative Chief Jiang, a general assembly of people's representatives from all over the Eastern Hebei Special District was held. Why was this meeting convened? According to Administrative Chief Jiang, it was to free the people of the entire district from the temptation of bandits and to allow the respected gentry to speak without reservation about the hidden pains of the people, so that the administrative authorities could study rescue strategies. I thought at the time that, regardless of the actual situation, this move was an initiative in a peaceful area. If North China can use the experiment of new governance as a model and gradually promote it to the whole country, the writer firmly believes that the bandits will one day disappear. It seems that the Eastern Hebei authorities are putting all their efforts into eliminating corruption and bribery. Therefore, on the day Administrative Chief Jiang took office, in his capacity as Director of the Tangshan Military Camp and Administrative Chief, he issued a letter to all officers and soldiers of the Pacification Army in Eastern Hebei. Several frank statements in it are indeed rare self-examinations by the authorities in recent years. He said: "Our army has been talking about suppression for years, without rest, but not only have the bandits not been cleared, but they have become more rampant. The main reason is that while many officers and soldiers are fighting bravely and hard, there are also not a few who make excuses for extorting, which causes the loss of public trust. When our army is stationed or marching, it is often due to negligence in searching and guarding, or a weak concept of the enemy, that they are ambushed by the enemy. They cannot fight bravely to kill the enemy, but instead blame the people, accusing them of communicating with and aiding the bandits, and extorting arbitrarily, even resorting to insults or violence for the sake of profit. As a result, good people are not afraid of the Communist bandits, but are afraid of the extortion of the military and police!" Therefore, he said: "If any of our officers, soldiers, or servants extort on the grounds of their position, take people's property without authorization, or commit any other illegal acts against the people, in addition to the Military Camp conducting thorough investigations and severely punishing them at any time, merchants and people are also allowed to truthfully accuse them. These bad elements will be immediately dealt with by the military." From this, we can see how Jiang warned his troops from the beginning of his tenure, and also see his determination to improve the politics of the special district. Currently, there are about five Group Armies of the Pacification Army stationed in the Special District, each Group Army including three regiments, which is actually the strength of five divisions. Finally, there is one more thing worth mentioning, which is the financial situation of the Eastern Hebei Special District. According to Administrative Chief Jiang, the total budget for this year is more than 12 million yuan. Although the amount is small, with the assistance of the North China Political Affairs Committee at the beginning of their tenure, a solid economic foundation can probably be laid starting next year. According to their current financial plan, the land tax will be uniformly changed to a mu (unit of area) donation, and other miscellaneous taxes will be abolished. Their planned mu donation will be half paid in cash and half in kind. The amount of tax will be determined based on the actual condition of the land. For top-quality land, the donation is 15 yuan per mu and 5 catties (unit of weight) of goods. For medium-quality land, the donation is 12 yuan per mu and 4 catties of goods. For low-quality land, the donation is 10 yuan per mu and 3 catties of goods. The abolition of all miscellaneous taxes also includes past funds owned by various counties and townships, because in the past, due to insufficient government funding, various counties and townships could independently apportion funds. Although the reporter only stayed in Tangshan for six hours, he expressed great admiration for the spirit of hard work and unity of the Eastern Hebei authorities. However, it is felt that they have not been able to integrate the economic aspect with the political and military aspects, which seems to be a slight deficiency. Because, according to the current situation, the groups that control the materials of Eastern Hebei today are still the same as other regions in North China, with the Fiber Association, the Oil Association, the Cooperative Professional Association, the Board of Directors Association, the Cotton Production Improvement Association, and the Hemp Production Improvement Association, etc., and there is no organization that has full authority to control the economy! The reporter sincerely hopes that they can go further and achieve their overall political goals, then the bright future of Eastern Hebei will surely be even more glorious!

The broadcast time yesterday was 6:45 PM.
