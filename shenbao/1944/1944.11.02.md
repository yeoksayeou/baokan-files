### Meat Grinding Assault on Enemy Fleet off Peleliu's Eastern Waters: Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announces Results of Torpedo Suicide Squad

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 1st: On the morning of October 28th, the Japanese Torpedo Suicide Squad launched a meat-grinding assault on an enemy transport fleet off the eastern waters of Peleliu Island, sinking four ships and destroying two. Simultaneously, a meat-grinding assault team that had penetrated the northern shore of the island successfully launched a surprise landing.

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese forces in the Central Pacific, in response to the valiant fight of the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Air Corps, are continuing their brave struggle. In the Peleliu Island area of the Palau Islands, since the enemy landed on September 15th, they have been engaging in operations day and night with torpedo suicide squads and meat-grinding assault teams, fully demonstrating the unique and strong spirit of the Japanese army, making the enemy tremble. The Japanese army and navy units in Palau Island are also providing all possible assistance to the Japanese forces fighting hard on Peleliu Island. On the other hand, the enemy is also exerting all its strength to supply Peleliu Island in response to the operations in the Philippines. On the 27th, they launched a desperate landing operation on the eastern shore of the island with approximately 18 transport ships (including 10 large transport ships). After detecting this movement of the enemy forces, the Japanese naval forces on Palau Island immediately launched an attack on the 28th with torpedo suicide squads and meat-grinding teams to support the Kamikaze Special Attack Air Corps. Among them, the torpedo suicide squad achieved a great victory in the eastern waters of Peleliu Island, sinking four enemy transport ships and destroying two enemy transport ships. The meat-grinding team launched a surprise landing on the northern shore of Peleliu Island, which has already succeeded, and is currently still engaged in fierce fighting.

Central News Agency News - The Japanese torpedo squadron sank an enemy American transport fleet supplying landing troops in the eastern waters of Peleliu Island. Details are as follows:

The Japanese military headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on November 1st that the Japanese torpedo suicide squad launched a surprise attack on the enemy American transport fleet in the eastern waters of Peleliu Island on the morning of October 28th, achieving a great victory of sinking four and destroying four. In addition, the assault team led by Lieutenant Commander Taniji Endo of the Navy, in response, penetrated the northern shore of Peleliu Island by boat, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. This surprise attack operation is extremely important from the perspective of the overall war situation. (1) Cutting off the enemy's food supply line in Leyte Gulf, isolating the forces of MacArthur, and further expressing the determination to launch a general counterattack on the Pacific islands already in enemy hands. By using Peleliu Island to block enemy target areas such as the Philippine Islands and Borneo, this narrow and isolated island of 30 square kilometers has become the site of a bloody battle for 20,000 people, which is a unique tactic of Japanese soldiers. This surprise attack resulted in the complete annihilation of three enemy divisions reinforced from Angaur Island. (2) The torpedo suicide squad in the sea is like the Kamikaze Special Attack Air Corps in the air, a concrete manifestation of the Japanese people's heroic spirit of defending their country, which is enough to make the enemy tremble. The enemy's transport fleet is a temporary conversion of merchant ships, and their aircraft carriers are assembled in a crude manner. Therefore, by using these torpedoes and bombs, which represent the Japanese national spirit, to launch heroic attacks unprecedented in history, no enemy ship can escape, and the United Kingdom and the United States will be stunned.

### Japanese Kamikaze Attack Air Corps Demonstrates Bushido Spirit: Details of Heroic Operations in the Eastern Philippines

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - As a major decisive battle between Japan and the United States unfolds in the Philippines, the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Air Corps and other new elite air corps are thoroughly demonstrating their Bushido spirit, launching fierce attacks day after day on the enemy mobile units and their transport fleets in the eastern waters of the Philippines and Leyte Gulf, inflicting enormous blows on the persistently stubborn enemy. The results achieved to date were announced by the Imperial Japanese Headquarters on the 31st. The details of the battles of each corps are recorded as follows.

25th (1) The Kamikaze Special Attack Air Corps and the Shikishima Corps, at noon, used ramming tactics in the east of the Surigao Strait, sinking one enemy giant aircraft carrier with two aircraft, destroying one enemy medium-sized aircraft carrier with one aircraft, and ramming and sinking one enemy cruiser with one aircraft. (2) Another Kamikaze Special Attack Air Corps, in the morning, in the waters east of Surigao, besieged an enemy mobile unit possessing aircraft carriers, overcame the obstruction of enemy escort aircraft, and hit and destroyed an enemy standard aircraft carrier. In addition, a part of another attack corps also dispatched to destroy the enemy. Since all of them have not returned, it is difficult to determine the results of the battle, but it is thought that the gains will not be small.

26th - The Kamikaze Special Attack Corps, at half past noon, in the waters east of Surigao, besieged an enemy mobile unit possessing four aircraft carriers, overcame the obstruction of enemy escort aircraft, giant fighters (approximately 60 aircraft), and intense anti-aircraft fire, launching a sure-hit attack. Two aircraft hit one enemy large aircraft carrier, engulfing the entire hull in fierce explosions. Japanese escort aircraft confirmed that it sank. Another aircraft hit the deck next to the bridge of an enemy aircraft carrier, causing it to tilt at approximately 40 degrees. Japanese escort aircraft then saw it restored.

27th (1) The Kamikaze Special Attack Air Corps and the Junchu Corps, at approximately 7:00 PM, penetrated the Leyte Gulf area, bombing enemy ships at anchor. Due to the darkness, it was difficult to distinguish the type of enemy ships. Commander So-and-so, a captain, intended to attack the enemy ships, but due to the obstruction of enemy fighters, he was unable to contact his wingmen. As a result, the commander's aircraft and a part of the direct escort aircraft had no choice but to return to base. The second and third aircraft, which lost contact, launched ramming attacks. One aircraft hit an enemy transport ship, causing it to immediately catch fire, explode, and sink. Unfortunately, the results of the other aircraft have not yet been determined. (2) The Kamikaze Special Attack Corps assault team, in coordination with escort aircraft, attacked the enemy fleet anchored in Leyte Gulf at approximately 6:00 PM. One aircraft first hit the stern of an enemy battleship, destroying it. The second aircraft hit a cruiser, also destroying it. The third aircraft was hit by enemy fire during the attack, resulting in it hitting the stern of an enemy large transport ship. That evening, it penetrated Leyte Gulf. Due to the difficulty of confirmation, it returned to base together with the escort aircraft.

28th - The commander of the Junchu Corps departed from base alone at approximately 4:00 AM, launching a brave attack on enemy ships in Leyte Gulf. Because it was not coordinated with escort aircraft, it was impossible to confirm the results of the battle.

29th - In the sea a certain distance east of Ormoc Bay, an enemy fleet was discovered, composed of four aircraft carriers (including three large aircraft carriers), two to four battleships, and other cruisers and destroyers, totaling more than 20 ships. The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Corps immediately dispatched to launch a fierce attack. One aircraft hit the vicinity of the bridge of one enemy aircraft carrier, causing an immediate explosion. Another ship of unknown type and one cruiser were also hit and caught fire. Due to the obstruction of enemy escort aircraft, it was not possible to confirm the hits.

30th Morning - The Kamikaze Special Attack Corps received intelligence that an enemy mobile unit had been discovered in the southeast sea area of Suluan Island, attempting to invade Leyte Gulf. The enemy mobile unit was formed with two giant aircraft carriers, one medium-sized aircraft carrier, one battleship, and many other ships. The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Corps rushed from a certain base and launched a fierce attack. Three of them hit one enemy large aircraft carrier, causing it to catch fire and immediately sink. One of them hit one enemy medium-sized aircraft carrier, causing it to catch fire. Another one hit one enemy small aircraft carrier. Other circumstances could not be confirmed due to the dense smoke and fire from the large aircraft carrier. Another one hit the stern of an enemy battleship, also injuring it.

### Director Endo Talks About How the Kamikaze Corps Has Grasped V-1 Control Power

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - Lieutenant General Endo, Director of the Aeronautical Weapons General Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Munitions, recently gave a speech, the gist of which was that after the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps launched its attacks, the enemy Americans were terrified. Currently, Germany's V-1 flying bomb attacks on the United Kingdom cannot transform the elements of the war situation. The disadvantage is the lack of control power. Therefore, our side, learning from the lessons of allied nations, must create a V-1 with control power. He also commented that although the V-1 has great power, it generally lacks a clear target and must have accurate control power, but it is feared that no country can make this control power a reality. However, this time, the Japanese Special Attack Corps has completely succeeded in making it a reality. Japan's V-1 has now fully exerted its power. In the future, even more weapons that will terrify the American army will continue to appear.

Japanese Army Base in the Philippines, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a report from the Japanese air corps at noon on October 31st, patrolling the Leyte Gulf area, there are enemy cruisers and a dozen destroyers (including several battleships) anchored in that area, confirming that most of the approximately 60 enemy transport ships have tilted and sunk due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Corps and the Japanese air corps.

Editorial

### Social Welfare and the Issue of Elderly Care

In recent discussions of social welfare, the most easily overlooked aspect is perhaps elderly care. This is because a common misconception prevails, viewing respect and care for the elderly merely as an old-fashioned notion or a passive form of charity. While efforts in this regard are appreciated, their absence is deemed inconsequential to society's future. In reality, this viewpoint is a root cause of today's deteriorating public morals and societal unrest. It is important to understand that respect and care for the elderly were the highest principles of our ancient morality. The "Great Way" of governance sought to realize the ideal of "not only cherishing one's own relatives," leading to the saying "cherish the elderly of others as you cherish your own" and "the elderly shall be cared for." Successive governments have promoted respect for the elderly and enacted policies for their care. Society at large also fostered a spirit of reverence for the elderly, still often seen in the towns and villages of the mainland, preserving noble and pure customs. However, upon reaching the treaty ports and major cities, the notion of respecting and caring for the elderly is often dismissed as impractical, leading people to pursue only self-interest and power, resulting in moral decay and societal decline. This is a pressing social problem.

Recognizing this, our newspaper, following the symposium on child welfare, convened a "Symposium on Elderly Care." The aim was to bring together representatives from elderly care organizations and respected philanthropists in the city to share their insights, consolidate opinions, and improve and promote elderly care initiatives. At the same time, we hope to raise awareness of the issue of elderly care among all sectors of society. We believe that the benefits will extend beyond the lonely and helpless elderly, having a significant impact on the hearts and minds of the people and on society as a whole.

How to ensure that "the elderly have a secure life" is a matter addressed by governments in many countries, with dedicated policies, funding, and organizations. Simultaneously, there are various well-organized and large-scale elderly care initiatives in society. Our country lags far behind in all aspects and naturally cannot be compared. However, there has never been a shortage of dedicated individuals in society striving for this cause, especially the efforts of the religious community, which are most commendable. Taking this city as an example, institutions such as the elderly homes and the New General Welfare Hall's elderly ward, are undoubtedly worthy of praise in terms of scale, organization, and care, as anyone who has visited them can attest. However, overall, there are only about twelve elderly care organizations in the city. Apart from the two run by Catholic teachers, the number of elderly people they accommodate has been gradually decreasing, primarily due to rising prices and increasing expenses, making it difficult to sustain operations. Even for the two institutions run by the Catholic Church, although the elderly home still houses over 300 people, it is questionable how long they can sustain this given the current economic situation. As for the New General Welfare Hall, which previously accommodated over 3,000 elderly, young, and disabled individuals in distress, with a considerable number of men, women, elderly, and disabled among them, only about 150 people remain in the hall. The five institutions run by Christian churches and the five run by charitable organizations face even more difficult circumstances, and the living conditions of the elderly they accommodate cannot be compared to those of the elderly homes. If those who are being accommodated and assisted are facing such a situation, how many more elderly, sick, lonely, and widowed individuals are not being accommodated or assisted! We only need to pay a little attention to those crying in the streets and alleys, even starving to death by the roadside; they are everywhere. Who has no parents, how can we bear to see them wandering? We cannot help but call on the relevant authorities, especially well-informed and compassionate individuals from all walks of life, to jointly find ways to provide assistance.

Regarding the issue of assisting lonely and impoverished elderly, specific and practical conclusions were reached at this symposium on elderly care. (Please refer to the records of the symposium on elderly care on page 3 of today's newspaper). We believe there are some points that deserve special attention from the relevant authorities and community leaders, as follows:

First, regarding the improvement and maintenance of existing elderly care organizations, Mr. Zhao Ximing's three proposals at the symposium are very relevant to the facts. We hope that the leaders of each organization can put aside prejudices and pay special attention to them. However, it seems that the third point, addressed to the two institutions run by the Catholic Church, has already been implemented. We hope that other organizations will visit them more often, adopt the methods used by the nuns and sisters, and especially learn from their spirit of sacrifice and service. But we more eagerly hope that all sectors of society will do their best to assist existing organizations, so that they can maintain and improve, and further expand the number of people they can accommodate.

Second, regarding the improvement of the general elderly population's living conditions, this symposium on elderly care raised issues such as nutrition, treatment, production, and rest. Elders Zhu, Ding, and Xu shared their insightful views. We hope that all elders, regardless of wealth or gender, will pay special attention to them. Even those who are children can refer to them as basic principles for serving their parents and elders.

Third, in order to universally respect and care for the elderly, to change the social atmosphere, we still rely on the government authorities and leaders from all walks of life to vigorously promote this cause. Implementing measures such as seniority-based salary increases and preferential retirement benefits for government agencies, schools, public and private organizations, as well as factory service personnel. Society, especially medical, transportation agencies, and entertainment venues, should have specific preferential measures for the elderly, creating an environment of respect and care. We firmly believe that these measures have a significant impact on the future revival of society.

Eyewitness Account by Ensign Hayano

Philippine Front, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - Regarding the great naval battle in the eastern Philippines the other day, Ensign Hayano of the Japanese Army Air Corps recounted as follows: "At that time, the sky above was cloudy, and it was a pity that the view below was not very clear. On that day, I and others set out to scout the enemy landing site in Leyte Gulf. During the voyage, we saw black dots on the course in the distance, which were our fleet. The aircraft carrier was majestic, and there were escort fighters protecting the fleet. The vanguard of our air force was the preemptive strike team. My attitude was also serious, and I silently prayed for the victory of our fleet. At that time, the enemy air corps flying from the distant sky had already launched a decisive battle with our air force over the Pacific Ocean. The enemy aircraft that were shot down trailed black smoke, spiraled down, and crashed. Our army's giant cannonballs exploded continuously in the air. Enemy torpedo planes were engulfed in flames and crashed into the sea. I was flying in the clouds, and in the gaps of the broken clouds, I saw our army's accurate giant cannons roaring. The enemy fleet was also clearly visible below. Some enemy aircraft carriers were tilted, and some were sinking. In an instant, several enemy cruisers were blown up. The enemy was terrified of our army's attack, and fired anti-aircraft shells to protect their aircraft carrier. At that time, the enemy fighters flying in the sky had already been defeated by our air force. Their aircraft carrier was tilted, and other ships were gradually destroyed and sunk into the sea, eventually perishing. I braved the violent air currents and continued reconnaissance in the sky, and seeing the great results of this battle in the swaying motion, my joy and emotion were difficult to contain."

### One Enemy Aircraft Reconnoiters Tokyo

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - At approximately 1:00 PM on the 1st, one enemy B-29 aircraft, which took off from a base near the Mariana Islands, intruded into the airspace over Tokyo. At approximately 1:30 PM, it fled to the southeast. The enemy aircraft did not drop bombs. The enemy's operations in the Philippines have suffered enormous losses due to the fierce counterattacks of the Japanese army, navy, and air force, and their operational progress has not been as desired. It is believed that the enemy aircraft's intrusion into Tokyo this time was to contain the Japanese counterattack. In addition, the U.S. presidential election will be held on the 7th, and this matter has a strategic intention and was for reconnaissance purposes.

### Japanese Aircraft Night Raid on Fenny Airfield

Frontline Base in Burma, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese aircraft in Burma attacked the enemy airfield in Fenny, eastern Bengal, again on the night of the 29th. In this operation, two enemy aircraft parked on the ground were hit and caught fire, and other facilities were also severely damaged. All Japanese aircraft safely returned to base.

### Truth About Stillwell's Recall: Discord Between Chongqing and Yan'an Disappoints the U.S.

Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - Regarding the resignation of U.S. General Stilwell, commander of the U.S. forces stationed in Chongqing, the U.S. government revealed the details of the matter on the 31st through the United Press and the Associated Press. According to the United Press, New Delhi, the reason for Stilwell's return to the country was only announced now, but it originated as far back as two months ago, when General Hurley and Nelson arrived in Chongqing. In order to make a rapid counteroffensive in East Asia, the U.S. command gave the two men the greatest authority, asking Chongqing to cooperate with the U.S. military in order to enhance the war effort against Japan. According to reliable information from the United Press, the U.S. government has in fact used the suspension of aid to Chongqing as a means of intimidation. At the same time, in order to avoid misunderstandings and provide accurate reports, the U.S. government has finally softened its attitude, maintaining the dignity of Chongqing and adopting a policy of appeasement. It is generally expected that the recall of Stilwell is the U.S.'s attempt to require cooperation between the KMT and the CCP, so that the two armies can cooperate in resisting Japan. Hurley and Nelson have stated that the failure of Chongqing and Yan'an to reconcile has disappointed the U.S. government.

What the U.S. government requires is (1) to reorganize the KMT government in Chongqing and remove xenophobic elements, and (2) to appoint U.S. military officers as commanders not only on the Burmese front but also in important battles on other fronts. These forceful conditions were presented to Chongqing. At the same time, Roosevelt also sent a personal letter to Chiang Kai-shek. During the negotiations, Chiang indirectly admitted that it would be impossible to transfer a part of the Chongqing army commanders on the important central China front. Although other conditions have been agreed to, the dissolution or reorganization of the KMT government has been rejected. According to a recent report by White, the Associated Press correspondent in Chongqing, Stilwell's return to the country is a manifestation of the division of opinions between the U.S. military commander in East Asia and Chiang. The many disputes caused by Stilwell's return to the country show that Roosevelt will entrust Chiang Kai-shek with the responsibility of reorganizing Chongqing and strengthening its war effort. When Stilwell returned to the country, U.S. Ambassador to Chongqing Gauss also submitted his resignation. Gauss has always advocated a tough attitude towards Chongqing. He believes that Stilwell's return to the country is the demise of the U.S.'s position in Chongqing.

Conflict Between Stilwell and Chiang

Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a Washington dispatch, U.S. President Roosevelt told reporters on the 31st that the recall of Stilwell was not a political issue. Stilwell had indeed achieved great results in his responsibility, but his conflict with Chiang Kai-shek was a failure.

New U.S. Commander Arrives in New Delhi

Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, Lieutenant General Sultan, the U.S. Deputy Commander of the anti-Axis forces in Southeast Asia, who has been transferred to the Indian-Burmese front, has been appointed as the commander of the U.S. forces stationed in India and Chongqing. It is also reported that Sultan arrived in New Delhi on October 31st.

One direction of the Japanese army attacking Guilin Airport, on the morning of the 29th at 10 o'clock, broke into Dawei, a key point on the Guilin-Yangshuo highway (15 kilometers southeast of Guilin), posing a major threat to the rear communication line of the Guilin direct defense forces and the Chongqing 37th Group Army entrenched in Pingle and Yangshuo.

Guilin Suburbs: Two Armies in Combat

Hengyang, 1st Dispatch, Central News Agency: According to a dispatch from a reporter of the Japanese army reporting team in the suburbs of Guilin, a certain unit of the Japanese army in Guangxi had advanced to the Chongqing army positions on the northeastern outskirts of Guilin on the night of the 30th, and fierce fighting is currently underway. Since the Japanese army advanced into Guangxi Province in early October, they have successively captured Quanxian, Xing'an, and other key points on the Xiang-Gui Railway, and continued to advance towards Guilin. By dusk on the 29th of last month, they had defeated two divisions of the Chongqing 93rd Army, occupied Lingchuan, the forward stronghold of Guilin, and advanced another 60 li on the 30th, reaching the north of Guilin Xinshi Street at 10:25 p.m. on the same day. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the 31st Army, 2nd Division, under the command of Wei Yunsong, commander of the Chongqing 60th Group Army. Other Japanese army units also advanced towards the Xiangfeng Mountain, the southern position outside Guilin city, on the 30th.

Guangxi, 1st Dispatch, Central News Agency: After breaking into Lingtian Street on the morning of the 29th, the Japanese army continued its rapid advance. The Chongqing troops stubbornly defended Yang'anqi (8 kilometers northeast of Guilin) to Dushan (10 kilometers northeast of Yang'anqi). In this battle, the Japanese army launched a fierce attack and defeated them on the 30th.

Occupation of Fuchuan, Chongqing Troops Retreat

Guangxi Front, 1st Dispatch, Central News Agency: The Japanese army previously attacked in the direction of Yongming, and at dusk on the 26th, they defeated 300 Chongqing troops near Shenjie. On the 27th, they repelled another regiment or so of Chongqing troops and occupied Fuchuan (a key point on the Maojiang River). The Chongqing troops around the area have retreated towards the ancient city wall.

Japanese Aircraft Attack Chongqing Air Force Base

Chinese Base, 1st Dispatch, Central News Agency: On the night of the 30th, a Japanese bomber squadron braved the adverse weather and attacked Liuzhou, a Chongqing military counter-offensive base. They overcame intense anti-aircraft fire and repeatedly bombed the air force base and warehouses, causing fires in various places. However, due to the absolute darkness, the details of the battle results could not be determined.

South China Front Base, 1st Dispatch, Central News Agency: According to news arriving locally, dozens of American naval fighter planes have flown to the Nanning and Liuzhou airfields in recent days. This is because most of the American naval vessels were sunk or destroyed in the past naval battles in Taiwan and the Philippines, and these naval fighter planes were unable to fly back to their mother ships and had to fly here. However, only a few dozen of these returned American aircraft were seen. From this, it can be inferred that the rest have suffered the same fate as the naval vessels, so the losses suffered by the American military this time are indeed quite significant.

Japanese Army Attacks Chongqing Army, Battle Results

South China Front Line, 1st Dispatch, Central News Agency: The Japanese army in Guangxi, which is attacking on the left bank of the Xijiang River, recently constructed positions in the hilly area between Xinxu, 30 kilometers north of Guiping, and Sanjiangxu, 15 kilometers west of the same place.

Berlin, 1st Dispatch, Central News Agency: Reuter's report: A German military spokesperson pointed out: The Soviet and Anglo-American forces also believe that the German Tiger King tank has superior combat power, and Germany also has the latest type of landmine, which cannot be found even with magnetic search. Germany has various new weapons, which is the reason why the Soviet army's offensive in East Prussia has been frustrated. The Soviet army sent a large force of 35 divisions to attack East Prussia, but in fact, its combat power has been greatly reduced.

Berlin, 1st Dispatch, Central News Agency: Reuter's report: German military authorities have counted the Soviet army's losses in East Prussia in 12 days, which shows that the German army has achieved a defensive victory, even though the narrow land on the border has fallen into the hands of the Soviet army. Fierce battles are still raging along the coast of Courland, from East to Riba, and West to Ositz. The Soviet authorities apparently want to eliminate the threat to their flanks before launching another attack on East Prussia.

Advance Along the Danube River to Hong Kong

The second focal point on the Eastern Front is the Buszta plain in Hungary. The Soviet army's move to push north to the Slovak border has stalled due to heavy losses in the battles of Tebresen, Niregyhaza, and Mezodul. The Soviet advance from the Carpathian Mountains has also been blocked to the east of Beskid. Between the Danube and Tisza rivers, the Soviet army is beginning its offensive towards Budapest.

### Soviet Fleet Discovered Near the Aland Islands

Stockholm, Sweden, 1st Dispatch, Central News Agency: Reuter's report: Finnish travelers said that they saw 12 Soviet warships near the Aland Islands.

Lisbon, 1st Dispatch, Central News Agency: German News Agency reported from Washington that President Roosevelt's private secretary, O'Leary, announced that President Roosevelt would broadcast an important speech from the White House on Thursday.

Travel Correspondence

### A Perspective on Nanhui Society

— Yifei

In my previous correspondence, I briefly reported on the general situation of Nanhui. Now, I will further describe the various aspects of Nanhui society as follows:

Nanhui County is one of the larger counties under the jurisdiction of Shanghai Municipality and is also designated as a model county by the Ministry of Interior. From the outside, it has a vast area, a considerable population, and abundant products. But if you look at its inner layer, you will immediately find its internal morbidity, riddled with holes, and the people's livelihood is extremely difficult. Social order is unstable.

(1) Farmers' Production

Nanhui County's economy is built on the rural center. It has 1.24 million mu of farmland and 520,000 residents. In theory, the county's food supply can be self-sufficient and not panic. However, the reporter's on-the-spot investigation shows that this is the opposite of the ideal. The amount of rice produced in the county is only enough to supply the county for three months. The shortfall depends entirely on imports from Jinshan, Songjiang and other places. If the source is once unsmoothed, panic will occur immediately. In addition, adjacent to Shanghai, the market price is shifted by Shanghai, and it is no wonder that it changes several times a day. Therefore, farmers are worried about the rising rice price. As for talking about the so-called "cheap grain hurts farmers," this situation is actually reversed. Furthermore, Nanhui's special products, cotton, sweet potatoes, and peanuts, are also economic sources for farmers, and they live on this. Taking cotton as an example, the handling of cotton production is currently extremely unfree, and the current market price is also cheap, almost halved (before the war, one dan of seed cotton could be exchanged for one shi of white rice, but now it can only be exchanged for five dou). In addition, the high cost of artificial fertilizers, the heavy burden of donations and taxes, and the difficulty of selling in Shanghai will inevitably lead to losses. In the past, this dilapidated rural area relied on merchants from the hometown who traveled to Shanghai to do business and salary earners who remitted money back home from time to time to make up for it. At present, the cost of living in Shanghai has soared. Except for a very small number of merchants, the rest of the salary earners traveling to Shanghai feel the pressure of life and cannot take care of themselves, let alone remit money to their hometown. Therefore, the rural economy here is becoming increasingly dilapidated. Because rural finance is exhausted, it is difficult to raise working capital. Farmers are in urgent need of money and inevitably take measures to quench their thirst with poison, resulting in the opportunity for usurious loans to rise. The illegal discounting that is prevalent here, its interest rate is shocking, and the details will be described in another chapter.

(2) Merchants' Life

After the war, Shanghai's merchants can be called natural darlings. It can be said that "all professions are inferior, only merchants are superior." But this is only true for a very small number of long-sleeved, good-dancing, wealthy merchants. The general small merchants lack capital, and they have to seek black market goods for the purchase of goods. The source of black market goods is generally trafficked from Shanghai by peddlers, and they must pay a handling fee of 30% of the price of the goods, resulting in increased costs. In addition to the profits that merchants should get, the selling price is high, and the purchasing power of the public is extremely weak. The reporter walked around the city and saw that the stores were deserted, and the shop assistants were chatting with each other, and their attitude was very leisurely. I have visited several bosses, and they all bitterly complained. It is said that the prices of goods in Shanghai have soared, and it is not easy to purchase goods in the store. At present, the city is seeing a trend that the goods in the stores are decreasing day by day, and it is not easy to replenish them. As for the export of local products, merchants also find it difficult to develop due to the heavy burden of water fees and taxes along the way and the lack of capital.

(3) Three Employees and Local Ruffians

The "three employees" here refer to shop assistants, teachers, and civil servants, and local ruffians and hooligans who act illegally. Among the three employees, shop assistants have a more prosperous life and are more stable. In addition to the shopkeeper providing food and accommodation, larger shops also have a bonus to share at the end of the year. Although the monthly salary is only about 1,000 yuan, if there is no family burden, personal life is not a problem. The most difficult are those in the education sector, whose fate seems to be destined to be inextricably linked to the word "poor." The tuition fee for primary school teachers here is only 600 yuan a month and two dou of rice (it is even less in rural towns). With this kind of treatment, the food is not enough, let alone other things. Civil servants have almost the same fate as teachers. The salary ranges from 2,100 yuan to 3,000 yuan, and they have to take care of their own food. How can this little money be enough to maintain? They are worried all day long about not having enough for three meals, and the work efficiency is naturally reduced. It is said that a civil servant from another town was in a state of melancholy all day long. He could not afford three meals. Before leaving, he sold all his bedding and obtained a small amount of money so that he could make the trip. It was also very miserable. Therefore, in my opinion, if the government wants to promote clean government and improve administrative efficiency, it must first start with improving the treatment of civil servants. As for the local ruffians and hooligans, it is really heartbreaking. Because of their powerful influence, even local officials have to treat them with respect, let alone the common people. Therefore, incidents often occur in the townships here, which is an opportunity for these people to get rich. They arbitrarily manage the villages and force merchants to sell goods on credit and use long-term checks to coerce them into exchanging them for cash. This kind of thing happens frequently.

(4) Three Evils of Nanhui

Opium, gambling, and usury are the three evils of Nanhui. According to investigations, there are nearly 10,000 opium addicts in Nanhui, where opium and gambling are prevalent everywhere in this extraordinary period, and the number of white powder customers is three or four times this number. The severity of the harm can be imagined. The 18th District is the most serious, and there are even more smokers in the coastal areas. These smokers are all middle class. Once they are addicted, they cannot extricate themselves and eventually lose their family property and become beggars and petty thieves, which has a great impact on the social order of the townships. Gambling is prevalent in all parts of Nanhui. The way to gamble is mostly held in tea houses. People gamble all night long. Therefore, although the rural and remote areas are also full of tea houses, their main business is to gather people to play mahjong. The number of wins and losses in one game is often 200,000 to 300,000, and the owner of the tea house will extract a commission according to the number. Tea is usually free. It is common for those with thriving businesses to earn millions of yuan a night, which is not surprising. The most prevalent gambling areas are Datuan in the 8th District and Sanzao in the 7th District. Villagers often run the risk of fleeing to the guerrilla areas because they owe too much debt and selling the fields is not enough to repay. This is also one of the main reasons why it is difficult to establish public security in the countryside in recent years. The rise of usury is related to opium and gambling. In order to cope with debts for a while, legitimate farmers and merchants often have to take long-term checks and ask for help from those who have cash and specialize in exploiting the poor. The highest interest rate is 11 yuan per 1,000 yuan per day. The means are so ruthless that even those in Shanghai who specialize in lending "rubber ball money" cannot compare.

(5) The Burden of the People

When the reporter first arrived here, as soon as I unloaded my luggage, I went to the streets for a stroll and found that in a small Nanhui county town, there were numerous agencies and densely packed signboards, totaling no less than 30. I wondered what these agencies usually did. After investigation, most of these are tax agencies that harm the people. The types of taxes are listed as follows:

(1) For merchants and people, the general taxes include business tax, income tax, stamp tax, consumption special tax, unified tax special tax, house donation, etc. Special taxes include slaughter tax, tobacco and alcohol license tax, bamboo and wood business special tax, pig tax, tooth tax, fisheries construction fee, etc.

The above taxes are contracted by the Finance Bureau to merchants, and the contractors subcontract them to small contractors. The taxes are contracted at all levels, and the contractors pay a small amount of contracting fees to the higher authorities and collect exorbitant taxes from the lower authorities. The common people suffer. In fact, the tax revenue obtained by the government only accounts for 20 to 30 percent of the total. The rest is pocketed in practice. No wonder the contractors try their best to suppress the rebellion before the incident and must get the taxes before they will stop. After the incident, they all transform into wealthy men with round faces.

(2) For farmers, in addition to the land tax of 180 yuan per mu and the military and police rice of 150 yuan, farmers actually have to supply the local teams with in-kind requisitions, as well as the extortion of the guerrillas, and other miscellaneous taxes, which are endless, causing chaos in the rural areas today. Whenever I talked to the old farmers here about the rural situation, they all shook their heads and frowned, only calling out "What can we do?" Therefore, I believe that if we talk about improving the rural economy, we must first abolish the harsh taxes and establish public security.

(3) Temporary donations and taxes are temporarily collected by local autonomous organizations, including public welfare donations, cotton quilt donations, supply fees, uniform fees, and township office recurring expenses. The above donations are to offset the local budget deficit. I have now learned that the newly appointed County Chief Chen Yimeng once declared that after Nanhui was changed to a county, the land tax revenue will be at the county's own disposal, and the harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies that are temporarily apportioned will be abolished. This is undoubtedly good news for the people who have been suffering for a long time, but we should wait and see whether Chen's words and deeds will be implemented.

### Inventory of Warehouse Stocks to Begin Today, Municipal Authorities Hope for Cooperation from Merchants and People to Report

The rising prices in this city have greatly affected the livelihood of the common people. The reason for the price increases is nothing more than hoarding and speculation, taking the opportunity to manipulate the market. After repeated discussions by the municipal authorities, it has been decided to start investigating the inventory of various warehouses and stacks in the city on the 2nd of this month. All private warehouses and stacks set up by various factories and shops, as well as similar warehouses and stacks set up by all private individuals for war preparation materials, should be reported to the authorities on a monthly basis for investigation. If any outsiders privately set up warehouses to hoard major commodities other than daily necessities, once discovered, they will be severely punished according to law. As for the large amount of materials stored by members of the same industry of major commodities, based on the amount of their capital and the total amount of business in a year, those who are not considered to have the intention of hoarding for speculation will not be interfered with. The authorities' move is purely to suppress prices and seek the welfare of the citizens. The officialdom may not be fully aware of everything. If there are any illegal hoarding activities outside the industry, merchants and people throughout the city should report them truthfully. The government and the people should cooperate. Furthermore, if any officials engaged in inspection are found to be engaging in corruption or unfairness, it is hoped that the citizens and the media will report them at any time to show fairness.

### This Newspaper Holds Naval Battle Victory Celebration Broadcast, Mr. Yuan Ludeng and Lu Feng Speak

The "Taiwan-Philippines Naval Battle Victory Celebration Broadcast" organized by this newspaper was held yesterday afternoon at the Huangpu Radio Station. First, Mr. Chen, the president of this newspaper, explained the significance of organizing the victory celebration broadcast, and invited Mr. Yuan Ludeng, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Lu Feng, a columnist for the New China Daily, to give speeches. Then, the broadcast program began. Members of the entertainment industry arrived on time to broadcast and sing, which was exceptionally wonderful. Yesterday, Ren Yunpeng, the executive director of the News Federation, was also responsible for the report.

(President Chen's speech)

Listeners, today the Shen Bao is organizing the Taiwan-Philippines Naval Battle Victory Celebration Broadcast, and has invited Mr. Yuan Ludeng and Mr. Lu Feng to give speeches, and we are very grateful to the members of the entertainment industry for participating in the broadcast.

You have all seen the good news of the Allied victory in the naval battle of Taiwan and the Philippines. There are two points that we particularly value about this victory in the Taiwan-Philippines naval battle. First, the Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage. The victory in the Taiwan-Philippines battle has reduced the main force of the U.S. Pacific Fleet and laid the foundation for the final victory. Second, the Greater East Asia War is a war to liberate all the nations of Greater East Asia. Survival is at stake in this battle. Now that the foundation for victory has been laid due to the victory in the Taiwan-Philippines naval battle, the liberation of the nations of Greater East Asia is guaranteed.

Because of the importance of the above two points, we are particularly encouraging the public to pay attention, on the one hand to express celebration, and on the other hand to express vigilance, and to work together with greater efforts to complete the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.

(Yuan Ludeng's speech)

Today's Taiwan-Philippines Naval Battle Victory Celebration Broadcast program organized by China News is a very meaningful program. It is not only an event of significance to one place and one country, but also a problem that is closely related to the entire Greater East Asia. This is because the great victory won by the Allied Japan in the sea off Taiwan and the Philippines has laid a solid foundation for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This significance has been clarified in various newspapers and magazines. I hope you will explain the significance of this victory. For 5,000 years, China has valued morality. The so-called "Dao cannot be separated for a moment, and what can be separated is not Dao." Dao is morality. From the standpoint of Dao, everyone should have a spirit of sacrifice in the war. What is the purpose of this spirit of sacrifice? It is to create the foundation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Why do we want to create the foundation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere? It is to complete the glorious future of the nations of Greater East Asia. Therefore, today, all of us in Greater East Asia should strive towards this consistent policy. If there is no such effort and spirit of sacrifice, the moral significance is lacking. This meaning of Dao includes the unified direction of the front and the rear. Soldiers at the front sacrifice their lives and materials, and the rear strives to increase production, conserve materials, and live frugally to cooperate with the front in combat. This spirit is based on Dao and cannot be separated for a moment. "What can be separated is not Dao." Therefore, now all newspapers are publicizing this spirit based on this point, and there have been many detailed explanations. In order to realize the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the people of Greater East Asia should have this same determination. China has always valued morality. Now that the foundation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has been laid, and the destination is not far away, the Chinese people should not deviate from the spirit of Dao. They should abandon all differences in understanding and opinion, unite into the same purpose of Dao, and strive towards the path of moral spirit. The front and the rear should cooperate as one to exert this power, and future generations will be able to achieve immortal glory.

Afterwards, Lu Feng gave a speech with the topic "Victory in the Philippines and the Future of China," explaining that the victory in the Philippines naval battle is enough to ensure the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, which is also the dawn of China's liberation.

(Wonderful Programs)

### Symposium on Elderly Care Issues (1)

Following the symposium on childcare and education on September 28th, this newspaper held a symposium on elderly care issues at 4 PM on October 1st in the auditorium of the Chinese Morality Society to examine ways to improve charitable endeavors. Representatives from various elderly care organizations and charitable elders, including Zhu Zhiyao, Ding Fubao, Gao Zihui, Xu Qianlin, Ying Yongyu, Wu Naizhong, Zhang Mali, Lu Yingen, Ren Zhonghuan, Chen Jianmin, Wu Xiaohou, Ye Shouhai, Li Qiyun, Weng Tongshi, Tang Qixiang, Nie Xingbo, Fang Zijun, Yang Zhongyi, Ye Binghua, Shen Simin, and Wang Yuhua, totaling over forty people, attended. Mr. Huang Yingwan, director of the social services department of this newspaper, chaired the meeting. During the session, everyone freely expressed their opinions on the following issues. The key points are recorded below:

(1) The Significance of the Senior Citizens' Home Movement

Huang Yingwan: Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival. This newspaper is convening a symposium on elderly care issues at this time, gathering representatives from various elderly care organizations and charitable elders in one place. It embodies the hope for a full moon and long life, and "respecting the elderly in our own families, and then extending that respect to the elderly in other families" makes the discussion of elders' concerns by elders themselves all the more meaningful. At this extraordinary time, displaced elderly people are everywhere, and due to social changes, elderly care is in a precarious situation. Therefore, how to promote the senior citizens' home movement and relieve poor elderly people is our current task. We hope that all the elders will not consider themselves too old and will offer their guidance.

Yang Zhongyi: Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, when the moon is full and people are reunited. I deeply wish longevity and peace to all the elders and the elderly who are suffering.

Xu Qianlin: I believe that the senior citizens' home movement is the realization of Confucius's spirit of "universal love" and aims for universal harmony. Therefore, we ourselves should also promote the spirit of benevolence and righteousness and practice it ourselves, serving as a model for young people.

Wu Zai: I have been engaged in education for nearly fifty years and deeply understand the common ailment of Chinese society, which is selfishness and self-interest. Therefore, I hope that the elderly and the young will work together to eradicate such improper mentality.

Wang Huishan: The Chinese Morality Society was initially founded by a few of us old people, not for fame or profit, but to wholeheartedly help the poor and elderly, providing summer medical care and medicine to relieve the suffering of diseases. Now, the number of members is increasing day by day, and we hope that it can be popularized throughout the country to do more relief work for society, which is what we deeply hope for.

Jiang Danshu: Everyone will get old, and everyone should respect the elderly. Respecting the elderly today means that others will respect me when I am old. From infancy to youth, from youth to old age, this is the process of life. The elderly often contribute to society and humanity during their youth, and it is not inappropriate to be respected. Therefore, Confucius said, "The elderly should be comforted." So, the senior citizens' home movement is truly the highest expression of human morality.

(2) Current Status of Elderly Care Organizations

Huang Yingwan: I thank everyone for elaborating on the theoretical basis of the elderly care and respect for the elderly movements. Now, on behalf of the Nanshi Senior Citizens' Home, I will describe the actual situation of the elderly care movement.

Huang Yingwan (on behalf of the Senior Citizens' Home): The Nanshi Senior Citizens' Home is run by Catholics and has a history of over forty years. It currently houses over three hundred elderly men and women, the oldest being a certain old lady who is over ninety years old. The monthly expenses are at least 500,000 yuan. Fundraising, service, and other matters are all handled by over thirty nuns who are full of religious enthusiasm. Upholding the Catholic spirit of charity and benevolence, they dedicate their lives to elderly care, treating poor elderly people as if they were their own parents. All miscellaneous tasks such as sewing, bathing, washing, and cooking are performed by the "Mumu." Those who are sick are also cared for by the "Mumu." This spirit of "not fearing trouble" is truly admirable. Now, please have a representative from the Baoan Nursing Home report on the general situation of the home.

Wu Fansun: The Baoan Nursing Home is located on North Chengdu Road and has a history of seven years, housing over forty elderly people aged sixty to seventy. Due to financial constraints, only two meals are provided daily, one porridge and one rice. In their free time, they pass the time by chanting scriptures and fold paper money, with the proceeds used as pocket money.

Ding Fubao: Eating two meals a day is actually very healthy, especially for the elderly. There is nothing more suitable. And the best way for the elderly to pass the time is to teach them meditation, the tranquility and pleasure of which are truly higher than those of the elderly in wealthy families, and it is very conducive to longevity.

Wang Guoliang: Our home (the Disabled Nursing Home) was founded in the 28th year of the Republic of China, specifically to accommodate disabled refugees from the war zone and homeless elderly people. At that time, there were over 150 people. Now, due to a shortage of funds and difficulty in purchasing rice, only over 70 people can be accommodated, with the elderly accounting for a quarter of the total. In the past, the disabled and elderly engaged in simple handicrafts and rattan work as a way to pass the time and earn income. Now, in addition to eating and drinking, they pass the time by chanting scriptures.

Lu Yingen: Our home (the Xin Pu Yu Tang) is located on Guohuo Road in Nanshi and was established in the first year of the Republic of China, with a history of over thirty years. It occupies over eighty mu of land and has over five hundred rooms. Before the war, it accommodated as many as 3,500 people, but now there are only over 900 people, including about 150 elderly people. All departments are staffed by the "Mumu," and two meals are served daily, one porridge and one rice.

Huang Yingwan: The elderly care business in Shanghai, whether in terms of quantity or quality, is not as good as that in foreign countries. Now, please have Mr. Zhao Ximing report on his insights from his daily inspections.

Zhao Ximing: There are twelve elderly care organizations in Shanghai: (1) Five are run by charitable organizations, such as the Charity Federation, Baoan Hall, and Disabled Institute, etc. Among them, there are inconveniences such as low and humid living quarters and mixed male and female accommodations, which need to be improved. (2) Five are run by Christian organizations, totaling thirty-five people. Life is too difficult and it is not easy to maintain them, which is worrying. (3) Two are run by Catholic organizations, which have the largest scope and the best results, and there are many things that can be learned from and referenced. The above three types each have their advantages and disadvantages. In particular, the various religious organizations, based on the virtue of God's compassion for people, promote the senior citizens' home movement, and their spirit is especially admirable. Based on the above observations, I would like to put forward the following three suggestions: (1) It is hoped that the five homes run by charitable organizations, such as the Charity Federation, Baoan Hall, and Disabled Institute, etc., will be unified and divided into three homes for men, women, and the disabled, so that strength can be concentrated and management can be facilitated. (2) It is hoped that the five Christian homes will be merged into one and managed by the Salvation Army to expand their scope. (3) It is hoped that the two Catholic homes will also be divided into men, women, and the disabled, and that religious concepts will be instilled more. In addition, there is one point that deserves special mention, which is that a nursing home on Qipu Road is on the verge of dissolution due to financial constraints. Seeing dozens of homeless elderly people being forced to wander the streets and fall into ditches, in front of this vivid picture of displaced people, I dare to make a special appeal, praying that society will lend a helping hand.

Huang Jingwan: I thank Mr. Zhao for expressing his emotional argument. Now, please have Mr. Zhu Zhiyao speak.

Zhu Zhiyao: Young people respecting and caring for the elderly, creating a temporary trend, is indeed a good thing for society. However, the elderly themselves cannot rely on their age and sell their seniority. Although they are old, their hearts cannot be old. Seeking help from others is not as good as seeking help from oneself. Therefore, the elderly should uphold the mandate of Heaven and work hard, engage in productive activities, and cultivate a self-respecting personality. Only then can they use their spare energy to help those who are suffering and become a model for the elderly. (To be continued)

### Proposals for Improving the Former French Concession's Water and Electricity Supply

— He Kan

When the French possessed governing power in Shanghai, their administration policy was nothing more than clever plundering and forceful seizure, exploiting the assets of the Chinese people to supply their extravagant waste and remit back to their homeland for their government's squandering. Their police enforcement measures were the most obvious example of this policy. The Chinese people, at all times and in all places, were subjected to their exploitation, oppression, and insults. Whenever there was a dispute between two parties that could not be resolved privately and they were brought to the police station, the French police and their Chinese collaborators, acting as henchmen, would arbitrarily inflict insults and impose fines on both parties. Their aim was to display their authority and extort money. The rights and wrongs of the Chinese people were not their concern. After the Shanghai Incident occurred, the Baojia system arose in response, and the self-defense system was established accordingly. The French police officers even used this as a pretext to increase taxes and fines. When household registration certificates were issued, they forcibly sold envelopes for eight yuan per household. When citizen certificates were issued, they also forcibly sold envelopes for two yuan per set. If people forgot to bring their citizen certificates and were caught, they were fined ten yuan each time. Fines for being late or leaving early for self-defense duties were even more numerous and impossible to list. After Mayor Chen took over the French Concession, he repeatedly ordered that police officers were not allowed to arbitrarily punish the public, and this trend began to change. However, the illegal profits obtained by the French authorities were already incalculable. Now that the concession has been recovered, the electric light and tram companies are still in the hands of French merchants, which is our country's greatest mistake. What they lose in political exploitation is compensated for by the exploitation of these companies, and their methods are numerous, such as:

(1) Repeated increases in electricity meter deposits: - When the Central Reserve Certificates were first used, the company, citing the change in the monetary system, forced users to pay deposits that were more than 110 times the original amount. Recently, they have increased the amount again, which is equivalent to more than twenty times the amount after the first increase. For example, if the original deposit was three yuan, it was first increased to sixty yuan, and then to fourteen hundred yuan. If prices inevitably increase in the future, it is unknown to what extent this deposit will increase. The threat to the public is by no means insignificant.

(2) Repeated increases in water, electricity, and tram fares: - The price increases for water, electricity, and trams have been repeatedly imposed on the people by command, directly stimulating prices and increasing the burden on the people. Indirectly, it devalues the legal tender and undermines the government's efforts and painstaking efforts to maintain the management of legal tender prices. Water and electricity prices increase every one or two months, and it is unknown whether they have been formally approved by the municipal authorities. The tram company dared to increase its fares by one and a half times without the permission of our government. Although the authorities issued a formal warning, they ignored it. After seven days, although the original price was restored, the illegal overcharges were equivalent to the company's entire income for seven and a half days, which has not been returned to the public. The extent to which they treat our officials and people in this way is unbearable.

(3) Using the slogan of conserving water and electricity to abuse penalties. Due to the shortage of coal, the authorities have restricted the public from wasting water and electricity, so the Yongdian usage has been reduced again and again, and there are penalties to punish excessive users. However, the bureau uses this opportunity to extort money, reducing the limits at any time and arbitrarily. Sometimes, posting a small advertisement in the newspaper is used as proof of announcing the reduction of the limit. In fact, many residents are illiterate or have not had time to read it, so they do not know that the limit has been reduced again. They use it within the limit, thinking that they can avoid fines, but at the end of the month, the penalty slips arrive, ranging from hundreds to thousands of yuan. In this time of difficult living, the monthly expenses are already stretched, and suddenly a large amount of fines comes unexpectedly, beyond the residents' expectations and budget. How can our people bear this after suffering from so many problems? Reading Mr. Tu's article in the "Society Service" column of the Xinwen Bao on October 30, which questions the French water and electricity company, we can see that the company intends to deceive users. Even if you go to the company to inquire, they are not willing to tell you the new limits, and a fine notice is suddenly sent. This is actually the company using the old tricks of the police to pressure the people, specializing in fraud and exploitation as their expertise. Their intentions are despicable, dangerous, and truly unspeakable. The water and electricity company is a people's organization. I don't know who authorized them to punish users. The use of these fines is also unknown to the five mouths of people. With this company's means of deliberately trapping people and forcibly seizing their wealth, the monthly fines are probably tens of millions of gold. If our people's fat and grease are all exploited by greedy French people, it is simply terrible. Considering the above three points, the French water and electricity company's bad deeds have been obvious for a long time. All those who live in the former French Concession have suffered from poisoning. Our government is determined to liberate the people from the clutches of European imperialism, so we must eliminate evil completely. How can we tolerate harboring evil-doers and allowing them to intensify their bullying and exploitation?

It is predicted that the fundamental solution is to take it back and operate it ourselves as the best option:

(1) The municipal government should prepare funds to take it back and hand it over to a public utility for operation.

(2) The citizens should raise funds to take it back and operate it as a limited liability company. The citizens have been deeply hurt by the company's exploitation. If the government properly guides and leads, raising funds should not be difficult. Although the company is called a French company, when it was established, it may have misappropriated municipal revenue. This should be thoroughly investigated. If evidence is obtained, then there is no need for redemption payments, and it should be unconditionally returned by the French. As for the French staff of the company, except for a few giants who should be replaced, the rest can be temporarily accommodated or transferred to other positions before the end of the war, so that their lives are not lost, to show the generosity of our government.

As for the short-term solutions, they are also important. Taking it back takes time, and before it is taken back, the company's bad habits must be improved. The proposed solutions are as follows:

(1) The new water and electricity limits and the newly adjusted prices should be clearly printed in a prominent place on the previous month's bill so that users can be prepared in advance to avoid being fined.

(2) If the water and electricity are lost due to damage to the Yongdian lines, resulting in exceeding the limit, and it is not the user's fault, then the company shall not punish.

(3) Fines should not be used. It is best to deduct the amount exceeded this month from the next month. For example, if the limit is 15 degrees and the limit is exceeded by 2 degrees this month, then only 13 degrees are allowed to be used next month. If you do not comply, give a serious warning for the first and second time, and then fine for the third time. The increase in water and electricity limits is a good intention to prevent waste, not to deliberately exploit the people's wealth. It is clear that the company's abuse of power for personal gain, specializing in clever extortion and harm to users, is not the authorities' original intention.

(4) If users have special reasons and need to use more water and electricity, they can discuss with the company and allow them to transfer the usage and pay it back in the following months.

(5) For users who have been punished in the past, because of the company's improper procedures and the previous bad methods, users should be allowed to repay the excessive degrees and then return the fines taken.

(6) Fines should not be enjoyed by the company, but should be handed over to the municipal government for the use of citizens' welfare.

(7) Except for new ones, no additional deposits should be allowed for water and electricity meters. For example, the deposit previously paid was actually equal to half the value of the meter. The first increase has exceeded the actual price of the meter, which means that the meter already belongs to the user. How can the deposit be increased by taking advantage of the price increase? The seven short-term solutions above are considered to be very good and fair. Users and the company are not enemies. The company's survival depends on users. For the company's sake, it should not specialize in making things difficult for users and inciting ill will. In these difficult times, although a few nouveau riche are well-off, the general public is suffering unspeakably. The company cannot bully users with its superior position to increase their pain. It is hoped that the wise authorities will negotiate with the company as soon as possible, first implement the short-term solutions to reassure the people, and then discuss the methods of taking it back in the long term. If the company is stubborn and refuses to comply, the authorities should force the takeover or impose a heavy surtax so that it cannot operate. Sovereignty is in our hands, how can we allow it to be abandoned?

### Review of the Japanese Shunyo-kai Art Exhibition

— Qian Shoutie

Several dozen of the finest pieces from the 24th Shunyo-kai Exhibition, represented by Mr. Kiyoshi Mizutani, are being displayed at the Continental Gallery, from October 30th to November 4th. The works include ink paintings and oil paintings, and my overall assessment is that they possess a sense of antiquity, simplicity, clarity, and vigor. For example, Mr. Hoan Kosugi's "Early Spring" is vividly lifelike, and his brushwork is between the ethereal and the excellent. Mr. Kazumasa Nakagawa's "Meaning of Poems from Manyoshu" is pleasingly rustic. The light colors of Mr. Shohachi Kimura and Mr. Tsuruzo Ishii each have their own charm. The oil paintings of Mr. Shiro Kayama, Mr. Genichiro Adachi, Mr. Tojiro Maeda, Mr. Kakujiro Yokobori, and Mr. Tokusaburo Kobayashi are all strong hands in Shunyo-kai, each with their own merits. Mr. Kanenosuke Oka's "Three-Colored Lotus" has elegant colors and is quite decorative, as wonderful as Southern Song Dynasty sketches. Mr. Kiyoshi Mizutani is a strong general in Shunyo-kai and the beloved son-in-law of Mr. Hoan. He has traveled to India for several years and has visited our country many times. He is honest and sincere, and his oil paintings have clear and elegant colors and broad brushstrokes, comparable to Matisse. The style of Shunyo-kai is enough to promote the Eastern spirit, and even Western painters lament that their brushes cannot reach it. The members of Shunyo-kai are all my old friends, and seeing their paintings is like meeting them in person, so I am happy to write this.

### Pity the Elderly in Their Twilight Years, Generously Help the Home for the Aged

Goal: Five Million Yuan

Period: November 10th

Collection Point: Social Services Department of this Newspaper

The Shanghai Home for the Aged, due to the high cost of everything, finds each day like a year. They have initiated a fundraising campaign and have received the support of ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life, who sympathize with their plight and cultivate both blessings and virtues, generously giving and donating, which is admirable. However, the amount is still far from the fundraising goal. It is hoped that enthusiastic people in society will think of their hunger and cold, pity their difficulties, and rise up to help with benevolence, rely on righteous millet to continue their lives, extend our care from our own elders to the elders of others, promote the virtue of filial piety, and help those in difficulty during difficult times, and they will surely receive auspicious rewards.

Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Wu Jianjia, stating: "I am writing to inform you that I had some daily necessities stored with my classmate Mr. Yao last year. Later, because I needed them, I asked him to return the original items, but Mr. Yao said that they had already been used. After repeated negotiations, there was no result. Now, thanks to the mediation of Mr. Zhong Delin, Mr. Yao has compensated me with 16,000 yuan, which is only worth two-tenths of the price of the goods. However, Mr. Zhong has worked hard and compensated 4,000 yuan, so this matter can be concluded. Therefore, I will donate the national currency of 4,000 yuan to the Home for the Aged to create blessings for Mr. Zhong, and I hope that this letter will be published in the newspaper."
