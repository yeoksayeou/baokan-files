### Don't Be a Mediator, Seek Truth from Facts

"Don't be a mediator, seek truth from facts," this was the motto of Mr. Huang Yizhou of Dinghai when he presided over the Jiangyin Nanqing Academy. Mr. Huang presided over the Nanqing Academy for fifteen years during the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty. He was indignant at the corruption of the late Qing Dynasty politics and the social figures who competed for vanity and were accustomed to perfunctoriness. Therefore, he put forward these eight characters as his motto to guide the students in the way of learning and being a human being. The Nanqing Academy mostly cultivated scholars of solid learning, which can be said to be greatly influenced by these eight characters.

The greatest significance of these eight characters lies in the thorough discernment of right and wrong. To call right what is right, and wrong what is wrong, there must be no slightest pretense between right and wrong, no slightest cancellation, and no way to reconcile them. To learn and be a human being, one must distinguish between right and wrong. Once right and wrong are clear, follow what is right and abandon what is wrong. One must have a clear attitude, avoid ambiguity, and avoid following the crowd. Only in this way can one be worthy of being a great man, and only in this way can one be worthy of oneself, society, and the country.

Seeking truth from facts is to prove right and wrong by grounding oneself in reality. It is the most scientific method. First, facts speak louder than eloquence. Anything that can be proven by facts can be called true right or true wrong. Anything that is not proven by facts, no matter how it manifests itself on the surface, is ultimately not true right or wrong. Second, seeking truth from facts is purely an intellectual exercise, without the intrusion of emotion or action, and even less subject to emotional constraints. Anything that is judged by reason is the true truth, while anything that is determined by emotion or influenced by emotion is not the true truth. Therefore, seeking truth from facts pays the most attention to reason and the most attention to factual proof.

After clearly distinguishing right from wrong, one must judge right from wrong. There is no way to be neutral or reconcile between right and wrong. Therefore, the result of judgment is only one right and one wrong. The meaning of not being a mediator is to ask people to clearly state the true right and wrong. One must have the courage to not offend others, be unconcerned, and be unafraid of being corrupted by wealth, moved by poverty, or subdued by force. Mediators often obscure right and wrong intentionally or unintentionally in order to please others. Those who do not mediate believe that right and wrong are supreme, so in any environment, they are able to disregard everything and boldly judge.

Using reason to seek true right and wrong proven by facts, and clearly judging true right and wrong, is the most scientific modern spirit. This spirit is even more needed in China's current situation. The biggest problem of China's national society is, first, the lack of clarity in right and wrong, and second, that no one dares to speak out even when there is true right and wrong. The consequence of unclear right and wrong is to encourage people to do evil. Having true right and wrong but no one daring to speak out is the same as having no true right and wrong, resulting in the loss of people's courage to do good. How can such a society be stable or progress? We, who are engaged in the news industry, hear and see more than ordinary people, especially in recent years, seeing the atmosphere of unclear right and wrong throughout the country, leading to the unrest of the country and society, and even more causing harm to the future survival of the nation. For example, if there is no right and wrong in politics, corruption will run rampant, honest officials will be suppressed, or officials who are not competent will not be dismissed immediately, but will be transferred, forming a corrupt situation. If there is no right and wrong in society, speculation and profit-seeking will flock to it, and public welfare undertakings will hesitate to move forward, forming a situation where only profit matters. It is true that "what the heart thinks is dangerous, one must speak out." Therefore, we do not avoid taboos and repeatedly speak out directly, hoping to create a social atmosphere so that ordinary people can distinguish between right and wrong, and hoping that the whole country can "seek truth from facts and not be mediators."

### Arakan Mountain Battlefront: Japanese-Indian Forces Advance in the Rain, Imphal Plain Situation Critically Imminent

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 11th – The eastern Burma-India border war zone has entered the rainy season. On the 300-kilometer Arakan mountain area battlefield, torrential rains have been falling for days. The Japanese-Indian allied forces are braving the rain to fiercely attack enemy troops, and their courage is becoming more and more excited. The rainy season in Manipur is about a month earlier than Arakan and a month later than the Fougong valley. From the "Roof of the World" Himalayas, the northeast seasonal winds all head towards the low-pressure area in the west. Therefore, Assam experiences strong westerly winds starting in April, causing the sudden rains in the northeast. This kind of thunderstorm landscape often strikes the Arakan mountains. The average annual rainfall in Manipur is 60 hours, and the average annual rainfall in Shillong, 150 kilometers west of Imphal, is 520 hours, making it the rainiest place in the world. Therefore, this place is commonly known as the world of rain. In Imphal, it rains for about 10 days in mid-April, about 15 days in mid-May, and about 20 days in mid-June, with the number of rainy days gradually increasing. The Manipur basin is turning into a pond, and the temperature is also rising with the rainy season. The Japanese-Indian allied forces are launching an offensive to defeat the British and American forces and annihilate them in this natural environment.

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 11th – A unit of the Japanese army advanced to the north of Imphal. After occupying the Mapa Highland, which is 15 kilometers from Imphal, its main force launched an attack on the enemy's fortified position on the Melbourne Highland, 5 kilometers southwest of Mapa. Because the Japanese army has completely occupied the highland, it can suppress Imphal from a commanding position.

Central News Agency, Somewhere on the Burma Front, 11th – The decisive battle on the Imphal Plain is becoming increasingly imminent. To counter the pressure from the Japanese army in the northern mountainous area, the enemy forces have formed a final defensive line northeast of Palel, and continue to fight hard with the area around Palel as the focus of defense in the south. Palel is a key fortress in the southeast of the Imphal Plain, relying on the Logtak Lake wetland as a military stronghold. Therefore, the battle for Palel is actually the key to deciding the Imphal battle. After the Japanese army recaptured the Imphal fortress, they continued to advance and attack Kipgen, Haimol, Dimapur and other places, gradually approaching Palel. On the 6th, they engaged in fierce battles with the enemy forces defending Palel. The vanguard of the Japanese army has approached Palel 10 kilometers, and the sound of artillery fire from both armies is deafening. The enemy inside and outside Palel has concentrated the 20th Division, with a main force of about 12,000 people and artillery units, in Palel. Also, on the Palel airfield side, the enemy forces are attempting a final resistance. The Japanese army is increasing pressure on the highway between Kohima and Imphal, directly threatening Imphal. Also, advancing from the Mairambung Highland, 10 kilometers north, they reached the eastern highlands of the Imphal Plain, and launched a fierce mountain battle. Also, the Japanese army's northbound troops continue to occupy Jakaema and Damdim, and are now approaching the gateway to the Imphal Plain. The war on the Imphal Plain, which has an area of only 1,000 square kilometers, is now imminent.

### Assam-Bengal Railway Seriously Threatened

Central News Agency, Indian Front, 11th – After the Japanese-Indian allied forces captured Kohima, the Assam-Bengal Railway was seriously threatened. This railway is the connection between Assam and Bengal provinces and is a major artery in northeastern India. If the railway is cut off, Assam and Bengal provinces will be in a state of paralysis. The railway starts from Chittagong in Bengal Province, passes through the Khasi and Jaintia hills of Assam Province, and then goes northeast, passing through the southern part of the Brahmaputra basin, to Sadiya. The total length of the line is about 1,000 meters. Before and after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it actively transported troops and ammunition. In addition to the branch line from Badarpur to Silchar, there are several other branch lines connecting the main areas. The most important ones are the following three lines: one is the branch line from Lumding to Gauhati, which connects the Assam-Bengal Railway and the East Indian Bengal Railway, a major trunk line in the western region, connecting Bengal and Assam. One is the branch line from Tinsukia to Dibrugarh. Dibrugarh is located along the Brahmaputra River and is the seat of the county government. It is a key hub for water and land transportation, connecting the trunk line of the Assam-Bengal Railway via the Brahmaputra River. One is the branch line from Tinsukia to Ledo. This branch line was laid to develop the coal mines and oil fields in northern Assam. This area has always been a commercial center between Assam and Burma, and the commercial route between Assam and China also passes through this line.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 11th – According to a telegram from a certain place in Burma, a Japanese dive bomber squadron supported ground troops on the morning of the 8th and attacked the enemy's stronghold in Shuganu, 50 kilometers south of Imphal. Braving intense ground fire, they bombed the village, and the surrounding enemy troops were annihilated. Completely destroyed it with bombs.

### Ambassador Tsubokami Returns to Japan, Talks About the Current Situation in Thailand

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 11th – The Japanese Ambassador to Thailand, Tsubokami, returned to Japan by plane from Bangkok on the 11th. He talked about the current situation in Thailand as follows: The alliance between Japan and Thailand is becoming increasingly close in military, political, economic, and cultural aspects, in order to defeat Britain and the United States as soon as possible. Thailand is also encountering various wartime difficulties, so it is making every effort to overcome them and strive to implement the war objectives. Regarding domestic industries, in addition to producing raw cotton, textile and spinning factories have also been established. Currently, Japan and Thailand have jointly established organizational factories. In order to establish a self-sufficiency system, they are practicing thrift and consumption. Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram and his wife personally devote themselves to the New Life Movement and directly guide the people. The military training department for youth and teenagers, which was originally under the Ministry of Education, has now been independently established as the military preparatory training department to actively enhance combat effectiveness. The Prime Minister's wife plans to gather graduates of women's normal schools and women's volunteer troops on June 24, the Thai Revolution Memorial Day, to organize a women's army. Her busyness is no less than that of Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram. Also, major cities in Thailand have now begun to evacuate the population, hoping to ensure the perfection of air defense facilities.

Eastern Front War Situation

Central News Agency, Berlin, 11th – Havas Agency reports that fierce battles are raging in the southern section of the Eastern Front in recent days.

### Decisive Battle to Liberate India Unfolds on the Manipur Plain

A powerful Japanese unit carrying the rear area supply lines of Imphal and Kohima successively approached the lines on the 29th, threatening the enemy's Fourth Army Corps and controlling Imphal from the rear, establishing a general offensive posture. On the night of the 28th, led by the vanguard that cut off the Kohima road in Mikhruma, powerful units of the Japanese army occupied a location 30 kilometers north of Imphal on the 29th. Furthermore, according to the enemy headquarters communique, Japanese army units have destroyed the bridges on the Imphal-Kohima road, and the enemy's rear supply lines have been completely trampled by various Japanese army units. The situation for the general attack on Imphal is nearing completion.

Battle Reaches Climax

The Japanese army, cooperating with the Indian National Army, has only entered the jungles of India for a dozen days, and the battle has already entered its climax. A major change in the war situation is about to occur, and a new battlefield will unfold on the land of India, which has been dominated by Britain for three hundred years. Due to meticulous and well-planned actions, the Japanese army's strategy has broken through the enemy's lines deployed on various fronts in Burma, and has now transformed into an offensive to liberate India. In this great battle on the Manipur Plain, there is the Japanese army advancing into India, the Indian National Army returning to their homeland, and on the other hand, the British Fourth Army Corps stubbornly defending the Manipur Plain, as well as Indian soldiers who are being forcibly killed by their compatriots at gunpoint. The depth and complexity of the situation is unparalleled on any front and is attracting worldwide attention.

India, which once shone brightly in the history of Eastern civilization but is now groaning under three centuries of British domination, is about to undergo a radical change with this battle as a turning point. The shaking and chaos of the enemy's lines is a sign of the arrival of this momentous day. The opposition and friction between the British and American commanders, Chongqing's disappointment and unease, and the anxiety of the British government and the Indian people about the future of India - these are the current situations wandering in the mire of opposition.

Enemy Strategy Fails

The split in the enemy's three headquarters: "Recapturing Burma" was the most important strategy of the enemy since the Quebec Conference. As Nimitz said, "To destroy Japan's production capacity, we must bomb the Japanese mainland." Therefore, no matter what, we must "ensure air bases along the South China coast," and the prerequisite is to recapture Burma. Since the appointment of Mountbatten, the plan agreed upon at the Cairo Conference was to concentrate large forces around Burma and use an outer-line encirclement attack to break through the Japanese defense on the inner line, reopen the Ledo Road, and complete the strategic trunk line linking India, Burma, and Chongqing. But everything is hopeless, and the situation has completely reversed. The forces of the various armies have been completely defeated by the elite Japanese forces in the last two months.

Not only that, after this month, it will be the six-month rainy season that everything cannot but be abandoned. The enemy's opposition and division erupted against this background. From the perspective of the US headquarters, Mountbatten is unreliable, and Chongqing is also criticizing the British army's poor performance. The three headquarters have lost the feeling of mutual trust, which is the culmination of the Japanese army's operation this time.

The meeting between Mountbatten and Stilwell (March 15) was an attempt to reach a temporary compromise. But four days after the meeting, the Japanese army entered India, and the situation took a sharp turn for the worse. The reality that the British army feared most finally arrived.

India's Fate: The enemy is also completely divided over the Japanese army's advance into India. Regarding the location of this great battle, Imphal, the American government is turning a blind eye and saying it is worthless. But that is obviously a show of strength. The US military cannot but know that the only supply route for the air force stationed in Chongqing is under serious threat. But the problem is the distrust of the Allied British army, and the British's annoyance is very profound. Auchinleck bluntly said, "The British army does not intend to abandon the Imphal Plain to the Japanese army. In fact, the situation is not that serious." But the opportunity for the great battle is fast approaching. But the surrender of Indian soldiers under British surveillance, the great turmoil in India, the Indian Central Legislative Assembly's rejection of the Indian government's tax increase proposal, and Governor-General Wavell's statement that "the Indian people are not engaged in the defense of India," but the Indian people have long seen through what the real strategy is for defending India.

The Trend of World Justice

In this situation, we cannot help but think of Prime Minister Tojo's historic speech on March 22: "The purpose of the Empire is to defeat the enemy forces and completely entrust India to the Indians. The land of the motherland India, which the National Army is attacking, will immediately be placed under the administration of the Provisional Government of Free India... The independence of India is the will of the entire Asia and the destination of world justice." The imminent general offensive on Imphal, the great battle on the Manipur Plain, contains various historical elements and is about to unfold. (Sho: From the Western Asahi Shimbun, April 3)

### Temporary Cotton Cloth Rationing: Purchase Permits to Be Issued First, Sales to Commence on a Scheduled Date Once Issued

Regarding the current progress of the temporary cotton cloth rationing in this city, the following was learned from the Business Control Committee: The "Purchase Permits" have been printed by the Business Control Committee and handed over to the Cloth Dealers' Guild for distribution to the designated merchant shops, which will affix secret code stamps and submit them to the committee. The Business Control Committee has already sent more than 3 million stamped "Purchase Permits" to the municipal government with a detailed list attached, awaiting notification from the municipal government regarding the total population of the city before making any additions or subtractions. These "Purchase Permits" will be distributed to citizens by the municipal government through various districts, which will take some time. It is now decided to distribute the "Purchase Permits" first, and sales will commence on a scheduled date once they are issued. The types of cloth to be sold to the designated merchant shops will be determined by the Executive Yuan. Sales will first be made from the approved retained quantity of each merchant shop, followed by the allocation of loose cloth. The Cloth Dealers' Guild is currently dispatching personnel to each designated merchant to investigate and compile a list of various types of cloth within their retained quantity, calculating the dimensions and prices, in order to prevent irregularities and ensure order.

Correction to Detailed Rules for Purchasing Cotton Cloth

In the book "Regulations on Material Control," published last month by the Materials Control Deliberation Committee, on page 44, under the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cotton, in Article 13, Section 2, there was originally no statement that cotton cloth of 5 packages or less per household would not be temporarily purchased. To avoid misunderstandings, the Business Control Committee specially telegraphed the Materials Control Deliberation Committee to promptly investigate the case and announce a correction. It is now learned that the Materials Control Deliberation Committee has replied that it has complied and announced the correction.

### Old Zhabei Branch Detects Fraudulent Impersonation of Military Personnel; Hopes Citizens Will Behave Themselves

Recently, some petty criminals in this city have been impersonating military personnel, falsely claiming to be from the "5th Army of the Chinese Autonomous Army," forging a large number of commission certificates, insignias, military and civilian official certificates, etc., openly selling them, and engaging in deception within the concession, causing disturbances to public order and serious harm. After receiving a secret report, the First Police Bureau ordered all branches to conduct a strict investigation. The Old Zhabei Branch has successively solved two cases within a few days. The details of the fraud are recorded below:

Details of the Investigation

Hong Hanbin, the director of the Old Zhabei Branch, received a secret report on the 5th of this month that someone was impersonating military personnel in room 402 of the Nanjing Hotel, flaunting weapons, and selling forged commission certificates, etc. He immediately ordered Liu Junjie, the director of the judicial section, to dispatch detectives to the aforementioned location. They arrested six people, including Lin Zhongmin, who falsely claimed to be the "Commander of the 13th Division of the 5th Army of the Chinese Autonomous Army," and Liu Pengju, who falsely claimed to be the "Chief of Staff," and confiscated two Browning pistols, two Mauser pistols (both without licenses), as well as a large number of forged commission certificates, insignias, official certificates, cards, and other items. They were taken to the bureau and interrogated. The six criminals confessed to the aforementioned matters. They also confessed that the so-called "5th Army of the Chinese Autonomous Army" was led by Jing Zhong as "Army Commander" and Wang Datong as "Commander-in-Chief," who specialized in deception and defrauding the ignorant. The bureau detained them and continued the investigation. On the previous day (10th), based on reports from informants, more than ten people, including Qiu Hongjun, who falsely claimed to be the "Commander of the 1st Division of the Sino-Russian Autonomous 5th Army," were arrested in rooms 525 of the Oriental Hotel and rooms 203 and 22 of the Jue Lu Hotel. At the same time, a large number of forged seals, commission certificates, and war official certificates were confiscated in the rooms. After strict interrogation, they also confessed to the aforementioned matters. However, they did not know the criminals arrested in the previous case. The bureau believes that there must be other accomplices lurking within the concession, so they are continuing the investigation. Once the investigation is completed, they will be handed over to the relevant authorities for strict punishment according to the law.

The police authorities are very concerned about this type of case and hope that citizens will behave themselves and not have unrealistic ideas. At the same time, if any of the above-mentioned situations are discovered, they should report to the police station for arrest and prosecution in order to maintain local security.

The Beixing Basketball Team, champion of North China, showed its skills at the China Youth the other day. Due to lighting and field conditions, Beixing's performance was abnormal, resulting in a disastrous defeat of 21 to 30 against the Xiqing team. However, their rapid passing, active teamwork, and tacit coordination were highly praised by the audience and readers. Tonight at 8:30 PM, the team will still be at the same location playing against the Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory basketball team. The referees will be Hong Lv and Yu Julu. Beixing should be able to restore its normal state tonight. Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory has risen in Shanghai this year, with Kong Guangyi, Qu Xilin, Zhang Liangxiong, and Wu Chengzhang, making it a strong team. The meeting with Beixing is truly a match of evenly matched opponents, which is sure to be a stimulating and tense situation.

### Matches, Soap, and Candles to Be Investigated in Ten Groups; Those Found Hoarding Will Be Severely Punished According to Law

Regarding the hoarding of essential goods related to people's livelihoods, such as matches, soap, and candles, the Materials Investigation Committee has prepared a table and instructed the respective trade associations to distribute it to their member merchants and factories to report their inventory and production status. After the reporting period expires, the committee will review the results. Although the reports have been enthusiastic, it is inevitable that some will conceal information or provide false reports. Therefore, the committee convened a full committee meeting and began implementing the investigation a few days ago. It is learned that the committee will divide all investigators into ten groups to investigate the three materials of matches, soap, and candles, assigning them to conduct thorough investigations in designated areas. If it is found that there are false declarations or failures to declare, they will be severely punished according to the law, and the hoarded goods will be confiscated and forfeited to the government.

### Ministry of Finance to Review Status of Increase in Capital of Financial Firms

In order to strengthen financial institutions in various regions, the Ministry of Finance issued a notice last year to all banks and financial firms that if their capital was insufficient, they should promptly increase their discount rate, which was to end by the end of March of this year. It is learned that since the ministry issued the notice, financial firms in various regions have been ordered to implement it and have successively submitted it to the ministry for review. The financial firms in various regions have now completed the procedures, and the ministry will begin the review. It is also heard that the results of this capital increase are quite good, with most financial firms having completed the capital increase. A small number of them have slight problems, and the ministry plans to adopt reasonable measures to thoroughly adjust them.

### Shanghai Special City Finance Bureau Proclamation

Upon investigation, various municipal taxes should be reported and paid by taxpayers themselves according to regulations. In the past, due to environmental constraints, personnel were dispatched to collect them. Now that municipal administration has entered a normal track, thorough rectification should be carried out to emphasize tax administration. It is hereby decided that starting from the summer of the 33rd year (1944), all merchants in the city should pay various taxes and levies to the tax collection office in their respective districts, following the verified amount payable, and report and pay within the deadline. No additional staff will be dispatched to collect taxes outside to prevent malfeasance. In addition to issuing separate orders and dispatching personnel to review at any time, this announcement is issued for the information of all merchants, who should understand the personal interests involved and truthfully report and pay on time, without colluding to underreport or delay, which would result in penalties. This is a crucial matter. This proclamation.
