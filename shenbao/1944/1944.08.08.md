### Rice Storage Registration: Many are Waiting to See

Regarding the matter of restoring rice rationing for households, according to news reports in recent days, the responsible authorities are actively working on it, and it is expected to be implemented in the shortest possible time. It is believed that most citizens are closely watching this issue, especially the poor who have no food for the next day, who feel it is even more urgent. However, another issue, which is also very important, especially for middle and upper-class citizens, is the public notice of rice storage registration issued by the city's goods distribution office.

On the 4th of this month, the goods distribution office announced that anyone in the city area who, as of August 5th, had stored rice exceeding the prescribed quantity should apply for registration with the First Section of the office before noon on August 10th. The so-called "prescribed quantity" is: rice shops, businesses, factories, entertainment venues, and other organizations storing more than 12.5 shi (石) of rice; citizen families storing more than 6 dou (斗) of rice per person. The announcement also stated that the purpose of the registration was to clarify the amount of rice stored in the city, and there was no intention of confiscation or forced purchase. However, those who refuse to apply for registration or make false registrations within the specified period will be confiscated once discovered.

According to the announcement, the authorities have clearly stated the purpose of the rice storage registration and have no intention of confiscation or forced purchase. Therefore, citizens who have stored rice exceeding the prescribed quantity should promptly apply for registration within the deadline and should not wait and see, missing the registration time. Registration must be absolutely honest, and there must be no concealment or falsehood, because after registering in accordance with the regulations, there will be no loss of confiscation or forced purchase. This is the order of the authorities, and to maintain credibility, they will absolutely not deceive the citizens. On the contrary, if citizens have stored rice exceeding the prescribed quantity and conceal it without registration, or if they register but make false statements, this is a violation of the law. Once discovered, the authorities will confiscate it to maintain their authority. At this time, the citizens' loss is their own fault and cannot be avoided. The registration date ends before noon on August 10th. Time is pressing, so don't hesitate and wait and see, or you will regret it.

Furthermore, the purpose of rice storage registration is to clarify the amount of rice stored in the city. To put it more thoroughly, it is to deal with unscrupulous merchants who hoard goods, fundamentally eliminate the factors of monopoly and speculation, and fluctuate rice prices. In the past, citizens who accumulated excessive grain to avoid high prices must register truthfully, because after holding the registration certificate, they will obtain legal status for their stored rice and be protected. If the purpose of storing rice is to hoard and speculate, and they conceal it hypocritically or underreport, they deserve to be confiscated if discovered. If the rice price stabilizes due to panic selling, it will also be beneficial to the public.

Secondly, from various observations, at this time of year when the old crop is running out and the new crop is not yet in, the authorities have a solid and sufficient guarantee to restore household rice rationing, so that it will not be delayed or reduced in quantity. In addition to two sheng (升) of rice per person per ten days, the quantity of flour and miscellaneous grains will also be increased to gradually achieve equality between rationing and consumption. This is what the citizens hope for and what the authorities are striving to achieve.

Finally, what we cannot help but say is that it is heard that police, civil servants, industrial workers, etc., have special rations in addition to ordinary rations. We sympathize with those who have meager salaries and heavy responsibilities, who enjoy special rations. However, teachers and staff in educational institutions, who also have meager salaries and heavy responsibilities, should enjoy the same treatment as the above-mentioned personnel. Therefore, we advocate that teachers and staff in public and private universities, middle schools, and elementary schools also have special rations. We hope that the education authorities and the rationing authorities will discuss this as soon as possible to make it a reality.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) – In response to the landing operations on the islands of Omiya and Tinian, the enemy forces again attacked the sea east of the Ogasawara Islands with a mobile unit on the morning of the 4th. On the 4th and 5th, they bombed Chichijima and Iwo Jima. On the 5th, they shelled Chichijima with several cruisers and destroyers. About one month has passed since the previous attack on the Ogasawara Islands on July 3rd and 4th. The Japanese garrison fought bravely and persistently, upholding their belief in victory, and repeatedly inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. The detailed battle situation is as follows: Iwo Jima was bombed by enemy aircraft three times on the 4th. In the first wave, 13 out of 77 enemy aircraft were shot down. In the second wave, 12 out of 70 aircraft were shot down. In the third wave, 3 out of 50 aircraft were shot down, totaling 28 enemy aircraft shot down. On the 5th, three enemy B-24 aircraft attacked in two waves, one in the first wave and two in the second wave. On the 4th, 22 enemy aircraft attacked Chichijima, and 3 were shot down.

### Japanese Army Completes Iron Wall Defense Line in the Bay of Bengal; Aerial Combat Unfolds in the Andaman Islands

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) – The Andaman and Nicobar Islands, located on the front line of the Indian Ocean, are a strategic line for defending the Greater East Asia resource zone and a major fortress for controlling the sea and air in the Bay of Bengal. The terrain stretches 1,700 kilometers from the southern tip of Myanmar to the northern tip of Sumatra, linking more than 200 small islands, each less than 1,000 square kilometers. Port Blair, the capital of South Andaman Island, has become the city it is today after several developments. Except for Great Nicobar Island, the other islands are dense forests, and there are very few places where simple land bases can be built. Under these geographical conditions, compared with other fortresses, it has the special characteristics of a modern fortress line in terms of ease of defense. Now, judging from the enemy's counter-offensive, Port Blair in South Andaman Island is about 2,000 miles from Ceylon and about 2,000 kilometers from Calcutta, which, calculated at the speed of 25 miles per hour for enemy warships, can be reached in just one day. Therefore, in the vast sea of ​​the Bay of Bengal, the Japanese army is rushing to form an iron-like defensive wall, and to use it as a base for active naval and air forces. Even if the enemy can successfully land on any small island in the archipelago, it will be difficult to establish an air force base on the island due to the aforementioned geographical conditions. It will be even more difficult to attack other islands. Any attempt to invade is like trying to catch a dragon with a short rope and only serve as food for the Japanese naval and air forces. Currently, bombing and reconnaissance battles are repeatedly unfolding near the Bay of Bengal. The enemy has tried to reconnoiter or bomb the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, while the Japanese army has repeatedly bombed Calcutta, Madras, and Colombo. When the Indian Ocean theater heats up, the Bay of Bengal, a modern maritime fortress line, will boast the most solid base, but it will soon become a base for the Japanese army to capture India. The climate in the Indian Ocean is rainy from May to November and dry from December to May. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are purely of the Indian Ocean climate, which is very comfortable. During the dry and rainy seasons, the temperature is hottest at noon, but it is not as sultry as on the continent, and the nights are unusually cool, requiring only a blanket to sleep. There is almost no rain during the dry season, and the sea water in the Indian Ocean is like oil, and the weather does not change much. However, during the rainy season, it is not surprising to have rain all day long, and the tides in the Indian Ocean are very large, and the turbulent waves fill the sky, which greatly hinders combat and the maneuverability of warships. The total population of the Andaman Islands is about 120,000, most of whom are Indians, about 118,000, and Burmese only account for 2,000. Because the area was once a penal colony, most of the residents are convicts and their descendants. There are more men than women, at a ratio of about three to one. In the past, under British rule, the residents suffered all kinds of penal colony life, and because they were eroded by the British ideas of liberalism and individualism, they lost their original character, so they lacked the communal spirit of mutual aid. The area has always been the largest prison in East Asia. The comrades of the Indian independence movement who were previously imprisoned were all sent back to mainland India by the British army one week before the Japanese army entered in March of the 17th year of Showa (1942 in the Republican calendar). The residents are ignorant and do not care much about the issue of Indian independence. After the Japanese army entered, the military government tried its best to promote the way of the king to these pure residents with Jewish ideas. Under the guidance of the military government, the Andaman branch of the Indian Independence League was organized. After several reorganizations and expansions, the league established the Indian Independence Volunteer Army in December of the 18th year (1943). Its development has been extremely rapid. Under these circumstances, the 120,000 residents are gradually sweeping away the Anglo-Saxon interest in

Indian independence
The movement, as a member of Greater East Asia, cooperates with the Japanese army to fight together.

The upper part of this type of trench can be used to throw hand grenades, and machine guns are also placed on the side of the base, which has many fire prevention effects. If you climb straight up with a ladder, there is a danger of being shot by machine guns. If you break through this position, there is a broken bank several meters high, which is difficult to destroy even with mountain guns. There are machine gun positions everywhere on the cliff, and beyond this, there are traffic trenches, and if you go forward, there are artillery positions. Behind this, there are many traps. Crossing the traps leads to the main base, which is equipped with stack guns and internal land mines. This type of compound position utilizes effective fire prevention, and the connection between the various positions is convenient, forming a complete fire network.

### The Implementation Committee for Rural Construction Can Be Established Soon: The National Government Officially Promulgates the Organizational Regulations Yesterday

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) The highest level of the National Defense Conference previously passed the Outline for Rural Construction Plan, and at the same time resolved to establish an Implementation Committee for Rural Construction under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, so that it can practically take charge of promoting rural construction work, in order to cultivate the people's livelihood, establish the foundation of democratic governance, achieve the goal of increasing production, and complete the war. After this decision, the relevant authorities are now actively preparing for the establishment of the committee, and it is expected to be established in the short term. At the same time, the entire nation, both government and public, deeply expects the future work and development of the committee. Since our country is founded on agriculture, the past weakness and decline, although caused by many reasons, the most important one is the bankruptcy of the rural economy. Therefore, the national economy has almost fallen into a state of paralysis. Thus, on New Year's Day this year, the Chairman specially announced the three major policy focuses, and further pointed out that increasing production is the most important of the policy focuses this year. The organization of this committee to be responsible for rural construction is indeed a practical work to fulfill the goal of increasing production. It is hoped that the future work of the committee will be as follows:

Work promotion should avoid bureaucratization. Rural construction is not an easy task. Those in charge should go deep into the rural areas, integrate with the villagers, understand the villagers' psychology, and recognize the current situation of the rural areas. Otherwise, it would be like scratching an itch from outside the boot, and it would be difficult to achieve practical results. Rural construction should pay special attention to organizing farmers, leading farmers, and educating farmers, so that they can understand the current national situation, stimulate their patriotism, and increase their confidence in rural construction. Rural construction work should strive to guide farmers' farming techniques, disseminate improved varieties of crops, improve agricultural tools, and carry out other rural welfare undertakings. In addition, attention should be paid to rural health facilities and smooth transportation. In this way, rural construction work will surely achieve satisfactory results, which will be of great benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) Kikuchi Kan, president of Daiei Film Company, recently discussed the film "Beacon Fire Shanghai," which is being produced by the company: ""Beacon Fire Shanghai"" is a massive production made in cooperation with China Film Company. Its production budget exceeds 2 million yuan, which is the highest production cost in the history of Japanese film. Because its purpose is to realize Sino-Japanese cultural exchange, not for profit, we only seek the production of fine works, and we plan to premiere it in all cities of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere within this year.

### Warsaw Offensive and Defensive War: Heavy Losses for Soviet Army, German Army Retakes Mito City on Northern Route

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) German News Agency: When the Soviet Third Tank Army suffered a defeat east of Warsaw, the German army destroyed 189 enemy heavy tanks. In addition, the Soviet army lost 3,000 prisoners of war and about 6,000 dead. Although the Soviet army continued to put pressure on the Tatar Pass, the German army conducted successful offensive and defensive battles in other parts of the Carpathian foothills. West of the upper reaches of the Vistula River, the Soviet army concentrated four elite tank armies. Soviet reconnaissance teams advanced to the northeast of Warsaw, but they were all blocked by the German army. On the Vistula River front, the Soviet army repeatedly attempted to expand its bridgehead northeast of Warsaw, but none succeeded. South of Warsaw, a German tank army advanced despite enemy resistance and made considerable progress. The German defense east of Warsaw also achieved great success. In the areas east of Ostrów Mazowiecka, northeast of Suwałki, and west of Vilkaviškis, the Soviet army continued to exert strong pressure, but after several hours of fierce fighting, the main German line remained unmoved. In the area north of Memel, the Soviet army exerted all its strength in an attempt to force a breakthrough into East Prussia. After several hours of fierce fighting, it pushed back the German line by several kilometers, but failed to break through the German line. The German army in the Mito area in the northern section of the Eastern Front also achieved success, and Mito City has been retaken from the Soviet army. Southwest of Lake Peipus, the German army moved its positions backward on a wide front. The Soviet army pressed the retreating German army closely, but was repelled.

### British Ships on Thames River Hit by Meteor Missiles, Residents Evacuated from London

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) A dispatch from London states: German meteor missiles continued to fly towards London and southern England on the night of the 5th, causing many damages and casualties. One missile hit a ship in the Thames River, causing numerous deaths and injuries.

### Venice Palace at Risk of Being Bombed

Venice, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) Reuters: The magnificent palaces along the Grand Canal in Venice are at risk of being bombed by enemy planes. Most of the city's houses already have cracks because the city's houses are built on the loose soil of the lagoon, which is easily shaken. Therefore, the speed of steamships in the city must not exceed six miles to reduce wave impact. When enemy planes bombed Mestre and Marghera, the heavy air pressure caused damage to some houses in Venice. Some of the city's luxurious houses are owned by foreigners, such as American movie star Mary Pickford and Hutton, the heir to American tycoon Woolworth, who both have villas built here. British Foreign Secretary Eden was also born here, and the house where he was born is still owned by the Eden family.

### Hitler's Speech: Insisting on the Belief in Victory, Nazi Party Members Pledge Loyalty to the Leader

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) Reuters: A reporter from the German News Agency reported on the situation of the meeting of political and party leaders in various German districts this afternoon: General Elba, as the spokesperson for the German Nazi Party leader, first expressed his joy, saying that after the riot of July 20, it was a pleasure to see the leader's health and energy fully restored, and to see the similarities. Then Hitler himself addressed the leaders of various districts to discuss the background of the riot. Hitler pointed out that since the Nazi Party came to power, such traitors have been secretly obstructing the country's ambitious plans for struggle. Although their numbers are small, their power cannot be ignored, and they have repeatedly tried to resist the measures taken by the government. Most of the troops have nothing to do with the above-mentioned traitors, and some have even turned against them. I believe that this riot revealed the inside story of resistance, purged the responsible traitors, and improved the burden on my shoulders. Is this also fate? Now is not the time to draw a hasty conclusion. In the future, the world may understand that this shameful riot will promote favorable results for the future of Germany. Hitler also said: We are fighting against foreign enemies, and I will never retreat. No matter what, we will severely attack them. But I believe that there must be a sense of absolute security and a belief in the loyal cooperation of the rear. This is the condition for the current decision. Now the lazy people have been eliminated. Otherwise, the measures for the full mobilization of the people of our country today cannot be completed. We will use all the military strength and power of the country to overcome all difficulties. Hitler concluded by saying that heaven allows me to survive so that I can continue to fight. I deeply feel that Germany needs someone like me who will never surrender in any situation. I believe that I will forever hold high the banner of loyalty. No matter what blows fate gives me, I will stand firm. Since July 20, I have gained a belief I have never had in my life. Therefore, I will experience this battle and achieve final victory. After Hitler's speech, all the party leaders present expressed their trust in the leader and unwavering loyalty.

### American Troops in Brittany Advance to Laval, German Troops on the Orne Shorten Their Lines

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) German News Agency: The enemy's center of gravity for operations in northern France is still on the western flank. On the Brittany Peninsula, American tank units have penetrated into the interior. Because the German defenders are concentrated in the most important areas, there have been no major operations. Another American unit, consisting of several tank and motorized infantry divisions, launched an attack east and southeast from the salient south of Avranches, and arrived at Mayenne and Laval (southwest of Rennes) on Saturday evening. Details of the war there are not yet available. The advance of the British invasion area is also on both flanks. The pressure is particularly strong south of Presles, and its breakthrough attempts were all blocked by German grenadiers. Yesterday afternoon, active fighting took place on both sides of the Caen-Falaise highway, in Thury-Harcourt, Fontaine-le-Pin, and north of Saint-Martin-de-Fontenay. After a brief artillery fire, the British army launched a fierce offensive, apparently hoping that the development of the situation on the western flank would force the German command to reduce the German lines in the Caen area. East of the Orne River, the Canadian army, after four days of inactivity, launched an offensive with tanks and infantry between Fourrière and Thury-la-Campagne on Sunday morning, but was repelled. West of the Orne River, the German army's disengagement operation has been completed according to plan, and the German units that were temporarily cut off from contact have advanced to the German lines. West of the Vire River and near Pois, the American army, under the cover of tank and motorized vehicles, broke through several gaps after a strong artillery preparation, but all of them have been closed.

### The Mission of the New Japanese Cabinet

The Significance of the New Cabinet

The first significance of the establishment of the new cabinet lies in the reorganization and completion of the leadership lineup in the Army and Navy, which are at the core of the Greater East Asia War. That is, by establishing a four-headed system of Chief of the General Staff, Chief of the Naval General Staff, Minister of the Army, and Minister of the Navy, pouring all efforts into command and military administration to complete the Greater East Asia War.

After the loss of Saipan Island and the war situation facing a new stage, the supreme command's planning and the military administration's assistance each sought suitable candidates, so that the substantial content could be enriched, and all power could be centralized. This was the first step in the new plan, with the incumbent Navy Minister Nomura and the beloved Chief of Staff Umezu in the previous cabinet. This plan now awaits the establishment of the new cabinet to be realized.

The second significance of the establishment of the new cabinet lies in renewing the people's hearts and uniting the total strength of the nation. The future war situation is expected to become more intense. If the enemy's so-called air raids on the mainland become more and more fierce, then even women and children in the rear cannot help but use their own strength to reduce the falling ammunition. Materials will become more and more scarce, and in this difficulty and lack, all the people, in order to exert their total strength, willingly endure, and advance the war with full hope. This depends largely on the influence of the personality of the leaders. This is the second significance of the new cabinet. The bright and accommodating state of the Koiso-Yonai cooperative cabinet will earn the people's comprehensive trust.

The Nature of the New Cabinet

From the above, the nature of the new cabinet is naturally clear. That is, first, it is a powerful decisive battle cabinet that wants to move towards the completion of the Greater East Asia War with a more strengthened lineup. Second, in order to achieve this decisive battle political approach—that is, to truly give play to the total strength of the people—it is necessary to use harmony to make all the people actively stand up to carry out the war.

The Cabinet's Composition to Fulfill the Above Mission

First, the great order to form a cabinet was conferred on Generals Koiso and Yonai. The two men worked together to lead the machine and form a cooperative cabinet. Second, as the Pacific decisive battle intensifies, General Yonai, who allowed the entire navy to exert the true navy spirit, returned to active service to serve as Navy Minister.

The combination of General Koiso's courage and strategy, and General Yonai's bright and open-minded character, is expected to be the most senior war-fighters who are both stern and gentle.

The Basic Trends of the New Cabinet's Policies

The new cabinet will contribute all its political and economic power to the war in the decisive battle period. Therefore, the new cabinet's policies will first be directed towards strengthening the domestic decisive battle posture and increasing production by leaps and bounds. The true meaning of the total national uprising is that the people of all classes automatically participate in the war with vigorous fighting spirit. Merely manufacturing poor products that are unusable in quantity is not a rise in productivity. The new cabinet's production guidance should first focus on this keynote, which is the first step in the rise of production.

The New Cabinet's Mission

The new cabinet is a powerful cabinet that is doing everything possible to promote the war. The war situation has now approached the time to defeat the Anglo-American counteroffensive. Taking advantage of this counter-offensive opportunity, in order to make it most effective, a national war posture is necessary. Therefore, it is the first mission of the powerful cabinet to promote powerful policies.

The fundamental way to carry out this powerful policy is to first cultivate harmony. In a true total war, the full strength of every citizen is required. This kind of big war cannot be won without putting the entire nation to death. It is the second mission to be frank with the people, to communicate with the people, and to fight the war together.

When taking the above attitude, the government can absolutely trust the people. And the people can also have the confidence to trust the government. If a powerful policy is promoted on this confidence, it can be smoothly completed without friction or obstacles. At that time, opponents can sometimes be punished severely, and emergency measures such as the decisive battle can be strengthened. In order to increase productivity, new production patterns that adapt to the new situation can be boldly adopted. In short, it is the third mission to carry out bold and powerful policies with confidence.

However, the war situation will not immediately improve with the establishment of the new cabinet. Politicians ultimately rely on the people's individual support. Now is the time for all the people to deepen their awareness of being happy to endure the future difficulties on the basis of a correct understanding.

### A Review of the Tojo Cabinet

The Tojo Cabinet was in power for two years and nine months. It initiated the war against Britain and the United States shortly after its formation, and thus remained a cabinet dedicated to waging war. During this period, Prime Minister Tojo focused primarily on strengthening the close relationship between state affairs and the high command, establishing a national unity system based on the perspective of total war, and consolidating the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

The Tojo Cabinet was established on October 18, 1941, the most tense period of the crisis between Japan and the United States. The war broke out less than two months later, making it the most significant event during the Tojo Cabinet's term. The relationship between the government and the Imperial Rule Assistance Association became inseparable due to the personal connections of Abe and Tojo. During this period, a large number of officials were dismissed to reform the officialdom. With the unfolding of the war, the Ministry of Greater East Asia was established to manage foreign affairs in the Greater East Asia war zone. After the establishment of the Ministry of Greater East Asia, Foreign Minister Togo resigned immediately. Ambassador Tani, stationed in China, assumed the position of Foreign Minister, and Aoki, economic advisor to the National Government, became Minister of Greater East Asia.

Subsequently, in April of 1943, the cabinet was reorganized in response to the sentiment within the 81st Diet. Minister of State Ando became Home Minister. Representatives Yamazaki and Oma of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association joined the cabinet. Vice President Goto of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association joined the cabinet. Ambassador Shigemitsu, stationed in China, became Foreign Minister. Foreign Minister Tani, Home Minister Yuzawa, and Agriculture Minister Ino resigned. Prime Minister Tojo not only inspected within the country, but also visited various countries and regions within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to personally observe the situation. A dramatic development in the China policy was the establishment of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty. Furthermore, in the autumn of 1943, the Greater East Asia Conference was held in Tokyo to build the Greater East Asia.

However, the enemy's counterattacks intensified, and the ferocity of the war demanded the establishment of a domestic war footing. Therefore, on September 21, 1943, the Tojo Cabinet decided on the Essentials of National Policy Management in a cabinet meeting, attempting to establish a domestic war footing.

The long-shelved Ministry of Munitions was finally established, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Planning Board were abolished. Related to this, the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications were merged into the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry was renamed the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. Along with this reform of the central administrative structure, Minister of State Teiichi Suzuki and Minister of Communications Terashima resigned. Commerce Minister Kishi, as Minister of State, also served as Vice-Minister of Commerce and Industry. Prime Minister Tojo concurrently held the position of Minister of Munitions, and Mr. Ginjiro Fujiwara became Minister of State. Local administrative organizations were also reorganized in conjunction with the restructuring of the central administrative organizations, and local administrative councils were established. The governors of each prefecture assumed the position of head of the local administrative association. Thus, administrative organizations that had been difficult to handle in the past were also given a fresh look. The cabinet advisory system and the administrative inspection system were also implemented during this period. Minister of State Fujiwara and others repeatedly conducted administrative inspections to enhance munitions production.

By February 1944, the cabinet further decided on the Essentials of Extraordinary Measures, and began the combat deployment of the entire nation. Student mobilization was implemented on a large scale, and non-essential projects were quickly reorganized. All possible measures to concentrate the nation's strength in national defense, food production, munitions production, and labor mobilization were implemented in succession. It is worth mentioning that General Tojo of the Army assumed the position of Chief of the General Staff, and Admiral Shimada of the Navy assumed the position of Chief of the Naval General Staff. General Tojo had previously served as Prime Minister concurrently with the Minister of the Army and Minister of Munitions, and had no time to rest. In order to promote the unification of state affairs and the high command, he assumed the position of Chief of the General Staff.

However, the war had developed into a serious situation unprecedented in Japan's three thousand years of history. The fierce fighting by Japanese troops and compatriots on Saipan Island was intensifying. From late June of this year, the cabinet, in order to reflect the deepening war situation, and to strengthen the seriousness of the war, based on the need to concentrate all national strength to forcefully carry out the war, undertook this mass resignation.

On one hand, it will guide the immediate deployment of personnel after the issuance of the alarm to engage in air defense combat, and prepare the necessary air defense equipment. On the other hand, it will urge companies, banks, factories, and other special buildings that have not yet established special air defense units to quickly set up such air defense units to complete air defense self-defense facilities.

### Materials Distribution Office - Commences Rice Stock Registration - Director Feng Explains Key Points of Registration

The city's Materials Distribution Office is conducting a registration aimed at understanding the amount of rice stored in Shanghai, as well as the rice stocks held by citizens exceeding limits. After notifying the public, the registration will be carried out from the 6th to the 10th of this month. Director Feng You of the office gave the following speech yesterday:

Establishing a Strong Distribution System

It is said that food is the people's heaven. The volatility of the Shanghai citizen's food supply is a serious threat to their livelihood and runs contrary to the government's initial intent to stabilize rice prices and reduce price increases. The establishment of this office is aimed at streamlining the Shanghai materials distribution system and establishing a strong distribution system. The purpose of this city-wide rice stock registration is to understand the amount of rice stored in the city.

Rice Stock Registration is Not Confiscation

How much rice is actually stored in Shanghai? Is there illegal hoarding or monopolization of the food supply? It is difficult to obtain accurate statistics without conducting a widespread registration. Therefore, we urgently hope that citizens will cooperate fully, report the true situation in their storage facilities, and not underreport or overreport. This measure is purely for the legitimate needs of protecting citizens. Rice stocks that do not exceed the regulations do not need to be registered. We ask that citizens with limited rice stocks apply for registration based on the actual quantity of rice stored in the city. Absolutely no rice will be confiscated or purchased. Shanghai's rice stocks are extremely abundant and not lacking. New grain has already begun to arrive, and the future of food supply is quite optimistic. In fact, there is no need to purchase or confiscate rice.

Underreporting Will Be Severely Punished

In order to effectively protect the legitimate supply of rice to the people, anyone who underreports in an attempt to conceal and hoard will be severely punished upon verification and will not be tolerated. For thoroughness, allied military police and the Japanese consulate, as well as the city's Economic Security Office, will be mobilized to conduct a thorough investigation to prevent evasion and inaccurate registration. All citizens, for their own benefit, must not test the law and face severe punishment.

### Ambassador Tani Flies to Shanghai

His Excellency Tani Masayuki, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Allied Nations stationed in China, has come to Shanghai on official business and plans to inspect and liaise with various parties in the city. It is reported that he arrived at the airport at 3:30 PM yesterday (7th) on a special flight from Beijing. Accompanying Ambassador Tani were Secretary Shimizu and Secretary Terasaki.

### Second Phase of Immunization Begins

The second phase of immunization by the Municipal Health Bureau has commenced on August 1st as scheduled. The format of the immunization certificate has been slightly changed from the first phase. There is no red horizontal line on the front, and the back is printed with a red number. This new certificate will be issued on the spot by each immunization team upon completion of the immunization. In order to be thorough, the bureau has sent immunization teams to various main streets, stations, and wharves to administer cholera vaccinations and issue immunization certificates. They will also closely inspect the validity of immunization certificates held by citizens at any time. The certificate is valid for three months. Citizens are advised to pay attention. Expired certificates are invalid, so they should apply to the immunization teams for re-immunization.

### Police Bureau Unifies Police Organization

The Shanghai Police Bureau has completed the unification of all municipal administrations, and the organization of the police has been unified. The numbers of the police officers of the former Second Police Bureau have been reorganized based on the numbers of the police officers of the former First Police Bureau, and orders have been issued. All female search officers in the bureau have also been uniformly renamed female police officers, and they will be trained in medical and police knowledge in the future. The police brigade of the former Second Police Bureau has been renamed the Security Police General Brigade, with Wang Tingdong appointed as the commander. The water patrol team has been renamed the Water Police General Brigade, with Zhang Dianjia appointed as the commander. Tian Hongsheng has been appointed as the director of the police training center branch, and Shi Wenfeng has been appointed as the director of the police hospital branch. The police officers of the former Second Police Bureau have also been adjusted and assigned to various branch offices.

### Donation for Warplanes - 10 Million Yuan - Three Representatives Heading to Beijing Today

The city's Donation for Warplanes Campaign has been progressing smoothly since its launch. All sectors of society have been responding enthusiastically and sparing no effort. It is reported that the standing committee of the campaign has decided to present 10 million yuan in the first installment and has selected Standing Committee Members Liu Diyu, Yang Shanzhang, Jian Wu, and Zhu Dingsan as representatives to present the donation in Beijing today.

### Strict Crackdown on Unhygienic Street Vendors - The Municipal Health Bureau

The Municipal Health Bureau is concerned about public health and the health of citizens. In the past, during the summer season, when epidemics were rampant, all infectious diseases tended to spread. The transmission of summer diseases is mostly caused by unclean food. Therefore, it was announced that street vendors selling sour plum juice, jelly, and cut fruits along the road would be subject to crackdown. It is now reported that personnel have been dispatched to strictly enforce the crackdown in order to protect the health of citizens. At the same time, it is hoped that citizens will respect themselves and not buy these foods to avoid contracting diseases.

### Health Bureau to Relocate on Schedule

The Municipal Health Bureau, having been ordered to relocate to the former site of the First District Health Office at 223 Hankou Road on the 11th of this month, is actively preparing for the relocation. All incoming and outgoing documents and license applications will be processed at the new location from that date.

### News of Zhao, Chief Prosecutor of the District Prosecutor's Office, Resigning Is Inaccurate

Since Director Zheng Zongtang took office at the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office, he has been sparing no effort in reforming the judiciary. The Ministry of Justice has placed great emphasis on him. However, there have been rumors that Chief Prosecutor Zhao has requested to resign due to fatigue. The reporter visited Mr. Zhao to inquire about this matter. Mr. Zhao said, "I was ordered to serve as the Director of the Prosecutor's Office. I am now working diligently to reform the internal affairs and have not expressed my intention to resign. As for whether I will be transferred, that is up to my superiors, which I cannot predict. However, I am determined to adhere to the principle of not being idle and not resigning. As long as I am in office, I will do my best every day." This means that the rumors are definitely not true.

### Regulations for Exchanging Joint Reserve Bank Notes

In order to promote the exchange of materials between the North and the South, streamline and develop industrial and commercial trade, and prosper the market, the Central Reserve Bank entered into an agreement with the North China United Reserve Bank three months ago to implement the circulation of Huazhong and North China, with the exchange rate of 100 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes to 18 yuan of Joint Reserve Bank notes. It designated 11 banks, including the Sino-Japanese Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Jin Cheng Bank, the Continental Bank, and the Yokohama Specie Bank, as exchange banks. Since its implementation, trade between the North and the South has become increasingly prosperous. It is now reported that in order to facilitate merchants and travelers, travelers from Shanghai going to North China or North China travelers coming to Shanghai who need Central Reserve Bank notes and Joint Reserve Bank notes can go to the Foreign Exchange Department of the bank to exchange Central Reserve Bank notes at the rate of 100 yuan to 18 yuan. However, it is stipulated that travelers holding first-class or second-class tickets can only exchange up to 500 yuan to prevent fraud. This will be implemented from this month.

### Police Sub-Bureau Judiciary Directors Hold Joint Meeting - Director Li Explains Tasks of Judicial Police

Since the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau was formally established after the merger of the former First and Second Police Bureaus, the city's police facilities have been actively strengthened. In order to improve the city's judicial police system and increase administrative efficiency, the Judicial Affairs Office of the Municipal Police Bureau held a meeting of the judicial directors of all sub-bureaus at 2:00 PM yesterday in the conference hall on the 8th floor of the Municipal Police Bureau on Fuzhou Road. More than 60 judicial section chiefs from the urban area and Nanshi Zhabei sub-bureaus attended the meeting, and Director Li Shiyu, Deputy Director Ying Xian Erlang, and section chiefs from the crime prevention section provided guidance.

Director's Address

Director Li gave a sincere address, stating: "After the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau unified the city's police administration, the first judicial director meeting was held in Xichang. I hope that you will all abide by the will of Director Jian and work together sincerely, regardless of your background, and strive to improve in accordance with the new regulations and the established policies of this office. Secondly, you should learn humbly and improve your skills in a timely manner. In particular, colleagues from the former Second Bureau may be less familiar with the documents, formats, and investigative procedures of this office, but as long as you make an effort, you will definitely gain something. Finally, for the protection of human rights, our task as judicial police is to safeguard the dignity of national laws, protect the lives and property of the people, and ensure personal freedom. We can prevent harm before it occurs and reduce harm to the nation, society, or individuals. This is the most reasonable way to progress. I hope that you will all practice what you preach and carry out your duties earnestly. In the case of incidents that have already occurred, you must seek the truth and discover the evidence. You must never resort to torture to extract confessions. If anyone uses violence or abusive language against litigants, they will be severely punished for corruption. As for the detention of defendants, it must also be in accordance with the provisions of criminal procedure and should not be abused in order to comply with Director Chen's sincere intention to love the country and its people."

### Shanghai's Credit Situation Is Loosening

Shanghai's credit situation has recently shown signs of easing, and investment projects are showing a prosperous trend. Financial institutions have improved compared to before, with increases in deposits and loans. The previous tense financial situation is gradually easing. It is reported that the main reasons for this are: (1) The Central Reserve Bank refuses to provide interbank lending to those who are not in need or are hoarding goods, but provides as much lending as possible to those in legitimate need or investing in production projects. (2) The Central Reserve Bank’s Gold and Foreign Exchange Department allows ten listed stocks to be used as deposit reserves, so the cash positions of various banks and money shops are eased. (3) Banks and money shops are allowed by the authorities to provide stock collateral loans. (4) Agricultural products are being transported to Shanghai one after another, and funds from the interior are flowing back.

### Reader's Educational Aid News - Allied Friends Sympathize with Students Out of School - French Tram Company Donates Large Sum

We began grading the high school exam papers yesterday, and most of them were above standard, especially some of the papers were particularly excellent. Therefore, we deeply feel that these talented and hardworking young people are the backbone of the nation and society in the future. If they drop out of school due to poverty, wouldn't it be a waste of great talent? Whose loss is this? Thinking of this, we cannot help but feel uneasy and lost. Fortunately, all sectors of society are enthusiastically donating money to urge us to promote the educational aid movement so that the outstanding young people we see do not drop out of school. However, we hope that impoverished students with above-standard grades can all continue their education. At the same time, we believe that this is also the common hope of enthusiastic people in society. You donate money, we donate our time, and everyone promotes the educational aid movement. We are extremely grateful.

Mr. Wu Songqun has raised 100,000 yuan donated by the French Tram Company. Although Mr. Wu's words carry great weight, the company's authorities are allied French people. This shows their great sympathy for our cause of nurturing talent, which is very touching. Even foreign merchants have such enthusiasm, so merchants with successful businesses should not lag behind. Why not donate some money?

Donations for Educational Aid - Enthusiastic Response

Wang Xingchang Niqihao says: "We are located at 807 Nanjing Road. Due to recent business expansion, our shoe department will open on August 8th. In addition to the bargain prices for the first seven days, in order to support the educational aid fund of both newspapers, we will hold a donation for educational aid for one month. We will extract 5% of the total business revenue and donate it to the Shenxin newspapers' educational aid fund. We hope that all sectors of society will participate enthusiastically and support this righteous cause together. Once the [unclear] is full, we will present the accumulated amount. However, new businesses are opening every day in Shanghai. If everyone can respond, it will be like accumulating sand into a tower and gathering fur into a robe. Then tens of thousands of impoverished students will not drop out of school."

### Enemy American Generals in Chongqing Expose Contemptuous Attitude: Information Director Matsudaira Issues Statement

Reported by the Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy, at 2:30 PM yesterday (7th), the regular press conference was held on the 8th floor of the Shanghai Bund on Nanjing Road. Information Director Matsudaira, accompanied by his advisor and consul, arrived promptly. Director Matsudaira delivered a speech on the latest international situation and the economic situation in the city, lasting an hour and a half. The following is a transcript of Director Matsudaira's speech:

The contempt of the enemy Americans for the Chongqing army has aroused discontent among the lower ranks in Chongqing. Recently, a lower-ranking officer of the Chinese Expeditionary Force in India deserted from the interior and returned to the embrace of peace. According to his statements, he spoke extensively about the enemy Americans' contempt for the Chongqing army. This clearly shows the enemy's disdain for Asians and their attitude towards East Asia, which is self-evident. It is known that the Chongqing-派遣ed駐印軍, initially aimed to avoid British and American contempt, subjected the soldiers to strict examinations. In addition to rigorous testing, recruits had to be tall, at least five feet six inches, to qualify. Furthermore, their education level had to be at least equivalent to a complete primary school education. However, even after such rigorous testing, the駐印軍 in India still faced constant contempt from the British and American armies, who consistently assigned them the most difficult tasks. Consequently, lower-ranking officers and graduates of the Chongqing駐印軍 opposed the British and American armies' poor attitude more and more. To prevent dissatisfaction among the Chongqing lower-ranking officers, the British and Americans proposed sending British and American officers to directly command the Chongqing army, to avoid friction and dissatisfaction with the Chongqing officers. This proposal specifically mentioned the ancestral homeland. The British, Americans, and Canadians all agreed, but the Chongqing officers vehemently opposed it. The Chongqing government's idea was that Americans would be in charge of division commanders, while the lower-level regimental commanders would be Chongqing officers. This principle had already been acknowledged by Song Ziwen in the United States. However, Jiang Jieshi, witnessing the opposition from his subordinates, officers, and Whampoa Military Academy graduates to American command, concealed Song Ziwen's acknowledgement in the United States, finding the situation difficult. Initially, he also opposed it. It began in July when American General Stilwell visited Chongqing and discussed the matter extensively with Jiang. As a result, Jiang conceded. According to recent news, this international division has already set off from the border and is heading to the Ninth War Area. This seemingly contradictory international division, harboring different dreams, is bound to repeat past mistakes and will not achieve good results.

### J. Zhan's Preface

— Chen Huang

The "Post-Refugee Group" painted by Mr. Jiang Zhaohe, hosted by Mr. Li Si, Mr. Wang Shishi Tuan, and Mr. Chen Bin Yu, is being publicly exhibited in China Garden. I was honored to be invited to the preview and had the opportunity to examine it thoroughly, and I am very satisfied. This painting by Jiang Zhaohe deeply embodies the "Responding to objects by depicting their forms, conveying and transferring their appearances" as described in Xie He's Six Canons of Painting. Moreover, he employs a mixed and broken style, making it particularly outstanding. In my opinion, modern figure sketching: Huang Yingpiao understood the principles of "bone method using brush, managing composition." Now, having seen Mr. Jiang's work and considering them together, all six canons are included. Regarding painting styles, Huang Shen's style is like flying white, Gao Fenghan's outlines are like engraving, and Jiang Zhaohe's embellishments are like cursive seal script. As for the merits of the works, the readers can judge for themselves, which I dare not comment on. In my free time, I have read the history. During the reign of Emperor Shenzong of the Song Dynasty, there was a great drought, and famine was rampant. At that time, Wang Anshi was in power and implemented the New Policies, "collecting taxes harshly, northeastern refugees, every time the wind and sand rose, supporting each other on the roads, frail and suffering, without complete clothing, or eating wood fruits and grass roots, even wearing shackles, carrying tiles and boards, constantly being apprehended by officials." Zheng Xia, Supervisor of Anshangmen, painted what he saw as "Refugee Map," falsely claiming it was to contend for favors, and secretly delivered it to the emperor. Emperor Shenzong repeatedly reviewed it, sighed several times, and could not sleep, so he temporarily suspended the New Policies. Now, Zheng Xia's paintings are not passed down, but the sufferings still exist, and they are even amplified. The sorrowful sight is the same as in ancient times. This is why it is named "Post-Refugee Map."

### Sports: Volleyball League Finals - Guangdong-Guangxi Wins Championship, Women's Green Team Wins Title

The Shanghai Volleyball League concluded yesterday with the finals held at the Zhongshen Sports Field starting at 5:15 PM. In the women's group, the Green team faced the champions of the Three Provinces League. In the first set, Three Provinces relied on Chen Meizhen's spikes to win the set. In the second set, Huang Xingfen and Huang Mingyuan of the Green team pursued relentlessly. The players of Three Provinces were overly nervous and lost three consecutive sets, giving the Green team the women's title. In the men's Group A final, Guangdong-Guangxi took the lead in the first set with a score of 21-15. Wang Deyuan of the White team made some fierce spikes, but Guangdong-Guangxi had strong stamina. As a result, Guangdong-Guangxi defeated the White team three to one and won the Group A title. The results are as follows:

Green team defeated Three Provinces, 19-121, 21-19, 21-18.

Guangdong-Guangxi defeated White team, 21-15, 21-17, 20-22, 21-16.

### Fuhua Cup Small Ball: Huatong Defeats Police and Security

The Fuhua Cup small ball competition held its second event yesterday. From 5:30 PM at the Donghua sports field, the first match was between Jishi and German Merchant. Jishi was helped by Gu Di Rong and Gao Xiu Qing, first broke through, but the German Merchants responded. Unfortunately Fuen misses. Jishi led in the first half. After switching sides, Jishi became even more rampant, Yu Zhen Yue scored a goal. Jishi defeated the German merchants two to zero. The second match was between Huatong and the Police and Security team. Huatong benefited from Fa Fanxiao's assistance, and the lineup was completely new. The main player of the Police and Security team, Yu Liming, was sick and weak, and their strength was greatly reduced, resulting in a one-sided game. Fa Fanxiao scored a goal in the first half, followed by Zhou Qilin and Fa Fanxiao scoring two consecutive goals. Huatong defeated the Police and Security team three to zero.

Huatong: Zheng Tongyu, Qin Biga, Zhou Qilin, Feng Shoupeng, Wu Jiabao, Meng Yangliang, Cao Qinfang, Fa Fanxiao, Li Songjun.

Police and Security: Tao Ziming, Wang Xisheng, Jiang Tongshan, Yu Lihua, Yuan Zhentian, Yin Qingbing, Zhang Dingxiang.

The Bu Cheng Cup small ball league had a total of seventeen games last weekend. In Group B, Shuangma, Zhiyou, and Yong'an all won victories. In Group A2, the fourth match saw Fuguan B and Huatong B win one after another. In Group A1, Zhenhua defeated Yaqing, the White team defeated Jiaoying, and Zao Kai defeated Jianhua with a score of five to two.

News released yesterday at 6:25 PM.

### Ensuring the Decisive Battle for Food

The investigation of food administration, led by Mahama, the head of the Great Hemp Administration, began on July 8th to 10th, starting with the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, and the Metropolitan Police Department to get a general understanding of the situation. The subjects of discussion included not only staple foods and fresh ingredients, but also a review of the supply and demand relationships for processed instruments and delicacies, as well as the supply of food for factory workers, schools, youth, infants, pregnant women, and other related issues. Virtually all issues related to food were covered. The following is an explanation of the issues raised:

(1) Review of Comprehensive Food Allocation

Today, the food problem in cities is that the supply of vegetables, fish, meat, eggs, and other destroyed items has been greatly reduced. The burden is concentrated on one type of staple food, leading to problems. Although the minimum allocation standard for staple foods has been decided, allocation standards for other fresh foods have not been set. If their supply continues to decrease, families will become dissatisfied.

Approximately how much food does the average Japanese person need to continue daily labor and maintain their weight? To date, research laboratories in various regions have published numerous reports from a thermic point of view, but the government itself has not conducted a scientific review to reach conclusions. As a result, the allocation of fresh foods lacks standards, despite the need for responsible administration.

This point was raised at the meeting, and it was noted that researching the minimum amount of food needed to maintain the weight and nutrition of the average Japanese factory worker, youth, and pregnant woman is quite difficult. Although a general goal has been decided, considering the current conditions of labor, transportation, and materials, perishable goods are difficult to obtain. Therefore, it is necessary to consider medical and nutritional conclusions and determine a course of action that takes into account the actual food supply. Those in power only need to ensure the supply of rice, vegetables, fish, meat, and all other foods. If they can declare absolute assurance, people can feel secure. Therefore, fresh foods should be managed by the state in the same way as staple foods such as rice and wheat.

(2) Allocation Standards for Staple Foods

Whether it is possible to use some method to revise the current allocation standard of 2.3 cups is also one of the topics for review.

The current allocation system is divided into more than a dozen categories, and there are special allocations for factories. The first point of discussion is to simplify all the complex allocation stages and revise the standard amount. The second point of discussion for revising the standard amount is to thoroughly eliminate double allocations and false population reports. Someone at the meeting suggested that if a considerable amount of food is freed up by thoroughly investigating false population reports, it should be reserved for years of famine. Regardless of the conclusion reached from the investigation of the standard amount issue, the government must guide the people and encourage them to endure hardship for a long time, conserve food, and continue the war.

(3) Rectification of False Population Reports

How many false population reports are there today? Some believe there are many, but others believe there are not many. However, it is necessary to rectify them to create a surplus. From the perspective of national ethics in wartime, this kind of situation cannot be tolerated.

The first source of false population reports is in the so-called canteens in business locations. The second is in factories, the third in allocation agencies, and the fourth is in false claims of various occupations. The method of investigation is based primarily on the national census implemented on February 12th of this year. The government also investigates the actual population receiving rice allocations on the same day nationwide. The false population reports in each prefecture are, of course, calculated here. Based on the results, fundamental measures to eliminate false population reports must be implemented immediately.

The method of eliminating false population reports is to conduct on-site investigations. In canteens, the movement of free laborers should be strictly investigated, and certificates should be issued for those who transfer out. Regarding the number of false reports in factories, the Metropolitan Police Department also conducted on-site investigations last year and found tens of thousands of false reports. Since then, the actual number of male and female workers has been investigated every three times, and the investigation of transfers has been intensified. The investigation of long-term absentees has gradually reduced the number of false reports. However, investigating large factories and managing factories is actually quite difficult. Officials and civilians should establish a joint inspection committee to take on this responsibility. Regarding allocation agencies, the livelihood of allocation workers should be ensured, their income should be guaranteed, and supervision should be strengthened while also training the awareness of allocation workers. On this point, there are still issues that need to be improved in the Food Management Group.

False claims of various occupations have been revised since last year. In Tokyo, each time the high ledgers are updated, the allocated population decreases by tens of thousands. On this point, it is hoped that the heads of each group will work harder, frequently change the ledgers, and strictly implement national transfer certificates. However, some false population numbers are unavoidable due to technical compilation reasons, and some are unintentional. In short, the people should deeply understand the reality of the food situation and the war situation and receive the allocation they deserve, while the government should not reduce the minimum allocation necessary for life. By working together, the problem of false population reports can be solved.

(4) Resources That Have Not Been Won

The Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce is studying how many food resources our country has not yet won. "Rice chaff" is one of the targets. Other resources such as sweet potato vines, sweet potato leaves, mugwort seeds, seaweed, etc., are planned to be powdered and saccharified. Pickles are already being used in the Northeast and Hokuriku regions. Fallen apples, defatted soybeans, and oil wrapping are also being studied. Converting the above into rice equates to approximately hundreds of thousands of koku.

(5) Fresh Food Ingredients

Since March of this year, the collection and distribution mechanisms for vegetables and fish in the six major cities have been gradually reformed.

Starting this year, each major consumer city is striving for self-sufficiency in vegetables. Vegetable production bonus systems, pickling of excess production, etc., are all being discussed. The secure transportation of vegetables is unanimously considered to be of utmost importance.

Regarding fish, the discussions include guaranteeing fishermen's livelihoods during fishing bans, setting official prices for unorganized fish species, simplifying pricing, strengthening the organization of coastal fisheries, thoroughly distributing materials to fisheries companies, and supervising production records.

As for cattle, the number being raised now is actually higher than before the incident, so slaughtering a considerable number to provide protein is being considered, and private slaughtering of cattle will be strictly prohibited.

(6) Price Countermeasures for Fresh Food Ingredients

Current price policies focus most on essential goods, especially the staple foods within food. On this point, many people advocate how price policies can better demonstrate their flexibility.

Regarding the issue of delegating the authority to set prices during periods of scarcity to local autonomous bodies, especially the citizens of Tokyo, now want to exchange less value for higher-priced goods. Tokyo is the imperial capital with a large population. Considering this special nature, whether the costs required for collection and distribution within Tokyo can be transferred to consumers in Tokyo is an opinion worth noting. However, the relationship between cities and prefectures, the relationship between new prices and the cost of living in Tokyo, the relationship between consumption and prices, the relationship between consumption and low-price policies, and the relationship with the prices of staple foods such as rice and wheat are all factors. Also, the effectiveness of price policies themselves has greatly decreased today, so the view that even if producers' prices are greatly increased, the government's organizational capacity cannot penetrate is also worth noting.

(7) Review of the Meal Ticket System

There is much discussion about whether a national joint meal ticket system that deducts allocated rice can be implemented in our country, as it has already been implemented in Manchuria.

This is to stop part of the food for business use that does not require meal tickets and increase the distribution to families. In this way, current meal ticket holders are spared the inconvenience of having to eat out in general canteens with the general public. Under the current food situation, it is indeed possible to abolish general canteens and stabilize the security of cities.

(8) Congee Canteens

This can also be said to be a current security measure. In Tokyo, the total number of people eating in congee canteens in each association is 450,000 to 60,000. At the meeting, it was discussed that the associations sell non-compliant food to make a profit, which hurts the feelings of the citizens. Therefore, it was advocated to completely abolish congee canteens and replace them with government- or autonomous body-run public canteens.

Rest during air raid alerts is also a problem, and the lunch for salaried workers and the food for security guards during air raid alerts must be considered and a new plan must be established taking into account the meal ticket issue.

(9) Milk and Alcohol

The milk problem, which is related to the nutrition of infants, is quite serious. The future direction should be to corporatize the collection and distribution mechanisms, and the allocation amount for each district should break away from the past performance-based system and be adjusted based on the actual population ratio. Other proposals, such as deducting the rice allocation for those who need milk and allocating alcohol and other delicacies selectively, were discussed. However, candy is different from alcohol; candy is given on a unit basis to children and pregnant women, while alcohol is given on a household basis, so it is quite difficult to implement.

(10) Allocations for Factory Youth

Some strongly suggested that factory personnel should not receive increased allocations. They also advocated abolishing the extra allocations for contract workers. As for youth, including working students, the current amount is generally sufficient.

(11) Re-examination of Eating Habits

Regarding the popularization of powder foods (i.e., flour-based foods), problems were raised regarding milling capacity, fuel, transportation capacity, and distribution methods. It was hoped that the national eating habits would change toward powder foods, and it was requested that the country promote the supply of raw materials.

The crediting of rice winning resources cannot but begin with powder foods, so it should be carefully studied in the future. Also, in terms of preparation, since the current distribution is of flour and wheat flour, the amount of rice deduction should be further reduced. Citizens hope that the current mixing of soybeans will be replaced by separate allocations of rice and beans. The mixing of food borrowing has increased sharply from summer to autumn. Although it is an unavoidable measure due to the emergence of new rice, it is hoped that it will be allocated evenly throughout the year, that the unjust weighing of various allocated foods will be prohibited, and that fresh foods will be allocated as vegetables. These hopes were raised at the meeting.

The most important point of improving life is to maximize nutritional efficiency with the lowest amount of rice. Not only the government but also each family must carefully study and improve. (Sho: From the Asahi Shimbun, July 13th).

### Blood and Tears (10) The Navy

— Written by Toyoo Iwata, Translated by Hong Yang

Due to my incompetence, His Majesty's warship sank, and my subordinates were harmed. I truly deserve to die. However, all the crew members, until their last breath, remained calm and dedicated to their duties. Although we say we sacrificed ourselves for the country, what prevents us from resting in peace is the fear that people will misunderstand us and hesitate in future submarine endeavors. This is the only concern. I hope everyone will work harder and dedicate themselves to researching the development of submarines. If so, we will have no regrets even in death.

Cause of Sinking

Due to diving too deep using gasoline, we attempted to close the blockage, but it broke midway. Trying to plug it with our hands was also too late, so the rear section completely flooded, causing a list of about twenty-five degrees, and we sank.

Situation After Sinking

(1) Angle of list was approximately thirteen degrees.

(2) Because the distribution panel was flooded, the lights went out, a fire started, gas was generated, and breathing became difficult. We sank at 10:00 AM on the 14th. Under this suffocating gas, we tried our best to pump water out using manual pumps.

(3) As soon as we sank, we started pumping water from the main tank. The lights were out, so we couldn't see clearly, but I believe the main tank's pumping work was completed. The current could not be used up completely. A small amount of electrolyte remained, seawater no longer entered, and gas stopped appearing. About 500 pounds of residual oxygen remained. The only special thing was to tighten the water pump.

(The above was written in the conning tower at 11:45 AM.)

Most of the crew who were submerged in water had their clothes completely soaked, but they didn't feel cold. I often told the submarine crew that if you are not brave and careful, you cannot develop confidence, but don't be too timid and afraid of pain when things happen. If the world does not ridicule us for this failure, then I am sure that what I said above will not be wrong.

(1) The depth gauge in the conning tower read fifty-two degrees. We worked hard to pump water out until 12:00, but the depth here was more than ten zhang. I dare not say if this is accurate.

(2) Submarine crewmen and soldiers need to be selected from the best of the best. Fortunately, in this difficult time, each crew member was able to fulfill their duties, and I am very satisfied.

Every time I go out, I am prepared to die, so my will is in the drawer of "Han Qi" (but there is no need to talk about this matter, please present it to my father through Tanaka Asami Shi).

Public Will

Humbly presented to His Majesty, I only hope that my unit's surviving families will not be forced by hunger and cold. I respectfully extend my greetings to the following gentlemen (names in no particular order).

(1) Minister Fuji... (Note by the author: The names of the following elders are omitted.) The air pressure is too high, and I deeply feel that my eardrums are about to burst. (He continued to write names).

12:30 PM, breathing is very painful.

Although gasoline has accumulated in one place, I am overwhelmed by the gasoline smell.

(1) Colonel Nakano (Guang: wants to recall the name)

12:40 PM

(11)

The above is Lieutenant Commander Sakuma's will. As the saying goes, anyone who doesn't cry at this is not human. It is truly a tragedy. Written more than thirty years ago, these words still have unparalleled emotional power today.

After hearing what Colonel I said, Longfu looked at a skillfully copied version of the will in the school's reference hall. He also looked at the photos of the lieutenant commander and other crew members hanging on the wall. Everyone inspires us to be deeply moved.

"Commander Sakuma and Lieutenant Colonel Hirose were even objects of admiration at the naval academy. Students chose one of these two as their role model..."

Zhenren said this. He also said that April 15th, the date of the disaster, is also a bright page in naval history.

"The Colonel said that there were also sentences in Petty Officer Anemi's will from the 43rd submarine that Commander Sakuma said. This may be the influence of Lieutenant Commander Sakuma, or tradition. It's truly great!"

Longfu said this as he walked.

"Furthermore, the way the lieutenant commander spoke to his subordinates, that kind of demeanor, may not be easy for non-military personnel to understand."

Zhenren replied in this way. In his reply, it was as if he was truly thinking about the situation of a subordinate.

"But submarines are truly pitiful! They haven't even been in a single battle. If Zhenren had served on other types of warships, wouldn't he have been able to show his skills sooner!"

"No."

Zhenren's reply was only this one word. His refreshing laugh completely compensated for the inadequacy of his words. In a short while, the two arrived in front of the submarine shrine near their department. The submarine school tour was only left with this final destination.

Zhenren said, let's worship at the shrine!

"In the No. 6 submarine, it doesn't matter if ordinary visitors come in. I'll lead the way."

"Okay, let's go here?"

Longfu's chest was pounding.

Inspecting the 73-foot-long hull, he bent over because it was too small. Longfu was very surprised by how small it was, and the ventilation pipe, the cause of the accident, protruded from the outside of the submarine like a chimney in a bathhouse. Looking at it, his heart ached like a needle.

Stepping up the white wooden stairs, he felt like there was a new entrance. At this place, he took a step forward into the submarine, and except for the dim electric lights and the outside light shining in from the conning tower, everything was pitch black. (129)

### National Forum: Proposal to Implement Rationing of National Standard Textbooks

Since the enlightenment of the beginning, due to the gap between production and consumption, everything has fallen into a price surge. Indeed, the repeated price increases of various books and textbooks are also unavoidable facts.

However, books are ultimately a specialized item related to culture. They have a vital interest in the future of the Republic of China and cannot be lumped together with other things. Therefore, the relevant authorities, in order to adapt to the wartime environment, have unified all the textbooks used in junior high schools and primary schools into national standards and have tried their best to reduce prices to make them affordable for the common people. Primary school students have benefited greatly, and the plan can be said to be second to none.

However, because the price of national standard textbooks is so low, it has soon created a distorted situation. I remember that at the beginning of last year, the Chinese language version of the national standard only sold for a little over three yuan per book. However, those printed by ordinary bookstores required about thirty yuan. The difference in price reached ten times. Although the content of the national standard textbooks was poorer, the printing was still better than the ordinary version. As a result, the ordinary versions of books were naturally greatly affected, leading to business decline. However, the people of Shanghai are good at showing off, and businessmen have boundless ingenuity. As long as there is profit to be made, they don't care if it is harmful or unreasonable. Seeing that national standard textbooks were so cheap, almost cheaper than "selling by the pound," they desperately bought and hoarded them. The books printed for national standard textbooks are allocated to primary and secondary school students throughout the city, which should have been enough. But due to this, not a single copy was left in the formal bookstores. Students still could not buy the books they needed, and the black market for books arose, followed by soaring prices. Primary school students cried out in pain, with no one to listen. The above is the fact of the previous semester. The parties concerned (China United Publishing Company) also discovered the drawbacks. They have been increasing the price of books again and again this summer, often by several times (see the previous forum). Their purpose is probably to balance the price with ordinary books so as not to create the above-mentioned situation.

Advocating for an increase in prices under necessary circumstances is, of course, appropriate. However, such an endless price increase is an undesirable phenomenon. Today, to be fortunate enough to receive education is already difficult enough, and adding this significant burden is even more difficult. Moreover, the authorities created national standard textbooks to make them universal. So, where is the original intention of the authorities in this contradictory phenomenon of "forcing growth"?

Speaking of the above-mentioned drawbacks, fundamentally speaking, it is necessary to try to suppress the price of ordinary books. But the most important thing that needs to be resolved is the implementation of rationing, to distribute the books according to the actual needs. Of course, this does not only refer to the school. Everyone who truly needs the books can get them. In short, it is not to allow those cunning merchants to take advantage of the opportunity, and to enable every student to obtain inexpensive books.

Regarding the method of distribution, there are certainly good ways for those in charge to implement, and there is no need to elaborate.

### Social Service: Suggestions for Reforming Funeral Arrangements

At a time when materials are scarce, everything is expensive, and people's livelihoods are declining, the death of ordinary people and vagrants often becomes a serious problem. This is because the cost of even a thin coffin is not low. Although there are charitable organizations in this city that handle the distribution of coffins and charitable burials, this arduous task always feels like a well is too deep and the rope is too short, and there is more than enough heart but not enough strength. It is believed that in this epoch-making period, this kind of affairs really needs reform, and I dare to offer my humble opinions as follows, for the sake of offering a humble suggestion.

When a person dies, all consciousness is lost, so funeral arrangements after death only need to be hygienic. Therefore, for ordinary people and unclaimed bodies, it is sufficient to wrap them and transport them to the public cemetery for burial. As for cremation, it is very hygienic and economical, but this city does not have the facilities for cremation of common people. Before the establishment of public cremation grounds, it may be advisable to promote "soil burial."

In the public cemeteries in the suburbs of Shanghai, the bodies of ordinary vagrants are buried. Currently, in most public cemeteries, coffins are still exposed above the ground, which is not only related to hygiene, but also, as days go by and the soil piles up, the whole area becomes useless. Therefore, burials must be deep, at least six or seven feet deep into the ground, so that the odor of decomposition will not rise.

If the above-mentioned open space can be used, plant trees (within the possible range, plant one tree at each burial site). Twenty years later, the forest will be naturally formed, and felling them to make tools is not a win-win situation!

The above opinions are just a brief outline. As for detailed organization, it still needs to be planned and traveled by social authorities and charitable organizations. In this difficult period, enlightened people will surely not disregard it, fortunately! (Ni Yaping)
