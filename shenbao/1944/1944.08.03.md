### Eliminating the US Air Force Stationed in Chongqing

Question: Recently, I've frequently seen news about the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing bombing peaceful areas. For instance, yesterday's newspaper reported a dispatch from Hankou's Central News Agency on the 1st of this month: "Around ten US Air Force planes stationed in Chongqing intruded into the Wuhan area, bombing the Jiang'an area. Residences caught fire, and there were casualties." Why is the US Air Force indiscriminately bombing like this?

Answer: Although the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing's own strength is quite weak, their ambitions are great, and they are especially arrogant within the area controlled by Chongqing. The purpose of their indiscriminate bombing of peaceful areas is ostensibly to target Japanese military facilities, but in reality, it is merely to justify their expenses to their own country.

Question: Since the US Air Force's bombing is just for justifying expenses, Chinese civilians inevitably suffer loss of life and property. Moreover, their presence poses some obstacle to the future of a peaceful and unified China, isn't that so?

Answer: Incorrect. We don't need to take the strength of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing too seriously, but their obstacle to the future of a peaceful and unified China, especially from the perspective of building a New Order in Greater East Asia, should be taken seriously. Therefore, allied Japanese forces have recently launched a widespread war in mainland China. The target of the operation is to eliminate and expel the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. Although the direct target of the conflict is the Chongqing army, the real goal is not the Chongqing army, but the US Air Force.

Question: Does that mean the aim of the several battles in Henan and Hunan was entirely to eliminate the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing? However, the damage suffered by the Chinese people is inestimable!

Answer: The objective of the operations in Henan and Hunan was, of course, to eliminate the US Air Force. This is evident from the attack on the Guangshi Airport in Henan, the attack on the Hengyang Airport in Hunan, and the launch of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign, all with the same goal. If there were no US Air Force bases or areas within their sphere of influence, they would not be attacked. From this perspective, the objective of the Japanese army's operations in mainland China is clear. As for the damage suffered by the local people due to the Japanese army's bombing or attack in order to achieve the goal of eliminating the US Air Force, not only we but also the Japanese army feels very regretful.

Question: According to this trend, will the mainland operations not end until the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is completely eliminated?

Answer: Here, we need to understand that the essence of the East Asian War is a war for the East Asian peoples to cast off the shackles that the British and Americans have imposed on us in the past and to strive for national liberation. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is a weapon that destroys the construction of the New Order in Greater East Asia and continues to enslave the East Asian peoples. It is the enemy of the entire East Asian people and must be completely eliminated. Therefore, as long as the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing exists, the allied forces will attack it. We must all fully understand this general trend.

Question: Since the general trend is like this, how can we cooperate?

Answer: We are a part of Greater East Asia and a participating country. We also have a responsibility to eliminate the US Air Force. If our military strength is insufficient, we must strengthen our political and economic power within the peaceful areas, so that the hearts of the people in the (anti-Japanese) areas will lean towards us, isolating the Chongqing forces. Then, the US Air Force will have no place to stand.

### Japan Prepares for Decisive Battle; All Cabinet Members Agree on Actively Strengthening Production and Air Force Capabilities

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government considers the implementation of decisive battle measures to be an urgent task. A cabinet meeting was convened on the 1st, during which cabinet members exchanged candid opinions on the issue. According to Prime Minister Koiso, the Japanese people's morale has been renewed since the establishment of the Koiso-Yonai cabinet, and unity is the foundation of war and politics. Therefore, the objective is to build on this foundation, implement vigorous and decisive battle preparations, and realize various essential measures to defeat the enemy, the United States and Great Britain. All cabinet members fully agreed on this point and decided to work together on concrete preparations. From this perspective, these measures represent a concentrated effort to focus combat power and cope with the decisive battle.

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - After the establishment of the new Japanese cabinet, Prime Minister Koiso keenly felt that close cooperation between the army and navy, and the unity of military and civilians within the cabinet, were urgent tasks. Therefore, the slogan of "Great Unity" was promoted throughout the country, and the war situation progressed rapidly. The US military has attempted to challenge Japan from air bases in the central Pacific, which is very obvious. However, in order to cope with this urgent situation, the Japanese government must shift the focus of its domestic preparations to a decisive battle posture and request necessary measures. In addition to holding cabinet meetings, the new cabinet has held three regular cabinet meetings after its formation. In addition to discussing agenda items, they have openly exchanged opinions on concrete strategies for adapting to the decisive battle. In particular, at the regular cabinet meeting on August 1st, cabinet members expressed unanimous agreement on the issue of shifting the focus of domestic policy guidance from the emphasis on unity since the formation of the cabinet to the preparation for a decisive battle. The new cabinet's decisive battle policies have rapidly become concrete. However, the focus of implementation is on adapting to the decisive battle posture, and existing policies will also be subject to necessary revisions or repeal.

### Three-Sided Attack Achieves Victory; Japanese Army Occupies Lianhua; Hunan Battle Enters Decisive Stage

A certain Japanese army base on the Hunan front, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The right wing of the Japanese army on the Hunan front is also advancing towards Jiangxi, posing a great threat to the Third War Area of Chongqing. Since the 20th of last month, after annihilating the Chongqing army near Pingxiang, it has marched south and occupied Lianhua (about 70 kilometers south of Pingxiang) on the 1st of this month. After the fall of Changsha, this place had in fact become the general command post of Chongqing's Ninth War Area and the location of the headquarters of Chongqing's Twenty-ninth Army Group. It was defended by the 20th Army, which boasts of being an elite force, and also had the 30th Army Group and the 73rd Army, which had retreated from the vicinity of Pingxiang, stationed there, so the defense was quite solid, but it finally fell under the three-sided attack of the Japanese army.

Hunan Front, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army on the Hunan front is currently completely controlling the mountains and fields of Hunan and has always maintained an active position. However, due to the incompetence of the war command and field army, they are making unnecessary sacrifices. The Japanese army is currently adopting a tactic of luring the enemy, with attacking Hengyang as a step. The Chongqing army still fails to recognize this and believes that it can salvage the Hengyang battle and ensure Hengyang, so it is ordered to defend to the death. In order to plan a flanking attack on Liling and Chaling and retake Hengyang, the defeated remnants of the Ninth War Area were concentrated in early August, and reinforcements from the Third, Sixth, and Seventh War Areas were added, totaling eight armies, which broke into the encirclement line from the east and south. In this way, they have unknowingly fallen into the battle of the Japanese army. On July 10th, the second annihilation battle was launched on the east-west front connecting Liling, Chaling, and Hengyang. The Japanese army used its bravery and perseverance to annihilate eight armies of the Chongqing army and achieved success everywhere. The Chongqing army concentrated a large number of troops and suffered heavy casualties in order to retake Hengyang. At the beginning of the operation, its forces totaled nineteen armies, including three divisions of the Fourth Army of the Ninth War Area, the 124th Division of the 20th Army, and the 161st Division of the Fourth Army. As a result, nine armies were completely annihilated, and the combat power of twenty-five divisions was greatly damaged. The Ninth War Area army has been completely destroyed here. In addition, the Japanese air force increased control over the US Air Force bases in Chongqing, Zhijiang, Guilin, and Liuzhou. From July 1st to 28th, it shot down or destroyed more than 480 Chongqing-US aircraft that were set on fire, inflicting great damage on the US Air Force. The results achieved by the Japanese army in Hunan, both in the air and on the ground, have determined the offensive of the Chinese battlefield in Hunan and have entered a new decisive stage.

Street Fighting Unfolds in Hengyang City

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency): The Air Force authorities issued a factual statement overnight, stating that the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on the streets of Hengyang for as long as five days. After fierce fighting, they finally entered the city and are currently engaged in street fighting with the garrison forces.

Hunan Front, 2nd (Central News Agency): The main force of Chongqing's 58th Army attempted to attack the rear of the Japanese army units surrounding Hengyang and began operations in Pingxiang. In response, the Japanese army launched a swift battle on the 26th of last month with skillful tactics, occupying Mashan, eight kilometers west of Pingxiang, and controlling the forward positions. Another Japanese army unit also occupied Luxi on the 27th, cutting off the Chongqing army's retreat and encircling it. Although the Chongqing army sent the newly formed 162nd Division and 99th Division to reinforce it, it was again encircled by the Japanese army. By the 30th, the Japanese army had achieved great results in four days. The Chongqing army division commanders and others escaped alone. The remnants of the Chongqing 58th Army have been annihilated, so the roads between Pingxiang, Lianhua, and Suichuan are all under Japanese control.

Great Results from Air Raid on Liuzhou

A certain Japanese army base in China, 1st (Central News Agency): Japanese aircraft, in order to completely eliminate the US forces stationed in Chongqing, bombed Liuzhou three times with a heavy bomber fleet on the night of the 21st. A heavy blow was dealt to the forces that had recently concentrated there to replenish the damage suffered by the Japanese Air Force in recent attacks. At the same time, the Dantan and Wuzhou airfields were attacked, and in addition to burning a total of 22 enemy planes, the runways and other ground facilities were bombed and destroyed. On the 21st, due to bad weather, a Japanese bomber fleet approached Liuzhou at 20 minutes past eight on the 22nd. At that time, the Chongqing army's ground fire hit and bombed enemy aircraft fleeing to the Liuzhou airport. Seven large aircraft and three small aircraft were immediately hit and burned, and six large aircraft and two small aircraft were destroyed. In addition, three ground facilities were bombed. Another team of Japanese aircraft separately destroyed two facilities, and another team of Japanese aircraft bombed the runway at 10:30, all hitting the target. All the Japanese aircraft returned safely to base after completing the bombing.

A certain Japanese army base on the China front, 2nd (Central News Agency): As a result of the Japanese aircraft's attack on Liuzhou on the evening of June 31, it has been clarified that in addition to the aircraft, one large aircraft and two small aircraft were hit and caught fire, and two military facilities were burned. In total, the Chongqing-US Air Force lost eight large aircraft and five small aircraft, and six large aircraft and small facilities were burned in five places. The total results of the battle that evening, in addition to destroying and burning 24 enemy aircraft, also burned ten military facilities.

### General Oikawa Appointed Chief of the Naval General Staff; General Nomura Appointed Commander of Yokosuka

### Director Izubuchi Discusses the Hunan War Situation; Chongqing Army Stubbornly Resists, Sacrificing Themselves for the Enemy

Director Izubuchi of the Allied Army Reporting Department in Shanghai has made great contributions to the information and ideological warfare of the Greater East Asia War and the mainland campaign, and has been promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel by the military authorities. Mr. Izubuchi also invited Chinese newspaper reporters from this city to the Hua Hotel on the Bund in Nanjing Road at 2:45 p.m. yesterday (2nd) to deliver a speech on the recent situation in Hunan. The following is a summary of Mr. Izubuchi's speech:

Japanese Army Operations Do Not Disturb the People

Director Izubuchi first stated that the Hunan operation has been going on for two months since it began. During this process, the Japanese army has achieved remarkable results. However, since the beginning of the operation, the Japanese army has adhered to the instructions of the Supreme Commander, implemented the operation policy thoroughly, endured all suffering, avoided harming the Chinese people, and adhered to the principle of not disturbing the people. Therefore, since the operation, all actions and measures of the Japanese army have always been within the scope of instructions. Even when occupying the city of Changsha, although the attack was carried out in several directions, the operation was still carried out under the welfare of all the people, and the city and streets inside and outside the city were never disturbed, and Changsha was safely and smoothly occupied. The security of Changsha has been restored rapidly under the rapid development of the Japanese army, and the city appearance is also gradually restored. Recently, I have also explained to you in detail that by the end of last month, it was almost the same as before the war. By July 25, there were more than 10,000 residents. Unexpectedly, on July 26 and 27, the enemy's US Air Force made a stupid move and carried out aimless and indiscriminate bombing of Changsha, throwing a lot of incendiary bombs and, occasionally, difficult to burn bombs. As a result of the bombing, 500 to 600 houses were burned on July 26, about 3,000 houses, and a combined loss of about 3,500 houses in two days. It is found that there are only 15,000 to 16,000 houses in Changsha, so about one-fifth of the houses were damaged this time.

Enemy Aircraft Bombing Does Not Harm Military Facilities

The Japanese army in Changsha adheres to the principle of not disturbing the people based on the spirit of morality. Important troops are not stationed in the city, and only a part of the troops is stationed to protect the restoration of Changsha's appearance. Although the indiscriminate bombing of the enemy's US Air Force caused substantial losses to the people, the Japanese army was not harmed at all. The Japanese army's principle of not disturbing the people and not stationing troops in the peaceful area, as a result of this blind bombing by the enemy's US Air Force, resulted in no casualties to the Japanese army. This is a clear explanation. There are indeed no regular Japanese troops stationed in Changsha. Those who were harmed this time were innocent civilians, and there was no damage to military facilities. Regarding the loss of people and objects in Changsha, the following points are described: ① When the Japanese army did not occupy Changsha, the Japanese army also constantly bombed Changsha, but the Japanese army's bombing was also quite severe every time, but the targets were different. Except for military facilities, everything else was never destroyed, and no harm was done to the people. Its action like the movement of a large troop is the same and nothing else. However, the civilians near the military facilities will be slightly affected under unavoidable circumstances, and no one else will be damaged. ② The actions of the enemy's US Air Force are aimless, lacking indiscriminate bombing techniques. There is no military damage, so it harms the people. This can reflect the inconsistency of the command system of the Chongqing-US Air Force, and there is no discipline, and opinions are divided and mutually opposed, so the facts of hesitation and negation arise. At the same time, it can be seen that the US Air Force's chaotic and irregular bombing is fundamentally worthless militarily, but only causes suffering to the general public.

Chongqing Army Sacrifices Themselves for the Enemy

Director Izubuchi outlined the battle situation in Hengyang and said that the battles in the past two or three days have been particularly fierce. The Chongqing army defending the fortress in Hengyang City still has three divisions of the Chongqing 10th Army, but the ammunition is exhausted and very short. On the one hand, the Japanese army has completely surrounded the general situation of the heavy troops. However, although there are very few Chongqing rescue troops on the periphery of Hengyang attempting to save the isolated troops in the city, the Japanese army will surround the rescue troops, so the situation in Hengyang has become a three-way encirclement. The Chongqing army in Hengyang City is resisting fiercely, but the effect is very small. The reasons for its resistance can be analyzed as follows: ① According to the confessions of the Chongqing prisoners captured in Hengyang, the base of the Chongqing 10th Army is near the China Bank in the city, and it has a strong defense. There are fifty or sixty enemy US military officers who participated in planning various operations. ② The enemy US officers participate in military plans and supervise the battle, because the Chongqing army is hesitating to make a stubborn resistance. In other words, the Chongqing side is sacrificing for the enemy, that is, fighting for the enemy. From a broader perspective, the bombing of Changsha and the stubborn resistance in Hengyang City are completely instigated and instigated by the enemy. The Chongqing army and the general Chinese people are sacrificed for the enemy. Although the battle in Hengyang is fierce, the supply lines, highways, and waterways have all been ensured by the Japanese army recently, so the current war will become more and more fierce. It is very clear to observe that the Japanese army has considerable prospects in the war.

### Japanese Officer Talks About the Battle Situation in Hengyang

A certain unit commander of the Japanese army on the Hunan front flew here on the 1st due to important business. When he spoke about the battle situation on the Hunan front, he stated that the Chongqing army within the encirclement of Hengyang is continuing to resist due to Chiang Kai-shek's war order. However, the Chongqing army has been annihilated and has long since lost its will to fight. Why is the Chongqing army still doing this useless resistance? This is indeed a matter that needs to be reviewed. The army headquarters is located in the basement of the Bank of China in the central part of Hengyang City. There are a minimum of 60 US officers supervising the Chongqing army commanders at the headquarters. These US officers are obviously opposing the will of the Chongqing army and forcing them to resist the Japanese army. Therefore, the Chongqing army on the front line of the encirclement net is in a difficult situation to advance or retreat, and it is said that a part of the Chongqing army committed suicide because of this. As for the US Air Force on that side, when they launch a surprise attack, they do not recognize the target and bomb indiscriminately. In the past, we have also witnessed the US Air Force bombarding Changsha when Changsha was lost. Their actions are out of control, the US Air Force's generals are scattered, lacking orders, and when they are attacked by the Japanese high-altitude anti-aircraft guns, the base fleet is torn apart. In this regard, it is commonplace not to recognize the target, throw bombs indiscriminately, and the team enters the cloud and runs away. Therefore, only the people are victimized, and there is no loss to the Japanese Air Force facilities. It is said that recently, due to the US Air Force's indiscriminate bombing of Changsha, one-fifth of the houses in Changsha, about 15,000 households, have been reduced to ashes. On average, 3,000 households have been destroyed, which can slightly injure one Japanese soldier. This is a fact that everyone has witnessed, so the people who returned to Changsha are extremely angry with the US aircraft. However, when the Japanese army attacked Changsha twice, the bombing by the Japanese army was completely different from that. At that time, in addition to thoroughly destroying the Chongqing army's facilities, the people were not harmed. The low level of US Air Force technology can be seen from this. After Hunan was far away from the war, the land was not harmed by fire, and the farmers still worked at sunrise and rested at sunset, so the area can harvest a bumper harvest this year. At present, there are still some Chongqing troops in the Hengyang area, but the highways and roads destroyed by the Chongqing army have been restored, and the water transportation of the Xiangjiang and Yuanjiang Rivers is no less prosperous than before the war.

### Enemy Aircraft Attack Palau, Destroying and Crashing 110 Aircraft; Attack on Anshan Losses Two Aircraft

A certain Japanese army base in the central Pacific, 2nd (Central News Agency): Between July 25, 26, and 27, enemy ships and aircraft repeatedly visited Gananlin Island and Palau Island. Afterwards, it was found that the enemy aircraft that came to attack numbered about 750. 43 aircraft were shot down by the Japanese anti-aircraft artillery fire, and 67 aircraft were destroyed, for a total of 110 aircraft.

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency): Regarding the air raid on Anshan by the Chongqing-US Air Force's B29 Super Fortress fleet, according to a Reuter's dispatch from a secret base in western China: two Super Fortresses have not yet returned to base, and it has been confirmed that two aircraft have been lost.

### Burma Organizes the Greater Alliance and Works to Establish an Air Force; The Ba Hengte Investigation Team Returned Home Yesterday Morning

Rangoon, 2nd (Central News Agency): The Burmese government's propaganda authorities announced to representatives of various groups at the Burma Independence Anniversary Conference held in Rangoon on the 1st that the Burmese government has organized the "Greater Burma Alliance" to summarize Burma's national strength.

Rangoon, 2nd (Central News Agency): Burmese Minister of Defense Major General Win Sang met with reporters after the Independence Anniversary parade. He made the following remarks: "Strengthening the strength and improving the quality of the Burmese National Army is an urgent task at present. The Recruitment Committee established on the 29th of last month is responsible for this. The committee aims to compile the people, and plans to start with the implementation of national registration. If this is completed, the conscription system can also be realized. The military is working hard to create an air force this year. In the future, it also plans to establish a navy, but it still needs to wait for Dr. Ba Ting and others to return from visiting various parts of East Asia for detailed discussions. In addition, the Burmese anti-aircraft artillery air defense forces have repeatedly made great achievements, and have indeed shot down 29 enemy Unified Aircraft and North American aircraft, and destroyed 12 aircraft.

Rangoon, 2nd (Central News Agency): The Burmese Special Investigation Team, led by Dr. Ba Ting, has been investigating since leaving the port for three months. During this period, it has visited Japan and various Allied countries in East Asia. It has now completed its work and returned home on the morning of the 2nd.

### Mr. Prapakit Appointed Regent of Thailand; Major General Abhaiwongse Succeeds as Prime Minister

Bangkok, 2nd (Central News Agency): The Thai government announced on the radio at night on the 1st that His Highness Regent Akiht had resigned on July 31. The council approved the matter on the 1st of last month and decided to appoint Prapakit as regent. The decision was formally signed by the Speaker of the National Assembly. Regent Prapakit appointed Major General Abhaiwongse by decree on August 1 to the cabinet succeeding Prime Minister Phibun after his resignation. The Prime Minister's appointment was also signed by the Speaker of the National Assembly.

Bangkok, 2nd (Central News Agency): After Thai Prime Minister Phibun resigned, it has been decided that Major General Abhaiwongse will take over. He is 43 years old and a descendant of the Marquis of Bassarabon. After the area was merged into French Vietnam in 1893, he fled to Thailand. In 1918, he went to France to study, and returned to Thailand in 1928 to serve as a technician in the Communications Department of the Ministry of Transport, which was his first step into technical officialdom. In June 1934, he was elected as an official member of the National Assembly. The following year, he entered the cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio. After that, he successively served as Acting Minister of Economy, Acting Deputy Minister of Education, Minister of Transport, and Minister of Commerce. In February of last year, he resigned due to disagreements with former Prime Minister Phibun. After stepping down, he visited Japan three times. This year, he was elected as the Deputy Speaker of the Assembly. On the 29th of last month, after voting in the parliamentary representatives' meeting, he won with 69 votes, defeating former Prime Minister Phibun with 22 votes. Although the new Prime Minister Abhaiwongse has little experience in political life, he is a reasonable and honest politician from a technical background and is very popular with the people. Due to the appointment of the new Prime Minister, the policy towards Japan will become clearer. The basic policy of Thailand's cooperation with Japan will be vigorously expanded.

### Speaker Tian Sends a Telegram to Congratulate Ba Maw

I sincerely wish your country's national fortune prosperity and your Excellency good health."

### 渝民衆右厭戰

Guangzhou, 2nd – Central News Agency Dispatch: The Guangxi Daily, recently published in Guilin, issued a commentary entitled "Beware of Japan's Political Offensive," pointing out the fact that a war-weary atmosphere permeates the people. The gist is recorded as follows: The recent Japanese military offensive has been fierce, and the people's defeatist thinking has become even more profound. At the same time, soldiers are also trying to avoid war, retreating and deserting. We have experienced seven years of resistance, and today we have a little confidence in obtaining the "final victory," which should be fully reviewed and self-criticized. The reasons for this are nothing more than political corruption and the incomplete mobilization of the people. In the past, we were able to use morale and political power to stop the Japanese offensive to a certain extent, but now we have lost these two important conditions for resistance. We did not expect that the situation of the seven-year resistance would regress to this point. In short, our crisis is imminent, and our future destiny will depend on whether this situation can be rebuilt.

Regarding Turko-Bulgarian relations, all major politicians agree that maintaining peace in the Balkans is in the common interest of both countries. Therefore, the Bulgarian people naturally feel uneasy about changes in Turkish foreign policy. Although the great pressure from the anti-Axis powers on Turkey cannot be ignored, it is hoped that influential Turkish politicians will not be forced to make decisions that are detrimental to the common interests of Bulgaria and Turkey.

Helsinki, 2nd – Central News Agency Dispatch, Transocean News Agency: The official announcement: President Ryti has resigned, and Marshal Mannerheim, Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Army, has been elected as President of Finland.

Helsinki, 2nd – German News Agency Dispatch: Finnish Prime Minister Linkomies has notified the parliament that after President Ryti resigned, he has temporarily assumed the duties of President. Political circles here believe that Linkomies will be the acting President before Marshal Mannerheim is appointed as President. In his speech to the parliament, Linkomies praised the achievements of the former President. He said that the people are very grateful for the achievements of the former President, and they will be forever recorded in history. Ryti will always be one of Finland's great politicians. Linkomies also read out the letter from the former President, saying, "In view of the difficult situation our country is currently in, I have decided to concentrate the highest administrative power of the state in one person. Therefore, I have decided to resign. My health also makes my resignation necessary." The bill for Marshal Mannerheim has been passed for the second reading by the Parliament, so its wording cannot be changed. It should be approved by five-sixths of the parliamentarians.

### 佛羅倫斯　宣布不設防

Milan, 2nd – Central News Agency, Transocean News Agency: British and American artillery have begun to bombard Florence. Several residential areas have caught fire, especially in the southwest and south, causing considerable damage and casualties. The Italian government has decided not to move the artworks of Florence elsewhere, as the German army has declared Florence an undefended city, and it is expected that the British and American forces will preserve the city.

### 西線决戰為期不遠

In the summer of the fifth year of the European War, Germany was attacked by the enemy from the east, west, and south. The war situation was not optimistic. During the year and a half of silence, the anti-Axis forces, armed to the teeth, hoped to reverse the war situation with overwhelming force. However, on the German side, time was of the essence, and this was an excellent opportunity to gain an advantage. Therefore, the German authorities also directly admitted that today's Germany is facing the most serious situation in its history.

Focus on the West

So which of these three fronts does Germany focus on? The conclusion is that the fundamental strategy of "defending the East and attacking the West" since last autumn must not be changed. Today, the best and only way to survive is to endure all suffering and implement this established direction without hesitation. The front where Germany gives the enemy a head-on blow should be the West. The development of the Western Front is the key to the decisive battle in Europe.

The Struggle for Northern France

Although the British and American troops have landed on the Western Front for a month, they have only occupied Cherbourg, and the western half of the Cotentin Peninsula is still in German hands. The 70-kilometer bridgehead on the Normandy coast has been expanded to the south, but is blocked by the German counter-offensive. The deepest part is only 30 kilometers. Therefore, in order to stabilize this bridgehead, Montgomery advanced southward, capturing Caens and Saint-Lô, but in order to break through the German positions beyond the range of naval guns, it was necessary to wait for the reinforcement of a large number of heavy weapons and mechanized units. However, landing large forces in a small area like the present is extremely dangerous, and the threat has not yet been lifted.

With the troops and heavy weapons that can be obtained at present, although it has been strengthened a little due to the repair of Cherbourg port, the result can only be an extremely unfavorable war of attrition, and it is impossible to have a decisive battle with the main force of the German army advancing on a large scale with Normandy as its base.

The Movements of the Mountbatten Army

Then what about the Mountbatten Army, which has more than 40 American and Canadian divisions waiting in southeastern England, showing a second landing posture, trying to contain the main force of the German army? Will this army come to Normandy to rescue Montgomery's underperforming troops? Or will it land in the Ostend and Dieppe areas to seek a decisive battle? Or will it take a middle ground and land on the east bank of the Orne River in the Seine estuary, immediately connect with Montgomery's army, and attempt to advance towards Paris? It is still impossible to predict. But at the present stage, the enemy's strategy of using the Normandy landing army to lure the main force of the German army has obviously not succeeded, and the purpose of making Normandy an operational base for the future decisive battle cannot be said to have been completed. And will the Mountbatten Army, which was originally prepared as a separate army, come here to rescue in succession and merge into one army, or will it start to move towards the planned landing base, but lead to indecision?

Materialism

However, this strategy, without taxes, will eventually use its absolutely superior amount of materials to continue to advance from the front. In this landing operation, the enemy, who came with overwhelming superiority in sea, land, and air, gradually showed signs of fatigue due to subsequent losses, which could not be concealed. The reasons are:

First, after the start of the landing battle, about one-third of the first-line aircraft were used quickly, so the fatigue and losses of personnel increased. The number of aircraft lost in June broke the record, exceeding 2,000. Second, in addition, due to the appearance of the V-1, most fighters were mobilized to defend the British mainland, and long-range aircraft were mobilized to detect the launch bases of the V-1. Third, although the airfields in southern England were damaged by the V-1 and could not be used, the anxiety of the people increased. Moreover, although the British and American air forces have an advantage in quantity, if the V-1 continues to bomb London, although the British and Americans boast that they will continue to bomb Berlin and other major German cities, there has been no news since the Anglo-American air raid on Berlin two weeks ago.

Of course, it is too early to say that the Anglo-American air superiority in Europe has been shaken by this example. As for the ground forces, the British and American sides have prepared a landing force of about 80 to 90 divisions. These are the number of divisions that have been trained to land in front of the enemy and establish bridgeheads. After the bridgehead is secured, not only will they go to the British mainland, but there are also preparations to directly transport 2 to 3 million troops and supplies in batches from the United States and Canada to the mainland. This should also be taken into consideration. (To be continued) (Translated from the Yomiuri-Hochi, July 10)

Shortwave Radio Transmitters: Strict Prohibition of Use and Concealment – Statement by the Japanese Military Police Captain

On December 18th of the year before last, the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army and Navy issued a proclamation prohibiting the use of shortwave radio transmitters, stipulating that anyone who possesses such a radio transmitter must send it to the authorities for modification. The proclamation has been in effect for a year and a half, but it has been found that there are still a considerable number of people concealing prohibited radios and using them secretly. Recently, the Shanghai Military Police conducted an investigation and found that a considerable number of large commercial firms were secretly concealing prohibited radios. This shows that there are still a large number of prohibited radios remaining in Shanghai, which is the source of malicious rumors. The military authorities have decided to actively crack down on this. On the 2nd, the captain of the Shanghai Military Police issued a statement, issuing a serious warning to violators. The statement is recorded as follows: The Shanghai Military Police is cracking down on those who secretly conceal and use prohibited radios, and have found a considerable number of violators. The Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army and Navy issued a proclamation on December 18, Showa 17 (1942). The prohibition of the manufacture, use, and transfer of these prohibited radios is a well-known fact. Despite repeated and thorough guidance by the authorities concerned, there are still those who arbitrarily conceal them, neglecting the prohibition to an extreme degree. The Shanghai Japanese Military Police will not tolerate those who violate the Japanese military proclamation, and will confiscate them, imprison them, fine them, and suspend their business in accordance with military law. In the future, violators will continue to be inspected from time to time in order to ensure the security of the law. In addition, those who report themselves before being discovered will be given lenient treatment in accordance with the circumstances.

Electricity Use Restricted Again: Earnest and Voluntary Conservation – Statement by Secretary-General Wu

Secretary-General Wu of the Municipal Government made the following statement regarding the re-restriction of electricity use: Electricity is necessary for modern urban life, but in this time of war, with reduced coal production and inconvenient transportation, every country and every city is deliberately seeking ways to save electricity. Electricity use in this city has been restricted since last December, and a summer electricity conservation campaign was also launched in May of this year. Although each has achieved considerable results, and most citizens are aware of the need to conserve voluntarily, a closer examination of electricity use in some areas still reveals considerable waste, and there is still room for further restriction. For example, electric fans, elevators, heating and cooling equipment, electric machines for entertainment and games, electric lights for shop windows and signs, non-public swimming pools, electric bulbs above 100 candlepower, and electric lights for outdoor vendors, etc. Although it may be permissible to install more equipment in normal times, in times of war when resources are scarce, all things should be conserved. The cessation of supply will not have a great impact on the lives of citizens. The government has consulted with the relevant parties and decided to prohibit the supply of the above-mentioned equipment from August 1, which has already been announced. As for some flexibility in the implementation, it will still be considered. After this restriction, all users must earnestly shut down, so as not to be subject to penalties such as power outages. Electricity use in other family homes and offices should also be fully exhausted. It is hoped that everyone will conserve electricity to avoid even greater inconvenience when resources are scarce.

Inspector Zhou of the First District Took Office in Zhoupu Yesterday – Warm Welcome from Various Agencies and Organizations

Zhou Huarren, Administrative Inspector of the First District of Shanghai Special Municipality, went to Zhoupu Town on the 1st to take office. Various local agencies and public organizations held a mass welcome meeting in the square in front of the Inspector's Office. After Inspector Zhou delivered a speech, he met with representatives of various groups and agencies and issued a written statement to reporters. A grand soccer performance was held in Zhoupu Park at 4:00 PM, with more than 3,000 spectators, creating an exceptionally enthusiastic atmosphere. The details are recorded as follows:

Welcome Situation

Inspector Zhou arrived in Zhoupu at 10:00 AM. At that time, more than a thousand people, including the Nanhui District Office, the Zhoupu District Office, Tao Xuesheng, deputy commander of the North Bridge District Security Team, Chen Ge, deputy commander of the team, agency representatives, and representatives of public organizations, were holding flags in front of the car to welcome him. Zhou shook hands with representatives of various groups as a courtesy, and then accompanied his entourage into the public office and gave a brief speech to thousands of people standing in the square in front of the public office before they dispersed.

Written Statement

Huarren was ordered to supervise the administration of Nanhui, Fengxian, and Shenchuan counties and will begin work on August 1. At the beginning of the work, everything will be simplified. At this time, when the Greater East Asia War has entered the decisive stage, although the jurisdiction is in the rear, it is located in a strategic area and is a barrier to Greater Shanghai. The duty lies in upholding the government's three major policies—ensuring security, increasing production, and rectifying thought—and striving to supervise subordinates so that the central government's policies are implemented in the local government. Furthermore, I will uphold Mayor Chen's purpose of honesty, integrity, and love for the people and practice it personally so as not to fail in my duties. The office of the public office has just been established, and there are many things to be dealt with. I hope that my fellow countrymen and elders, as well as the long-term officials of the allied countries, will come forward and teach me. It is a great honor for me and a great honor for the region.

Grand Soccer Game

At 4:00 PM, all sectors of Zhoupu Town held a grand soccer performance in the town's park to celebrate the August 1 Renaissance Festival and welcome Inspector Wu's arrival. Before the game, Inspector Zhou led the ceremony, and Chief Jian Dong, director of the Shanghai Special Municipal Security Office, gave a speech to the people in the field. The two sides of the soccer performance were the famous Chinese and Western teams in Shanghai: the Lianyi team and the West team, which was a disguised form of the police team. The two teams had more than 30 members, all of whom came to Zhou from Shanghai. Before 3:00 PM, the field was already full of spectators, with an estimated 3,000 people. At exactly 4:00 PM, Inspector Zhou performed the opening kickoff ceremony. The strength of the two sides was equal, and the competition was fierce, so the performance was full of highlights. The first half ended with a score of 4 to 3, with the West team slightly ahead. In the second half, under the leadership of team captain Xu Wenkui, Lianyi launched a strong counter-attack, and the final score was a draw. The total result was 6 to 6.

### Cafes on Tibet Road Fined for Operating Past Hours; Unified Enforcement in Nanshi and West Shanghai

Cafes must close no later than 12:00 AM, and operations resembling dance halls are prohibited. Violators will be dealt with severely according to the regulations. The Bureau's Administrative Section discovered that the cafe operated by the Central Western Restaurant was operating past hours and, in accordance with regulations, ordered a seven-day suspension. Jazz Cafe was fined 5,000 yuan for operating past hours, and the Queen Wanshoushan Bookstore was warned. In the future, any entertainment venues in all districts found to be in violation will be severely punished according to the law.

Commentary

### A Sigh for the Frenzied Stock Market

— Qi Hua

Regarding the activities of the Chinese stock market, we have said a lot in the past. We have praised the good aspects and criticized the bad aspects. Our understanding is: the securities market is where entrepreneurs obtain long-term capital and where savers manage their floating capital. Stocks are by no means purely speculative chips, and the stock market is not a gambling place for betting big or small.

However, in recent years, various economic activities in Shanghai have often been unreasonable and unorthodox. Where there is profit, not only do people flock to it in shock, but they often push aside many good laws and regulations, regardless of right or wrong, and without choosing means, they only know how to reach out and grab money. The recent stagnation of the stock market over the past six months, as well as the sudden surge in the recent period, can be said to be a consistent expression of this bad style.

To say something not entirely dogmatic, most people in Shanghai do not treat stock trading as a normal transaction at all. People who issue stocks often only know how to use stocks as a tool to swindle funds from retail investors. Today Company A, tomorrow Company B, today increase capital, tomorrow raise stock prices, making the market full of new stocks, and the number of stock chips has been unnecessarily inflated. On the other hand, ordinary stock investors often use ears instead of eyes, follow blindly, and do not ask about the company's content, only looking at how big households operate, following the trend and taking short-term profits, and knowing nothing else. What is even more regrettable is the negligence of duty by ordinary stock brokers, eating plates, lending at high interest rates, and soliciting business indiscriminately. Some even conduct over-the-counter transactions with customers in a purely short-selling manner, rushing to trade outside the market all day long. The securities exchange authorities often turn a blind eye to these things, allowing the stock market to rise and fall without correction, thus further contributing to the abnormal development of the stock market in the past.

Since the price of goods and gold and the rise in yarn have stabilized slightly, funds from various places have returned to Shanghai slightly, the money market has been relatively relaxed, and the Central Reserve Bank has allowed good stocks to be used as collateral or to pay part of the deposit reserve, the stock market has gradually progressed and improved day by day. But unexpectedly, there was another frenzied rise from then on. In just six or seven days, all the market prices that had fallen in the past six months were restored. Several popular stocks even established new high prices, and the bulls finally raised their eyebrows, but the problem of short squeezes also arose from then on. Many brokers who specialize in short-selling business were especially squeezed out of breath, and had to ask the exchange to stop trading on the one hand, and issue rogue-style "settlement prices" to seek settlement on the other hand. This short squeeze seems sudden at first glance, but it is actually the inevitable poison of the unorthodox operation of the stock market in the past. The central key is the excessive prevalence of over-the-counter transactions. In this situation, we believe that this is a good opportunity to clean up the stock market, a good time for Kong Ming to teach speculators. But unexpectedly, the measures taken by the exchange authorities were actually to suspend business for one day, which is really confusing. Why don't the exchange authorities rectify discipline and revoke the licenses of those brokers who do not abide by the rules of the industry? They have already "settled prices" outside the market. Isn't that enough to prove that they are illegally trading outside the market? Instead of banning "settlement prices," they suspend business for a day, giving convenience to those who settle prices. Where is the legal system? Where is the decency? Is it possible that "short selling" should be encouraged and protected, over-the-counter transactions should be promoted, and illegal brokers should be condoned?

Big players operate, retail investors lose money, brokers are absurd, and the measures taken by the exchange are inappropriate. Looking at the current stock market, I really can't help but stop writing in despair. I heard that the securities exchange supervision has telegraphed the ministry to ask for instructions on the suspension and settlement prices. We can only wait and see for the sequel.

### Electricity Conservation and Suggestions

— Xu Yongxi

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, due to the shortage of coal, electricity restrictions have been reduced three times. Recently, the newspapers announced that electricity will be reduced by another 50%. However, some of the past electricity reduction methods are not in line with public sentiment. For example, legitimate production industries are affected by electricity and cannot start work one after another, resulting in shutdowns. However, general consumption and entertainment venues have not yet seen a state of electricity shortage. Newspapers still have advertisements such as "×× air conditioning open day and night". Since the reduction of electricity last year, after discounting the average electricity consumption in September, there is still surplus electricity to open air conditioning. Where this electricity comes from is beyond the understanding of the most foolish of us. Therefore, regarding this fourth reduction in electricity, I offer a few suggestions for the authorities to consider, so as to meet the expectations of increasing production and saving money.

Adjust Industrial Electricity Consumption: In the past, most factories were already restricted by electricity and shut down one after another. The only remaining ones are small industries with short capital. They have difficulty meeting expenses on weekdays due to the sluggish market. If the electricity is reduced by another 50% this time, they will inevitably close down, putting the entire production industry on the road to destruction. This will have an impact on the stability of the entire people's livelihood. In the future, the electricity consumption of factories can be applied for. If it is a major production industry, it can be applied for. The company will conduct a strict and detailed investigation to select those that are needed and reduce or exempt the electricity reduction fee.

Shorten the Business Hours of Consumption Venues: Restaurants, cafes, dance halls, clubs, and amusement venues are all in the category of consumption. People have mentioned the matter of various venues disobeying the orders of the authorities in the past, so I won’t repeat them. Previously, the authorities limited business hours to before 11:00 PM, and now it may be possible to move it forward by another hour or half an hour. The authorities must deal with this decisively and resolutely. Those who do not comply with the orders will be immediately stopped from operating.

Limit the Number of Performances in Theaters: Reduce the number of performances in theaters, or stop performing on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, or stop performing on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. This measure is actually beneficial to the theaters. Because most theaters are not very popular now, the average seat sales are four or five percent. Empty talk is of no use. Now there is only one way to dismantle them within a limited time to prevent them from being used.

Prohibit Playing Mahjong at Night: The prevalence of playing mahjong in Shanghai is well known. Its harm, injury to the spirit and finances, has long been discussed by people and does not need to be elaborated. During this period of conservation and gambling ban, it should be strictly prohibited. The electric lights used for playing mahjong are all above 40 watts. The electricity spent in one night is enough for ordinary users to use for ten days. If it is prohibited, it will also help to save electricity. The method can be for the police authorities to cooperate closely with the Baojia chiefs. The first time will be a warning, and the second and third times will be a relatively severe punishment. This measure was also implemented in Su and Xi before the war and should be able to handle it impartially without selling affection, and it will definitely achieve results.

### Averting the Rural Crisis

— Zhang Yipan

"Increase Production" is currently the unanimous and pressing demand of the nation, and also one of the three major urgent tasks of the National Government this year. The abundance or lack of productivity is related to the enjoyment of humankind and the prosperity or decline of the nation. "All things come from the soil," so increasing agricultural production is even more important. The call for increased production fills the air, but the reality of increased production has not yet appeared. The reason why the reality of increased production has not appeared is due to insufficient political power, the prevalence of evil forces, the unrest in rural areas, and economic poverty, among other things. Observing the current plight of farmers, there is indeed a great crisis hidden. Those who have not experienced it firsthand can hardly believe it; not only can the original output not be maintained, but there is also a trend of gradual decline.

There is currently a kind of deformed situation in rural areas. If you have always been a peaceful and self-sufficient farmer, you must now find a powerful old man to associate with or become his nominal adopted son. Otherwise, you will be envied by local bullies and ruffians, leaving you with no place to stand. These hooligans are all unemployed vagrants who live by trickery. Red invitations fly everywhere, for things like setting traps, getting married, freeloading and extorting, gambling, and large sums of money come and go; this is not uncommon, cultivating in them the habit of being idle and lazy. As a result, good farmers are also assimilated by them, abandoning good farming practices to join them. These temporary alliances are actually worse.

Unofficial taxes and miscellaneous levies that are not stipulated by the government are the mortal wounds of rural villages, often exceeding several times the land tax. Today, there's a levy for firewood and grass for the defense army; tomorrow, a levy for the militia. Bizarre terms emerge endlessly. Farmers eke out a meager existence, constantly complaining, to the point where they are angry but dare not speak out. If they don't deliver the payment by the specified date, they might get beaten with whips and rifle butts. They have no ability to resist, so they can only lower their heads and endure the pain. Eventually, farmers who were once able to sustain themselves turn to other occupations, creating an abnormal phenomenon.

Farmers are already very distressed in normal times. After the ravages of war, harvests have been sharply reduced, and they are often living beyond their means. In addition, due to years of materials control, the government agencies often buy at low prices, and they hope to exchange for low-price rations, but in reality they have long been exploited and embezzled by unsound rationing agencies. By the time the farmers receive the rations, the quantity is extremely small. So they have no choice but to seek the black market, creating a situation where the exchange of materials goes against the grain. Farming is not enough to cover the cost, and people generally regard farming as a dangerous path, with many tending towards abandoning it altogether.

Farmers live beyond their means, and capital is scarce during the farming season, forcing them to borrow high-interest loans at rates much higher than usury. Everyone looks forward to the next harvest to repay their debts. During the rice harvest season, the market is saturated, and food prices depreciate. Farmers, disregarding the low prices, are forced to sell because they are under pressure from debt collectors, and they can only endure the pain and sell to repay their debts. The lower the price, the more they sell, and even the food that should be reserved for sustenance must be sold off. Therefore, it is urgently hoped that the government authorities will quickly use strong political power to provide relief to rural areas, pacify hooligans, abolish excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, adjust rationing, attract urban idle capital to organize banking consortia, guide idle capital to proper channels, strengthen agricultural loans, establish rural security, promote economic prosperity, and make farmers happy to produce, so that the goal of increased production can be achieved. Commerce and industry will also inevitably revive, then the people will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate. (Moved repayment for academic study)

### Nanyang Hospital Offers Free Health Checkups for Children; Beneficiaries of This Newspaper's Aid Eligible for Checkups

A letter from Nanyang Hospital states: "Previously, considering the difficult lives and heavy responsibilities of elementary school teachers, this hospital held free tuberculosis screenings from May 1st to July 31st to express our hospital's humble intention to serve society. Now that this program has ended, we are gratified by the excellent results, thanks to the assistance of all parties. Furthermore, considering that children are the pillars of the nation in the future, the Nanyang Group, during this extraordinary period, recognizes that malnutrition can easily lead to illness, and that the most serious cases can affect them for life and impact the nation. Considering this, we dare not neglect our position as medical professionals and strive to remedy the situation in hopes of averting the worst. In particular, we feel unlimited sympathy for students receiving scholarships and loans, who are generally outstanding but from impoverished backgrounds. Therefore, we have agreed on a free children's health checkup program and scheduled its implementation. We are sending you a copy of the program and respectfully request your assistance, which we eagerly anticipate."

All children receiving scholarships from Shenbao and loans from Xinwenbao are eligible to benefit from this program.

The term "children" in this program refers to those in need of examination who can go directly to the social service departments of the two newspapers, Jia Xin. Each person receives a form, which, after being signed by the department as pertaining to the child, is taken to the social department of Shanghai Nanyang Hospital at 77 Luoyang Road, where they will obtain an examination certificate and be sent to the relevant departments for examination. The form will be filled in with details and treatment recommendations.

Examination dates: Tentatively set for four months, from October 10th to December 9th, from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily, excluding Sundays and public holidays.

Number of examinations: Tentatively set at 25 people per day, with the number to be increased as the weather cools down.

This program is subject to amendment at any time.

### Liu Dunyu Hall Donates Large Sum to Aid the Poor; Mr. Liu Bonian's Benevolence Is Praiseworthy

A letter from Mr. Liu Bonian states: "Years of disasters continue, and the people's livelihoods are difficult. As we enter summer, epidemics are rampant, and the suffering of the poor and sick is even deeper. The current situation is dire, like a pestle pounding away. Therefore, I have donated 55 art folding fans made by myself, originally given to Hexie, worth a total of 16,500 yuan, together with 50,000 yuan raised through Liu Dunyu Hall, totaling 66,500 yuan, to your organization's poverty relief fund, to fulfill my personal wish to relieve poverty and sickness and to care for the orphaned and destitute. In addition, Liu Dunyu Hall has donated 10,000 yuan to your newspaper's scholarship fund. Herewith, I am submitting three receipts. I hope you will keep them and provide a receipt."

Liu Dunyu Hall, with a compassionate heart, generously provides aid. In addition to scholarships, it also spends a large sum to help the poor. Its enthusiasm for public welfare is truly a model for society. And Mr. Bonian, not deterred by the trouble, not only donated and sold art folding fans but also went around raising funds for Liu Dunyu Hall, acting bravely for a righteous cause, which is truly commendable! On behalf of the impoverished people who benefit, we express our deepest gratitude.

We have heard that Mr. Liu, in order to further realize his grand vision of relief, is preparing to offer another 1,000 of his beautiful folding fans in the near future for a charity sale broadcast on the radio. All proceeds will be donated to our poverty relief fund. His tireless dedication to good deeds is truly admirable. It is anticipated that enthusiastic members of society will show great sympathy and respond to the charity event at that time.

### Blood and Tears (8) Navy

— Written by Shutō Ideshi, Translated by Yang

For example, using gasoline engines to achieve semi-submerged navigation was also an important issue at the time. The speed of the No. 6 boat was 8 nautical miles on the surface and 4 nautical miles underwater. The speed of other boats was about the same. Since submarines had the nickname "Sea Turtle," those involved hoped to maintain their concealment and strive for speed and range similar to surface navigation.

But migration was very dangerous, especially when navigating with the snorkel, which looked like a Japanese pipe, exposed on the surface of the water. If a large wave crashed over it, there was an immediate danger of flooding. There was also a plug on the snorkel that could be closed if there was a danger of flooding, but the problem was whether there was enough time, which required taking a big risk. Lieutenant Commander Sakuma boldly attempted this on the No. 6 boat, which had the worst performance. On April 11, Meiji 43 (1910), the First Submarine Squadron was cruising from the Seto Inland Sea to Beppu. However, according to regulations, the No. 6 boat was not allowed to participate in the operation. On April 15, it operated in the Inland Sea with the mother ship Alexander Maru, heading towards Shinminato Offshore. The time was 9:50 AM, when Lieutenant Commander Sakuma began the experiment of semi-submerged navigation.

At this time, the No. 6 boat was in a fully submerged state, but the Alexander Maru thought it was the beginning of submerged navigation training and did not pay attention. In fact, they also wanted to conduct an experiment of sinking to the bottom of the sea at the same time.

However, because the submergence time was too long, they gradually felt that something was wrong and immediately reported the situation to the mother ship Hanasaki, which was anchored in the Wu Naval Base. The Hanasaki immediately reported to the Naval Base, so many destroyers and water minesweepers were dispatched to the area. The mother ship Toyohashi, which was in Seki, also rushed over to search for the sunken place day and night. At 3:00 PM on the 16th of the following day, the naval mine sweepers of the Fuji and Ibuki finally discovered the sunken hull. But rescue was difficult, so it was towed to a shallow water area. This was at 1:00 PM on the 17th.

According to the equipment of submarines at that time, no one would have thought that there could be any survivors after such a long time. But the only question was whether they wanted to know the situation of the first accident of the Imperial Navy submarine. In fact, a similar incident had occurred in a certain country's navy not long ago, and the people on board had behaved shamefully, which was outrageous.

The hearts of Lieutenant Colonel Shizhi and Lieutenant Commander Nakashiro, who were the first to drill into the No. 6 boat, contained a rather complex emotion in their grief.

But after inspecting the narrow boat for a week, the lieutenant colonel shouted "Good!" and burst into tears. (127)
