### One Year Anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Solidifies the Belief in Inevitable Victory; Acting Chairman Chen and Ambassador Tani Issue Statements

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Today (30th) marks the one-year anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. At a time when successive victories are being achieved in the Pacific theater, and the Greater East Asia War is entering a decisive stage, it is imperative that we strengthen Sino-Japanese cooperation to fulfill the alliance, and even more so to exert our full strength to complete the war. On this anniversary of the alliance, Acting Chairman Chen of our National Government has issued a special statement, clarifying the significance of the commemoration and instructing the people of the nation. The full text of the statement is recorded as follows:

Acting Chairman Chen's Statement

The 30th of this month marks the first anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and the 6th of next month marks the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. The former completely swept away the traces of unequal treaty constraints that China had suffered for a century, fully restoring the original appearance of East Asian compatriots. The latter established the fundamental principles of independence, autonomy, mutual coexistence, and co-prosperity for East Asian nations, enabling all East Asian countries and ethnic groups to unite as one, cooperate with one heart, and break the oppression and exploitation of Anglo-American colonialism, so that each East Asian

Nation

may rely on its own inherent characteristics to ensure its survival and development, and rely on its interconnected relationships of mutual respect and mutual assistance to strive for coexistence and co-prosperity. The spirit and purpose of both are consistent from beginning to end. Over the past year, the development of the situation has made the meaning of this treaty and this declaration all the more real and valuable. Speaking of the former, not only has the troop withdrawal issue, which the people of the country have been anxiously awaiting, been concretely resolved, but also the right to station troops based on the Boxer Protocol has been resolutely abandoned due to the sincerity of our allies. Not only can the doubts of the people of the country regarding past diplomatic documents be dispelled like clouds and mist due to the invalidation of the Sino-Japanese

Basic Relations

Treaty and all its associated documents, but also the concerns about China's freedom and unity in political and economic terms can be completely eliminated due to the conclusion of the alliance treaty. Not only can the expectations of the people of the country that peace can only be realized by returning to the state before the Lugouqiao Incident be fulfilled, but also, with the recovery of concessions, the abolition of extraterritoriality, and the abandonment of the right to station troops, it has actually exceeded several times over, and the cornerstone of righteous peace between China and Japan can be laid here. Furthermore, the Anglo-American aggressors, using East Asians to kill East Asians, and using China as a battlefield, with their ambition of scorched earth not yet extinguished, have led to a

State of War

continuing to drag on, and peaceful unification cannot be realized. War cannot be entrusted to illusory miracles, and peace cannot be attained by relying on a slim chance of fate. Time slips away, how can we not feel deeply moved? Speaking of the latter, since the oppression and exploitation of colonialism are intolerable to the East Asian nations, then the efforts of the East Asian nations to seek independence, autonomy, coexistence, and mutual defense will inevitably be hated and resented by Anglo-American colonialists. Understanding this, the closer the time for the final decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War approaches, the more bitter and more brutal the final struggle of Anglo-American colonialists will be, and the more arduous and brighter the task of our East Asian nations to devote their full strength to this battle for the survival of their countries and for the security of East Asia. For both, everything depends on the people of the nation to

Actively Rise Up

and encourage each other to bring into play the true spirit of the Joint Declaration with the determination to sacrifice, and to translate every word of the alliance treaty into reality with realistic efforts. As we commemorate the first anniversary of the alliance treaty and the Joint Declaration, which coincides with the unfolding of the decisive victory of the Greater East Asia War, in addition to expressing our gratitude to our ally Japan for assisting our country in achieving independence and self-reliance, and leading the countries of East Asia in jointly seeking liberation, we have no choice but to redouble our efforts, leading the people internally to eliminate obstacles in order to promote the peaceful unification of the country; externally, we must exert our national strength to follow our allies in completing the sacred war of East Asia, saving China and protecting East Asia. There is no other path.

Ambassador Tani's Statement

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani Masayuki, issued the following statement to commemorate the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty: Today marks the first anniversary of the signing of the Alliance Treaty between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan. This treaty has epoch-making significance, and it is truly a great anniversary for officials and civilians of both China and Japan to celebrate together. Although this treaty has only a very few articles, its stipulated content has extremely important historical significance not only for China and Japan, but also for all countries and ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. For

China and Japan

have clearly indicated in this treaty that they will practice good neighborliness, respect each other's autonomy and independence, and cooperate closely to build a Greater East Asia based on morality, and contribute to world peace. And they have the firm determination to eliminate all obstacles and sources of disaster. From this, the two countries, each in its original state, have established a foundation of lasting friendship. And for the construction of Greater East Asia and the assurance of its stability, they will cooperate closely to exert all their strength. Looking back over the past year, China and Japan, in accordance with the provisions of this treaty, have been

actively cooperating

in various aspects such as military affairs, politics, economy, and culture, on the basis of mutual respect, mutual benefit, and equality, to strike down the Anglo-American enemies who are invading East Asia, sharing weal and woe, and striving day and night. Therefore, the close ties between the two countries based on morality are now absolutely unshakable. However, according to the current situation in East Asia, the United Kingdom and the United States are seeking to realize their ambition of dominating East Asia. They are dividing and echoing each other in East Asia, especially in areas under the rule of Chongqing. They have set up air bases, dispatched troops to garrison, and strengthened the use of Chinese territory as a battlefield, and are gradually turning China into a colony at the expense of the Chinese people. Therefore, the current war situation is increasingly entering a

Critical Stage

At a time when great war results have been achieved in Taiwan and the Philippines in striking down the enemy's American fleet, it is becoming increasingly evident that China and Japan can accomplish their common mission, which is deeply gratifying. Commemorating the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty today has even more profound significance. As we commemorate the anniversary of the alliance treaty, I sincerely wish for a bright future for China and Japan, and hope that as the war situation progresses, the two countries will further strengthen their cooperation and renew their firm determination to strive to achieve the lofty goals of this treaty.

### Ba Maw Phones Philippine President to Encourage Combat

Rangoon, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Myanmar's Head of State, Ba Maw, issued a statement on the 25th to the President of the Republic of the Philippines, Laurel, encouraging the Philippines in the decisive battle. The original text is as follows: To His Excellency President Laurel, The enemy forces are currently attacking fiercely in order to gain a foothold in the Philippines. During this intense battle period, I represent the entire people of Myanmar to offer sympathetic assistance to Your Excellency. We, the people of Myanmar, fully understand the burden of the Philippines, and are fiercely attacking the enemy's vast material resources. Myanmar will also resist the enemy's barbaric attacks for a long time, but the will of us East Asians has not been broken. We believe that our Philippine comrades will be able to coexist and perish with all of East Asia in this war. The Philippines and Myanmar will resolutely defend their fortresses.

### Asahi Shimbun Special Correspondent Mr. Ina's Recent Visit to the Western Front, Impressions Gained Indicate Enemy Forces Should Be Warded Against, Especially the Airborne Units Invading the Netherlands Area

The Western Front situation is as follows:

It may not be possible to say that the western fortresses are strong fortresses that can resist the overwhelming material strength of the enemy, but the final line with the German mainland as the stage, in addition to the tank trenches and fortress facilities, the German people's defense line must also be considered by the British and Americans. As a result, the focus of the attack is extremely cautious, avoiding the western fortress line and choosing to enter from the Belgium and Netherlands area. This is a common tactic for the British and Americans. If it is said that Aachen cannot be broken through, the war is still limited to the outer perimeter of Germany, then a real invasion of the German mainland will not occur.

The British and Americans will publicize that due to the continued pursuit of the German army after the occupation of France, and due to the chaos of the defeated German army, the period of Germany's surrender, that is, the end of the European war, will be unexpectedly fast. The annihilation battle of the enemy's airborne units in Ating gave a great blow in this battle, showing Germany's fighting spirit, contrary to the enemy's expectations, and extremely focused on national defense posture, not only geographical, that is, the defense of the fortress line, but also mobile defense. The defeat of the German army in the Battle of Farange and Falaise in the Faya territory was actually a battle to avenge their humiliation, and it was a sign that Germany had begun a decisive battle, which boosted the morale of the entire army.

Germany and France Cooperate Again

Germany sees this as a sign that it will improve soon. Although it cannot be rashly said that this is optimistic material for the future, Germany has indeed gained enough time to prevent the enemy from intruding into the real final line. As far as the enemy, the British and Americans, are concerned, before the terrible attack that Germany is trying to launch begins, Germany has more time to defend, which is even more painful than cutting the skin. If the war relying on material strength cannot realize the dream of taking Berlin without any stagnation, the advantage of material strength may not be able to achieve decisive war results. In response to the victory in the northern theater, a political counterattack to regain France has also begun in the south. Politicians of the pro-German collaborationist faction who withdrew from Paris and Vichy are planning to regain their motherland, and the time to put it into action has arrived. For a time, both sides seemed to have forgotten this issue due to the tension on the western front. Since the fall of Paris, France has disappeared from the world's vision, and now it has suddenly begun to attack the Tegoul faction and the communist system front. [German-French cooperation] was once again loudly rumored. Now that I think about it, Marshal Petain and Prime Minister Laval should respond to Germany's request to move to eastern France. In Germany, this is a great victory. In law, he is the formal French chairman. In practice, there is no second person who can win over 40 million French people other than Marshal Petain.

The British and American occupied areas that have lost Marshal Petain cannot even operate Parisian politics smoothly. The lives of ordinary citizens are still confined to the dark of unease. The tendency for the infighting between the Tegoel faction and the communist elements to gradually intensify with the entire France as the stage is very clear even in fragmentary information. The Sorre occupied by the Communist Party declared itself the first Soviet region after the Anglo-American occupation. Tegul was very embarrassed. The military and political commander of Paris, Koenig, refused to demand the disarming of the Tegul elements and went to London to discuss it. This fact illustrates the chaotic situation in France.

Hitler's Statement

Regarding the transfer of Marshal Petain and the Laval government, the enemy will publicize that these people have become German prisoners or are imprisoned, but in terms of region, because the entire territory of France has been ravaged by the British and Americans, there is no factual administrative area, and there is no object for administering government affairs. The French government naturally has to stand by and wait for the situation to clarify. However, with the development of the situation, the French government has formed a German-French Cooperation Committee. The French government's minister in charge of German affairs, Ambassador Brignon, was changed to full power over Germany. Under him is Darnan, the Director-General of Public Security, as the Commissioner of French Volunteers, General Britt as the Commissioner of Prisoner Relations, and Minister of Labor Welfare, Diar, as the Commissioner of French Labor Issues. In addition, Lucier, who cooperated with us in the eastern French press, took the important position of Minister of Propaganda, each taking charge of the implementation of German military affairs.

The Anglo-American army on the declaration's French front and the Tegoel faction or the communist parties used newspapers and radios to launch a fierce offensive. The advanced base has crossed the Rhine River and advanced to the front line. The recent meeting between the three commissioners Brignon, Darnan, and Dia and the Head of State of Greece was the starting point for this political counterattack. It is faintly heard that Hitler first provided the French side with a concrete and detailed war plan during this meeting. He also gained a complete understanding of the previous military situation and insisted on breaking the Anglo-American forces to recapture the capital Paris as the goal and set off grandly.

Although the mountains and rivers of France have been broken, Germany still has 1 million French laborers and 1 million French prisoners. It is not difficult to gather the power of these 2 million people in the future to instigate the recapture of the motherland. Chairman Petain, who has been confined to his room for a while, has also been in high spirits recently, going out for a walk every morning, leisurely and optimistic about the future of the motherland. This shows that France has a bright future. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, October 2) Editorial

### One Year Anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance

Today marks the one-year anniversary of the signing of the alliance treaty between China and Japan in Nanjing last year. We have opened the full text of the alliance treaty and read it through. At the same time, we reviewed the relationship between China and Japan over the past year, as well as the general situation in Greater East Asia, and we have deep feelings. We will state what we have seen as follows.

The conclusion of the alliance treaty is based on the common objective requirements between the two countries. Since the signing of the basic treaty in November of the 29th year, the relationship between the two countries has entered a new stage. With the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and the participation of the National Government in the war, and the implementation of the new China policy by Japan, the objective requirements between the two countries are completely consistent. Therefore, we will further sign the alliance treaty. However, we believe that how to cooperate in the spirit of the alliance to complete the common requirements is the policy of actively realizing the alliance treaty.

What are the common requirements? Of course, it is to strive for victory in the Greater East Asia War. The Japanese side has already mobilized the full strength of 100 million people to destroy the British and Americans, especially the great victory in the sea battle in Taiwan and the Philippines, which laid the foundation for the victory of the Greater East Asia War. In a narrow sense, this is the Japanese side has already fulfilled part of the responsibility of the allied country to us. As far as the Chinese National Government is concerned, some parts of the alliance treaty need to be fully adjusted when the overall peace is restored and the state of war ends. Therefore, the realization of comprehensive peace is, on the one hand, to enhance the guarantee of striving for victory in the Greater East Asia War, and on the other hand, it is a condition for fully restoring the normal relationship between China and Japan. However, according to the current situation, instead of talking about realizing comprehensive peace, it is better to start with the innovation of politics in the peace zone, so that the politics are on the right track, the public security is established, and the people's livelihood is stable. It is necessary to express this fact and strive for the people under the rule of Chongqing to return to their hearts. At this time, comprehensive peace will be realized without seeking it. However, over the past year, how is the effort in this area worth the authorities' reflection? Even if we take a step back, according to the exchange of notes in the alliance treaty, during the continuation of the state of war, adjustments can be made at any time by agreement between the two countries as permitted by the situation. Therefore, although there is the fact that Chongqing is delaying the war, we can still seek progress in political and economic aspects and make partial adjustments according to the spirit of the treaty. What about the efforts in this area in the past year? It is also worth the reflection of the Chinese and Japanese authorities.

Secondly, we must especially understand that the alliance treaty was revised and signed from the basic treaty. At that time, the determination to revise, as well as the exchange of notes of the alliance treaty and the protocol, were all proposed by the Japanese government on its own initiative. Why is the Japanese government willing to propose a revised treaty of mutual respect and mutual benefit? Of course, it is to express sincerity in friendship and cooperation with China, and it is a concrete manifestation after the implementation of the new China policy. However, although there have been various facts in the efforts over the past year, in order to promote greater cooperation between the two countries, this should be the most urgent situation at present. In order to strive for the victory of the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, we also hope that our allies can further promote the new China policy step by step and concretely realize it step by step.

Finally, we urge those who are obsessed with the British and Americans to be awakened from this. In this continental war, the battles in Henan, Hunan, and Guangxi, the fall of Luoyang, Changsha, and Hengyang, the crisis in Guilin, and the repeated defeats in the sea battles in Taiwan and the Philippines have fully exposed the unreliability of the British and Americans. The belief in Greater East Asianism should be strengthened. Strive for work in this position, cooperate with the government, supervise the government, complete the common requirements, and realize the alliance treaty.

### Thailand Strives to Complete Iron Wall Defense Posture

Cooperate in the Greater East Asia Liberation War

Bangkok, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Since the outbreak of the war, Thailand has been engaging in the Greater East Asia Liberation War under the banner of destroying the British and Americans, based on the Thai-Japanese alliance. Since the establishment of the Abhaiwongse Cabinet, it has expressed its determination to complete the war and defend the country through Thai-Japanese cooperation. Since the formation of the cabinet, it has been preparing the domestic situation, actively building the national army, gathering the total strength of the country, and striving to establish a strong national defense posture. The various measures appropriate for the decisive battle cabinet have been implemented. First, the head lineup of the National Defense Army was adjusted. Then, at the beginning of September, the Thai government formulated the National Defense Council Law, established the National Defense Council, and the chairman was composed of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Army, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief, the Chief of Staff of the National Defense Army, the Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Navy, and five government-recommended committee members, with the Prime Minister serving as the Chairman of the National Defense Council. Article 5 of the law stipulates that the National Defense Council has the task of deliberating on military, economic, political, national security, and national defense issues both domestically and internationally, and has the authority to carry out undertakings related to the prosecution and completion of the war. This has the same character as the Japanese Supreme War Guidance Conference. After the rainy season, in order to prevent enemy air raids and implement various air defense countermeasures, the National Homeland Air Defense Command was newly established, with Deputy Minister of National Defense Shatnyudarak concurrently serving as the commander, and the Air Defense Bureau, which was transferred from the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the Ministry of National Defense during the Pibul Cabinet era, was still under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Defense, so that information and orders could be quickly transmitted. On the other hand, in Bangkok and other major cities and towns, all but women and children were engaged in daily affairs, and factories and companies organized defense groups to ensure complete rescue and fire prevention during air raids. At the same time, the Japanese garrison in Thailand is also actively assisting Thailand's defense, especially air defense. Whenever enemy planes attack, Japanese and Thai soldiers and civilians must cooperate closely to destroy enemy planes and have now completed an iron wall defense posture.

### Japanese-Thai Cultural Association Commemorates Prime Minister Koiso's Congratulatory Telegram

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Japanese Prime Minister Koiso sent a telegram to Thai Prime Minister Abhaiwongse on the 28th, the second anniversary of the conclusion of the Japanese-Thai Cultural Agreement, as follows: The conclusion of the Japanese-Thai Cultural Agreement, which is intended to promote and enhance the friendly relations between the two countries by virtue of the spiritual, cultural, and even religious similarities that have existed between the two countries since ancient times, is something that we deeply celebrate. Today, at a time when the Greater East Asia War is in full swing, we believe even more that the spiritual cooperation of the people of the two countries will, because of the conclusion of this agreement, become the driving force for breaking through the difficulties ahead. Here, in addition to expressing my gratitude to Your Excellency in the capacity of President of the Cultural Academy for your past efforts, I also earnestly hope that Your Excellency can make further efforts in the future.

### One Week War Situation in Various Parts of Greater East Asia

Japanese Air Force Re-Attacks Chengdu Airport

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The war situation for the week is as follows: 1. On the western part of the Japanese mainland, about 100 enemy B-29 aircraft attacked various parts of Kyushu and Jeju Island on the 25th in order to cut off Japanese supplies to the Philippines, but 24 of them were shot down and destroyed by the Japanese Air Defense Force. In addition, the Japanese Air Force stationed in China pursued to Chengdu on the 26th and destroyed a total of 57 aircraft, causing most of the attacking enemy aircraft to collapse. 2. In China, the Japanese army's operations against the Guilin-Liuzhou area are still progressing smoothly. 3. In Myanmar, since the beginning of this month, enemy aircraft have been actively active in the entire city of Myanmar. Since the 18th, the results of the Japanese army's counterattack in the Yangon area have been 17 enemy aircraft shot down (including 6 unconfirmed) and 14 enemy aircraft destroyed. In addition, the British army's actions to respond to the Philippines operation from the Indian Ocean are also gradually becoming more active. 4. In Palau, the Japanese army on Peleliu Island still secures the central highlands and fights bravely, and those on Angaur Island also accurately secure the northwestern corner area and engage in fierce battles. The Japanese army on Morotai continues to engage in hand-to-hand combat, achieving great war results and preventing the enemy army from building and using airfields. 5. In the Philippines, about one division of the enemy on Leyte Island and about two divisions of the enemy on Dulag engaged in counterattacks and ambushes, and fierce land operations are still unfolding. The Japanese Air Force is still fully exerting its spirit of suicidal attacks, attacking enemy fleets in the bay day and night, and achieving great war results.

China Mainland Frontline Base, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – In order to punish the US Air Force bombing squad stationed in Chongqing for the air raid on Kyushu and Jeju Island on the 25th, the Japanese bomber squadron braved bad weather on the night of the 26th and strongly attacked Chengdu Airport for the fourth time, achieving great war results. A total of 60 enemy aircraft were bombed and destroyed. On that night, a large formation of elite enemy bombers launched a retaliatory attack on Chengdu Airport, the resting place for B-29 aircraft, causing B-29 aircraft dispersed at Chengdu Airport to be successively burned down, and about ten ground facilities were bombed and burned, illuminating the area as if it were daytime. All of the B-29 aircraft groups south of the large runway were hit, and another attacking team also dropped countless bombs on the southwest of the airfield, with the wings of the enemy B-29 aircraft in the moon. Two locations were hit and caught fire, and the B-29 aircraft parked in the northwest were subjected to fierce bombing and burning.

### Suzhou Plans to Organize a General Rally

Suzhou, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Since our ally Japan won an unprecedented victory in the East China Sea off Taiwan and the Philippines, all circles in the Suzhou Provincial Capital have felt deeply happy, and in order to realize the final victory as soon as possible, they have organized a preparatory committee for a general rally to celebrate the victory. After three meetings and discussions, the donation part was extremely enthusiastic. The donation methods of all circles are recorded below: Civil servants donate one month's salary, shops donate 5% of one day's business income, military and police officers above the rank of lieutenant and inspecting officer are the same as civil servants.

Entertainers and shop assistants donate 30% of one day's income, and entertainment venues donate the profits of one day. The heads of agencies automatically handle the matter.

### Fierce Battle for the Scheldt Estuary: German Forces Retreat from Tilburg

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports, according to the German official war bulletin: The fierce fighting in the Netherlands has expanded to the Scheldt estuary and the entire area between it and 's-Hertogenbosch. The battle of Bergen is particularly intense. Repeated offensives launched by enemy forces there with direct tank support have been repelled. Tilburg, to the east, has fallen into enemy hands after fierce fighting.
Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: Although the German position at the Scheldt bridgehead and southern Beveland is increasingly difficult, the anti-Axis forces are still blocked outside the port of Antwerp. This is the greatest success of the German command. The garrison of the port will continue to resist despite the difficult situation. This difficult situation is due to the anti-Axis forces strengthening their position at the southeastern Beveland bridgehead, and the advance of Canadian forces in the western part of the isthmus. However, German forces are still strong, and the anti-Axis forces must pay a heavy price for any further advance. The Canadian First Army is attacking northwest Brabant and has advanced close to Roosendaal, but the enemy forces attacking Breda have made no progress. General Montgomery's focus of operations is currently on the left flank of the British Second Army, which is advancing northwest and west along the Tilburg-'s-Hertogenbosch line, in an attempt to drive the German forces to the coast. British forces have reached Tilburg after their success. German reinforcements are resisting the advance of British tank columns north and northwest of the city. The situation in that area is not yet stable. German forces have launched a strong counter-offensive west of the Meuse bridgehead at Venlo towards Helmond and Mierlo, on the right flank of the British Second Army. The British forces were caught unprepared and had to abandon some territory. The situation in the Aachen area remains unchanged. Anti-Axis forces have begun local reconnaissance activities in the center of Auvelais and Froidmont, indicating that the deployment of the US Third Army is complete and a general offensive is imminent. The US Seventh Army continued to exert pressure on Sainte-Dié and Gérardmer in the western Vosges on Friday, but without significant success.

### Change of Commander of US Forces in India-Burma-China Theater

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: The White House announced yesterday that General Stilwell, commander of US forces in the India-Burma-China Theater, has been recalled. Henceforth, US forces in India and Burma will be commanded by Lieutenant General Sultan, and US forces in China by Major General Wedemeyer.

### Renewed Conflict Between Chongqing and Communist Forces in Shanxi Province

Guangzhou, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Chongqing government issued a major statement on the 26th, stating that the opposing Chongqing and Communist forces had opened fire in a corner of Shanxi Province, and the reconciliation between the two governments had reached a state of despair. Zhang Pingqun, spokesman for the Chongqing government, met with a group of reporters on the same day to further explain the details of the battle between the Chongqing and Communist forces as follows: Yan Xishan, commander of the Second War Zone, recently met with Chinese and foreign journalists in the northwest region to express his opinions on the Communist Party issue. Afterwards, he was abused and slandered by the Yan'an organ newspaper [Liberation Daily] and Communist military officers such as Chuan Yibo, commander of the Taiyue Military Region. Chuan Yibo, commander of the Taiyue Military Region, openly attacked the Chongqing 61st Army at Tashan, about 30 kilometers east of Linfen, in late August, and was repelled. In early September, the 210th, 212th, 213th, 385th, and 386th brigades of the Communist army formed four large detachments and attacked the 61st Army again at 10:00 AM on September 8. In addition, Communist mobile units attacked from Pingyao and Linfen along the Tongpu Railway. As a result, the Chongqing 72nd Division north of Fushan was forced to retreat to the southwest due to the superiority of the Communist forces.

### Japanese Aircraft Fiercely Attack Enemy Ships and Vessels in Leyte Gulf, Philippine Islands; Remnants in Tacloban Being Swept Up

Manila, 29th (Central News Agency) – The intensity of the Japanese-American battle for Leyte is increasing daily. The enemy forces, attempting to regain air supremacy, have dispatched dozens of transport ships to Leyte Gulf, striving to strengthen their rear supply lines. At the same time, they are also urgently trying to use the occupied Tacloban and Dulag airfields to deploy carrier-based and land-based aircraft. Among these, 70 aircraft have already suffered a devastating blow. The enemy's rear is also actively engaged in airlift operations. On the other hand, they are concentrating tanks to attempt to seize the San Pablo airfield. Fierce battles are currently unfolding for the control of the La Paz and San Roque airfields in the south. Japanese forces on the island are securing the high ground in the west and continuing to attack the enemy's rear positions south of Tacloban with small forces. The current focus of the battle is south of that city, as the enemy forces attempt to seize control of the area near the Dulag and La Paz airfields.

Manila, 29th (Central News Agency) – Japanese air units continued to be active in the Leyte area on the 27th, continuing to fiercely attack enemy warships, landing craft, and airfields under enemy occupation in the gulf. The war results that have been confirmed from the night of the 26th to noon on the 27th are as follows: one enemy transport ship and five destroyers destroyed, one enemy transport ship damaged by bombing, and two enemy aircraft shot down.

Manila, 29th (Central News Agency) – Enemy forces have suffered heavy damage from the continuous fierce attacks by Japanese air units, so the number of enemy aircraft attacks has decreased significantly in recent days. On the 27th, only 200 carrier-based aircraft and less than 100 land-based aircraft attacked various parts of the Philippines. The situation was even more relaxed on the morning of the 28th. In the Palawan area, enemy aircraft attacked only twice, the first time with only 14 large aircraft, and the second time with only 23 aircraft. In the Visayas area, enemy aircraft only carried out scattered attacks, with the sole purpose of patrolling and reconnaissance.

A Certain Japanese Army Base on the Philippine Front Lines, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Kamikaze attack squadron, composed of fighter squadrons, is the essence of the Japanese Navy, and consistently adopts a heroic tactic, fighting to the death as soon as it encounters an enemy mobile force. These suicide squads began a general offensive on the 25th, flying their planes with a calm attitude and the determination to never return. According to their comrades, the details of the squadron's heroic battles are as follows: The first special attack squadron discovered an enemy mobile force in the eastern sea of Leyte Gulf. It immediately used two aircraft to sink a medium-sized aircraft carrier, and one aircraft to damage an aircraft carrier, rendering it unable to navigate, and also sunk a cruiser. Their spirit of disregard for life and fearlessness is truly worthy of emulation.

### Japanese Navy Ministry Praises Kamikaze Squadrons for Heroic Battles

They achieved extremely great results. The members deeply understood righteousness and were incomparably loyal and courageous. In addition to praising their achievements in a separate document, this is hereby announced to the entire army for their information.

### Japanese Army in Taiwan and the Philippines Wins Victory, Laying the Initial Foundation for Certain Victory

Minister of Propaganda Lin Issues Statement

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Allied forces won a great victory in the naval battle of the Philippines, giving the enemy Americans a fatal blow and laying the initial foundation for the victory of the Greater East Asia War. Minister of Propaganda Lin issued a statement on this, and the original words are recorded as follows: The Allied forces have continuously achieved unprecedentedly great war results in the waters off Taiwan and the Philippines in recent days. The good news has been spreading frequently, and all one billion people of East Asia are deeply inspired. Since the Quebec Conference, the enemy Americans and British have decided to adopt an offensive in the Pacific. For months, the enemy Americans have been waiting for an opportunity to move, wantonly bombing the mainland and deliberately scorching the earth, disregarding humanity. In the Pacific, they have concentrated their brutal isolated forces and gone deep into enemy territory, ignoring the taboos of military strategists. Recently, they cunningly attempted to succeed in the waters off Taiwan and the Philippines. The Allied forces waited at ease and seized the divine opportunity, resolutely launching an attack. They not only inflicted heavy damage on the enemy forces, but it will not be difficult to gather and annihilate the enemy forces that landed on Leyte Island, which has lost maritime contact. The Allied forces' operations this time can be said to have achieved great strategic success. The enemy Americans and British still boast of their material superiority, and use this to play with boastful propaganda. However, facts speak louder than words. If they thought that the air force could rampage, why would the battle of Taiwan end in such a rout? If they thought that the navy could win, why would the battle of the Philippines result in such heavy damage that it was almost impossible to rescue? On the contrary, the Allied soldiers, for the sake of their country and East Asia, are not afraid of hardships and do not hesitate to sacrifice. Their bravery in battle can be said to be moving to the gods and causing wind and rain. This is deeply admired by the one billion people of East Asia, and even the enemy Americans and British are chilled by it. This is truly a manifestation of the unique spirit of the East Asian nation, which cannot be imagined by superficial Western materialists. Even if measured by material strength, the same strength, when used ten thousand miles away, compared to a thousand miles away, the disparity in proportion is truly astonishing. Judging from this, the loss of combat capability in this defeat of the enemy Americans, considering the supply in terms of space and time, is at least equivalent to four times their numerical losses. Although the enemy Americans boast of their abundant material resources, they cannot but admit the difficulty of utilizing their material resources. Now the Greater East Asia War is entering a decisive stage, and this victory is the initial foundation for laying the final victory. The enemy Americans have not given up their ambition to dominate East Asia, and it is expected that they will make a desperate gamble and stage a comeback. Our country is a link in Greater East Asia, and our survival is closely related to it. We hope that our compatriots in China and the entire East Asia will rise up together, intensify their efforts, strengthen rear production, strengthen combat power, and gradually become one with the soldiers at the front, holding onto the belief in certain victory, and striving for the brightness of China and the liberation of East Asia.

### Three-Power Conference of Anti-Axis Nations

Location in Negotiations

Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports, Exchange Telegraph reports from London: London, Washington and Moscow are currently busy discussing the location for the year-end meeting of the Big Three. Due to Churchill's advanced age, it is not advisable for him to travel long distances in winter, so the meeting place should preferably be not far from London. De Gaulle was not invited to attend the meeting, but Churchill will go to Paris to hold talks with De Gaulle before the meeting is held.

### Watching the Red Leaves in the Western Hills

— Wu Gong

Every year around the Double Ninth Festival, the maple leaves in the Western Hills of Beijing turn red. A few days ago, a friend of mine happened to fly here from Shanghai, so we decided to take a car out of Xizhimen together five days before the Double Ninth Festival. There is an asphalt road from Xizhimen to the Summer Palace, which is magnificently constructed, so the car ride on it is exceptionally comfortable. In particular, looking back at the scenery of the fields in the western suburbs of Beijing, one can feel a sense of openness. It is said that this beautiful asphalt road is the only political achievement in North China after the Incident. Otherwise, the roads before the Incident would have been badly damaged by now. We only need to look at the road from the Summer Palace to the Western Hills, which used to be a good road! But today it is abandoned and unrecognizable. I haven't walked this road for two years, and many new constructions have been added on both sides. For example, when you pass Weijiacun and approach Pangjiazhuang, you can see a tall building with a strong Manchurian architectural style. This is the North China Equestrian Testing Ground.

### Visiting Cheng Yanqiu at Qinglong Bridge

After passing the Summer Palace, we arrived at Qinglong Bridge. At that time, one of my friends suggested visiting the famous actor Cheng Yanqiu. It turned out that Cheng Yanqiu had retired from the theater world after the Greater East Asia War and was very familiar with my friend. He had been living a secluded life there since last year. Although I have no interest in Peking Opera, I heard from my friend that the general young ladies in Shanghai are now learning Cheng's Peking Opera style, which shows that there is a great situation of [no tune without Cheng]. Why don't I go and see him? We immediately stopped the car in Qinglong Bridge Town and asked the shops for directions to Mr. Cheng's residence before walking into a narrow alley and arriving at the door of No. 3. We knocked on the door and entered. The courtyard was very quiet, but I saw a pile of millet in the courtyard. An old servant led us into the main room, and as the door curtain moved, Mr. Cheng greeted us with a smile. At that time, he was only wearing a pair of black trousers and a black cotton short jacket. Whoever saw him would never know that he was the once extremely popular Peking Opera actor Cheng Yanqiu! Because I have never liked Peking Opera, I have never seen his plays, but I also know that he is a very dramatically accomplished person. He used to have close contact with Li Shizeng and ran a theatrical monthly magazine in the former capital. At that time, he very much wanted to improve the Peking Opera of our country, but this magazine has now been discontinued. It is really unexpected that the impact of the Incident has also affected actors!

We talked for about half an hour. Because of the limited time for sightseeing, we said goodbye without being able to talk freely. However, in this half hour, I also learned a lot of things. It turned out that Mr. Cheng had given up his singing career two years ago. His biggest reason is that he no longer needs to sing to make a living. When he heard me say that Mei Lanfang was also not singing in Shanghai, he said: [We are all getting old now, and our children have all grown up. It's a bit embarrassing to do this again! Moreover, the purpose of singing is nothing more than to fill our stomachs. Since we can live without singing now, why bother to suffer? ]

I felt very sympathetic to Mr. Cheng's current life at that time. His home is still in Beijing, but he lives here alone. Every morning, he runs to a vineyard not far from here. It is said that the vineyard is more than sixty acres in size, so it is enough for him to live on. His eldest son was sent to Geneva by the World School ten years ago. At that time, readers may still remember the Geneva International Academy, which was founded by Li Shizeng to cultivate future talents. The World School selected more than a dozen young Chinese children to study there, and Mr. Cheng's eldest son was one of them. According to Mr. Cheng, his son is now twenty years old and has entered the University of Geneva. Time is really too fast. Thinking back, I also studied at the University of Geneva fourteen years ago. The scenery of Lake Geneva is still vividly in my mind! He also has two sons studying at the Affiliated High School of Fu Jen Catholic University, and a young lady studying at the Women's Normal High School, all in Beijing. Finally, we also talked about Mr. Li Shizeng. It is said that he is nearly seventy years old and has married a German lady in the United States. The joke ended there, and we hurriedly said goodbye and got back in the car to move forward.

### Visiting Ancient Sites at Yelu Chucai's Villa

The car arrived at the foot of the Western Hills and could no longer move forward. We first went to a nearby restaurant for lunch. After lunch, we abandoned the car and used donkeys to go to Biyun Temple first. Speaking of Biyun Temple, today it can be said that no one in the country does not know it, because in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, the coffin of the National Father Sun Yat-sen was first placed here. Therefore, there is still a clothing and hat tomb here, and there is a garrison office, and the person guarding the clothing and hat tomb is still a Cantonese from Guangzhou. However, the so-called Biyun Temple has a very ancient history. In the Yuan Dynasty, it was the villa of Yelu Chucai. Yelu Chucai was a very meritorious figure in our country, and this is a historical fact known to everyone today. According to the tour guide, Yelu Chucai is now not only worshipped by the people of our country, but also admired by many Allied people. It can be seen that in our country, regardless of whether he is a national or not, as long as he has contributed to our country, even a foreigner can be unforgettable to the people of our country forever. According to the inscription on the stone tablet here, Biyun Temple was donated as a temple by Yelu Chucai's son Ali Ji. In the Ming Dynasty, the famous eunuch traitor Wei Zhongxian used this as his living tomb, but Wei was later killed in Guizhou and did not have time to be buried here. It can be seen that a lifetime of treachery is ultimately difficult to fulfill!

Walking into the gate of Biyun Temple, we saw the four large characters [Shadow Red Silent Illumination]. We first went to the Arhat Hall to visit. There are five hundred golden Arhats inside, and the room is full of six Tibetan golden characters. It is said that the pronunciation of those six characters is [Om Mani Padme Hum], which means the same as when we recite [Namo Amitabha]. Inside the gate of Biyun Temple, there is a stone tablet first, and behind the stone tablet is a Buddhist hall. The Buddhist hall displays Buddhist statues of Maitreya Buddha, Guanyin, Manjushri, and Samantabhadra Bodhisattvas. Behind the Buddhist hall is the main hall, namely the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, which displays the National Father's portrait and a coffin model. The front is filled with wreaths from important officials of the National Government placed on the National Father's death anniversary on March 12 this year. However, when the reporters and others went to pay their respects, the memorial hall was being renovated, so these furnishings were moved to a room next door. Behind the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall is the clothing and hat tomb. We were led by the Cantonese who guarded the tomb to the roof to view the scenery of the entire city of Beijing. Because the weather was particularly clear today, with not a single white cloud in the sky, I smiled and said to my friend, it is really a blue sky and white sun tour of the Western Hills!

My friend said that before the Incident, Biyun Temple and Fragrant Hills were respectively managed by two politicians: Li Shizeng managed Biyun Temple, and Xiong Xiling managed Fragrant Hills. Therefore, in the early years of the Republic of China, Li established cultural undertakings at Biyun Temple, while the orphanage founded by Xiong is still at the foot of Fragrant Hills. Unfortunately, we were limited by time and did not have time to visit the orphanage, which is a pity.

### Red Leaves in Fragrant Hills Reflect the Double Clear Villa

It is not very far from Biyun Temple to Fragrant Hills, but it is not easy to explore the entire view of Fragrant Hills, so we decided to still use the method of riding donkeys to go up the mountain to see the red leaves! Coming up the mountain, we saw that the maple leaves had already turned red all over the top of the mountain, symbolizing the light of fire. Everywhere there, you can see the villas of past dignitaries or bankers. We first sat in the Half-Mountain Pavilion for a while, and then dismounted from the donkeys at the Double Clear Villa. The so-called Double Clear Villa was originally the place where Xiong Xiling and his wife rested during their lifetime, but at that time Xiong's wife was still his original wife. We walked into the villa and saw a clear water encircling the courtyard, and the goldfish inside were floating and sinking freely. My friend walked into the courtyard, but there was no one inside, and it was so quiet that everything seemed dead! He couldn't help but sigh, saying: [The living reality has all become history]! It turned out that he used to be very familiar with Xiong, and Xiong's new wife, Ms. Mao, is still often seen in Shanghai. He asked the person watching the house: [Does Madam Mao still come here often?] The old man said listlessly: [She came north once this spring, but she only went to Tianjin to take care of private matters, and soon returned to Shanghai.] My friend lingered there for a long time, murmuring: [What a pair, one three-three, one six-six!] So we walked across the pond. To the north of the courtyard, there is a long stone table with many seats, probably the place where Xiong held banquets in the past! There was a couplet written by Emperor Qianlong hanging there, which read: [Green bamboos fill the courtyard to behold the Dharma's appearance, White clouds fill the valley to recognize the ancestral style,] which is a very good piece of calligraphy.

Coming out of the Double Clear Villa, we arrived at the only scenic spot in Fragrant Hills, which is the Zhaomiao Temple and the Jianxin House that we often see in pictures. The Zhaomiao Temple has now been converted into the Fragrant Hills Branch of the Affiliated Hospital of the Medical College of Peking University, which is a bit of a mood killer! Walking past the Zhaomiao Temple, we saw a scenic spot with pavilions and painted buildings. The so-called Jianxin House is actually the temporary palace of the Qing Dynasty emperors when they came to Fragrant Hills. There is also a clear pool there, with withered lotuses remaining in the pool. I think it must be very cool in summer. Inside the Jianxin House, there are more traces of the Qing Dynasty emperors' brushwork, especially Qianlong's. I didn't have time to remember them all. Coming out of the Jianxin House, we rode our donkeys to the Fragrant Hills Hotel to have some tea and snacks. There are still lodgings available there, with rooms costing only twenty yuan per day, which is much cheaper than in Beijing, but the facilities are too poor. There used to be many hotels in the Western Hills area, but some were destroyed by artillery fire during the Incident. Finally, we picked some red leaves and rode our donkeys down the mountain, and then changed cars and returned. On the way back, we originally wanted to go to Jade Spring Hill and the Quiet Bright Garden again, but it was already too late. The Quiet Bright Garden was originally as famous as the Quiet Pleasant Garden in Fragrant Hills mentioned above, especially the spring water there is excellent. The soda water here is made by drawing from the spring. Unfortunately, it is too cold and the soda water cannot be bought anymore, so we had to return to the city disappointed.

### Anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance: City-Wide Enthusiastic Celebrations

Various Groups Jointly Hold Commemorative Ceremony. Today, the 30th, marks the anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. At this pivotal moment of the Great East Asia Decisive Battle, China and Japan stand shoulder-to-shoulder, sharing the responsibility of advancing towards ultimate victory. Coinciding with this anniversary, our allied Japanese valiant soldiers have repeatedly achieved brilliant victories in the Pacific, Taiwan, Philippine, and Eastern seas, severely damaging stubborn enemies. Its significance is paramount. Therefore, today, the entire nation, from the government to the people, is enthusiastically celebrating. In this city, the municipal government issued a general order to all agencies, instructing all shops and residents to hoist flags in celebration in the morning. Also, celebratory banners commemorating the alliance are hung across streets in major streets. At 10:00 AM, the city party headquarters of the New Movement Branch, the city headquarters of the Youth Corps, the Shanghai branch of the Central Youth Cadre School, the Fourth Joint Brigade of the Model Youth Corps, and the Shanghai branch of the East Asia League jointly held an enlarged commemorative ceremony in the auditorium of the city party headquarters at 22 Panyu Road. It is reported that the municipal government will also hold a tea party at 3:00 PM to entertain various agencies of the allied nation, in celebration.

### Joint Commemorative Lecture by the News Association

The Shanghai News Association, in celebration of the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, has specifically joined with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industry and Commerce Association, and the Citizens' Welfare Association to hold a [Commemorative Lecture Celebrating the Anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance]. They have invited Mr. Tatsuchiro Funatsu and Mr. Chen Binhe, civilian representatives from both China and Japan, as the main speakers. The presidium includes Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Yoichi Osaka, Xu Liqiu, Jin Xiongbai, Huang Jingqi, Yuan Shu, Takashi Moriyama, and Wu Yunqi, with Ren Yunpeng as the general secretary.

At the same time, the Shanghai News Association, in view of the fact that November 6 is the anniversary of the Great East Asia Joint Declaration, has also decided to hold a commemorative lecture on that day, inviting celebrities from various countries in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as the main speakers. The entertainment will be singing by famous Chinese and Japanese singers and performances by symphony orchestras. The venue will still be the Grand Cathay Theatre. Readers are requested to pay attention.

### Talk by Minister Usami

On this occasion of the first anniversary of the establishment of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, Mr. Usami, the Japanese Minister Plenipotentiary to Shanghai, delivered a speech, the main purpose of which was to strongly promote the permanent friendly relations between China and Japan and to resolutely destroy the British and Americans who obstruct Sino-Japanese friendship. His speech is as follows:

### Great Victory Makes Significance Profound

It has been two years and ten months since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War. Coincidentally, our army fiercely attacked its old enemy in the Pacific and achieved a historically unprecedented victory. The anniversary of the establishment of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty is greeted at this time, and its significance is extremely profound. The relationship between China and Japan, whether viewed from the four perspectives of geography, history, ethnicity, and culture, should be one of good friendship and alliance. However, in recent years, the relations between the two countries have gradually deteriorated, eventually leading to armed conflict, resulting in the Sino-Japanese Incident in 1937, which has not yet been completely resolved, which is deeply regrettable. The reason for this, although due to improper measures by the responsible authorities of both countries, and if a thorough review is added, the fundamental reason is that the East Asian policy of the United Kingdom and the United States is to use counter-espionage and bitter schemes to obstruct Sino-Japanese friendship, and neither China nor Japan is aware of the British and American treachery. This is indeed the process of internal strife in East Asia, and people from China and Japan have gradually reflected and become aware. As a result, the peace movement arose in China, and then the National Government returned to Nanjing. As a result, the policy of the United Kingdom and the United States to alienate Sino-Japanese relations became even more blatant, so as to make the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan fight permanently.

### Defeat Britain and America to Realize the Ideal

Until recently, both China and Japan have realized that Japan has launched the Great East Asia War to destroy the British and Americans, in order to sweep away the great enemies that obstruct Sino-Japanese relations. The two major ethnic groups of China and Japan have joined hands and marched towards the road of defeating the British and Americans. Therefore, the Chinese National Government also declared war on Britain and the United States and established a permanent friendly foundation for the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan, and based on the principle of mutual benefit and equality, mutual understanding was achieved. The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was established on this day last year to clarify this principle, comply with each other, and establish a Sino-Japanese friendship. The establishment of friendly relations is not only an obligation for the governments of both countries to practice, but also an obligation for every national of both countries to practice. In order to actively achieve this goal, a comprehensive war of force, economy, and ideology is launched against the British and Americans who hinder Sino-Japanese friendship. We must do our best in our respective positions and resolutely destroy the British and Americans to achieve the common ideal of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. There are great expectations for this.

### The Municipal Bureau of Economics Actively Suppresses and Stabilizes Prices

Yesterday, he summoned the chairmen of various guilds for instruction. Xu, the Director of the Municipal Bureau of Economics, actively suppressed and stabilized prices, launched the economic police to implement a city-wide general inspection, and closely contacted all parties. In addition to entertaining Chinese and foreign journalists from the city at the Huamao Hotel the afternoon before yesterday and clarifying the significance of this general inspection, he also convened the chairmen of various industry guilds in the city for instruction in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 4:00 PM yesterday (29th), strictly ordering each guild to follow the government's regulations and assist the government in suppressing and stabilizing prices, so that this unreasonable price increase trend would be completely stopped in order to stabilize people's lives. Tao, the Director of the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Industry, spoke on behalf of Minister Chen, hoping that the chairmen of the guilds would understand the government's sincere intention to suppress and stabilize prices, lead the industry to cooperate with the government, and work together to complete the goal of suppressing and stabilizing prices. He spoke many encouraging words. Then, the chairmen of the guilds put forward their opinions. Director Xu explained them item by item, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.

### Main Items in the City Will Be Re-issued

Regarding the comprehensive distribution certificates for main items in the entire Nanshi area, they have been completely distributed. The Material Distribution Office is currently making careful statistics. Once everything is ready, all items such as rice, yellow beans, flour, and coal briquettes will be re-issued separately within days.

### A Week of Industrial and Commercial Market Conditions

The financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai. Last week, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the outline for strengthening the business of financial institutions in Shanghai Special City, stipulating the enrichment of the content of financial institutions, increasing capital, restricting loans, and the strong suppression and stabilization of prices by the Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau, together with the Economic Security Office to conduct a city-wide warehouse inspection, thoroughly punish hoarding, and crack down on illegal price increases, which has made speculators dare not act rashly. Finance has become more stable, and the price increase trend has turned flat. Banks and money houses have stopped mortgaging major commodities and are calling in loans. Silver has become looser. Gold has been falling since Monday until Friday. However, the market suddenly turned up again on Saturday morning. Tael silver and silver dollars remained stable. Because of the urgent need for joint banknotes, the market price has always tended to be higher. As for stocks, the trend of various stocks has been weakening due to the suspension of loans and collection of debts by banks. The situation in factories and industries has not changed. Although major items of industry and commerce have adjusted power consumption, the start-up production rate has not been reduced. The market prices of rice, miscellaneous grains, and food products were flat from Monday to Saturday last week. However, rice and grains saw a peak again on Saturday. The reason for the increase in gold and rice and grains on Saturday is that those who generally have funds and hoard daily necessities have shifted their targets to buy gold or store rice and grains, and holders take the opportunity to control them, causing the market price to rise in the opposite direction. However, this situation is the end of the road for speculators and can hardly affect the general price increase.

### Director Dai of the Education Bureau Convenes a Tea Party with the Principals of Private Secondary Schools

Director Dai of the Municipal Education Bureau, for the first time yesterday (29th) at 3:00 PM at the Kang Le Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road, invited more than 30 principals of private secondary schools in the city to discuss in detail issues such as the reforms that should be made in the city's education, the welfare of faculty and staff, and tuition fees for the next semester.

### Gambling and Profiteering Are Not Allowed in Hotels and Apartments

The police authorities are strictly investigating and cracking down. In order to refresh the city's appearance, the municipal authorities have thoroughly banned the atmosphere of smoking and drugs. However, the police authorities found that some unscrupulous criminals disregarded the law and discipline, opened hotels and apartments, gathered crowds to gamble, and profited from commissions, which was illegal. Therefore, they ordered each branch bureau to strictly investigate and crack down. The Lao Zha branch bureau, in view of the fact that the area under its jurisdiction is a gathering place for public entertainment venues, so the above-mentioned gambling trend is the most intense, ordered each public venue not to allow gambling and ordered its subordinates to strictly investigate and crack down. On the day before yesterday, they arrested gamblers Wu Amao, Tong Yuenian, Tong Zaiyi, Wu Yisheng, Fan Fuliang, Shi Ruixiang, Lin Yongzuo, Zhou Ruilan, Shao Xiangkang, Tong Yuanfu, Lin Chengyao, and Li Sushi in Room 427 of the Xinhui China Hostel, and transferred them to the District Prosecutor's Office together with the gambling equipment for investigation and handling in accordance with the law. It is also reported that if there is any such situation in the future, the person in charge of the hotel will also be investigated and cracked down in order to curb the evil trend of gambling and maintain local security.

### The Young Women's Christian Association Actively Donates

The Young Women's Christian Association hosted a banquet for the donation committee at the Kang Le Restaurant the day before yesterday for the purpose of raising donations. More than 20 people attended, including Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, and Yan Huiqing representing Mr. Xi. After Lin Kanghou delivered a speech, donations were actively made on the spot, including Han Zhicheng 1 million, Xue Zuheng and Pan Yangyao jointly assumed 500,000 to 1 million, Zhang Wenkui and Yang Changkang 500,000 each, Pan Bingchen, Qu Yaokang, and Dai Zhenhua 300,000 each, Lin Kanghou and Yao Jiaosan jointly assumed 200,000, Lu Zhixue, Shuai Bochun, and Jiang Zhaozu 100,000 each. Ms. Lin Bingruo, the daughter of Mr. Lin Kanghou, invited women to jointly assume 2 million, and Zhang Bunong has agreed to assume 500,000, Pan Zhiwen 400,000, and Zhang Youxiang 300,000, etc. It is reported that other donation committee members are also doing their best to solicit donations on their behalf or contribute from their own pockets, which shows that the association's usual efforts, such as nurseries, children's homes, free schools, and talent training, have won a lot of sympathy from society. Therefore, it can achieve this good result. This fundraising campaign of 8 million will definitely exceed the target.

### The Baojia Office Explains the Issue of Self-Defense and Exemption from Service

Regarding the issue of exemption from service for teachers and staff of this city in the Self-Defense Corps on duty, Gu Jiwu, the Director of the Baojia Office of the Municipal Police Bureau, specifically clarified and explained to reporters yesterday that the exemption from service for teachers and staff has been stipulated before 1935 and is limited to public schools. However, after the incident, after the Baojia organization was formed and the Self-Defense Corps was organized, there were no regulations for exemption from service except for public officials, postal and telecommunications employees, and doctors. Afterwards, the teachers and staff of this city applied for exemption from service based on past regulations and due to their duty to educate students. After consultation with the relevant authorities of the allied nation by the former 18 two districts and 132 police stations, it was stipulated that the exemption from service for teachers is limited to the teachers and staff of public schools and the staff of private schools who are responsible for educational work. Now, in this city, all exemption from service issues, after weighing various circumstances by this office, include public officials, postal and telecommunications employees, school teachers and students, doctors and pharmacists, lawyers and accountants, journalists, and those with disabilities or special circumstances. Regulations for exemption from service have been formulated, and detailed methods have been approved and promulgated, and have been published in various newspapers in this city.

### Exemption Procedures for Journalists

Also, the realization of exemption from service for journalists has never been stipulated in the past. After repeated consultations and discussions by this office, it was concluded that those engaged in journalism have been working hard to serve the society and local areas and have been doing their utmost to report. Therefore, the Health Committee, which is subject to the Baojia Regulations, is now organized as a Propaganda Committee, and Propaganda Committee branches are organized in each district under this office. All journalists in the city may participate. Now that they have participated in the propaganda and Baojia responsibilities, they can be exempted from self-defense duty.

### The Fifth Day of Traffic Week Focuses on the Operation of Tricycles

### Each School Receiving Aid Can Receive the Remainder in Three or Four Semesters Each Year

Most of the grants for students approved in the seventh session have been paid in full at one time. However, a few schools have three or four semesters a year, and the payment period is approaching soon. For students receiving aid from such schools, if the grant received in this session has not reached the maximum limit (i.e., 6,000 yuan for universities, 4,000 yuan for high schools, 3,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 2,000 yuan for senior elementary schools), they can receive the remainder when paying the second fee. It is hoped that they will contact the office in advance to issue a check.

### Selling Overcoats for Charity to Donate to Scholarship Funds

Mr. Wu Hengshan wrote in a letter: [Dear Sir, the Sisters Flower Clothing Store that I opened held its opening ceremony on Double Ten Festival, and invited movie star Ms. Li Hong to cut the ribbon. Afterwards, I presented Ms. Li with a short overcoat produced by our factory to express our gratitude. Ms. Li did not want to accept it, and was willing to donate it as a scholarship fund. I greatly admire Ms. Li Xiaoniu's concern for impoverished education, so I am willing to donate another women's overcoat and hold a charity sale at the Dahua Ballroom on the 15th of this month. Half of the proceeds, a total of 15,000 yuan, is presented to you as a scholarship fund from your newspaper, and the other half will be sent to the Xinwen Daily newspaper.

### Shanghai Ping Pong Championship Finals: Lianyi Defeats Jingwu

The Shanghai Ping Pong Team Championship Finals were held at the East Asia Stadium (Xiqing) starting at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday (28th). Lianyi and Jingwu competed for the championship. After seven major battles, Jingwu was completely wiped out. Lianyi won all seven matches and won the Shanghai championship. Among them, the battle between Chuan Qifang and Lu Hanjun was the most exciting. After the game, movie star Chen Qi presented the awards. The overall champion was Lianyi, the runner-up was Jingwu, the third place was jointly won by Post Office Workers and Hezong, the fifth place was China Electric, and the sixth place was Yuelian. The results of the battle the night before yesterday are recorded below: Lianyi Jingwu Chuan Qifang 3-1 Lu Hanjun Wang Youxin 3-2 Ouyang Weizhou Ke Gang 3-1 Gu Jinxiang Huang Zhijun 3-2 Han Dewei Xue Xuchu 3-1 Zhang Ying Huang Zhijun 2-0 Lu Hanjun Chuan Qifang Ouyang Wei Wang Youxin 2-1 Zhang Zhihong Xue Xuchu Gu Jinxiang

### Shen Bao Cup Basketball: Tonight, Hualian vs. Huanan

There will be three more games in the Shen Bao Cup basketball tournament tonight. They will be held in the gymnasium of the Japanese Army Dormitory (old West Qiao Youth Association) starting at 6:30 PM. Ticket prices have been adjusted. Upstairs tickets are sold for 100 yuan, downstairs tickets are sold for 200 yuan, and special seats are sold for 300 yuan. All income will be used to help the newspaper's scholarship fund. The first act is a match between Chen Lan of Division B5 and Zhenyuan. The latter is stronger and is expected to win. The second act is a match between Huaying of Group A and Team V. Since joining the war, neither army has benefited and has always followed behind. Huaying was unable to have all of its soldiers present due to filming, which created an awkward situation. According to the evaluation of strength, Huaying should be among the best, and the team has famous generals such as Shushi Cheyao An Baosongyuan. It is no accident that Team V can be included in the Group A lineup. Usually, they work hard and strive to make progress, so they have succeeded, but their experience is slightly worse and their performance is not ideal. The team's style has always been slow, and Yi Yu Zibin is the soul. The battle between the two teams is tantamount to giving way to each other, and the excitement is expected. The final act is a match between Hualian and Huanan of Group A. Hualian is known as the basketball hegemon of modern times, and its combat power is indeed strong. An Xia, such as Kong Guangyi, Qu Xilin, Wu Chengzhang, and Fan Qinggong, are all veterans who are good at fighting. Huanan has always been known as the Little Overlord. Liu Minkun Zhong is called the Liu Family General. They are short and capable and have great characteristics. He Jingui, Li Ruixiong, etc. all have refined skills. The outcome of this battle is related to the championship. It is not known who will win the title of Overlord. The order for today and the lineups of the two Huas are recorded below: Chen Lan Zhenyuan (B5) 6:30 PM, Huaying Team V (Group A) 7:15 PM, Hualian Huanan (Group A) 8:15 PM. Hualian: Kong Guangyi, Qu Xilin, Wu Chengzhang, Fan Qinggong, Jin Changchun, Bo Tuo, Zhang Liangxiong, Zhen Zuoliang, Xu Jusheng, Yan Ziling, Zhang Xianlun. Huanan: Liu Fookei, Liu Fooshun, Liu Fooqiang, Ho Kung-kui, Li Hin-kwon, Li Shui-hung, Kwan Luk-sang, Tang Ying-ki.

### ○Yesterday's Group B Results

Tie Fu won against Eagle Team 22-15, Wing Team won against Qiang Shi 26-23, Renyu won against Fanjiang 50-18, Zhongchu won against Sanlian 29-24, Qingxie won against Feihong 41-16, and Shan Team won against Yuelian 27-19.

### Football Match Postponed

Also, the Phoenix Cup basketball award ceremony was scheduled to be held at the Huaying General Administration Stadium on Huashan Road at 2:00 PM yesterday, but it was postponed due to the rain. The time of issuing the report yesterday was 7:50.

Special Edition Commemorating the First Anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Alliance

### The Sino-Japanese Alliance and the Defense of East Asia

Today, last year, China and Japan concluded the Alliance Treaty, which is not only an epoch-making page in the history of Sino-Japanese relations, but also an unprecedented and completely new page in the construction of East Asia. Recalling the breakdown between China and Japan caused by the Lugou Bridge Incident, it was resolved three years later due to the establishment of the Basic Relations Treaty. Three years after that, last year, the Alliance Treaty was finally concluded with the unanimous enthusiasm of both China and Japan. It was agreed to respect each other's territorial sovereignty, maintain eternal friendship, and further establish an alliance relationship for the construction of Greater East Asia. The impact of this development of Sino-Japanese relations is not only the future of China and Japan, but also the future of the entire East Asia, and even the construction of a new world order. Today, due to the changes in the world situation, the peace movement can no longer be just for peace between China and Japan, but should be a major movement for peace in East Asia and even the world. The peace movement, from its launch, brewing, to the return of the National Government to the capital and the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty and the restoration of normal relations with Japan, is an initial success of the peace movement. Because comprehensive peace has not yet been realized, the Great East Asia War broke out. Therefore, the peace movement has developed into cooperation with the Great East Asia War in order to achieve peace throughout East Asia. On January 9 last year, the National Government officially announced its declaration of war on Britain and the United States and participated in the Great East Asia War. The peace movement has also developed into a world character, hoping to thoroughly destroy the old forces of Britain and the United States that dominate the world. However, in this There is one point that Japan never forgets and wants to strive for, that is, China's independence and autonomy. Under this fundamental national policy and long-term world vision, Sino-Japanese relations have inevitably progressed from the Basic Treaty to the Alliance Treaty. What China requires is the completion of independence and autonomy. This has been achieved in the conclusion of the Lvshang Treaty, which has become the result of the peace movement, which has been proved in fact. From this time on, the relationship between China and Japan is no longer just for the two countries, but is enough to determine the fate of East Asia and even the world. This argument has become even more convincing today. Because under today's Great East Asia war situation, the attempts of Britain and the United States to counterattack, to restore their ambitions to dominate East Asia, and the fact that Yu Fang is willing to be used by Britain and the United States to delay the war of resistance, all make it necessary for China and Japan to cooperate more closely for the survival of the two countries themselves and the survival of the entire East Asia. Because the revival of China and the defense of East Asia have no way to self-defense and self-existence other than attacking Britain and the United States and completely crushing their ambitions. Therefore, from the Sino-Japanese alliance to the defense of East Asia, this has a consistent meaning. In order to practice the alliance and revive China, in this final decisive battle stage, we must fully cooperate with our ally Japan in an all-round way to defend East Asia, which is also for the independence and freedom of China. Only in this way can we truly practice the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. The successive victories of the Allied forces in Taiwan East and the East Sea of the Philippines in the past three weeks have made the one billion people of the entire East Asia unanimously excited. Today, when we commemorate the anniversary of the Sino-Japanese alliance, we expect that only by taking the mood of being on the front line and making unremitting efforts to crush the enemy's counterattack attempts and shoulder the mission of defending East Asia can we do so.

### Mainland War and the Decline of Chongqing-America

Regarding the war on the Chinese mainland, the Japanese army is attacking the enemy American forces on one side and advancing towards the vicinity of Guilin on the other. That area is the largest base in South China, built by the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing at the enormous cost of 70 million yuan, and has been the source of their dream of air raids against Japan for the past few years. However, the Japanese army, having crushed countless enemy base groups and relentlessly pursued the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing into the interior, will soon seize this large base. Stilwell and Chennault's dismay is even greater than that of Chiang Kai-shek, who relies on the United States. This is written by an American war correspondent; the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing had long abandoned Xue Yue's Chongqing army and retreated to the safe interior. The demolition unit remaining behind, under Stilwell's orders, blew up this luxurious flying base. The American war correspondent's retreat report states that only Chinese people are dying in the Guilin area. Last time Wuzhou fell, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing not only strictly ordered the Chongqing authorities to forcibly evacuate the citizens, but also set fire to the streets of Wuzhou from the air. Judging from the examples of Wuzhou and Guilin, the enemy American forces everywhere regard themselves as the protagonists of the Chinese front, and for the sake of their own operations, they often sacrifice the Chongqing army and Chinese citizens. Chinese people are not people, but merely a means to fulfill American ambitions. Therefore, they implement a scorched earth tactic on Chinese cities. This American attitude is bound to provoke the resentment of thoughtful people in China, and the following saying has arisen in Chongqing: "[The United States] has changed from an aid-giver [援將] to a disaster-bringer [導將]." This American military force, mainly composed of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, now dominates the Chinese front. The Chongqing army is nominally an allied army, but in reality, it is a sub-colonial army of the United States. They regard the Chinese front as an important wing of the Pacific front, attempting to attack Japan from both sides, and are pursuing the strengthening of their combat power with fervent desire. In reality, this attempted American military force, due to the Japanese operations in China, is taking precedence step by step, giving a major impact to the entire Greater East Asia War situation. Therefore, they cannot but attach importance to the successive defeats in China. During the retreat from Guilin, they said: "[Our being here], in this moment of defeat, will prolong the war between Japan and the United States by six months." They hope to open up a desperate path for the progress of the Pacific offensive. Chiang Kai-shek, directed by the United States, is also like this. In his closing speech at the last参政会 (People's Political Council), he admitted the disastrous defeat of the U.S. Air Force and Chongqing army stationed in Chongqing today, saying: "The Chinese front is a part of the world front, in which forty-one allied nations participate and is closely linked with other fronts. We have suffered defeats, but on the other hand, our allied forces have won victories, which offset our defeats." Subject to the whims of others, this is the current situation of Chiang Kai-shek, who follows the United States. Out of the friendship of the same East Asian race, we cannot help but extend a word of sympathy. However, what the United States and Chiang Kai-shek expect is in the Pacific, and the more profound the retreat and changes in the Chinese front, the stronger this tendency becomes. The correlation between the Chinese front and the Pacific front becomes clearer and more significant due to the enemy's approach. The enemy's cries of sorrow in China, and the direction of the enemy's offensive in the Pacific, indicate that the task accomplished by Japan's operations in China is greater than the defense of the homeland. Furthermore, the Greater East Asia War is a continuous series of decisive battles, and at the same time, it is a long-term war in essence. Therefore, it is necessary to change the way of thinking about the position of the Chinese mainland in the current great war. (Translated from the October 5th Mainichi Shimbun)

### Chongqing's Rapprochement with the Soviet Union

The mainland operation, which aims to encircle Guilin from the north and south, is progressing day by day. On the 27th of last month, they also carried out a surprise landing near Fuzhou, making prior arrangements to block the American operational intentions. Since the Hunan operation in April of this year, the Chongqing army's continuous defeats and the recent urgency of the Guilin crisis cannot but bring about changes in the politics of the Chongqing regime. Chongqing's rapprochement with the Soviet Union is one of them. Originally, for Chongqing, which lacks independent war-dragging power, the diplomatic route is a major issue related to its life and death. At the beginning of the China Incident, Chongqing's diplomatic route was directed towards all countries except Japan. However, after the Tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact, the connection with Germany and Italy was severed. After the Greater East Asia War, it exclusively approached Britain and the United States, especially the United States, up to the present. Today, the center of gravity of Chongqing's diplomatic route is concentrated in the United States. Before and after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, in Chongqing's view, the Soviet Union was also a central route, but due to the start of the German-Soviet war, Chongqing's dependence on the United States accelerated, and the route to the Soviet Union seemed to be forgotten, leading to the conflict with the Soviet Union in Xinjiang Province at the end of last year. However, recently Chongqing began a very obvious rapprochement with the Soviet Union. Under the pretext of enhancing friendship with the Soviet Union, Sheng Shicai, the chairman of Xinjiang Province, was ordered to resign, and Wu Zhongxin was appointed as his successor. The external liaison officer of Dihua was replaced, and Liu Zeyun, the former Chongqing counselor in Moscow, was appointed, with the intention of renewing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. In the People's Political Council last month, a proposal was put forward to strengthen Sino-Soviet cooperation and send an envoy of goodwill to the Soviet Union. According to foreign news reports, Soviet Far East Minister Litvinov will arrive in Chongqing. Also, due to the reorganization of the Chongqing regime, Chen Cheng replaced the anti-communist He Yingqin and advanced, and pro-Soviet giants such as Sun Ke and the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party rose to prominence. It can be clearly concluded that Chongqing is once again shifting its diplomatic route towards the Soviet Union. So, what kind of attempt does this urgent rapprochement with the Soviet Union represent for Chongqing? As a result of the successive failures of the mainland operation, the rhetoric of distrusting Chongqing's fighting power has recently become prevalent in the British and American camps. Roosevelt and other war leaders do not hesitate to publicly declare it, and Churchill also openly stated in parliament the unreliability of the Chongqing army in the decisive battle. At the same time as this British and American slander of Chongqing, the Chongqing regime's resentment towards the United States' overreach and post-war ambitions is quite high, even to the point of the emergence of arguments for the suspension of American loans and attacks on pro-American factions. Chongqing's recent rapprochement with the Soviet Union is a reaction to this problem with the United States. Secondly, what currently perplexes Chongqing is the unresolved issue of the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Although the Chongqing talks following the Xi'an talks were somewhat forcibly reconciled by Wallace and others, they have worsened, and Zhou Enlai ultimately made a statement of dismantling the stage. Chongqing cannot help but refute this. According to foreign news reports, Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, Peng Dehuai, and other CCP giants gathered in Yan'an to secretly discuss countermeasures. Chongqing's rapprochement with the Soviet Union is a search for a way out due to the unresolved issue of the Kuomintang-Communist relationship. However, in the current state, no matter how close it gets to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union believes that the current American aid to Chongqing is clearly useless. Moreover, the Chongqing regime will not sever ties with the United States. Therefore, the power of the United States has deeply penetrated the heart of Chongqing. On the issue of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the Yan'an regime is still in an offensive position. Attempting to resolve this opposition by relying on the power of the Soviet Union will, on the contrary, increase the power of Yan'an. In short, by strengthening the route to the Soviet Union, if one wants to block the ambitions of the United States and resolve the dispute between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the result will ultimately be failure. However, the fact that they finally have no choice but to resort to this inferior strategy shows how confused the Chongqing regime is today. (Translated from the October 5th Dokusho Hochi)

### Crisis of the Chongqing Regime: Vicious Inflation Causes Economic Collapse

The Chongqing regime, which has been dragging on the war for as long as seven years, faces an economic collapse crisis caused by extreme vicious inflation. The following article is an article entitled "The Endless Chinese Inflation" recently published in the famous American magazine "The New Republic." It is entirely a report of the actual situation. The author, Eric Sevareid, narrates that the Chinese people in the anti-Japanese war zone are facing the line of starvation and loudly shouts that this is the price of dragging out the war with Japan. The following is the translation: The extreme vicious inflation taking place in the Chongqing辖境 (administrative area) is virtually unique in the world since Germany created an unprecedented record in 1923. A few weeks ago, the reporter saw dark green airplanes – bombers and fighter planes, etc. – flying from India at a certain large airfield in Chongqing, and at another corner of the airfield, he saw beautiful transport planes with the white words "[China National Aviation Corporation]" landing. A sea of people, coolies, carried heavy boxes out of those many transport planes, and then carefully loaded them onto combat-heavy vehicles. These boxes were filled with Chongqing banknotes transported from the United States. This is an injection for the Chongqing economy oppressed by the heat. Most of these banknotes are made by the American Bank Note Company of New York, but all of them are ten yuan or more. This means that almost no ten-yuan bills are needed for eating and buying things. This kind of banknote is transported from the United States, across the Pacific Ocean and India, to Chongqing every month, more than just a few tons. What the Chongqing regime is racking its brains over is how to massively print banknotes to match the monthly increase in prices of 10%. The amount of banknotes in circulation has already reached an astonishing figure, so the Chongqing regime does not have the courage to publish the actual figure. In some places, prices are 250 times higher than in 1937. The current legal price of one U.S. dollar is 20 法幣 (legal tender), but diplomats and foreign journalists are allowed to exchange one U.S. dollar for 30 法幣. However, the black market has reached 80 to 90 yuan, so the purchasing power of one yuan of Chongqing 法幣 is actually only equal to five cents of U.S. dollars. What one yuan of Chongqing 法幣 can buy is half a pack of low-quality cigarettes, half a catty of peanuts, or six sheets of typewriter paper. If you take a bus with one yuan of Chongqing 法幣, you can only travel three or four li (Chinese mile). Buying a new pair of leather shoes costs 500 yuan of 法幣, and an old raincoat costs 1,500 to 1,600 yuan of Chongqing 法幣. Isn't this staggering? The reporter ate an ordinary meal with three other people in a Chongqing restaurant, which cost 400 yuan of Chongqing 法幣, which is really ridiculous. Because Chongqing cannot import consumer goods from overseas, but Chinese stores are full of luxury goods. (Translated by An from the October 4th Mainichi Shimbun)

### Announcement to the People of Chongqing – Broadcast Speech by Chief Matsushima –

Colonel Matsushima, the head of the press department of the Chinese Fleet, gave the following broadcast to the people of Chongqing from the Shanghai International Broadcasting Station and the Shanghai Broadcasting Station at 8:30 p.m. on the 28th of this month, targeting Mr. He Yingqin, the Minister of Military and Political Affairs of the Chongqing regime:

### Heavy Damage to the Mobile Force

Today, I would like to inform the beloved people of Chongqing about the results of the great naval battle between Japan and the United States in the Philippines: What the US military is most anxious about is to quickly land the MacArthur forces in the Philippines in order to establish contact with the Chinese mainland, but this time the US side suffered unexpectedly huge losses, which were caused by this kind of rude action, which I believe you must already understand. I reported to you on the 22nd of this month that the US military, in order to assist MacArthur's landing, ordered Halsey to attack Japan, Taiwan, and the Ryukyus, but this move ultimately failed due to the ambush of the Japanese army. However, the US military did not retreat because of this, and attempted to forcibly land on the Philippines. Finally, since October 18th, they began to attack Leyte Island, which is located in the middle of Mindanao and Luzon. Prior to this, the Japanese air force in the Philippines had captured the enemy's mobile force proceeding on the sea east of the Philippines and inflicted great damage on it. However, the enemy's land forces dared to start attacking a corner of the Philippines. The Japanese side, seeing this situation, considered it a rare opportunity, and finally dispatched the Combined Fleet, which had been waiting for an opportunity since the beginning of the war. However, the enemy did not know this. After suffering huge losses many times, the MacArthur forces were finally able to land on Leyte Island, build a fragile bridgehead, and advertise widely that their attempt had succeeded.

### Japanese Warships' Heroism Surprises the Enemy

On the 22nd of this month, I happened to hear the broadcast of Chongqing and heard Mr. He Yingqin, whom I trust most, praise the US military's landing on the Philippines, and believe that the connection between the Chinese mainland and the US military has been completed and is overjoyed. I was very surprised after hearing this. The US military's dream desire has reached the time when it will be destroyed by us. Our Combined Fleet, with a large formation of powerful battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, and submarines, dared to carry out an attack that is not easy for even immortals to do. It appeared in the Philippines and fiercely began to attack the US naval and land forces. Regarding the heroic actions of the Japanese fleet, Admiral King, the commander of the US Combined Fleet, made the following remarks: "It is admirable that the Japanese fleet can pass through the Surigao Strait, which is not easy to turn around in. There must be an incredible reason behind its ability to take this action." Mr. He Yingqin, you have studied in Japan, please deeply consider Admiral King's words. What the American admiral cannot judge and understand is the greatness of the Japanese navy. This kind of fact cannot be calculated with numbers, and it should not be discussed on the same day as aircraft, warships, and other objects.

### Naval Gunfire is the Best in the World

On the morning of the 24th, the Japanese fleet finally appeared on the sea east of the Philippines. The Japanese fleet has been focusing on the research of shipbuilding technology for more than 20 years since the Washington Conference, so that it has today's sophisticated and strong battleships, and it has obtained the essence of training that surprised Admiral King, and the day to show its skills has come. After the fierce airborne attack, the power of our battleships, which continue to fire from a close range of 20,000 meters, can be called the best in the world. The enemy ships could not withstand our artillery fire and had no way to escape, and repeatedly sent telegrams requesting assistance. The power is so great that one can get a glimpse of it. The Japanese fleet further broke into Leyte Bay, where enemy transport convoys and escort warship groups were gathered, performing a full martial arts show like the Water Margin to chill the enemy's hearts. Leyte Bay suddenly became a sea of fire. The enemy's transport ships and warships, with soaring flames, destroyed seven aircraft carriers, one battleship, and two cruisers, sunk eight aircraft carriers, three cruisers, and two destroyers. In addition, 13 cruisers and destroyers, one oil tanker, five ships of unknown type, and 18 transport ships were destroyed or sunk in Leyte Bay, and 500 aircraft were shot down over the Philippine Sea, and 72 were destroyed in Leyte Bay.

### Comprehensive Battle Results of Taiwan and Philippines Waters

The comprehensive battle results since the start of the battle on the waters of Taiwan are as follows: 34 aircraft carriers, 7 battleships, 14 cruisers, 4 destroyers, 4 cruisers or destroyers of unknown type, 47 transport ships or more, 16 ships of unknown type, 16 large boats, and 1 oil tanker were sunk or destroyed, totaling 154 ships or more. The US military in the Pacific has lost almost half of its strength, especially most of the enemy's most precious battleships and aircraft carriers have been buried at the bottom of the sea. This fact deserves the attention and surprise of the world. As for the loss of personnel, it is about 500,000 people. The United States is still using the excuse that the investigation has not been completed and does not dare to publish the results of the battle, and is trying to deceive the world, but the fact is the fact. The United States has suffered a huge blow. Not only is it unable to capture the Philippines, its Pacific operation plan has been seriously hindered. On the 27th of this month, the US Navy Day, President Roosevelt did not specifically mention the situation of this naval battle, and reluctantly kept silent, which is a piece of evidence. The Imperial Navy immediately reorganized its formation and further carried out the annihilation of the enemy forces landing on Leyte Island. The final result of this naval battle will ultimately determine the future trend of the war between Japan and the United States. In addition, the British fleet, which had acted recklessly in Nicobar, was attacked by the Japanese air force and suffered heavy losses, and fled in panic, which was miserable.

### The Valor of the Special Attack Force

I would also like to mention the "[Kamikaze Special Attack Force]" announced by the headquarters at 15:00 today. I am unable to disclose the mechanism of this weapon, but this new weapon can only be operated by Japanese or Chinese people, that is, people who understand the spirit of East Asia. Mr. He Yingqin should also be able to understand it. Captain Seki and the other four of our naval aviation warriors operated this new weapon and crashed into the aircraft with their bodies, destroying two American aircraft carriers and one cruiser. It is nothing more than the ardent Japanese soul, and the divine skill that chills the hearts of Americans can also stir the ears and eyes of the people of the world. Their loyalty and courage will surely be remembered for generations to come. People of Chongqing: The great East Asian spirit or the original power of East Asians can be exerted to this extent with only effort. Relying on the British and Americans to become their slaves, and having their dignity completely trampled on, is this the way to save China? I hope that you will restore the true nature of East Asians as soon as possible, and connect with the right track. I cannot help but hope for it.

Guilin Defeat Record
— Written by an American War Correspondent

The Japanese army's attack on Guilin is a sign that the enemy's largest forward base for the counterattack against Japan is about to collapse. Recently, the American "Time" weekly published an article by American war correspondent Teddy White's "Guilin Defeat Record," which caused a great response. The following is an excerpt from the article, describing the accurate portrayal of the US and Chongqing forces in Guilin, which were in chaos due to the Japanese army's attack, destroying military facilities, and retreating. When the Anglo-American military high command in Quebec was holding a conference to end the war around the table, the Greater East Asia War was proceeding smoothly, and the Japanese army began to drive out the air force led by Chennault (commander of the US Fourth Air Force in China), the largest forward base in South China "[Guilin]". This place reveals the signs of America's defeat. Many people have experienced the military failures of the Allies in 1942, but few people know the same military failure that occurred last week. Before suffering this major blow, the US and Chongqing forces had fought a major battle for two weeks south of Hengyang. The continuous fog every day meant that the US air force's superiority could not fully exert its power, and as a result, they had to bid farewell to Guilin, and the sun was shining in the sky, but "[time was late]", and the US military retreated under the guidance of Chinese soldiers.

### The Chaos of Weapons

The weapons for defending the entire province of Guangxi and Guilin can be said to have everything. Among them are American-made cannons, Soviet-made tanks, and Japanese-made and Chinese-made artillery. Among them are also cannons that have been used as much as possible, and there are also cannons that cannot be used at all. Xue Yue, the commander of Chongqing, led 4,000 subordinates, but only half of them, 2,000, had usable rifles. The unit did not even have the wood needed for cover, nor did it have signal flags to contact American aircraft, and there was no radio to contact the detachments from the unit headquarters. The Japanese army is not like this. It not only has power but also has mobility. No matter where it is, it can satisfactorily dispatch superior forces. We originally wanted to stop the Japanese army's advance north of the entire county, near Huangsha River, about 140 to 150 kilometers northeast of Guilin. However, this road was taken by the Japanese army four days before our plan. Many air bases in Guilin had to evacuate, destroy, and abandon within 26 hours. Soldiers and telescopes were also prepared to evacuate. In order to carry out uninterrupted operations against Japan, they were still carrying out their last mission in Guilin, and then fled south in the dark night. In order to find the contact line of the rear base, Major General Clinton Vincent and two combat staff officers, Dibamann and Deved, set off on the last plane early the next morning. Only the demolition unit led by Colonel Wald Knudson was left behind, and the final decision was made to blow up the airfield and buildings.

### The Pitiable Form of Refugees

Once in the suburbs, we saw the last batch of refugees, either sitting in rickshaws, carriages, or walking, all pouring into the road endlessly, showing a pitiable form, and escaping on the road. In the city, which was forbidden to pass through, soldiers were desperately preparing the machine guns that were about to be used, digging trenches, and building defenses. On the morning of the day Stilwell approved the final retreat, he, along with Chennault and US military officers, visited Zhang Fakui, the commander of Chongqing, to discuss the military situation, and the US military officers received maps and aerial photos. Stilwell ordered to set fire and began to retreat. After a few hours, they left. All the barracks in our valley were set on fire, and every soldier in the demolition unit was holding a bucket of gasoline. The buildings were blown up one by one, and finally the entire valley was burning with flames. Sometimes, the entire roof was blown to the ground and shattered into pieces of fine tiles. The fire swallowed the buildings like a torrent. Flames of yellow, red, and white colors were burning the houses. The demolition bombs were constantly sounding around us like firecrackers during the Chinese New Year. Sometimes it felt like being hit by a boulder. Just for one of our airfields, the number of buildings that needed to be destroyed reached as many as 550. The cost we invested in this airfield was as high as 700 million Chinese 法幣 (legal tender), which is 70 million US dollars. When we blew up the runway for combat aircraft, it was already slightly dawning. We ran to the dining hall to eat the last bacon and eggs. Major General Wingate said to me: "[About this war, I want to write a book]". He said that the title of that book would be "[Flames, Downfall, and Retreat]".

### The Japanese Army's Purpose is to Eliminate the US Military

We do not know whether the Chongqing army will defend Guilin to the death. They are fighting bravely. And the thousands of people who died along the river and on the city's defense barriers were all Chinese, but this war is our common war, that is, our common failure. The Japanese army has many purposes for this war. For example, in order to not be threatened by American aircraft and submarines on the sea, to seek the only southern land route, to defeat the latest army of Chongqing, and to politically shake the Chongqing government, etc. However, these purposes are all secondary. The main purpose of the Japanese army has always been to reduce the US military and occupy American air bases. We know that this defeat in Guilin will prolong the war between Japan and the United States by six months. The Japanese air force bombed this base of ours late last night, so we all slept in the long air-raid shelters all night. Someone told me that the US Navy landed on Palau Island today. I ran to an officer and asked if the landing was a fact. The officer replied: "[Huh? Palau Island?
