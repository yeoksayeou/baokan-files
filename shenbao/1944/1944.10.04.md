### An Open Letter

Mr. Ugaki: I have heard that you recently traveled from North China to Shanghai to examine the real conditions of our people, intending to use this as reference for further promoting Sino-Japanese relations. I deeply admire your diligence and arduous journey. Furthermore, after reading your impressions of your inspections in various places, I admire your grand aspirations even more. Standing as a person in the press in the private sector, I write this open letter to express what I want to say, which can also be said to be what some of our countrymen want to say. I hope you will not hesitate to give your guidance; it would be my great fortune. In the past two years or so, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the implementation of Japan's new policy towards China, many people from the government and public of your country have visited our country. This is a very gratifying phenomenon. However, it is regrettable that how many of your country's friends who come to China are able to delve deep into the Chinese private sector to examine the real conditions? And how many are able to listen to the opinions of the private sector? If one only looks around in Shanghai or lingers in a few large cities for a few days, engaging in social gatherings, one will not obtain any real information. Furthermore, if the promotion of Sino-Japanese relations is entrusted to the real conditions seen in this way, then the distance between the results obtained and the goals set will be very far. These are all facts, and we can easily prove them with a little review and reflection. When I visited your country last winter, I felt that too few people in the government and public of your country understood our country's situation, so I felt even more deeply apprehensive. On the other hand, in the past two years or so, too few people from our country have visited your country. Inconvenient transportation is certainly one reason. But another reason is that many people still have prejudices and are unwilling to go, unwilling to go. Therefore, the Greater East Asia Doctrine advocated by your country and the new policy towards China loudly proclaimed are still separated by a sea. The recognition within your country has certainly formed a passionate, widespread, profound, and genuine phenomenon, but very few people in our country can deeply understand it. Therefore, I must solemnly and sincerely point out: Under such circumstances, if your country wants to make the Chinese private sector understand, to have the same passionate, widespread, profound, and genuine understanding as within your country, then it must be demonstrated with facts on Chinese soil. I believe that how to promote Sino-Japanese cooperation to win the Greater East Asia War is currently the most important topic, and at the same time, it is our greatest responsibility. In the past two years or so, the government and public of your country have made many passionate contributions to winning the Greater East Asia War and liberating the shackles of the East Asian nations. At the same time, we greatly admire the fact that 100 million people in your country are constantly burying themselves in hard work. However, speaking of what efforts our country has made since participating in the war, I am very apprehensive and ashamed. However, the ambition of the British and American enemies has not been quelled, the Greater East Asia War is a long-term war, and the hardships ahead are foreseeable. If our country fails to contribute adequate strength in the war, then the responsibility will be even more arduous and significant. The current question is: What strength has China contributed to the Greater East Asia War in the past is questionable; and in terms of China's current situation, how much strength can it contribute in the future is even more questionable. Why do I say this? I believe that one can only wage war with production capacity, which is an unshakeable principle. And the people must obtain a minimum level of stable living before they can engage in production and wage war. However, from the reality of production, although slogans and plans for increasing production have been put forward, in fact, factors that reduce production arise at any time. For example, the reasons for reduced production in the industrial sector include a lack of raw materials, declining electricity, poor methods of purchasing materials, unrestricted transportation of materials, unreasonable price limits on finished products, etc. Secondly, the existence of economic regional division, with different currencies and different controls within the same country, hinders each other, making it impossible for material exchange to be smooth and for the national economy to develop in a balanced and unified manner. All factors that contribute to reduced production are due to the failure to fulfill one's duties in personnel matters, what is called [poor human planning]. For example, the materials of Central China and North China cannot be exchanged smoothly, coal, raw materials, transportation, etc., the Chinese are unable to handle them. Even if the Chinese are willing to produce and cooperate, they have no way to start. As for the issue of the people's minimum level of stable living, because prices are soaring without limit, life is difficult and painful, let alone stable. Currently, prices are 300 to 1200 times higher than seven years ago, and daily necessities are all more than 700 times higher. The general standard of living of the Chinese people has always been low and frugal, and the requirements are not extravagant. However, the current difficulties in life are mostly caused by man-made reasons, unnecessary suffering. However, the result of the people's increasingly painful life is giving an opportunity for the spread of communism, which is especially a major hidden danger in East Asia and must be given close attention. In short, the formation of all past problems is due to politics not being on the right track, insufficient understanding, and lack of conviction. The Chinese government and public should of course bear a major responsibility. However, the Japanese authorities also have a part of the responsibility. The single point that material exchanges cannot be smooth is enough to reduce production and increase prices. Therefore, I believe that several principles should be put forward: First, all undertakings in China that can be handled by the Chinese themselves should be handled by the Chinese themselves, and your country should be in a position to assist and guide. Second, the authority of each department in an undertaking must be unified. If the authority is not consistent, then the controlled economy will inevitably become chaotic and ineffective. Third, those from your country who participate in Chinese undertakings should be primarily first-class talents. Recently, I met with friends from your country who came here from Guangzhou and learned that when the Guangzhou Electric Lamp Factory was managed by people from your country, power outages and shortages often occurred, but when it was managed by the Chinese, this phenomenon disappeared. A certain sugar factory in Guangzhou often lost money when operated by people from your country, but it did not lose money when operated by the Chinese. Furthermore, the order management of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway was known as a model railway before the incident, but now there is a black market for tickets and many malpractices. These examples, of course, are not to say that people from your country do not have the ability and cannot manage. It is really because people from your country have not deeply understood the Chinese national conditions and people's sentiments, as well as the current environment, so they often have ways of doing things that they think are right but are not, and they do not get results. I have always known that you have a passion for improving Sino-Japanese relations, and this time you have a very sincere desire to obtain more real information about China, so I do not hesitate to be simple and straightforward in offering my advice. I respectfully wish you good health. Chen Binhe, October 3, Year 33

### Japanese Army and Navy Cooperate in Landing Northeast of Fuzhou, Japanese Army and Navy Obtain Contact in Wenzhou Area

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 3rd: The Japanese army, in order to capture the important area near Fuzhou on the coast of the East China Sea in China, under the close cooperation of the army and navy, landed in a surprise attack on the coast northeast of the city at dawn on September 27, and is currently attacking Guangzhou.

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) Xiamen and Shantou, seaports on the southeastern coast of China, were successively brought under the control of the Japanese army in the early stages of the incident. Wenzhou was once again captured by the Japanese army on September 9. At present, only Fuzhou in Fujian remains. The elite of the Japanese army and navy, cooperating with each other on September 27, once again launched the Fuzhou capture operation. The Japanese fleet, a mixed formation of the army and navy, gradually approached the coast of Fuzhou under the cover of naval vessels and landed at the mouth of the Daichi River (approximately 40 kilometers northeast of Fuzhou) at dawn on the 27th, continuing to attack and crushing the resistance of the Chongqing army everywhere. On the 28th, after passing through the important Lianchi point, they continued to advance towards Fuzhou. The responsibility for defending the area near Fuzhou was borne by the 70th Army, commanded by Liu Jianxu, who also served as the provincial governor. However, under the Japanese army's blitzkrieg tactics, they could only flee in a state of disarray. Once Fuzhou is successfully captured by the Japanese army, all the important points on the southeastern coast of China will be under the control of the Japanese army. The American attempt to cut off the connection between the Chinese coast and the Japanese mainland has been completely crushed by the Japanese army's preemptive operation this time. Furthermore, Fuzhou was once captured by the Japanese army in April of the 30th year of the Republic of China, but in September of that year, the Japanese army carried out a voluntary withdrawal after completing its operational objectives.

Japanese Army Frontline, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) After the elite of the Japanese army occupied Wenzhou on September 7, Gu Zhutong, commander of the Chongqing Third War Zone, attempted to retake it. The Japanese navy, aware of this situation, landed a unit of marines in the Qili area east of Wenzhou one night. After that, the Chongqing army's attempt to retake Wenzhou became increasingly exposed, so the Japanese army and navy units actively carried out contact. The navy units boldly opened up the waterway, finally completing it one day, thereby establishing contact with the Japanese army stationed in the Wenzhou area and suppressing the Chongqing army's recklessness.

### Fierce Fighting Near Guilin

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) According to Reuters' Chongqing dispatch: The fighting along the Xiang-Gui Railway northeast of Guilin suddenly intensified again, with the situation as follows: The Chongqing military headquarters announced on the 2nd: Fierce fighting suddenly broke out again on the 1st southeast of Xing'an (50 kilometers northeast of Guilin), and fighting is still ongoing near Baoqing. The Chongqing army is currently launching a counterattack towards Baoqing, and fighting continues in the Xiguan northwest and Danzhu vicinity of Pingnan (104 kilometers west of Wuzhou) in the eastern part of Guangdong Province. According to the Associated Press, regarding the Xing'an area, the Chongqing military headquarters announced that the fiercest fighting is currently taking place near Guilin. The battlefield is located 7 kilometers and 19 kilometers southeast of Xing'an. Furthermore, fighting is also continuing in and around the fallen city of Danzhu and in the southwest and northwest areas of Pingnan. Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) The elite of the Japanese army in the Xiang-Gui provincial border is currently preparing to capture Guilin near Jieshou, northeast of Guilin, and will launch a full-scale attack on Guilin. The Chongqing side has reported that the crisis at Xing'an, the outpost of Guilin, is imminent. According to a Central News Agency Guilin front-line dispatch on the 3rd from the Chongqing side, the Japanese army, which had divided into two teams near Jieshou and moved south along the Guilin Railway, has already arrived at Litouwei and Jiukuaida, 8 kilometers and 9 kilometers south of Xing'an, respectively. After the two units established contact at that location, they crossed the Xing'an River and are currently engaged in fierce fighting.

### Results of Raids on Liuzhou and Other Bases

Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) According to a dispatch from the Japanese army's front-line base: The Japanese air force, recently echoing the advance of ground troops, has reached its climax in air raids on Chongqing-American air force bases. Since September 23, it has been bombing Liuzhou fiercely night after night. The results achieved in eight days include the destruction of 54 aircraft. Adding to this the results of bombing Nanning, Zhijiang, and other enemy mobile bases, the total reaches 76 aircraft. In addition, five ground facilities were destroyed and runways were damaged, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy.

### Fierce Fighting Continues in the Central Highlands of Palau

Air Raids on Other Islands Becoming More Frequent

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) Fierce fighting is still ongoing in the central highlands of Palau Island. On the morning of the 1st, enemy troops attacked the Japanese army's position on Mount Suifu. The Japanese army lured them to the front of the position and inflicted heavy damage, repelling them. The Japanese soldiers' melee combat with bayonets has been particularly intense in the area between the two armies' positions, where barbed wire has been erected. Furthermore, fierce fighting is also still ongoing on Geatrubs Island, north of Palau Island. The airfield on Palau Island has been roughly restored after the enemy army rushed repairs at night, and enemy small aircraft have begun using the airfield since the 2nd. Furthermore, the battle situation on Angaur Island has not changed much in recent days, and the Japanese garrison is continuing to fight bravely. Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) A dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the Southwest Pacific on the 2nd states that the enemy mobile unit's attacks on Japanese bases in the Southwest Pacific have eased slightly since the air raids on Manila, but enemy B24, B25, P38, P40, etc., aircraft have been conducting increasingly frequent air raids from land bases. The enemy aircraft air raid situation on September 30 was as follows: In the Toaroe area of the Kai Islands, approximately 60 enemy medium and small aircraft attacked, one of which was shot down. In the Siri Bo and Guo Zhu areas, approximately 40 enemy medium aircraft attacked, three of which were shot down. In the Kendari area, approximately 40 enemy fighter-bombers attacked, one of which was shot down. In the Anjue area, more than ten enemy small aircraft attacked. In the Bajjin area of western New Guinea, approximately 65 enemy medium and small aircraft attacked, one of which was shot down.

### Minister Tajiri Discusses the Current Situation in the Philippines

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) Japanese Minister to the Philippines, Aiyi Tajiri, after returning to Tokyo, discussed the current situation in the Philippines on the 2nd, stating: ○ The Philippine government, taking advantage of the blind bombing of Manila by American aircraft on September 21 and 22, declared martial law throughout the country, followed by a declaration of war on the United States and Britain. Therefore, the Philippines has directly undertaken the glorious responsibility of completing the Greater East Asia War and building Greater East Asia. ○ After the Philippines promulgated martial law, all powers of the country were统统归于the President, who is the martial law commander, giving the President dictatorial powers in times of emergency. This is stipulated in Section 9 of Article 2 of the Philippine Constitution. Although the Philippines has implemented this dictatorial system, it has not damaged the essence of an independent country. Because of the announcement of martial law, it is easy to misunderstand that Philippine politics have reverted to the hands of the Japanese army, placing the Philippines under Japanese military administration. This is a complete misunderstanding. Due to martial law, the Philippines' completion of the war and the cooperation system with the Japanese army have become more perfect. ○ Looking at the overall situation in the Philippines, the emergency system in the country has been completed, and on the other hand, from the perspective of the national spirit, it has moved towards wartime life.

### America's Supply in the Pacific Becomes More Difficult, Forrestal Discusses the Future of the War

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) According to a San Francisco dispatch, American Secretary of the Navy Forrestal explained the future of the Pacific War on the 30th, stating: The Japanese main fleet is still intact, and the army still possesses great strength. The greatest difficulty in the Pacific War is in supplying its needs. The required supply capacity will be three times that required for the European War. Therefore, the difficulty of its supply will increase with the advance of the American army, and the rate of increase in difficulty is far beyond the rate of extension of the supply line, not directly proportional to it.

### One American Aircraft Crashes and One Is Destroyed off Iwo Jima

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) According to a dispatch from a base in the Central Pacific, on the afternoon of the 1st, ten American B24 aircraft attacked Iwo Jima in the Ogasawara Islands, one of which was shot down and one was destroyed by the Japanese army. On that day, the enemy aircraft were subjected to fierce attacks by the Japanese side and failed to enter the airspace of the island. All the bombs dropped fell into the sea.

### Japan Dispatches Mr. Yamashita as Administrative Inspector

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) In order to strengthen the maritime transport capacity of the Seto Inland Sea, the Japanese government has decided to dispatch Cabinet Advisor Saburo Yamashita as Administrative Inspector, implementing administrative inspection from the 4th.

### Germany Fully Defends Its Territory, Great Decisive Battle Imminent, Anti-Axis Offensive Focuses on Both Wings

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) German News from the Frontline: The American Third Army in the Metz area is continuing to gather troops and heavy weapons, and at the same time actively preparing supply lines. The battle opportunity for the anti-Axis forces to begin attacking the Siegfried Line is imminent. The German authorities are also fully aware of this tense situation, so they first used a fierce counterattack to close the breakthrough point of the American army east of Metz, and immediately blew up all the large bridges of a certain canal, preparing countermeasures for the great decisive battle.

### Large-Scale Land and Air Battle on the Aachen Frontline

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) The battle opportunity in the Aachen area of the Western Front is gradually ripening. The fierce attack by the American First Army, attempting to break through the Siegfried Line, has encountered fierce resistance from the German army. Hundreds of German and American aircraft are responding to the ground troops, unfolding a magnificent and fierce battle. According to Associated Press frontline news, this battle is the largest attack since the anti-Axis forces landed on the Normandy Peninsula. Anti-Axis paratroopers were annihilated in the Anting area of the Netherlands, and the attempt to invade northern Germany failed. Now, Canadian troops are being transferred from Antwerp, Belgium, to the north of Teunant, launching a major offensive. The situation in that area is extremely important and is considered the most meaningful in the defensive-offensive battle on the Western Front.

### German Forces in the South Frequent Counterattacks

German forces in the Belfort frontline in the south are currently conducting frequent counterattacks. After fierce fighting near Lun, fifteen miles northeast of Belfort, the American army advanced ten miles towards Belfort. Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) According to a dispatch from a Reuters war correspondent: The German army has begun a counterattack southwest of Pluen, between Anhun and Telian. The American army was forced to abandon a considerable area. Near Strasbourg, the German army seems to have a tendency to counterattack.

### Soviet Troops Land on Dago Island in the Baltic Sea

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) German News Agency dispatch: Yesterday, strong Soviet troops suddenly landed on the northern part of Dago Island, near the west coast of Estonia.

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) Haitian News Agency dispatch: Currently, the focus of the Soviet army's attack is in Southeast Europe. The Soviet army is trying to consolidate its position in Romania and Bulgaria and has begun a major offensive against Yugoslavia and Hungary. In recent days, the Soviet army's attacks in the Baltic Sea have eased slightly. Although the German army was able to withdraw from Worcesterland to the central area of the Baltic Sea, the most important thing is that the Soviet army's occupation of Finnish airfields on the Aland Islands and its intention to occupy the Worcester Island, Dago Island, and Monk Island in the Gulf of Riga. Currently, Monk Island has been occupied by the Soviet army. The Soviet army clearly wants to expand its sphere of influence in the Baltic Sea.

### Warsaw Polish Rebels Surrender Unconditionally

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) German News Agency dispatch: According to an official statement here this morning, the Polish rebels in the city of Warsaw have recently surrendered unconditionally.

### Chongqing Political Council Dispatches Investigation Team to Yan'an

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency telegram) The Chongqing-Yan'an reconciliation negotiations, based on the report of the representatives in the National Political Council meeting on September 5, after open discussion, it was decided that the Political Council would dispatch a four- or five-person investigation team to investigate the real situation in the Yan'an area and then submit necessary recommendations to the Chongqing side. However, according to a Chongqing dispatch, Lin Zuhan, the Yan'an representative who did not compromise with the Chongqing side, and Dong Biwu, the permanent representative in Chongqing, are scheduled to leave Chongqing this week. The five members of the National Political Council investigation team will also travel to Yan'an on the same route.

### Refugees Gather in Chongqing, Population Increases Sharply

Central News Agency dispatch: The Japanese air force has repeatedly and continuously raided Chengdu, causing unease in Chongqing. Since the fall of Changsha and Hengyang, the Chongqing army has been repeatedly defeated, and the residents there have flocked to Chongqing to seek refuge, causing a sudden surge in population, reaching 200,000 people. Chongqing, which had previously forcibly dispersed the population, is now seeing pedestrians filling the streets again. Taking September as an example, the population has increased by 40,000 people. The main reason is that the Chongqing side had long anticipated that the Japanese army would definitely advance, so they destroyed Guilin themselves. Under the command of the United States, the homes of the Chinese people are destroyed by their own army, and occupations are lost, causing homeless men and women to gather in Chongqing in order to survive. After the population of Chongqing increased, rents and prices have risen without exception, and the refugees have criticized the government's measures to deal with the high prices. Officials are currently feeling overwhelmed.

### The Spirit of Devouring the Enemy

— Tokutomi Sohō

Furthermore, in a teaching from December of the third year of Shian (1270), there were the following words: [Quickly go there and pay close attention: In recent years, I have heard that the warrior vassals responsible for defense are often discordant and disunited due to disputes over affairs or judgments in lawsuits. They only seek private grievances and do not care about the great calamities facing the nation. How disloyal they are! Military personnel and soldiers below them should obey the orders of their lords and wholeheartedly defend the nation. Lords should not judge loyalty based on personal relationships but reward and punish fairly. Those who disobey orders should be severely punished.] From this, it can be seen that many of them were ego-centric rather than nation-centric. In other words, observing Tokimune's stern condemnation of those who sought private grievances and disregarded the great calamities facing the nation, we can also know that not everyone at that time was loyal and righteous. However, regardless of these weaknesses, Tokimune received the imperial decrees of the retired Emperor Kameyama and Emperor Go-Uda and ultimately repelled the enemy from the nation's territory. The enemy invaded Tsushima, occupied Tagi, and threatened Hakata Bay, indulging in wanton killing and plunder. However, the reason they were eventually driven out completely was not solely due to material resources. At that time, the Japanese army numbered at most only fifty or sixty thousand. The enemy, on the other hand, had an army of one hundred and fifty thousand, three times the size of ours. Moreover, they had firearms and a well-organized military structure. From any perspective, the enemy held the advantage. However, Japan, with the sincerity of the retired Emperor Kameyama praying for the nation's plight from above, and Tokimune's great spirit that made all beasts tremble with a lion's roar from below, inspired the soldiers to fight bravely and boosted the morale of the people. Finally, thanks to the divine wind, the enemy was buried in the bellies of fish. Let us discuss an example from World War I. During the latter half of the war, France had no political leaders with a guiding national ideology and no generals capable of cultivating soldiers. Talk of defeat was openly advocated, and a sense of failure permeated the entire country. However, once Clemenceau became Prime Minister, France was revitalized as if electrified. Utilitarian politicians who advocated defeat were constantly detained. Soldiers who ignored their superiors' orders, arbitrarily returned home, and incited workers to strike became disciplined troops. In contrast, Germany at that time, although still had the strength to fight for another year and a half, its own morale declined spontaneously. The spirit of devouring the enemy was replaced by being devoured by the enemy's spirit, overwhelmed by fear, and ultimately collapsed in panic, leading to the emergence of a negotiation faction seeking to escape through luck. From this, we can also know that victory in war is not solely determined by material resources but primarily by having the spirit to devour the enemy, which then leads to the acquisition of material resources. What we should say now is that our ally, Germany, is currently fighting to the death with the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front and engaging in skirmishes with the Anglo-Saxons in France and Northern Italy. Last year, Italy, led by Badoglio, betrayed them, and this year, Romania, with its royalist party, defected. Finland and Bulgaria have changed from allies to enemies. Furthermore, Turkey abandoned its neutrality and severed diplomatic relations with Germany, and neutral countries such as Spain and Sweden have unanimously announced the cessation of steel exports to Germany. Germany, which used to be a large fortress in Europe, now has to rely on Germany itself as a fortress. If only Führer Hitler does not lose heart and has the spirit to devour the enemy, then we dare to assert that Germany will definitely win. The problem with Germany today lies in whether Hitler and the German people under Hitler's influence still have the spirit to devour the enemy. At the recent conference of local officials, His Majesty the Emperor exceptionally bestowed imperial words: [The war situation is critical, concerning the rise and fall of the imperial nation. Today, you local officials should redouble your efforts to inspire and lead the common people, so that officials and civilians are united in replenishing both material and spiritual resources to support the imperial destiny.] These are not merely imperial words bestowed upon local officials, but also imperial words bestowed upon our one hundred million imperial subjects through them, so we should be grateful and encourage ourselves. This is the reason why we fulfill our duties as subjects. As the Emperor said, today's war situation can truly be called critical. So, what should we use to handle this critical war situation? The so-called imperial words of "both material and spiritual resources," when annotated, refer to the food problem. Among food, there is material food and spiritual food. Material food fills the stomach, while spiritual food fills the spirit of devouring the enemy. At any time, the stomach cannot be idle, so filling the stomach is the most important thing. However, simply having an inflated stomach while the spirit is empty is useless, so the spirit of devouring the enemy is very necessary.

### East Asian Nations Must Unite and Rise Up at This Critical Juncture

General Ueki's Impressions After Inspecting North China

General Kazushige Ugaki, who arrived in Shanghai on the first of this month after inspecting North China, met with a group of reporters at his residence, the Yamashita Mansion, at 6:00 PM on the third. He shared his thoughts after inspecting various places and stated that, although he did not need to exert himself due to his age, he felt that no one should be idle in the current situation. Therefore, he had ventured to the mainland to study the situation diligently. He frankly shared his views after arriving in Shanghai as follows:

### East Asian Nations Must Unite

I should have retired to the countryside to play with my grandchildren and enjoy family life. However, the current situation is very critical, and I could not bear to sit idly by. I felt that this trip might lead to something that could benefit the nation, so I came to study the situation diligently. It is a fact that Japan is facing a critical juncture of rise and fall. However, we must understand that Japan's rise and fall directly affects the rise and fall of all East Asian nations. Considering this only as Japan's problem is not worth mentioning. People in Manchuria and various parts of China, regardless of age or social status, should consider this from this perspective and think about what they should think of us. Regarding the issue of how to break through this East Asian crisis, I am willing to openly and without any concealment exchange opinions as much as possible. First, I will share the thoughts of the people I have met. Whether Chinese or Manchurian, they all understand the current situation. Whether it belongs to Japan alone or to all of East Asia, they all have an unusually strong feeling and say that we should each do our part.

### The Future Situation Will Become More Severe

Many of the important figures in both the National Government and the Chongqing faction are acquainted with me. Chiang Kai-shek came to visit me and became acquainted with me when he fled to Japan after his first revolution failed and he went into hiding. Therefore, we should also think deeply about the current situation. Even if Japan's victory or defeat is seen as another issue, and China observes from China's position, the future era will naturally be different from today's reality. I heard that American troops are currently entering the area under Chongqing's control. No matter how many, even if it is only one or two thousand, more American troops will continue to enter in the future. Then, the future situation will obviously become more severe. The nations of Greater East Asia, only now, are four hundred million people united to defeat Britain and the United States.

### Active Development in Manchuria

Regarding Manchuria, since the establishment of Manchuria, Japan has provided a large amount of manpower and material resources and has been working hard for its active development. At that time, I was deeply afraid that even if we did our best, it would be useless. However, the development that has been achieved has exceeded all expectations. The order of officials and civilians, both high and low, is very orderly, and they are working together to complete the Greater East Asia War. It can be seen that my concerns were just unnecessary worries, and Manchuria is quite reliable. This is Japan's greatest spirit. In Tokyo, I heard that the security of some areas in North China has not yet been restored. This is indeed the case, but this is also the same as the period before the growth of Manchuria today. We have to recognize it as a process. Local Chinese military officers and civilians seem to be engaged in various plans regarding this point. Therefore, in the near future, there will be some way to deal with it. Furthermore, General Ugaki is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Suzhou around the ninth, stay there overnight, and go to Nanjing the next day. He may stay there for two or three days before returning to Shanghai. He is expected to hold a cordial discussion with key figures from all walks of life in Shanghai around the fourteenth or fifteenth.

### Youth Corps Holds National Day Camping Performance

Forty-Nine Battalions from Fifteen Schools Participate

To celebrate the 33rd National Day Commemorative Festival, the city's Bureau of Education and the city headquarters of the Youth Corps decided to hold a camping performance for the Youth Corps. The date is from 2:00 PM on September 9th to 5:00 PM on September 10th, and the camp is the Racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road. It has been learned that at 5:00 PM on September 30th, the city's Bureau of Education and the city headquarters of the Youth Corps will jointly hold a preparatory meeting for the camping performance. More than 20 instructors from the headquarters of each school district will attend. First, Deputy Commander Xi will report the purpose of the meeting, and then Director Dai of the Education Bureau will give instructions. Then, the discussion will begin. The following important items have been decided: ○ The commander of the camping performance is Mayor Chen, and the deputy commanders are Director Dai and Deputy Commander Xi. ○ The camp directors are Shen Zhaofeng, Wu Pengfei, and Qian Boping. ○ The participating units in the camping include 15 schools and 49 battalions. ○ The performance programs will be proposed by each unit and then scheduled. The headquarters of the third district (Nanshi) of the China Youth Corps Shanghai Special City Headquarters has been ordered to adjust the position of commander of the district headquarters and appoint Mr. Cheng Hanqing as the successor. The deputy commanders will be Shen Shijing and Cheng Deliang.

### District Court Ordered to Expedite Cases

The Ministry of Justice Administration, in light of the fact that court cases are often delayed due to various procedural matters, causing unspeakable suffering to the people, has specifically instructed the District Prosecutor's Office that, in the future, for all cases handed over to the office by the police station, if the sentence is five years or less, the District Prosecutor's Office should immediately investigate. If there is solid evidence, the case should be sent to the court for judgment the next day, and after the judgment, it should be sent to the prison for execution.

According to a reporter's investigation, the bureau is very concerned about the issue of improving the treatment of police officers and, after several plans, will increase salaries by 100% of the original salary in the near future. However, this must be discussed and decided with the financial authorities before it can be implemented.

### The Educational Character of the Old Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Children's Schools

— —Yatai Tada

○Science Equipment: Most schools have quite abundant natural science experimental equipment. When secondary school students conduct experiments, each group has its own set of equipment, allowing them to see and touch them easily. Currently, the central science laboratory's various instruments are based on the science equipment of Yucai Public School. The adequacy of the school's equipment in this department is evident. In summary, the most noteworthy aspect is that most of the schools' equipment was acquired at the time of the schools' establishment. Subsequent additions or new acquisitions were extremely difficult because the budget for the municipal schools only included an item for experimental [materials] and not for [equipment]. Before the incident, this was limited to just over a hundred yuan per year, mostly restricted to the needs of experimental consumables. It was exceedingly difficult to obtain new [equipment]. To add [equipment], regardless of price, it had to be included in the temporary budget the previous year. After approval by the finance department, the principal would solicit bids (at least three bids) the following year. These bids would then be submitted to the education department for approval before an order could be placed. This cumbersome process often meant that nothing could be added for a year and a half. During times of unrest and fluctuating prices, the Chinese Education Department would advocate for the self-manufacture of simple school equipment and teaching aids. While this served as an educational exercise, it also tended to make the self-manufacture of teaching aids an educational goal in itself. This may have also been due to the aforementioned reasons. (Eight) Conclusion: The former Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese children's primary and secondary schools have a relatively long history in the vertical dimension and a relatively high social status in the horizontal dimension. Adopting strengths and discarding weaknesses, selecting the essence and applying it broadly, and adapting to the times to meet the needs of the era are what the education sector must understand deeply. Furthermore, it is crucial not to overlook the educational characteristics of Chinese children's schools to improve or maintain Shanghai's cultural standards. Despite my limited knowledge, I have drafted this article. Omissions and errors are inevitable. I hope that knowledgeable gentlemen will provide guidance. Note 1: Chinese children's schools refer to four boys' secondary schools, one girls' secondary school, and seven primary schools. The boys' secondary schools are all called "Public Schools." The Nie Zhongcheng, Gezhi, Yucai, and Huatong schools are collectively referred to as Chinese Children's Secondary Schools. The other four night schools, one people's school, and one workers' technical school are not included in this discussion. Note 2: The education authorities made the following remarks regarding the old Chinese children's schools from February 20th to 25th: ○ All personnel matters regarding the old principals and affiliated institutions' teachers and staff will remain unchanged, and their treatment will be maintained as before. ○ The existing excellent systems will be preserved and will not be changed arbitrarily. ○ Other Notes 3: In 1930 (the 19th year of the Republic of China), the Shanghai Municipal Council's Education Committee resolved on an "Eight-Year Education Plan." Its main points are as follows: ○ The purpose of the Shanghai Municipal Council's education plan is to provide appropriate schools and educational opportunities to the children of citizens who directly or indirectly pay taxes in the concession, regardless of nationality. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council does not solely bear the responsibility for educating citizens. All government agencies, public and private organizations, and religious groups, or legal individuals, are welcome to establish schools in the Public Concession. ○ The Bureau will provide assistance when appropriate to the aforementioned schools that have been established and meet the standards to strengthen their effectiveness and work together for citizen education. ○ The Shanghai Municipal Council will continue to maintain and add to the Western children's schools and Chinese children's schools it has established. ○ From 1931 to 1936, two primary schools capable of accommodating 600 children will be opened each year. By the end of 1938, including the original three primary schools, there will be a total of seventeen Shanghai Municipal Council primary schools. ○ In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Council must open two girls' secondary schools. The first will open in 1931, and the second must be established before 1934. ○ The existing four Chinese Children's Public Schools should be gradually adjusted according to secondary school standards to become standard secondary schools. At least one of them should have the basic conditions of a vocational or technical school. ○ By the end of 1938, the Shanghai Municipal Council should have a total of twenty-three Chinese primary and secondary schools. The students enrolled will account for 7.5% of the total number of school-age Chinese children in the entire concession. ○ Regarding subsidies for private schools, the Shanghai Municipal Council provides financial assistance to private schools within the concession that meet the prescribed standards for educational level, equipment, and management, and are in need of financial assistance. All subsidized schools must be located within the Public Concession or pay taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council. The amount of the subsidy is determined by the school's performance, financial needs, and the number of students enrolled.
