### DO NOT BE LAZY

This year is designated as the decisive year for the Greater East Asia War. Like a relay race, this is the final leg. The person running this leg must rouse their spirit, grit their teeth, and advance bravely, without stopping for a single step, towards the finish line. This is the crucial moment for victory or defeat, as well as life or death. It is the most important and also the most tense. This is the meaning of the decisive year.

The Book of Documents says: "To build a mountain of nine ren high, one basket of earth is lacking to complete it." Confucius said: "Suppose I am making a mountain, and have stopped when one basketful is wanting to complete it, I stop. Suppose I am throwing down earth on level ground, though I have thrown only one basketful, I am going forward." Zhu Xi annotated: "To stop halfway is to abandon all previous efforts. Whether to stop or to go forward depends entirely on ourselves and not on others." All of this teaches people that at critical junctures, they must not give up halfway. They must strive for self-improvement and be determined to be outstanding, otherwise they will face the abandonment of all previous efforts. Success or failure, gain or loss, hinges on a single thought, on "our" own efforts. If we do not work hard ourselves, we cannot hope that others will do the work for us. If we do not work hard ourselves, we cannot hope for accidental success. Only by using "our" own blood and sweat can we exchange for "our" own success. There is no other path besides this.

People living in this great era, looking at the current situation, know that the achievements of the Greater East Asia War over the past two years have already laid the foundation for inevitable victory amidst hardship and difficulty. Eighty or ninety percent of the work has already been done, and we still need to continue to do the remaining ten or twenty percent of the work. However, this ten or twenty percent of work requires us to redouble our efforts, redouble our hardships, and redouble our struggles. We do not want to "fail for lack of one basket of earth." We do not want to "abandon all previous efforts." Then everyone must rise up, take on all responsibilities, and move forward. At this time, everything depends entirely on ourselves and not on others. Let us determine our own destiny through our own efforts. In this regard, we are willing to offer this to the people of the country, hoping that the entire nation, from top to bottom, will be inspired.

The government should be inspired, constantly reflecting on how much it has done for the country and how much welfare it has sought for the people. If it has not done much, or has not done enough, then from now on it should do it immediately, it should do more immediately. If it does not have the ability to do it, does not have the ability to do more, then from now on it should employ the talents of the entire country and work together quickly. Being unable to advance or retreat is most harmful to the country. In normal times, perhaps it is still possible to wait, but in the last five minutes of an extraordinary period, there is no room for delay.

The people should be inspired, constantly reflecting on how much they have done for the country in their respective positions. Especially those engaged in production, how much has production increased, how much strength has been contributed. Do not use the excuse of environmental difficulties, because this is a common phenomenon in any country during wartime. Other countries, the more they are at war, the more they show the strength of the people. It can be seen that the environment cannot hinder a person's progress. Only those who cannot be enterprising are controlled by the environment. Furthermore, individual wealth is linked to the wealth of the country. Only with the overall wealth of the country can individual wealth be preserved, otherwise, "when the skin is gone, what can the hair attach to?" Therefore, valuing national interests is valuing personal interests. Keep this thought in mind at all times, be inspired at all times, and work hard for the country. Only then can the country and nation be revived, and the people can enjoy peace and happiness.

### Japanese Planes Braving Bad Weather Night Raid Silchar City – Enemy Military Installations Heavily Damaged in Several Locations

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a dispatch from a certain base in Burma, on the Burmese front, a Japanese army air force bomber squadron braved bad weather on the night of the 3rd, launching a strong attack on Silchar in eastern India, shaking the enemy's rear base for the defense of Imphal. Another unit of Japanese planes, after bombing the airfield north of Silchar, further dropped bombs on marked enemy positions, destroying two of its facilities. At the same time, another team of Japanese planes, eliminating the alert of three enemy fighter planes, flew to Silchar and safely returned to base after destroying military installations in the city.

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a dispatch from Calcutta, the Assam provincial government issued a public statement on the 6th, stating that Japanese forces bombed Silchar and Imphal on the night of the 3rd.

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a dispatch from Calcutta, the government of Assam province in India announced on the 6th that the anti-Axis forces are currently engaged in battle with the Japanese army on the Manipur front. Therefore, the bombing of Assam by Japanese planes will be intensified compared to before. It is expected that many people will be injured. In this situation, blood transfusions are needed for the injured. Therefore, in order to store blood serum, the general public is asked to provide their own blood.

### Enemy Airborne Troops in Burma Experiencing Famine – Japanese Planes Compete to Attack Kalat Airfield

Rangoon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The enemy airborne troops on the upper Irrawaddy River have shown signs of wavering since the death of their commander Wingate. Therefore, the enemy Southeast Asia Commander Mountbatten recently encouraged them, saying: "Wingate's death is irrelevant to the overall situation. We still expect much from you in the future." However, supplies of food and ammunition rely solely on airborne supplies, which are extremely difficult to obtain. Therefore, the main force of the enemy troops is on the verge of famine. Mountbatten's words are mere empty talk. They are everywhere subject to fierce attacks by powerful Japanese units, and many have scattered and fled.

Rangoon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese army air force in Burma, since the attack on the 28th, had temporarily remained silent, monitoring the enemy airborne troops' movements. From the 3rd of this month, it launched another fierce attack on the enemy airborne troops. The translation of the situation is as follows: At dusk on the 3rd, a Japanese fighter squadron suddenly launched a surprise attack on the enemy airfield at Kalat (50 kilometers northwest of Kazha), 15 kilometers northwest of Namy. The enemy's anti-aircraft fire was exceptionally fierce. The Japanese planes attacked with machine guns and cannons, destroying its strength. An unidentified number of Japanese dive bombers launched a strong attack on the enemy airfield at Kalat, carrying out accurate bombing at extremely low altitude. After destroying the facilities at the airfield, all planes safely returned to base.

### New Currency System Implemented in Free India – Views of Japanese Economic Circles

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – After learning of the news that the Provisional Government of Free India has established a bank and implemented a currency system, economic commentators have all expressed their blessings to the provisional government and the Indian people, and expressed their views, saying: The Provisional Government of India's implementation of its own currency system this time, with the new bank having opened on the 5th, is because India was previously forced by Britain to adopt the silver standard system, so that it could extract as much Indian gold as possible and transport it to London. This was a clever plan by Britain to plunder gold. On April 1, 1927, Britain, disregarding the strong opposition of the Indian people, implemented the gold standard system in India, causing the Indian people to suffer extreme oppression under the system. Now that India is independent and has restored the right to its own currency, this move is truly laudable.

### Discord Between British and American Leaders

Rangoon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Since the loudly proclaimed total counteroffensive in Burma last year suffered repeated defeats, the American leadership has recently disregarded the active offensive of the American military leadership and released pessimistic remarks about the defeat on the Qian (Burma) front, hoping to shift the responsibility for the defeat onto others. According to enemy air force prisoners captured recently in northern Burma, Mountbatten, in mid-January, when inspecting the glider training of the airborne troops, made the following speech to British and American soldiers in Laladpur near Gaya in Bihar: "Before the war against Germany ends, I am afraid we cannot actively attack Burma." The propaganda of the total counteroffensive in Burma, after being threatened by the fierce attacks of the Japanese side, has exposed the discord within the enemy leadership.

### Japanese Ambassador to Thailand Visits Prime Minister Pibun

Bangkok, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Japanese Ambassador to Thailand Tsubogami, accompanied by Counselor Ishii, visited Thai Prime Minister Pibun at the Prime Minister's residence at 5:00 PM on the 6th, discussing matters for a long time before departing.

### Burmese People Organize the Arakan Volunteer Army

Rangoon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Indian National Army is fighting fiercely in the Arakan region, and there are many areas where the cooperation of Burmese residents is needed. Therefore, the Indian and Burmese people have joined hands to rise up and jointly protect East Asia. A large number of Burmese people have voluntarily taken up arms and swords to participate in the battle in response to the Indian National Army's operations, under the name "Arakan Volunteer Army." They have traditionally lived in the dense forests and are particularly skilled in guerrilla warfare. The "Arakan Volunteer Army" was organized around January of last year by Arakan Sinha. The British air force did not realize Wavell's dream of retaking Burma, and carried out guerrilla warfare centered on Nissi. The British Indian army invaded their homes, and Sinha, in order to defend his home, gathered a number of young people, organized a volunteer army, and appointed Kra Win as commander. As a result, the momentum grew stronger, cooperating with the Japanese army, either infiltrating enemy positions as spies to gather intelligence, or annihilating enemy troops, establishing special merits. The enemy army is also deeply aware that the activities of the volunteer army are a fatal blow to them, and said that "the reason for the previous Arakan tragedy was caused by our abuse of the Burmese people." During the rainy season, when the enemy army launched a counteroffensive, they organized a strategic unit, led by Basant, a former forestry officer in the Nissi area, to appease the Burmese people on the border and began to sabotage the volunteer army's work, but all were unsuccessful. The number of Burmese youth joining the volunteer army is increasing daily. It is said that in mid-March, a Burmese boy named Ja Dan, only fifteen years old, encouraged by his mother, hung a Burmese knife around his waist and enthusiastically joined the volunteer army, setting off to the front line to fight, greatly boosting the morale of the entire army. At the end of February of this year, an enemy force of about 5,000 troops moved south along the Kaladan River. The Japanese army and the volunteers immediately ambushed them, cutting off their retreat. The enemy army was in great chaos and fled to the dense forest area on the river bank. The local residents also, under the command of the volunteer army, sharpened bamboo into spears, and tracked and chased them. In the villages and towns south of Kaktok, all the Burmese people turned out to pursue the enemy army, and in Cakiief, they arrested an Englishman and more than a dozen British soldiers. Also, on March 12, a member of the self-defense corps, Mon Ha, single-handedly killed several enemy soldiers and captured one alive. The activities of the local residents are truly noteworthy. The enemy army, in view of the previous failure, shouted that the Burmese people must not be mistreated this time, but their looting behavior has increased the hatred of the residents. Therefore, the residents along the border, under the leadership of the volunteer army, are all filled with the fighting spirit to overthrow Britain.

### Change of Command for the US Navy in the South Pacific

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a dispatch from Canberra, Halsey, commander of the US Navy in the South Pacific under Admiral Nimitz, will be relieved of his post. It is reported that MacArthur, commander of the US Southwest Pacific, will not be affected by this transfer.

### Central Youth Cadre School Holds Combat Exercise Class

It also intercepted and shot down seven enemy fighter squadrons. A fierce bombing of ground military installations also resulted in two losses for the Japanese side.

Special Commentary

### From Ensuring Public Security and Stabilizing People's Livelihood to Reforming the Local Political System

— Ding Mocun

The Shen Bao editorial on April 5th discussed "Reforming the Local Political System." At the same time, Xinmin Jun's article "Preliminary Views on the Reform of the Local Administrative System" was published, elaborating on the importance of the local administrative system and offering many suggestions on the steps for reforming the local administrative system. I am also deeply interested in this issue, and I dare to express my views for discussion among all parties.

Currently, everyone hopes to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood. Of course, stabilizing people's livelihood is the most important part of the national government's policy; suppressing prices is the most basic means of stabilizing people's livelihood. However, suppressing prices does not seem simple. The most important thing is to increase production, so that materials are fully supplied; and to dredge sources, so that material exchanges are smooth. Forcing suppression and price limits are superficial. These principles have been commonly understood by those who discuss the issue of prices today.

However, if we want to achieve the goals of increasing production and smoothing material exchanges, there is a very important prerequisite, which is to ensure public security. If public security cannot be ensured, then increasing production may encounter unexpected disturbances in the process, affecting the expected results. After production, unexpected opportunities may be lost. For example, in agricultural production, due to poor public security, farmers' work and rest are erratic, reducing harvests. Even if the harvest is not reduced, but the harvested agricultural products fall into the hands of others or are blocked by bandits, making it impossible to export them from rural areas, it is also a waste of effort. Another example is industrial production. Due to poor public security, work is constantly interrupted, reducing output. As a result, not only can production not be increased, but it is reduced. Furthermore, if public security cannot be ensured, the transportation of materials, whether by boat or by vehicle, is subject to obstruction at any time, making smooth exchanges impossible. Therefore, ensuring public security directly protects increased production and the transportation of materials, and indirectly assists in suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihood.

Next, let's talk about ensuring public security. The basic methods are nothing more than clearing the countryside and suppressing the communists. Suppressing the communists is certainly part of the work of clearing the countryside, but at present, with the rampant communists, suppressing the communists is the most urgent work in clearing the countryside. Furthermore, clearing the countryside and suppressing the communists are the basic methods for ensuring public security and should be jointly undertaken by all departments of the national government as the focus of current work. It is by no means that a certain agency can bear it alone, nor is it that a certain group of people can bear it alone. Agencies and agencies, government and people, should unite and mobilize as a whole.

How to mobilize as a whole? It can be divided into vertical and horizontal aspects: Vertical mobilization means that the central, provincial, municipal, county, district, and rural levels are consistently implemented. Horizontal mobilization means that military, political, economic, and cultural aspects are promoted simultaneously. Only in this way can a consistent execution vertically and a simultaneous advancement horizontally achieve the effectiveness of the entire mobilization and ensure public security.

Relying solely on military implementation of clearing the countryside and suppressing the communists can be effective for a while, but after the military period has passed, latent bandits will rise again from the ashes. In particular, the communist party and New Fourth Army bandits are completely lurking in the villages and towns. When the national army enters to suppress them, they escape without a trace. When the national army is transferred, they come out and run rampant. Because past suppression has focused on military affairs, and the coordination with political, economic, and cultural aspects has been insufficient, the cooperation between the government and the people has also been insufficient. In other words, the vertical mobilization and horizontal mobilization have not been perfected, so they cannot eradicate the root cause, making it easy for them to rise again from the ashes.

Some people say that the central government is the point (the focus of the entire country), the provinces and cities are the lines, and the counties and rural areas are the plane. The reason why public security has not been fully established today may also be due to the fact that all parties have previously excessively neglected the "plane." Because the "plane" has been too neglected, the bandits and communists have become increasingly rampant.

Furthermore, in the past, all parties not only excessively neglected the "plane" problem, but even accelerated and deepened its deterioration. This was certainly not intentional, but even if it was out of ignorance, its harm to the "plane" cannot be avoided. For example, corrupt county magistrates or corrupt district chiefs are often used by others and protected on their behalf. In this way, how can the "plane" problem not become increasingly serious?

From the perspective of the entire political system, the central government leads the provinces, and the provinces lead the counties, but the implementation of government orders and policies, the assurance of public security, and the stabilization of people's livelihood are still at the county level. After the return to the capital, those who talked about reforming politics seemed not to have reached the county level, and I have often been greatly puzzled. I previously consoled myself that it might be my personal prejudice, but judging from the current rampant situation of bandits and communists, my views do not seem to be without any basis. Currently, there are indeed many points that can be discussed regarding public security and people's livelihood, but merely blaming the central government or blaming a few central leaders is, based on the above reasons, not a fair opinion. The central government is constantly thinking about governing diligently, but because the local system is unsound and local personnel do not meet expectations, the central government is also unable to do what it wants.

In short, strengthening the national government, increasing its strength, so that it can fulfill its responsibility to Greater East Asia, is the common goal of all parties. How to strengthen the national government and increase its strength? Ensuring public security and stabilizing people's livelihood are the basic conditions, and ensuring public security and stabilizing people's livelihood have a mutually promoting and mutually causal effect. To ensure public security and stabilize people's livelihood (including clearing the countryside and suppressing the communists), in terms of verticality, the central, provincial, municipal, county, district, and rural areas must be mobilized as a whole; in terms of horizontality, political, economic, cultural, and military aspects must be fully coordinated. The foundation of all work is on the "plane." The results are also harvested on the "plane." Therefore, the "plane" problem should be earnestly improved in the future.

As for the improvement of the "plane," the local system and local personnel must be reformed simultaneously. Only a good system can attract truly incorruptible and capable talents, and only truly incorruptible and capable talents can use a good system. With the current local system, even if there are truly capable, honest, and incorruptible talents, they have no way to display their strengths or realize their ambitions, and can only ask for trouble.

I strongly agree with the Shen Bao editorial on April 5th and the views on reforming the local system contained therein, and I hope that all parties will pay more attention to them.

### Agricultural Production Promotion Association Approves Total Budget – Ministry of Food Trains Agricultural Guidance Personnel

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – In order to promote work, the Agricultural Production Promotion Association of the Executive Yuan has prepared to establish 600 township agricultural promotion associations and 4,000 mutual aid societies under its jurisdiction in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai. The total establishment expenses have been approved by the association. The establishment of mutual aid societies by the township agricultural promotion associations totals 3 million yuan, and the promotion fee for the mutual aid societies is 4 million yuan. Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – In order to actively train agricultural guidance personnel, practically take on agricultural guidance, and promote the responsibility of agricultural production, the Ministry of Food has entrusted the China Youth Work-Study Corps in Nanjing to hold a training class for agricultural guidance personnel. Excellent students from various provinces and cities are selected for training. The number of trainees is stipulated to be 100, selected and recommended by the municipal and county governments from outstanding young people from farming families, aged 20 to 30, with a junior high school education. (The recommendation method will be formulated separately.) The training period is seven full months, from May 1st to the end of December. The training subjects are divided into academic subjects, practical training, lifestyle lectures, and rural service. All tuition, board, lodging, and transportation expenses for distribution to practical training during the training period are completely waived. A set of farm clothing will also be issued. After the training period, they will return to their original places and listen to the instructions of the Ministry of Food and the Corps to engage in agricultural guidance work.

### Chongqing Faces Difficulties Implementing Constitutional Government – Unable to Cope with the Public – Extremely Anxious Internally and Externally

Central News Agency report – Regarding Chongqing's implementation of constitutional government, with a five-year focus, according to information revealed by this city, Hang Liwu, a member of the visiting British delegation sent by Chongqing, gave a speech on his personal views on Chongqing's constitutional government upon his recent return to Chongqing. The content of the speech stated: With the date of implementing constitutional government approaching, it is hoped that the Chongqing government will establish people's institutions at all levels as soon as possible, so that the people have the opportunity to participate in politics. It is also hoped that the people of various places will send representatives to fulfill their responsibilities, adopt sovereignty, and not make the people's institutions a tool for personal interests. Adopt the rule of law, because the law is higher than everything, with two meanings: One is that the existence of arbitrary power is absolutely not allowed, and the people will not be punished without due process of law. The second is that government officials, regardless of their private capacity or their civil servant status, will be subject to the same legal sanctions as ordinary people if they violate the law. Second, the people have basic freedoms, including the right to vote, and are allowed to freely elect personnel, form a government, and advocate changing and opposing the government by peaceful means. The people should also be free to criticize the government and propose political discussions. They can also oppose illegal arrests and prohibitions by the government, and can use the opportunity of speech to demand personal freedom. This is the basic freedom that the people must have under constitutional government, otherwise democratic constitutional government cannot exist. The Chinese "Five-Five Draft Constitution" already has clear provisions on these three basic freedoms of the people. Even during the period of political tutelage, there were already civil law regulations. During this wartime, the country cannot but impose considerable restrictions on the freedom of the people. In order to realize constitutional government and gradually move forward, it is hoped that the government will relax restrictions on opportunities for speech within the possible range, and implement the protection of the people's personal freedom in advance. In addition, it is hoped that the people will have a spirit of abiding by the law, so as to gradually increase freedom, so that the people's right to freedom will not be abused. In short, the implementation of constitutional government seeks mutual progress. In addition to hoping that the government will open up political power, it is hoped that the people will fulfill their responsibilities. Therefore, regarding the Chongqing people's demands for opening up the ban on parties and implementing local organization and local autonomy, the entire territory of Chongqing is in turmoil. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek is unable to deal with these demands. The proposal to implement constitutional government passed at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chongqing government last year is already in a difficult position, tantamount to tying one's own hands. And the United Kingdom and the United States have doubts about Chongqing, and have seriously discussed whether it is moving towards a democratic country or a democratic path. Therefore, Chongqing is currently very anxious about dealing with internal and external affairs.

### Foreign Minister Chu and Others Visit Manchukuo Ambassador Lü

### Serious Dispute Between Chongqing and Mongolia – Shooting at Cossacks – Outer Mongolia Issues a Serious Statement

Central News Agency report – According to reliable sources in this city, the friction and disputes between Chongqing and Outer Mongolia are quite serious. The Soviet influence in Xinjiang Province is quite expansive, and Chongqing has taken various countermeasures to prevent this. First, Chongqing instigated Sheng Shicai, chairman of the Xinjiang provincial government, to expel Soviet forces. On the one hand, it strengthened Chongqing's forces in Xinjiang, specially established a provincial party headquarters, hoping to use the Kuomintang's forces to build the foundation of the provincial government, but secretly to implement surveillance, so there are many signs of unrest in Xinjiang Province. In addition, the fact that Chongqing's army crossed the border into Outer Mongolia in Xinjiang was also seriously noted by Outer Mongolia. On the 4th of this month, the government of the People's Republic of Outer Mongolia in Kulun issued a statement, which stated that in December of last year, the Cossack people were nomads in northern Xinjiang. The Xinjiang provincial government ordered their pursuit. After an investigation by Outer Mongolia in the mountain gorges in the southwest, the chased people have moved east to the north. In order to comply with the international spirit of justice and the Mongolian constitution, refugee camps were set up along the way in the territory under its jurisdiction, and the right to live in the territory was granted. However, the new province still pursued them, firing shots indiscriminately, causing many Outer Mongolian people's villages to be hit by bullets. Afterwards, the Outer Mongolian army launched an effective counterattack, confronting each other. On March 20 of this year, the new Chongqing army was finally repelled. It was also said that in order to strengthen defense, the Outer Mongolian border will take necessary measures to deal with the situation.

### Guo Pei'er Writes Article on Germany's Potential, Resolves to Strive to Fulfill its Mission

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Haitong News Agency, the "German Weekly" published a recent essay by Minister of Propaganda Guo Pei'er, stating that Germany's geographical situation and general way of life force Germans to work harder than other countries in order to ensure national survival. After a long period of struggle, the German people have developed this extraordinary energy and efficiency, and the progress of this war proves the truth of this argument. We have been at war with the four major world powers for five years and can still maintain our current position. We rely entirely on our own strength to deal with some overt enemies and covert foes. The enemy has repeatedly underestimated our strength, limited by prejudices from which they cannot escape. Therefore, on the Eastern Front, the Germans are dealing with an enemy twice their size with only half the manpower. At the same time, in Italy, a small number of German troops are facing the superior manpower and resources of the two major powers, Britain and the United States, preventing the enemy from achieving their goals. Imagine if the enemy's advantages were used by us, or if the enemy had to fight on all fronts as we do, what would the result be? Modern Germans have endured hardships in completing their mission that almost exceed human endurance. As for the loss of property due to air raids, we express our respect to the Germans who have suffered sacrifices. If there is any possibility of avoiding sacrifices, we will do our best to do so. In short, we are facing a new era.

A general order has also been issued to the provinces and cities of North China, setting a deadline for completion.

### Battle for the Important Port of Odessa Unfolds, German Rear Guard Defends Double Fortress

Zurich, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to Moscow news, although Soviet troops occupied Tukarat, 55 kilometers southeast of Ternopol, and surrounded powerful German forces in the area, the German side has denied this. Elsewhere, Soviet telegrams continue to exert heavy pressure on the Odessa region. According to a Moscow telegram, the Malinovsky army, advancing on Odessa from three directions, has reached Ladier Nanaia, 38 kilometers north of Odessa, and Kubanga, 14 kilometers northeast of Odessa. Berlin news also stated that German rear guard troops are currently engaged in fierce battles in the extensive bridgehead of Odessa.

Luo Hong's Army Cooperates, War Situation Tends to Stabilize

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to the Haitong News Agency: Fresh German forces and Romanian troops are fighting the enemy in the Prut River area, while Hungarian troops are fighting fiercely in front of the Carpathian Mountains, and the front line has been greatly stabilized. The German forces between the lower reaches of the Tiligul River, the Dniester River, and the Prut River are resisting while retreating, safely transporting all war equipment and heavy equipment. The German rear guard in Odessa is resisting with double fortress fortifications. On Wednesday, the enemy still failed to break through these fortifications to reach the lower reaches of the Dniester River. The failure of this offensive has affected the enemy forces advancing from Balti to Kishinev in the central sector. The enemy's attacks along the Tiraspol-Iasi railway have been unsuccessful, and Romanian troops are vigorously resisting Soviet forces crossing the Prut River north of Iasi. On Wednesday, German troops crossed the Dniester River from Skala Kamennazy Badursk towards Cernauti and west to avoid encirclement by the enemy. There is fierce fighting for Brody and Kovel. German troops in Kovel broke through and advanced northwest, meeting German troops coming to rescue from the north and northwest. Kovel is now within the main German battle line. The enemy offensive south of Lake Peipus in the northern sector has now extended to the Ostrov district. It seems that the enemy's offensive in the southern sector has been blocked, and they intend to stir up trouble in the northern sector.

### Laval's Speech Declares National Policy, Seeking Welfare for the Motherland

Vichy, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Haitong News Agency: Laval delivered a speech at a French military officer's opportunity, strongly arguing that he had done his best and had not done anything harmful to France. It is said that in 1936, he told a certain American reporter that there would be a war between governments that believed in communism and fascism. France has a long history. Today, you are fighting for our country, but in the season of 1940, there was no other option but to sign an armistice agreement. He also said that among you are socialists, communists, and monarchists. Regardless of your future, I hope you will cooperate with each other and unite as one. France is a great country, and I hope the public will not hesitate to sacrifice to seek the survival of the country.

### Greek Government in Exile Resigns

Amsterdam, 7th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency News, according to London Radio broadcast: The Greek government in exile has accepted the resignation of the Tsouderos government.

### New Trends in the European War Situation

The Second Front Issue: In his parliamentary speech on February 22, Churchill stated: "The current Anglo-American air raids on Germany are the foundation for an upcoming invasion of Europe." Regarding this, according to the German authorities' view, the enemy may attempt to invade the mainland somewhere, or simultaneously in several places. However, Germany has full confidence that no matter where the enemy lands, it can be defeated at any time. At the end of last year, the enemy appointed Eisenhower as the commander-in-chief, reorganized the front line, and began the continental invasion operation. The German side also appointed Field Marshal Rommel as the commander-in-chief, personally inspected the Atlantic coast, and further strengthened the iron-clad Atlantic defense line.

Recently, Guo Pei'er, Minister of Propaganda, determined in the Great German Newspaper that "the period of the Anglo-American planned invasion of Western Europe is gradually approaching." According to the combined observations of powerful German journalists or neutral countries, the invasion of Western Europe will be soon. As Churchill said in his speech, the large-scale attacks will intensify from this spring to summer, so the foundation for the air and land invasion cannot be completed without the bean season.

In short, the Anglo-American method is to limit losses to a minimum. If they can do this, they will be relieved. Churchill's plan is to first defeat the German Air Force, especially the fighters, and only after fully controlling the air force will he leisurely implement the landing. Therefore, if we can boldly predict the timing of the opening of the second front, it will probably be in the summer.

Secondly, there is no consensus on the issue of the invasion battlefield. Generally speaking, the main force may land along the Atlantic coast of the English Channel. Some speculate that it will be the Danish coast, but experts consider it too far away and quite difficult, and fighter support is also slightly too far away. There is also the Norway theory, but firstly, it is easy to defend and difficult to attack in terms of terrain. Even if it can be landed, it is difficult to attack the German mainland, and there are many barriers. As for the first attack on the Balkans, it involves the Balkan issue politically, and at the same time, the United States and Britain must first recognize the Soviet sphere of influence, so its feasibility is low. Furthermore, judging from the recent Anglo-American attitude towards Spain, we cannot conclude that the Iberian Peninsula landing theory is impossible. In response to this, as I said before, we have a winning chance no matter where the enemy comes from. We might as well say that the war situation has changed to a good opportunity to attack Britain.

German Retaliatory Bombing

Churchill once said that Germany had to concentrate four-fifths of its existing fighters on the western front because of the Anglo-American air raids. In fact, since last autumn, the movement of German troops has not been affected by the enemy's air strikes on the Eastern Front and the Italian Front, but to prepare for the Anglo-American invasion of Europe. Therefore, it is wrong to think that the retreat at various points on the Eastern Front is a phenomenon caused by this. The current stage of Germany's war against the Soviet Union is a so-called evasive operation, allowing the enemy to take advantage of the situation and send its reserve troops and troops to attack. The German side resisted at every point to avoid increasing its own losses and to lure the enemy. On the other hand, Anglo-American propaganda says that Germany's aircraft production capacity has been reduced by 45 percent due to air raids. This figure is also incorrect. What the enemy is trying to do is nothing more than what Churchill said to annihilate German fighters. In fact, this is exactly the case, planning to bomb German cities related to aircraft factories. The question is how effective this move is. Speaking of this point, analyzing the distance between previous propaganda and facts, we can know that Germany has not suffered such a big blow. Taking the suburbs of Berlin as an example, although they have been subjected to such blind bombing, the factories have not been destroyed to an unimaginable degree. Most of the victims are ordinary residences, churches, hospitals, etc. Germany had already made thorough preparations to completely disperse the factories and did not suffer as advertised and planned by the British and Americans.

Recent Situation on the Eastern Front

Finally, speaking of the recent developments on the Eastern Front, as I said before, Germany's operational guidelines in the German-Soviet War are to abandon territory and make the enemy bleed. Germany is not fleeing in defeat, and the morale of the soldiers is by no means depressed, so when the Soviet Union continued its offensive for about eight months since last July and showed fatigue, it switched to offensive. At least it can be said that in that situation, the German side was fully prepared and willing to counterattack when necessary. As for when or where this will happen, it is of course impossible to predict.

Some people have observed that the Soviet Union is taking the offensive and advancing comprehensively, with its northern border in the Baltic states, its central border in the old Polish territory, and its southern border approaching the Romanian border, so Germany may take some new actions to stop it. What is now a problem is the Soviet Union's enemy rule work in Finland, which is also quite noteworthy.

In the face of this serious situation, the essence of this war, the proposition of national survival, has become a real problem and must be fought to the end. Churchill himself frankly admitted this. As long as the front and rear have this strong determination, as long as there is preparation to complete a long-term war, neither the Soviet offensive, nor the Anglo-American strengthened air raids, nor even the second front can make Germany submit.

### Salt Field Captain Refutes Wild and Absurd Rumors in American Newspapers; Analyzes Reasons for Enemy Failure on Palau Island

Salt Field Captain, representative of the Japanese Fleet Press Department stationed in China, yesterday afternoon, at the joint press conference at Mu Haiwai, gave a detailed explanation of the reasons for the enemy's failure in the Pacific, and denounced the enemy's unfounded propaganda.

Enemy Losses

Salt Field first stated that the Japanese army on Palau Island and Yap Island adopted a bleeding tactic, saying: At that time, the enemy used only ten or so large ships, attempting to invade the Japanese positions on the 23rd. However, enemy Colonel Knox claimed: The use of more than fifty giant battleships and said launch of the Nimitz offensive, ready to South Pacific Philippine Manila dispatched, turning to southern China. However, the enemy's operation completely collapsed and failed. At this time, the so-called enemy large fleet to Palau Island, no more than an educational material, the enemy also difficult to break through the difficulties, deeply worried. Salt Field Captain pointed out that there are two reasons for the enemy's failure: first, Palau Island did not have any slight attack, second, planning to make a head-on battle with the Japanese fleet, this time the enemy fleet was manipulated by the Japanese fleet, resulting in the enemy losing two battleships, one aircraft carrier, one large battleship, two cruisers, therefore the enemy's operation in the Pacific, due to Nogus's lies, the so-called fifty or so large fleets participating in the operation, collapse on their own. However, they are trying to deceive the American public, and even more difficult to cope with. The New York Times has made a boring defense on behalf of Washington, saying; large American fleet did not encounter the Japanese Navy, southwestern Pacific completely under its control, countless southern islands, all under its suppression, and so on.

Beneficial to Japan

Salt Field Captain denounced this one-sided remark, considering it baseless, and analyzed it: The New York Times's unfounded propaganda, saying that the U.S. used its fleet to invade, yet has not achieved the slightest effect, if the Japanese fleet wants to have a head-on battle with it, or not a head-on battle, it is Japan's freedom, but the Japanese Navy only used a small number of air forces and naval forces to severely attack the enemy American fleet, heavily damaging the enemy, this is also the Japanese fleet's freedom, such as the U.S. fleet's supply line is longer, the more beneficial to Japan, if the enemy's large fleet passes, does not attack the Japanese army on the spot, and the Japanese army will naturally take advantage of the enemy's defenselessness to attack, so not taking a head-on battle with the enemy fleet, that is, Palau Island enemy temporarily difficult to attempt to attack. The so-called southwestern Pacific under their control, is not true, at the start of the war, the fleet wherever it goes, not necessarily the area occupied, in military tactics there is also this guidance, stealing sea power is not limited to time and space, difficult to immediately occupy, so Japan's air supremacy in the southwestern Pacific will not allow the enemy to invade, that is, if the enemy has already obtained southwestern Pacific air supremacy, then fifty or so large ships, still do not meet the need, this is because there are many islands there, all Japanese strategic strongholds and bases for operation, if this operation the U.S. immediately obtained southwestern Pacific air supremacy, then it would not have been delayed until now without being realized.

Japanese Army Victory

The so-called attack suppress countless southern islands, check these islands, all occupied by Japan, in terms of distance alone, in terms of supply Japan is closer than the United States, so the New York Times's unfounded words, is no more than a report of the U.S. operation's result. The victory gained by the Japanese fleet, has also been proven here, and the air defense force is extremely strong. Now, even judging the progress of the war in terms of time, the recent increase in Japanese aircraft technicians and the increase in aviation personnel, therefore the progress of the war, will not be far away. Furthermore, the longer the U.S. supply line, the better the opportunity for Japan's operation, so in the south the bases gained by the Japanese Navy, have gradually become fortresses, from the current point of view, although the enemy is bluffing, but in the near future, Japan will eventually wipe them out in one fell swoop, we can wait and see, this enemy's counterattack, the failure suffered, still attempting to cover up domestic, but the news released by the Japanese headquarters on the fourth of this month, is only a part of it, so the information released by the enemy, always uses the information released by Japan as a basis. At the time of this press campaign war, Japan is also one step ahead of the enemy, especially the reports released by the Japanese headquarters, people all over the world believe it to be correct, the American people all know, so the U.S. Navy Department for the traces of failure, also difficult to satisfy.

### Spring Cocoon Harvest Approaching: Silk Factories Rush to Resume Production; Thirty Silk Factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Have Accepted

After Huazhong Silk Co., Ltd. was disbanded in accordance with the implementation of the Japanese new policy towards China, the Ministry of Industry represented the Chinese side's in-kind investment in various silk factories, liquidated and settled accounts. After several meetings, the liquidation was completed in mid-last month. Now, in view of the approaching spring cocoon harvest and in order to ensure that all silk factories resume operation in a timely manner, the Ministry of Industry specially dispatched Wang Shuchun, Director of the Industrial Department, and Xu Qingdeng, assistant to the Director, to Wuxi, Jiaxing, Xiashi, Wei'an, Hangzhou and other places, to preside over the handover matters of various silk factories. The results were quite satisfactory. All thirty silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and three warehouses have been fully returned to their original owners. The manufacturers are grateful that the Ministry has taken their difficulties into consideration and tried to simplify the handover procedures so as to expedite the return within the shortest possible time and prevent them from missing the opportunity to harvest cocoons this year. It is reported that the silk factories are rushing to resume operation in order to assist the government's wartime economic policy and strive to increase production.

### Allocation of Materials to Various Industries: Must Be Distributed to Fellow Traders According to Regulations; Non-Members to Be Resolutely Denied Allocation

In order to ensure that the sales companies receive a sufficient quantity of allocated materials, the authorities have stipulated that any materials allocated to the trade associations of various industries must be distributed to their member traders in accordance with regulations, and no deliberate obstruction or other excuses are allowed; otherwise, approval must be requested. As for the trade associations of various industries, in order to adapt to the current situation, in addition to setting up a commodity evaluation committee, they have also added a commodity allocation team to be responsible for purchasing and distributing materials. However, any materials allocated by the authorities must be fairly distributed to fellow traders, or divided into various levels such as A, B, C, and D, depending on the size of their business scope. Those who are not members of the association should be refused allocation to avoid being manipulated by others; otherwise, they will be subject to legal sanctions by the Standing Committee.

However, once a company, firm, or manufacturing plant obtains these finished products or raw materials, it is strictly prohibited to transfer them privately. If they are finished products, they should be sold at the storefront within the prescribed period and must not be illegally concealed. If they are raw materials, they can only be used for self-manufacturing and it is absolutely forbidden to resell them at high prices for profit. If any of the above situations occur, in addition to suspending the right to enjoy the allocation, they will also be punished according to the severity of the circumstances in accordance with the law in order to prevent malpractices.

### Prices of Goods Sold by Merchants Must Accurately Follow Evaluation; Authorities Expand Scope of Evaluation

Recently, the economic authorities of this city discovered that some illegal merchants are still selling goods at prices that do not comply with the price limits. This kind of behavior clearly violates the original intention of the authorities to suppress prices and needs to be stopped as soon as possible. Therefore, the authorities have stipulated that henceforth, the prices of goods sold by merchants must accurately follow the prices evaluated and approved by the Commodity Price Evaluation Committee. Even if the price is agreed upon by the trade association, but has not been approved by the committee, it must not be adopted. It is also learned that in order to standardize the prices of various commodities in this city, the authorities have decided to expand the scope of evaluation of goods. The standard for determining prices is that the wholesale price should not increase more than 10% of the profit, and the retail price should not increase more than 20% of the profit, in addition to the cost, transportation expenses, administrative expenses and all taxes of the goods.

Children's Day Special - Part Four

### Recent Situation of Pingjiang Children's Education Institute

The Pingjiang Children's Education Institute was founded in the winter of the 27th year of the Republic of China. Initially, it was stipulated to adopt only 50 refugee children, but later it gradually expanded, and set its own house, decided to increase the quota to 200, and so far, the total number of people is 173, the largest is 16 years old, the smallest is 8 years old, of which 10 years old accounts for the majority.

Daily Life

In terms of daily life, because of their young age, it is relatively simple. In the morning, they get up at 6:30, eat breakfast at 7:00, and from 7:00 to 8:00 for an hour, it is the children's time to write. After 9:00 to 4:00 in the afternoon, except for the time to eat lunch in the middle, it is class time. From first grade to sixth grade, the curriculum is in accordance with the primary school system. After 4:00 in the afternoon, they knit mesh bags or do some carving work, but the income is very meager. This is because they are too young to learn other more difficult handicrafts to increase production.

According to the person in charge of the institute: Because of the narrowness of the house, there is a feeling of crowding for the existing number of people. This is the actual situation. The institute's house is a total of five rooms on three floors. The first floor is the former auditorium and cafeteria. The second floor is the classroom, a total of four rooms. The desks and chairs in the classrooms are neatly arranged, and the students' homework, calligraphy, essays, and paintings are placed on all four sides. They don't look very special. The third floor is the dormitory, a total of three rooms. The beds are stacked beds, and teachers and children sleep together. Because there are many people, the children share a bed. The bed sheets on each bed are uniformly white, and the pillowcases are folded into a square shape, which looks quite neat. There is a nanny in each room to manage trivial matters such as young children urinating or putting on clothes at night.

Dietary Situation

In terms of diet, there are also two porridge and one rice. Porridge is eaten in the morning and evening, and rice is eaten at noon. As for cooking rice, cooking dishes, washing dishes, and wiping tables, except for buying groceries, the children do everything themselves. When the author went in to visit, it was their lunch time. Many strong children were eating happily. The porridge and rice and dishes are also regulated. Each person has two bowls of porridge and rice per meal, and the dishes are "big pot dishes". Two people share a small basin, and the vegetables are nothing more than green vegetables, radishes, and tofu. Recently, the News Daily Social Service Office has provided them with yellow beans and beef bones twice a week.

The source of funding is supplemented by the Pingjiang Office, and the rest is raised from the outside by the board of directors, but the Pingjiang Office's subsidy only accounts for one-tenth, so most of it is still raised by the board of directors. Currently, the institute's monthly expenditure is 100,000 yuan, and it exceeded 110,000 last month. The institute's education time is six years. After six years, they have the ability to live, and then they are introduced to various professional departments.

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

Sky Wide Sea Vast (Five)

Because the whole house is full of young and strong people, red face arguments often occur, however, at this time, the attitude of the silent and smiling true person, becomes a strange calming special medicine. He read the ship's newspaper, and interjected, "The canvas bathtub that exposes Petty Officer's navel - a short Senryu ditty is quite interesting!"

Thus, the heated argument came to an end in laughter.

The ship's newspaper is a two-page evening paper. The officers who can write and draw are the publishers. It is printed on octavo-sized white paper with a mimeograph, but the content of the editing is quite substantial.

The main thing is the "Iwate Newspaper" and the special headings of Japanese ordinary newspapers. Every day, a few sentences of Emperor Meiji's text are carefully recorded, and then international news is published, the ship's position and course at noon, and the operation schedule for the next day. However, the supplement has a completely different performance, which contains the destination guide, or the wandering in Senryu, and sometimes finds the poems of begging, and the clear words of modern Kant. Of course, the contributors are mostly officers, but there are many "literary giants" among the petty officers and soldiers. The illustrations and cartoons are all exquisitely drawn, but the beauty country has become the spiritual food that must be published every time. This may be because the readers are all young people and have sexual worries. And the most interesting thing is the price of the newspaper, three cents a month for officers and above, two cents for candidates, and only one cent and two points for soldiers, which can be said to be the fairest price.

(Six)

From this ship's newspaper, Masato and others will never forget to know the resignation of the Hiranuma Cabinet. And the breakdown of the Anglo-Japanese talks. On September 4th, the fleet sailed from Kaohsiung on its way home, and was anchored in Xiamen. The "Iwate Newspaper" occupied the entire page with a huge headline, publishing the declaration of war against Britain and France.

"It's finally started!" During the rest time after dinner, the candidates gathered around the ashtray on the deck, and Kato was the first to open his mouth among the four roommates who formed a group. In the subtropical harbor, far away from the back, the sunset glow, which was roasted red by the sun, gradually turned purple, and there was a scene of dusk.

The saying "It's finally started" is not just for the four of them, but the main topic of conversation for the entire fleet.

"It will definitely expand!" Nakano replied.

"Of course it will expand." Okayama firmly admitted this point.

Social Services

### Yong Shengjun and Others Respond to the Save the Suffering Children Movement

In order to meet the urgent needs of the environment, this newspaper launched the Save the Suffering Children Movement on Children's Day. Readers have donated money and adopted children. Looking around the streets, groups of suffering children are scavenging for leftovers to survive, and the weak are eating tree bark to fill their hunger. After celebrating Children's Day, if we do not find ways to save the suffering children, it can be said that we are telling a false story. The received aid for refugee children: Yong Shengjun 3,000 yuan, colleagues of New New Hotel 500 yuan, Zhang Weichun 200 yuan, a total of 3,700 yuan in vouchers. (The above amounts are all for relieving the suffering children on the street), with a balance of 136,639.70 yuan.

### Appealing to All Sectors for New Pu Yu Tang

— Huang Jingwan

Since this newspaper accepted the request from New Pu Yu Tang to continue appealing to all sectors, it has sent reporters to the church to investigate the internal situation and took many photos. The church has a 33-year history of sacrificial service. I dare to introduce it to all sectors. All donations are used properly, and the suffering people really benefit. There are about 900 people currently being sheltered in the church. This great charitable and relief work should be jointly maintained by people from all walks of life. I think that everyone can easily lift it up, and everyone's will becomes a city. At the beginning of March, the church initiated a fundraising of 1.8 million yuan from the press, and a great benefactor added 1.8 million yuan. According to the budget at the time, it could be maintained for six months. Although the fundraising exceeded the goal, the price of everything has skyrocketed, and all prices have doubled compared to the pre-arranged period. The church has no foundation and lacks funds. A savior recently stated to this newspaper that he was willing to donate 1 million yuan in the hope that kind people from all walks of life would donate enthusiastically. In order to encourage all sectors to donate, he stated that for every 1,000 yuan donated by all sectors, he would donate 1,000 yuan to the million, and the savior is a reputable and enthusiastic person in Shanghai, and I can guarantee that what he said will be fulfilled. Therefore, I have no choice but to continue fundraising 1 million yuan from all sectors through this newspaper in order to purchase grain and daily necessities to maintain it until the end of the year. Therefore, I hope that all sectors will help more quickly, regardless of cash, daily necessities, and things that are easy to sell, new and old are welcome. If prices continue to rise for a long time, it will exceed the budget again.

From now on, this office will collect donations on behalf of you. The names and amounts of all donors will be disclosed in the newspaper every day to show great trust. As for the content and photos of the church's sub-sectors, I am afraid that readers are still unclear, so they will be published in sections in this column for all sectors to read. The church is open all day on Saturday every week, welcoming visitors from all walks of life. The address is Guohuo Road, Nanshi.
