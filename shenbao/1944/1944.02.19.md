Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from New Delhi reports: The Southeast Asia Command announced on the night of the 16th that on the night of the 14th, Japanese forces attacked Na Ga De Ku on the Arakan front line, occupying two hills overlooking the pass of the Maungdaw mountain range. British forces have retreated from their positions north of Maungdaw.

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - The British forces in the area north of Maungdaw are facing a major crisis of being surrounded and annihilated due to the ingenious flanking tactics of the Japanese army, which is imminent. According to a United Press dispatch from New Delhi on the 17th, according to recent front-line news, the Japanese army has built positions in the hilly area and launched several night attacks in the past seven days. British tank units and Indian troops are still resisting stubbornly.

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from New Delhi states: The Southeast Asia Command announced the battle situation on the Arakan front line on the 17th as follows: Some local battles have unfolded west and northwest of Buthidaung on the Arakan front line.

### Truk Islands: Naval and Air Battle Unfolds; Japan's Strong Navy Displays Power

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - The U.S. Pacific Fleet Command announced on the night of the 17th that the U.S. fleet began attacking the Truk Islands on the morning of the 16th, and that hundreds of U.S. aircraft participated in the operation.

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - Since the U.S. Central Pacific Force forcibly landed and invaded the Marshall Islands on February 1st, and taking advantage of its momentum, it has continued to attack Truk Island, an important Japanese base in the South Pacific. Disregarding the heavy damage it suffered since the enemy landed on Mono Island in October of last year in northern New Guinea, Bougainville, New Britain, Rabaul, etc., it single-mindedly continues its forceful operational goal, which is to attack Truk Islands, a strategic base in the South Pacific. However, due to the strong counter-offensive force of the Japanese army in that area, it has suffered great losses, and the battle situation has not progressed. Therefore, it has been eager to avoid frontal attacks and has gradually invaded Truk Islands from the Central Pacific, first attacking the Gilbert Islands and the Marshall Islands, where the Japanese army's defense capabilities are weaker. And with its remaining strength, on the 17th, it invaded Truk Islands with powerful aircraft units and powerful air force units. Currently, both sides are engaged in fierce fighting. According to reports, the enemy's attack this time is by no means a formal operation, but merely a reconnaissance battle. However, with Japan's strong navy, fighting against an enemy that has difficulties with supplies and a long distance to attack, it will undoubtedly repel them.

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific on the 18th: Anti-Axis aircraft once again raided Wewak, New Guinea on the 15th.

The Japanese fighter squadron immediately launched a courageous counterattack, engaging in a fierce aerial battle and shooting down five P40s. The others were all repelled. Although Japanese aircraft lost three, the convoy suffered no damage. Also, at 5:30 AM on the same day, another unit of Japanese aircraft bombed an enemy airfield under construction southwest of Wewak, inflicting great damage.

They, like overseas Chinese in other southern regions, occupy an absolute force. They completely dominate the economic power of Thailand in terms of production and distribution. Since the founding of the Republic of China, problems have repeatedly arisen between Thailand and overseas Chinese. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, they have realized that Asian nations should unite. Therefore, their subsequent relationship has been extremely harmonious. They have gradually understood the true meaning of building a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, so they actively cooperate in all construction departments. In particular, they have made great contributions to the construction of railways. Furthermore, due to Thailand's active cooperation, Japan has given Thai overseas Chinese extremely great reflections and self-awareness.

### National Financial Revenue and Expenditure Now Maintain Balance; Recent Sharp Rise in Prices Unrelated to Currency

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Finance held its regular meeting with Chinese and foreign journalists in the capital at 3:00 PM on the 18th. Responsible persons from the ministry answered various financial questions raised by the journalists in detail. The details are recorded below: What is the situation of national financial revenue and expenditure recently? (Answer) At present, the national financial revenue is mainly based on unified taxes, followed by customs duties, income tax, and salt tax. The monthly expenditure budget is approximately 300 million yuan, of which military expenses account for more than 60%. The revenue and expenditure can still be met. After the ban on opium, a batch of tax revenue will be reduced. How will this reduction be compensated? (Answer) The decision to ban opium within a limited time is indeed a gratifying thing. It has no impact on the entire tax revenue, and in fact, it was not originally intended to be used as a proper source of income, so there is no need to consider how to make up for it. After the Japanese residents in China pay taxes to the National Government in accordance with the regulations, how much will the tax revenue of the National Government increase? (Answer) There are currently no accurate statistics on the number of Japanese residents taxed, and the estimated number is not very large. However, this spirit of Japanese residents is indeed valuable and enough to symbolize the bright future of Sino-Japanese cooperation. The recent surge in prices in various places has many causes, but is it also stimulating the issuance of currency? (Answer) The amount of Central Reserve Certificates issued now has increased in quantity compared to before, but in terms of actual demand, it has not yet reached the saturation point at all. The issuance of banknotes during wartime is also a common phenomenon, so our country's current currency is not in inflation at all. In other words, the recent surge in prices has nothing to do with currency, but is only caused by the failure of material circulation to be smooth. To what extent has the Ministry of Finance's work on adjusting financial institutions progressed? There seem to be too many existing financial institutions. Is the authorities considering forcibly merging them? (Answer) The Ministry of Finance is still promoting and advancing the work of adjusting financial institutions according to the established policy. If there are those who do not increase the statutory funds as scheduled according to the regulations, they will be shut down. As for the forced merger of financial institutions, it may be implemented in the future due to changes in the environment, but it has not yet been considered at present.

### Price Management in Three Provinces and Two Cities Will Be Comprehensively Unified and Implemented

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Nanjing authorities believe that in order to solve the current serious price problem reasonably, it will not be successful without the overall planning and cooperation of all provinces, cities, and districts. In the past, price countermeasures in various provinces, cities, counties, and districts were individually formulated and implemented. There was little coordination and adjustment among them, resulting in large differences in prices in various places, leading to an uneven distribution of materials. As a result, it further promoted the surge in prices. For this reason, the authorities recently submitted a request to the central government to plan to organize a "Price Control Committee for Three Provinces and Two Cities" (tentative name) so that the price problems of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces and Nanjing and Shanghai special municipalities can have a fundamental and reasonable countermeasure and be comprehensively unified and implemented. The project is currently being closely reviewed by the Ministry of Industry. If it can be realized, the price problem can be reasonably solved. In addition, based on the above suggestions, the Ministry of Industry authorities have recently formulated official prices and agreed prices for daily food and necessities of life. The list of materials totals 17 items, which are circulated to the economic authorities of various provinces and cities, which in turn order the industry associations to strictly supervise and enforce them.

### Five Enemy Properties to Be Transferred Soon

The remaining 43 pieces are currently being prepared by relevant Chinese and Japanese agencies for transfer. The Japanese government has long decided on its policy of transferring 25 pieces of enemy property other than the aforementioned British and American properties to the National Government, and has completed the investigation, which will be transferred soon.

### Ministry of Food Takes Over Pangshan Lake Farm

### Rommel Inspects the Atlantic Wall and Talks with Commanders of Various Districts

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency has been authorized to publish: Marshal Rommel, by order of Marshal Xi Shi Quan Yin, recently inspected the southern part of the Atlantic Wall in order to inspect the fortresses and defense systems there. After inspecting the defenses in the Gulf of Lyon, Marshal Rommel traveled along the Pyrenees Mountains to the southernmost part of the German Western Front near the border between France and Spain, Handa and Irun. The Marshal also inspected the German deep-sealed defensive points along the Atlantic coast in Biscay, paying particular attention to places of special military importance, such as the ports of southwestern France. After inspecting the coastal heavy artillery units and various bases along the Atlantic coast, Marshal Rommel was convinced of the technical effectiveness of these facilities and the excellent training of the defending forces. Marshal Rommel held lengthy talks with the commanders of various districts and discussed future tasks with them. After this inspection, this part of the Atlantic Wall proved that the Biscay coast was ready to repel any enemy attack.

### It is Reported that Finland Rejected Soviet Demands; German Troops in Finland Will Not Withdraw

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports; local newspapers recently published a statement by a "Soviet government spokesman" stationed in Stockholm, who said that the future of the Soviet-Finnish issue is not promising. He claimed that all published peace terms were inaccurate. He acknowledged that the Soviet Union would demand that Finland force the withdrawal of German troops from Finland and the occupation by Soviet troops, but the Finnish side has expressed its refusal to accept, so it is currently impossible to coordinate the two sides.

Also, according to announcements from Berlin political circles: General Detit (the commander of German troops in northern Norway and Finland) has been ordered to prepare for withdrawal, which is part of the enemy's psychological warfare.

### The War Has Entered a Decisive Stage; The Fate of the European Continent is at Stake; Dr. Goebbels Appeals Loudly

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to the Haitian News Agency: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels wrote in the German Weekly that the war has approached its peak. Since the beginning of 1944, there have been decisive and major developments in both military and political aspects. The struggle that will determine the history and fate of Europe is increasingly close. If the enemy can defeat Germany, the collapse of Europe is inevitable. At this critical juncture of life and death, we must exert our last ounce of strength, otherwise the people of Huan Lu will eventually be trapped in a state of terror forever. The people of Europe know that if they want to avoid disaster, they can only rely on Germany and cannot seek help from Britain and the United States. The goals of Britain and the United States also disappear with the progress of the war, because Britain and the United States can no longer restore Europe to its pre-war position, but can only pave the way for the Communists to rule Europe. Since Britain and the United States are no longer able to do anything, only the German military can stop the Bolsheviks from occupying Europe. The Soviet Union is now using its propaganda to deceive the world, and the Jews are widely supporting it, using it to cover up the world's reason and act as traitors, which is infuriating.

### One U.S. Ship Sunk, Thousands Drowned

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington; the U.S. Army Department announced on the 17th that a U.S. transport ship was sunk by German forces in European waters at night. Due to the rough seas at the time, the ship sank immediately. Approximately 1,000 crew members and soldiers drowned, and the remaining 1,000 were rescued. However, the location and date of the sinking were not announced.

### Soviet Winter Offensive Ends; German Troops Shorten Lines in the North

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: In the northern sector of the Eastern Front, a cold wave with temperatures around 15 degrees below zero has extended to areas north of the Dnipro River bend. Roads have frozen, and snowfall is occurring everywhere, with only the Crimean Peninsula reporting rainfall.

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports, military dispatch: Germany is implementing a planned shortening of its lines to gain more reserve operational units. Therefore, after destroying all military equipment last night, it withdrew from Staraya Russa (south of Lake Ilmen). The German forces stationed there were able to disengage from the enemy, and all military equipment and supplies were transported to newly prepared positions. The Soviet forces were unable to hinder the German movements.

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - A German military spokesman announced yesterday: The battles on the Eastern Front in the last few days have been less intense than two weeks ago. German forces are now conducting counter-offensives in the southern sector. The Soviet winter offensive, which began on December 24th of last year, has now ended. Most of the locations of intense fighting two weeks ago are now quiet. The main focus of the fighting across the entire front is currently only in two areas. The German counter-offensive west of Cherkasy, although encountering stubborn Soviet resistance, continues to make daily progress. The other focus is near Vitebsk, where German forces repelled a full-scale Soviet attack. Currently, Soviet forces continue to threaten the Narva region, but the Soviet offensive in that area cannot be described as a large-scale attack. The Soviet operations directed at Pskov have encountered obstacles and stalled.

### Naturno Landing Zone Further Compressed; German Troops Firmly Hold Cassino

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: German forces have launched several fierce attacks on enemy positions in the Naturno bridgehead. As a result, German positions were improved on Wednesday, and the Allied landing zone was further narrowed. The enemy troop concentrations in the bridgehead have been subjected to intense artillery fire and air attacks, suffering heavy losses. In the Cassino area, American forces continue to shell the Benedictine monastery, but there is no news of other fighting. Although the enemy has repeatedly attempted to advance from the northern suburbs of Cassino, these attempts have collapsed under German artillery fire.

Condemnation of Monastery Bombing as Barbaric Act

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - Field Marshal Kesselring, German commander on the Italian Front, issued a statement: On February 15th, from 9:30 AM to 10:00 AM, Allied air forces bombed the monastery atop Monte Cassino, completely destroying the monastery and causing many civilian deaths and injuries. The Allied Command claimed that the attack was carried out to eliminate German forces inside the monastery, but I categorically deny this. Months ago, the Vatican, through the German Embassy, requested that the Cassino monastery be excluded from the war zone. Consequently, I immediately took the necessary measures, strictly prohibiting German troops from entering the monastery. We did not even use the monastery to house the seriously wounded. At the time of the bombing, hundreds of refugees, believing in the monastery's neutrality, had sought shelter there. There were no German troops in its vicinity. Those killed and injured in the bombing were only monks and civilians. The fact that there were no German troops or military installations inside the monastery can be proven by a signed declaration from Abbot Diamare. After the monastery was destroyed, German forces immediately designated it as part of the German defensive line, which was a natural measure. The Allied forces also bombed the Pope's summer residence, killing 500 Italian civilians, including 16 nuns. No German troops had ever entered that area, and German forces strictly adhered to its extraterritoriality. As the German commander in Italy, I hereby point out that the American action is new evidence of the destruction of European culture by the British, Americans, and Soviets. I am extremely disgusted by the shameless attempt of the British and American war leadership to shift the responsibility for destroying the monastery onto the German forces.

### Argentine Coup d'état Creates a Great Shock

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Argentine coup d'état appears to have caused a great shock in American political circles. According to United Press in Washington: U.S. State Department officials have expressed the view that if a pro-Nazi group of officers seizes power after this Argentine coup, the U.S. government will observe the development of the situation and not recognize the Argentine government. However, Argentine political circles are currently extremely chaotic, and it is now only possible to wait and see how the political situation develops.

### The Path to Permanent Sino-Japanese Cooperation

— Wu Zhenxiu

Colonel Tsuji Masanobu of the Japanese Army gave a speech (original text can be found in the 17th and 18th editions of Japanese newspapers - Editor's note), stating that Japan can only avoid defeat by obtaining China's genuine cooperation and hoping that the Japanese in Shanghai will strive to thoroughly implement the new policy. This speech has had an impact on various aspects of Sino-Japanese relations. Both sides who are advancing and accepting the new policy are determined to move towards resolving the Sino-Japanese problem in accordance with the spirit of the policy. Mr. Wu Zhenxiu, Chairman of the Board of the Bank of China, a financial magnate in Shanghai, also responded to Colonel Tsuji's speech. Based on the spirit of the new policy, he pointed out the necessity of assisting Japan in building the foundation of Sino-Japanese cooperation, expressed the attitude of Chinese economic circles, and frankly expressed various opinions regarding China's economic construction. The following is a summary of his key points:

The Goal of Greater East Asia Construction

In this Japanese parliament, the goal of constructing a new economic order for Greater East Asia has been declared as mutual benefit, equality, coexistence, and co-prosperity for all countries in Greater East Asia. Building a new order of coexistence and co-prosperity using the old Anglo-American methods is impossible. The prior issue is to create a Greater East Asia economic organization that reasonably distributes raw materials, production power, its equipment, and products. This means gathering representatives from various countries in Greater East Asia to hold a meeting that can be called the Greater East Asia Economic Conference.  Focusing on the distribution of raw materials, production power, and products, establish a planned economy for all of East Asia.

As demonstrated by the outbreaks of the First and Second World Wars in Europe, the existing Anglo-American economic system will cause wars again. This is as clear as fire. Finance Minister Kaya stated in parliament that there was no intention to restore the gold standard, which is certainly appropriate. Establishing this planned economy seems suitable to adopt a system that controls the countries of Greater East Asia. Applying this method to China means adjusting the Sino-Japanese economy.

I often think that there are many Chinese people who are pro-Japanese now but were anti-Japanese in the past, changing their beliefs due to the changing times. The same situation exists in Japan. It is difficult to fundamentally resolve the Sino-Japanese problem with such people. Regardless of the past or present, without being moved by the environment, quietly observe and examine the fundamental problems between China and Japan, and not be dominated by the changes of the times to solve the problems between China and Japan, these are the people who I think can truly resolve the Sino-Japanese problem. These people are the ones who are making the greatest efforts for the future coexistence and co-prosperity of China and Japan. Among the Chinese, there are many such people who do not come forward. It can be said that these people are sincerely waiting for the day they can work for China and Japan.

There is a Chinese saying called "Each goes his own way," which means each marches toward their own beliefs. The opposite of this is "Each goes the wrong way."

Concrete Implementation of the New Policy

Recently, there are indeed commendable and increasing cases of the gradual concrete implementation of the new policy in state-owned enterprises, the disposal of enemy property, the control of materials, and other aspects. This is showing Japan's sincerity to the Chinese, and the number of people who trust Japan is increasing. However, observing the dynamics of the past year, although the people above are good, if the people below do not fully understand this spirit, the result is that these good deeds cannot blossom and bear fruit below. Isn't this somewhat visible in the new policy?

Ambassador Tani, Minister Tajiri, and Colonel Tsuji have also clearly stated that this consistency is the key to the concrete implementation of the new policy. Of course, the Chinese who are affected by the new policy should also correct their past attitudes, be aware that they are East Asians, and continue to work harder than ever before to cooperate with Japan. I dare say that this point should be fully remembered by people in Chinese economic circles.

China's Autonomy

The foundation of the new policy lies in China's autonomy. What is meant by autonomy? This means leaving China to carry out its responsibilities and creativity independently. This is especially so in politics, economics, and culture, especially economics. Of course, Japan's economy is different from China's feudal economy and has been modernized. Therefore, what China cannot start should be done by Japan, while what China can do, it is hoped that it will be entirely handled by China.

I often say that the division of activities between Chinese and Japanese capital is clear. For example, China's existing capital, technology, and production equipment in heavy industries, chemical industries, etc., cannot be compared to Japan's, so Japanese economics must do it. But in terms of procurement and light industry, isn't it a good method to assist Chinese activity? Thinking from the perspective of Sino-Japanese cooperation, it is very difficult to achieve satisfactory progress if both sides are equal and do the same thing. Mr. Kodama, the former president of the Central China Development Company, said that even if capital can cooperate, people's cooperation is not possible. This seems to be the case.

The New Policy and North China

The new policy can also be implemented in North China. But observing the facts, it is rich in Central China flavor. What I just said, I think it is the same in North China.

The unification of Chinese capital is necessary in making economic activities modernized. We must strive towards unifying Chinese capital, which is the same as before. Regarding this point, fostering national capital is most important, and there is no other way to do this except by fostering national capital by Japan based on the new policy.

The Scope of the New Policy

Among the Japanese, once the new policy is established and reaches the stage of implementation, people are declaring, "This is the new policy," and "That is the new policy," and there is a tendency to start all kinds of things at the same time. However, the superficial structure changes too much. The exterior is the new policy, but isn't the content contrary to its spirit? I think this point should be avoided as much as possible.

For example, in Central and North China, the currency is complex, and the controlling authorities are different. If they are unified while shouting the new policy, the impact of economic changes in the two places will be very large. When the stability of people's livelihood is still needed, changes in the economic world can have negative consequences. If there are such problems, then it can only be hoped that they can be gradually or fundamentally adjusted without changes under the current conditions.

The Problem of Material Exchange

The exchange of materials is one of my greatest considerations. Under the current conditions, there are more obstacles to material exchange. There are two fundamental problems in controlling materials, namely, first, preventing materials from being washed out to enemy areas, and second, controlling the materials to ensure a certain amount of military supplies. The previous easing of restrictions on the movement of 19 controlled items was to remove things that did not need to be controlled. But there are still 17 controlled items, but their control is implemented to achieve the aforementioned goals.

However, if there is a method to ensure military supplies, then the control of some items can be eased somewhat. This is not my individual thought, but a general view. Reviewing this point again, I think it is necessary to adopt a mechanism that enables the exchange of materials. The problem with the Commerce and Trade Association lies in the method of controlling materials, that is, whether it is still concentrated in the Commerce and Trade Association, or whether important materials are controlled separately. However, no matter which method of control is used, strengthening the mechanism is always necessary.

The Activities of Chinese Economic Circles

Among people in economic circles, the number of people who are willing to cooperate has certainly increased, but there are still many who take a neutral position, and there are also those who are always only interested in profit. It is said that among those who express a particularly cooperative attitude, many are seeking rights and interests. On the other hand, among those who do not come forward, there are many who are seriously thinking about the permanent future of China and Japan. Assigning leadership to these people and implementing economic policies that promote the overall will of the people, I think, is very important and urgent.

I have simply stated one aspect of what I believe. I am deeply impressed by what Colonel Tsuji, Ambassador Tani, and Minister Tajiri have said. In particular, Colonel Tsuji's radio broadcast speech on the 8th is deeply engraved in my mind. Its content is indeed the true voice of Japan. It is also the voice of the new China. There is a Chinese saying called "It is better to be quiet than to move." My mentality is also like this, and I am determined to work hard for the permanent peace of China and Japan.

### Commerce and Trade Association Ordered to Handle Material Exchange and Distribution; Implementation Plan to Begin with Rice Procurement

(Central News Agency) In order to implement the current food and price policies, the authorities are paying attention to the distribution of cotton yarn and other major materials in various places, promoting the purchase of agricultural products, and aiming for organic operation. On January 30th, they promulgated the Outline for the Implementation of Material Distribution in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, ordering the Commerce and Trade Association to be responsible for implementation. After receiving the order, the Commerce and Trade Association immediately made close plans. The initial implementation plan will first begin with the Rice Control Association's purchase of rice. The method is that when purchasing rice, in addition to paying a portion of the funds directly to farmers in cash, a small portion of the remainder will be paid with material distribution certificates from local cooperatives. The cooperatives will then distribute daily necessities needed by farmers with these certificates. The materials distributed include six types: cotton yarn, candles, matches, soap, sugar, and cigarettes. This method has been approved at the 11th meeting of the Material Control Examination Committee of the Executive Yuan and will be implemented soon. The detailed table for the exchange of materials will be based on the quantity and amount of rice purchased in various places. It is believed that the implementation of this method will make the rice purchasing work smoother, and the general price level will also tend to stabilize as a result.

### Chief of Reporting Department Matsushima Refutes American False Propaganda; Issues Statement on Situation in Marshall Islands

He also stated that Japan is currently adopting a posture of preparedness and will soon launch a large-scale counter-offensive, currently in offensive defense. As for America's desire to use China as a tragic battlefield, attempting to seek its own survival with the blood and flesh of others, it is a consistent Anglo-American conspiracy, etc. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.

### District Court Clears Backlog of Cases; Holds Talk Meeting Yesterday

(Central News Agency) Since the Shanghai District Court was reorganized and established after merging the former First and Second Special District Courts and the Nanshi District Court, its jurisdiction has expanded, and the number of civil and criminal litigation cases accepted has also increased, reaching more than 2,000 cases per month. President Zhao, formerly the presiding judge of the First Criminal Division of the Supreme Court, has spared no effort in reorganizing the court's internal affairs since being transferred to this position. He is especially concerned about the suffering of the people in litigation. Therefore, on the 17th of this month, at 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM, he separately convened meetings with the presiding judges and judges of the civil and criminal divisions to discuss the issue of clearing the backlog of cases. He earnestly urged them to expedite the handling of the backlog of cases within the shortest possible time, in order to alleviate the suffering of litigants. In the future, cases should be accepted and handled as soon as they arrive, and be concluded as soon as they are handled, in order to live up to Minister Zhang's expectations for reorganizing the judiciary.

He expressed gratitude for the cooperation of the Allied authorities and the achievements of past Chinese and foreign staff, and encouraged the staff in the following three points: Important Chinese and Japanese staff in the office should, regardless of nationality, work together in harmony and cooperation under the principle of mutual respect to advance various administrative matters. The status of foreign staff who remain in the office should continue to be guaranteed in good faith so that they can work with peace of mind and give full play to their expertise and skills to assist in the development of the office. The staff transferred from the former Eighth District Public Office and other staff should form a unified whole with the original staff in spirit, strive to serve, and continuously improve the work efficiency of the First District Public Office.

### Third Phase of Household Coal Briquettes Ready; Sales to Start Universally Soon

Regarding the distribution of the 21st phase of household coal briquettes in the jurisdiction of the First District Public Office, the competent authorities have prepared everything and will soon issue a notice to begin sales universally within days. As for the quantity allocated per person and the price, it is said to be the same as in the previous phase. It is understood that various coal briquette manufacturing plants are already starting production to meet the needs of various sales agents. According to a Shanghai News reporter's inquiry from the coal industry, the raw materials (coal dust) used to manufacture coal briquettes are still arriving continuously. Considering the current quantity of household coal briquettes distributed, there will definitely be no shortage of fuel needed by residents for cooking. It is also understood that the coal ash sold by members of the Municipal Coal Slag Dealers' Association is very suitable for manufacturing coal briquettes. Therefore, the association is working to adjust the price of coal ash and strictly prohibits selling it to hoarders.

Economic Commentary

### Conference of Economic Bureau Directors

In a recent editorial, this newspaper, under the title "Sound Personnel and Unified Wartime Authority," discussed the prerequisites for the success of rice control, but we felt that the joint meeting of cadres convened by the Rice Control Committee was merely a superficial formality, no different from ordinary meetings. The result was simply the implementation of motions and reports. This has become a common ailment of all meetings in the country and must be eradicated fundamentally. Only then can the name of the meeting match the reality of the meeting? Otherwise, even if there is a meeting, discussion, and resolution, the result will only be a resolution that is not implemented.

The Ministry of Industry, concerned about the rising prices in various regions, even several price increases in a single day, causing public anxiety and uncertainty, convened a conference of provincial and municipal economic bureau directors in Shanghai on the 22nd of this month to discuss countermeasures, seek reasonable solutions, and stabilize people's livelihoods. It urgently sought to suppress the price increases, strive for an ample supply of materials, and instruct the relevant authorities to earnestly implement the temporary wartime price management regulations, so that ordinary merchants would not regard them as mere empty words. This seems to be the motivation for convening this meeting. So, can this "Economic Bureau Directors Conference" become an effective prescription for the most serious price problems at the moment?

Indeed, the Economic Bureau is responsible for stabilizing prices, but there are fundamental methods and general methods for stabilizing prices. We feel that the severity and urgency of the current price situation is already a case of "distant water cannot quench a nearby fire." Therefore, for the immediate future, we must actively implement general methods for stabilizing prices, the most important of which are: 1. Price freezing, i.e., taking the average price of general commodities on a certain day as the highest price, and not allowing it to exceed this price and continue to rise; 2. Crack down on profiteering, i.e., severely punish merchants who take the opportunity to raise prices to seek exorbitant profits; 3. Manage sales, i.e., strictly manage the sales of daily necessities to regulate supply and demand. As for cracking down on hoarding and speculation, it can be included in cracking down on profiteering and managing sales.

### Adjustment of Food Prices Must Be Submitted to the Review Council - Municipal Grain Bureau Informs Food Industry Guilds

The various trade associations in this city previously assessed and set standard price limits for goods in installments and issued them to all members of the industry for compliance. However, to this day, many businesses have arbitrarily changed prices and deliberately exceeded these limits, causing great harm to the people's livelihood. The Municipal Grain Bureau, to prevent illegal price increases and curb the rising tide of prices, has specifically ordered all grain industry trade associations to submit any future price adjustments to the Price Assessment Committee for approval before implementation. Unauthorized price increases are strictly prohibited, and those who deliberately violate the regulations will be severely punished.

### Ministry of Industry Will Reregister Unregistered Companies

Since the Ministry of Industry began handling company registrations last October, it has instructed the relevant authorities to handle them separately. Companies with legal organizations that applied for registration have been approved by the Ministry and issued registration licenses. However, some companies whose organizations did not meet the requirements of the company regulations were rejected by the Ministry. To ease the difficulties of businesses and prevent mail from being lost or misdirected, the Ministry has decided that all companies in various regions, whether applying directly or indirectly through the Economic Bureau, that have not been approved for registration must, by the end of this month, state the reason for the case and the company's detailed name and address in a registered letter to the Ministry for verification.

### Farmers' Urgent Plea: Grain Receipts Impossible to Calculate

The collection of land tax relies entirely on the grain receipts issued by the county. The grain receipts of Qingpu County are now like this: First, the name of the grain taxpayer is indicated, then the amount of mu (unit of land) that the grain taxpayer should pay, and then the fertility of the land, such as first-class top, first-class middle, and first-class bottom, are each specified, and the amount of legal tender to be paid is then indicated. However, the class to which the paid land belongs is not indicated.

Therefore, the grain taxpayers cannot calculate the amount after reading the grain receipts. Only when paying at the counter, the clerk standing inside the counter will temporarily indicate which class your land belongs to. Is it easy to multiply and calculate the amount after it is indicated? Still not. The clerk standing inside the counter will still arbitrarily add how much surtax per mu and how much survey fee per mu. The grain taxpayer standing outside the counter cannot use the abacus inside the counter to calculate the amount, so they have to let the clerk do the calculations as they please. Once the amount is calculated, you have no choice but to obediently pay the legal tender earned with your sweat and blood.

This is not the only strange thing. After paying the legal tender, he actually gives you a receipt. This receipt only states how many mu have been paid, but it never states how much legal tender has been received! We hope that the county government will earnestly rectify this situation and not allow the villagers to have grievances that they cannot express!

### Extortion and Apportionment

— Jin Limin

In recent years, the practice of township and bao leaders extorting donations from residents in the countryside has become increasingly rampant and endless. The method of apportioning donations by township and bao leaders in my hometown (i.e., Jianxiang Township, Xiaoshan, Zhejiang) is as follows: The township chief actually issues orders, gathers all the bao leaders for a meeting, and must first slaughter pigs and chickens to set up a feast to entertain them. The bao chief is assigned a huge amount of money and is given a deadline to collect and hand it over to the execution leader. They extort from house to house, regardless of wealth, with rich families paying seven or eight hundred yuan per month and poor families paying several hundred yuan. In addition, when collecting spring flowers from farmland, they apportion seven or eight sheng (unit of volume) of soybeans and wheat per mu. During the autumn harvest, they extort three dou (unit of volume) of rice per mu. In addition, there are items such as wealthy donations and special donations. They forcibly assign each household to pay, and the township chiefs, bao leaders, and jia leaders who are in charge are all local unemployed idlers who push each other forward and use their power to bully others. Therefore, those with a little agricultural land value are afraid of trouble and endure in silence, and are unwilling to come forward to assume the duties of township and bao leaders. As a result, things are getting worse and worse, society is moving towards darkness, and the people are in dire straits. It is hoped that the provincial and county governments will quickly send personnel to thoroughly investigate and vigorously reform the local organizational structure to alleviate the suffering of the people and resolve the crisis. I would be extremely fortunate!

### Letter

I greatly admire Mr. Tang Jingguo's article in the National Forum some time ago, which proposed the method of paying teachers' salaries once every six months or paying half in advance. I have learned that Mingde Girls' Middle School on Taishan Road has adopted this method since last semester in order to take care of its colleagues, and will continue to implement it this semester. The method is as follows: 1. Three months' salary will be paid in advance on February 7; 2. Half a month's salary will be paid on March 7 and March 31; 3. Half a month's salary will be paid on May 7 and June 7; 4. One month's salary will be paid on July 7; 5. Salary increases will be sent separately each month. (Xu Shigong)

### Sea Turtle (5)

— Written by Hidetoyo Umitada, Translated by Hong Yang

The five-minute game time. Unfortunately, the even-numbered team of Real Person lost because the bar was pushed at an angle of more than thirty degrees, and the decision was that it lost.

However, the most ridiculous thing is that when the speaker before that time stopped - "the speaker sounded, the postures of the two armies, at the moment when it stopped until five minutes, the speaker sounded, so I had to immediately stop the competitive action, and the military order was like a god - the students who were beating were still in the same posture, and the students who were beaten were also in the same posture. So, from the whole point of view, it was like the previously washed live-action race (Note: Living people are dressed up as characters in the game). Otherwise, it was like a movie had a problem. To the third party, it was very funny - but the students did it with caution - so both sides were silent. Usually three battles are the rule, so both sides returned to the designated place, at that time, they began to reorganize in their own camp. No one likes to take a defensive position around the pole. Even if they are beaten and kicked, they cannot fight back, which is something that everyone feels uncomfortable. This time, Real Person was also involved in the attack. Perhaps because his jujutsu was praised.

-You are number four - so let's fight - so it's okay to follow at the end."

Another member of the platoon, number two, said this to Real Person in a friendly way. That student's surname was Tang Qian, a core member of the attack known for swordsmanship.

- Real Person understood Tang Qian's friendship, but he was not satisfied with being sent to the end.

Because in the first battle, he was punched and kicked, and the uneasiness in his chest not only did not stop, but the fighting spirit surged back. One... Real Person couldn't help but let out the roar of a Mormon fighting. The feet stepping on the grass. Bouncing like a ball. When the second battle started, Tang Qian stood in front, and the members of the jujutsu club, Xintian, and others, began to fight with the enemy's guerrillas. Real Person could no longer bear it, and decided to charge into the enemy's formation, and began to run from the side of the team to the front.

Suddenly, he took a hammer, knocked the enemy down at that time, and ran forward again, and he had reached the enemy's front. Jumping on the back of the outer formation, a strong impact knocked them to the ground. Five large legs were approaching in front of his nose. He immediately decided to dive into this gap between the legs. There were no eyes on the legs, so the enemies kept kicking each other. It goes without saying that Real Person's face and back were cruelly trampled on. On the other side of the towering legs, he found the root of the pole's base. Grabbing the pole, he desperately tugged with both hands, and then it seemed like in a dream!

As a result, the second battle resulted in a complete victory for Real Person's army. After the end of the last battle, which was also judged to be a defeat, when going to the bathhouse, there were some with bleeding noses, and some with bruises on their faces, but there was no distinction between enemy and friend. The shouting in the bathhouse seemed like the walls were about to collapse. One person started laughing loudly, and suddenly everyone was swept into the vortex of laughter again. -Gu, that guy, is a sea turtle after all. He went down today and made a great contribution."

### Save Fuel for Cooking: Invention of the Insulation Box

The method of saving fuel for cooking published by Mr. Dai Yanping in this newspaper on the 13th of this month is very much in line with scientific principles. I have studied it in detail and have made dozens of them, named Insulation Boxes. All the functions are more than what Mr. Yanping mentioned. It can save more than 20% of coal briquettes per month, and the cost is about 400 yuan. For details, please send a letter to 424 Hede Road, and I will send a free brochure. (Li Hanchu)
