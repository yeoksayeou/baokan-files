### Commemoration of the National Government's Return to the Capital

Time flies, and it has been four years since the National Government returned to the capital. Today, on this commemorative day, we remember the source of the water we drink and express our boundless respect for those who, before the return of the National Government, traveled and campaigned without fear of danger. We also deeply admire Mr. Wang Jingwei and some Kuomintang comrades for overcoming difficulties, advocating peace, and creating today's situation. Today marks the fourth celebration of the return to the capital, and as we close our eyes and reflect, we feel that the only thing worth celebrating is the correctness of the peace policy, which becomes truer with time. Four years ago, at the beginning of advocating peace and in the short period after the return to the capital, most people not only did not understand the peace policy but also regarded it as unorthodox. After experiencing hardship and struggle, a foundation for both foreign and domestic affairs was gradually established, and those who previously did not understand the peace policy gradually shifted their views. After Japan implemented its new policy toward China, more and more people gradually recognized and accepted the peace policy. It was through the efforts of the peace movement that Japan implemented its new policy toward China and that a unified front of East Asian nations could jointly resist foreign enemies.

However, the day the National Government returned to the capital also marked the beginning of undertaking a major mission, and until today, the mission has not been completed, and the responsibility cannot be shirked for a single day. What is the major mission? First, it is to improve the people's livelihood. In our newspaper's editorial on January 27, 1943, it was said: "Any problems that the Chongqing side cannot solve for the benefit of the country and the people, especially those that the Chongqing side has said and done but have already failed, the people, since last spring when Japan announced its new policy toward China, have gradually implemented, and notable examples include the return of concessions, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the return of enemy property, assistance in economic control, and the strengthening of the National Government. Although Japan can concretely implement these, whether it can gain the understanding of the Chinese people and to what extent that understanding is profound still depends on whether the National Government's politics can cooperate as a prerequisite. If the National Government's politics fail to cooperate with Japan's steps in implementing the new policy, then it is related to the fact that the people do not understand the National Government's politics and, at the same time, do not understand Japan's new policy toward China." Now, four years have passed, have these two major missions been completed? Or to what extent have they been completed? Today, while we celebrate, we should also reflect on them in a practical way!

What is the prerequisite for the National Government's politics to cooperate? It is the "reform of politics" that we have consistently advocated. And the prerequisites for reforming politics are, first, to establish expert politics, and second, to establish popular representative institutions. Expert politics includes a government of good people and clean politics. Thus, on the one hand, we should eliminate corruption, purify officialdom, build a government of good people, and establish clean politics; on the other hand, we should rigorously implement the examination and selection system, adopt meritocracy, avoid nepotism and favoritism, and establish expert politics. Secondly, the unreasonable phenomena in national politics may be "a muddle to those in charge" subjectively, but the people are "clear observers" objectively. Therefore, by establishing popular representative institutions, the people can point out the gains and losses and correct unreasonable phenomena from a clear, objective perspective.

Today, on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, we respectfully and sincerely reiterate the four words "reform politics" as a gift for the celebration. By this time next year, on the fifth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, we hope to have completed the reform of politics in fact and at the same time completed the two major missions mentioned above!

### Japanese Troops Launch Interception War in Northwestern Region of Myitkyina; Central Route Advances Toward Imphal Plain

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced the following war situation in Burma at 5:20 PM on the 28th: Japanese troops in northern Burma are currently intercepting two divisions of the reorganized First Army of the Chongqing Army and approximately two brigades of British and American Allied forces invading from the Tanggon area in the northwestern region of Myitkyina and are compressing the encirclement of enemy airborne supply units that landed near Gasa. Japanese troops on the central border of India and Burma are continuing to attack the main force of the British Indian 4th Corps, which is surrounded, near Chin Hills and the Kabaw Valley and are advancing toward the Imphal Plain with their main force. Japanese troops on the border of India and Burma, after annihilating the main force of the British Indian 7th Division, are countering the main force of the British Indian 15th Corps that has advanced to that area. At the same time, they are attacking the 81st Division in the western area of the Kaladan River Valley, and the progress of the war is extremely smooth.

Rangoon, 29th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese army fighter squadron attacked enemy airborne commando units that landed east of Mani Kano Road on the 26th. The enemy units have been surrounded by Japanese ground troops, and the Japanese fighter squadron is fiercely strafing them and, at the same time, raided enemy airfields, completely destroying 55 small enemy transport planes that were landing. The Japanese planes have safely returned to base.

Rangoon, 29th (Central News Agency) - Elite units of the Japanese army air force in Burma, responding to the Japanese troops on the northern Burmese-Indian border, boldly dispatched on the 26th, repeatedly strafed and bombed the remnants of the British 17th Division, which had been defeated north of Donzain and surrounded by Japanese and Indian troops, destroying their vehicle formations, and smashing their dense formations, inflicting a great blow. The entire squadron safely returned to base.

Imphal, 28th (Central News Agency) - The enemy army is eager to reopen the Chongqing-India Highway. On the 5th and 6th of this month, two thousand people attempted to counterattack northern Burma. The Japanese troops, Burmese National Army, and Burmese civilians in that area surrounded the enemy landing troops, blockaded their movements, and continued to fiercely attack them, having captured and annihilated most of them. The remnants of the enemy army that had infiltrated the dense forests are currently being mopped up. The enemy army's attempt to reverse the decline has now become a mere dream.

### Paratroopers Near Gasa Partially Annihilated; Enemy in the South Also Suffers Heavy Blows

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced on the 28th that the Japanese army has launched a fierce annihilating operation against the British, American, and Chongqing armies on the 1,000-plus kilometer Burmese border line from the Fugong area in northern Burma to the Bay of Bengal. The Japanese army's operations in that area are proceeding extremely smoothly, and the enemy army has now largely fallen into a state of chaos, scattering and fleeing. The situation in various areas is as follows:

### Northern Burma and India

The Chongqing-American army's New First Army under the command of American General Stilwell and the two brigades formed by the British and Americans on the northern border of India and Burma are quite perplexed by the task of opening the Ledo Road. Although they have repeatedly counterattacked in the Tanggon area, they have been lured by the Japanese army's skillful tactics to the mountainous areas northwest of Myitkyina and encircled, so they have suffered heavy losses. The Chongqing army in that area, although equipped with excellent American equipment and commanded by American officers, is difficult to utilize its machinery due to terrain obstacles. At the same time, it has been heavily damaged by the skillful attacks of the Japanese army. In recent days, a large number of Chongqing army tanks have been destroyed by the Japanese army's artillery and cannons, and the Chongqing infantry units that were covering the tanks have been mostly annihilated, which can be described as a crushing defeat. In addition, an enemy glider unit of about 5,000 people, carrying light and heavy mortars and machine guns, landed near Gasa in the upper reaches of the Irrawaddy River, intending to echo the enemy forces in the Fugong area and disrupt the Japanese army's rear, but after being encircled by the Japanese army and the Burmese army, a part of it has been annihilated, and the remnants are currently being mopped up.

### Central Border

In the central India-Burma border area, the Japanese army is besieging and fiercely attacking the main forces of the British Indian 4th Corps, the 17th and 20th Divisions, at Chin Hills and the mouth of the Kabaw Valley, further intensifying the annihilating war. At the same time, the elite main force of the Japanese army and the Indian National Army, with mechanized units as the vanguard, using more than a thousand captured vehicles, continued to advance toward the Imphal Plain, but before the large Japanese army advanced into the Imphal Plain, it was already in a state of chaos. Regarding the war situation on the central India-Burma border, according to a Chongqing broadcast report, after the Japanese army pushed into the Imphal Plain, Stilwell's army's supply line in the Fugong area was not only cut off, but also the supply to the American air force stationed in Chongqing was also in danger of being interrupted. This has already shown a glimpse of the plight of the enemy camp before the Japanese army's crushing advance.

### Southern Area

In the southern India-Burma border area, after the Japanese army annihilated the British Indian 7th Division in February of this year, the enemy suffered heavy losses in the first Arakan disaster. Afterwards, they sent the 26th Division to advance to Buthidaung, trying to break through the Japanese army's front. At the same time, the powerful Japanese army transferred tank units, heavy artillery, and other new troops to the front line. The enemy is actively trying to break through the Japanese army's defenses in the southern India-Burma border, but it has suffered a major blow from the Japanese army. The progress of the war situation in the Imphal area has recently become unstable. In addition, the Japanese army is currently launching an annihilating war against each division of the West African forces advancing into the Kaladan River Valley, which is proceeding extremely smoothly. The annihilating war in the northern border area is now only a matter of time.

### Bombing of Tiddim

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain base on the Burma-India front, the Japanese tank units are intensifying the annihilation war against the 20th Division of the enemy, which is stubbornly resisting on the solid cold defense line around Tiddim. By the morning of the 22nd, they had reached the enemy airfield 1.5 kilometers south of Tiddim, setting three enemy planes on fire and completely occupying it. At the same time, the activity of the enemy air force in the Kabaw Valley was also completely controlled. In addition, on the 26th, the Japanese assault troops northwest of Tiddim launched a fierce attack on the enemy army, which was moving west from the Tiddim direction with 1,000 vehicles and 20 tanks, inflicting heavy losses. In addition, the city of Tiddim has fallen under the fierce fire of the Japanese army, causing fires in several places, so the fate of the main force of the enemy's 20th Division is becoming increasingly bleak.

### Philippine Service Corps Reorganized into Political Party

Manila, 29th (Central News Agency) - The New Philippine Service Corps was established on December 8th, 1941. The corps is an organization that encourages the people to achieve the goal of independence. Afterwards, it immediately engaged in both military and political activities, and after the Philippines achieved independence, the corps became the only liaison organization between the Philippine government and the people, and advanced towards the construction of the republic. Recently, in order to adapt to the new situation after independence, the headquarters of the corps decided to reorganize itself from a national movement body into the only officially recognized political party in the Philippines, so as to form an organization to promote national policy. Before and after the independence of the Philippines, the corps participated in the election of independent preparatory committee members and members of Congress, so it had already been assigned the task of a political party. After the independence of the Philippines, the governors and mayors of the states who were members of Congress also concurrently served as the local administrative heads of the corps. Currently, the number of members has exceeded 1.04 million, so after the corps is reorganized into a single political party this time, it will establish a tripartite relationship with the government and Congress, and can devote more effort to the construction of the republic.

### The Great East Asia War and the Mission of China and Japan - Ambassador Tani's Speech at the Party Training Corps

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - Ambassador Tani went to the Central Party Headquarters' Central Party Affairs Training Corps at 3:00 PM on the 22nd and gave a speech entitled "The Great East Asia War and the Mission of China and Japan" for an hour, explaining the significance of the Great East Asia War in great detail. The original text is recorded as follows: Since the Washington and London Naval Disarmament Conferences, Japan has been working hard to maintain world peace, but Britain and the United States have dreamed of conquering the world and have often oppressed Japan in order to achieve their ambitions. However, Japan, in order to seek world peace, has been tolerant and engaged in negotiations with the United States, but the United States still has no reflection. In order to open up the destiny of the nation, Japan resolutely rose up and fought. The Japanese soldiers bravely and skillfully fought and won great victories, and are still continuing to advance towards the common ideal of liberating East Asia and building a new order.

In addition, the allied countries of Germany and Italy have risen up to open up the destiny of the nation, and have also won great victories since the start of the war, and have built a new order with various European allied countries, achieving brilliant results. This is a well-known fact. Although Germany is currently forced to carry out a bloody attrition strategy on the Eastern Front, on the other hand, withdrawing the North African front and shortening its unnecessary fronts can strengthen the European fortress, so Britain and the United States are now facing difficulties on the Italian front. The so-called second front is quite difficult to achieve. After gaining some strength in the Mediterranean, Britain and the United States attempted to launch a major offensive on the Pacific front, but in the overall situation, as a result of the great defeat on the Burmese front, it has turned into an empty dream, so their resistance to Japan is gradually showing anxiety and panic.

### China Completes Autonomy

China and Japan have a relationship like lips and teeth, and have various exchanges in terms of ethnicity and history, but in the past hundred years, after the hegemonic doctrine of Britain and the United States flowed into China, their schemes caused the two countries of China and Japan, who share the same culture and ethnicity, to fight each other. However, since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, the power of Britain and the United States in China has been completely swept away, and China has been able to return to its original state. Therefore, since January 9th of last year, the Japanese government has handed over concessions and embassy areas in the political field, improved the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and further implemented the fundamental reform of the basic treaty, so that China and Japan can cooperate with each other in their original posture and move towards the path of war. In the economic field, the transfer of new and old enemy properties, the reorganization of various companies, and other economic cooperation are being used to develop the Chinese economy and improve its autonomy. The same measures are also being taken in the cultural field. The various measures mentioned above are all manifestations of the righteous policy of Japan hoping that China will complete its autonomy and independence.

### Realize True Peace

The peace of Great East Asia is achieved by each country in Great East Asia bringing its own characteristics into play. It is maintained by the principle of consolidation, mutual benefit, and equality in each country that promotes its autonomy, so that the war can be completed and the co-prosperity sphere can be completed. Therefore, the righteous policy adopted by Japan towards China can naturally be adopted towards other countries in Great East Asia, so the Great East Asia Joint Declaration was established, which is known to everyone. What the Japanese government seeks from China, as shown in the Allied Treaty, is the cooperation of all Great East Asia for construction, which is also for China's own revival and development. When the Great East Asia War is at a time of advance and retreat, the hope for a bright future is also deeply in mind, so at this rare opportunity, every citizen must thoroughly understand the current situation and implement Sino-Japanese cooperation. Based on the Great East Asia Declaration, we must move towards the path of Great East Asia construction, and first implement the correct peace of Great East Asia, and look forward to the early realization of the light of the East.

### Emperor Awards Medals to Meritorious Members of the National Government

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Information Department of the Japanese Embassy announced today (29th) that His Majesty the Emperor of Japan has awarded medals to meritorious members of the National Government who have worked to promote Sino-Japanese friendship and carry out the Great East Asia War. The medals have been handed over by the Japanese government to Ambassador Tani for transfer. Ambassador Tani specially dispatched Chief Secretary Ono to the Foreign Ministry Building at 11:00 AM on the 30th to transfer them to the recipients. The Chinese members in Beiping and Zhangjiakou were awarded by Minister Sawada in Beiping and Minister Iwasaki in Zhangjiakou at the same time on the same day.

### Meritorious Service of the Indian National Army; Bose Awards Medals

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain base in Burma, the Supreme Command of the Indian National Army announced that when the British Indian Army's annihilation war began on the southern India-Burma border on February 4th, the leader of the Indian National Army's front-line advance unit, Major Mishra, and 13 other warriors, who participated in the battle with the cooperation of the Japanese army, had established brilliant military exploits. Commander Bose, in order to commend their great achievements, specially awarded them glorious medals, and specially awarded Major Mishra and Second Lieutenant Meharidas the Lion of India Medal, the highest honor of the National Army.

### Sixteen Enemy Planes Attack Ponape Island

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain base of the Japanese army in the central Pacific, eight enemy B-25 aircraft and eight fighter planes attacked the Japanese South Pacific island of Ponape on the morning of the 27th. The Japanese army fighter planes and ground artillery intercepted them, shooting down two and destroying one. The Japanese planes self-detonated two.

### Change of Australian Military Commanders

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Canberra, Australian Army Minister Hurdle announced on Tuesday that Lieutenant General Morshead has been appointed commander of the Australian Second Army and will temporarily administer the headquarters of the New Guinea Army. Former Australian Chief of Staff, Chief Representative of the Military Delegation in Washington, Lieutenant General Vernon has been appointed commander of the Australian First Army. General Berryman, currently serving in the General Staff, has been appointed commander of the Australian Second Corps. Major General Savidge, who previously served in the Middle East and New Guinea, has been promoted to Lieutenant General and appointed commander of the Australian First Corps. In addition, Major General Mackay has been appointed senior officer stationed in India, Lieutenant General Laverock has been appointed chief representative of the Australian military delegation in Washington, and Lieutenant General Herring has been appointed chief justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria.

### General Hata Shun Concurrently Serves as Japanese Army Air Force Inspector General; Ministry of the Army Announces Changes in Air Force Leadership

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - In order to adapt to the current war situation of the decisive air battle, the Japanese Army has decisively changed the leadership of the air force-related departments, and formally announced the following on the 28th: Vice Chief of Staff General Hata Shun concurrently serves as Air Force Inspector General, the Supreme Commander of the Army Air Force, and Chief of the Air Force Headquarters. Former Air Force Inspector General Yasuda has been appointed Military Councilor. Lieutenant General Tokugawa Yoshitoshi, a veteran figure in the Japanese Army air force, has been appointed principal of the Army Air Force Officer School. Lieutenant General Sano Tadayoshi, chief of staff of the Defense General Command, has been transferred to an important position. His vacancy has been filled by Lieutenant General Kobayashi Asaburo, the first chief of staff of the Defense General Command, who was created to be permanent. The concurrent appointment of Vice Chief of Staff Hata as Air Force Inspector General places the highest guidance of the air force-related matters, which will determine the trend of the decisive battle, under the unified command of the general, in order to strongly operate it. This has the same meaning as the concurrent appointment of Vice Chief of the Naval Staff Tsukahara as Chief of the Air Force Headquarters. In addition, with the appointment of Lieutenant General Tokugawa as principal of the Air Force Officer School and Lieutenant General Kobayashi as chief of staff of the Defense Command, the leadership of the Japanese Army air force can be said to have formed the strongest lineup. The announcement of the Japanese Ministry of the Army is recorded as follows: Military Councilor and Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, General Hata Shun, concurrently serves as Inspector General of the Army Air Force and Chief of the Army Air Force Headquarters. Lieutenant General Yasuda Takeo has been appointed Military Councilor. Lieutenant General Tokugawa Yoshitoshi has been appointed principal of the Army Air Force Officer School. Lieutenant General Kobayashi Asajiro has been appointed chief of staff of the Defense General Command.

### Memorial Broadcast Speech by Dean Chen on the National Government's Return to the Capital

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – The 29th marked the fifth day of the special broadcast speeches commemorating the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, organized by the Propaganda Department. From 9:00 PM to 9:30 PM that evening, Legislative Yuan President Chen Gongbo delivered a broadcast speech titled "The Significance of Returning to the Capital and Current Work." The original text is as follows:

Dear compatriots, tomorrow marks the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. I would like to reiterate the significance of returning to the capital and our current work to you, my dear compatriots. The primary goal and most significant meaning of the National Government's return to the capital lie in seeking comprehensive peace. Therefore, at the beginning of the return to the capital, "peace, anti-communism, and nation-building" were proposed as the National Government's national policy. Our desire for comprehensive peace remains unwavering, and our efforts to achieve comprehensive peace continue unabated. However, the peace we seek is by no means a peace of temporary ease and security. Therefore, at the initial return to the capital, the slogan of "permanent peace" was put forward. Nor do we seek unequal peace. Therefore, when the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty was signed at the end of the 29th year, it was proposed that Japan should continuously and voluntarily revise the established relations, and China should also continuously and voluntarily improve future relations. Until the establishment of the alliance treaty with Japan at the end of last year, our aspiration was fulfilled. From this, it can be seen that we have spared no effort to achieve the permanent peace and equal peace we initially envisioned, which we can say to the country, to the people, and to ourselves. Today, four years have passed since the National Government returned to the capital, and comprehensive peace has not yet been realized, which we deeply regret. However, our sincere heart has never changed for a single day, and our efforts have never slackened for a single day. This can be told to the whole country, not only seeking peace for China, seeking peace for China and Japan, but also seeking genuine peace for the entire East Asia. Therefore, on January 9th of last year, we announced our participation in the Greater East Asia War. This participation in the war was entirely based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism and his last words of uniting with the world's nations that treat us equally to jointly strive forward. Moreover, we deeply felt that the existence of imperialism in Asia would inevitably lead to a lack of peace, and the existence of colonies would also lead to a lack of peace. Therefore, at the moment Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, we immediately decided to participate. After a year of preparation, it was finally realized, which shows that the meaning of the peace we advocate is by no means temporary but far-reaching, and it is not local but vast. The so-called comprehensive peace does not only refer to China but to the entire Asia.

### Current Important Work

Since the significance of the National Government's return to the capital has already been clarified, I can now proceed to describe our current work. At the beginning of this year, the Chairman instructed us that the work from now on is to rectify thinking, ensure security, and increase production. These three aspects are to establish the foundation for nation-building on the one hand and to complete the Greater East Asia War on the other. The so-called rectifying thinking currently strengthens the New National Movement, ensuring that every citizen can sweep away defeatist thoughts and move forward, eliminate individualism, and move towards national collectivism, eliminate liberalism, and move towards national capitalism, expand narrow nationalism, and move towards national groupism. Regarding drugs that harm the body and mind, we will spare no effort to eliminate them completely with the strength of the nation and the people. Regarding the bad customs that hinder society, we will emphasize them strongly and eliminate them completely.

Regarding increasing production, we acknowledge that it is not just a technical problem but a general responsibility and organizational problem for the people. In the future, our efforts should move towards this new direction. In the past year, the government has also made great efforts to suppress prices and crack down on speculation and hoarding, but it has always recognized that suppressing prices must focus on increasing production. In the future, we will strengthen the national agricultural agencies and local rural organizations to increase agricultural products. Moreover, the Central Reserve Bank has prepared 100 million yuan in funds to lend to factories related to people's livelihood and military needs at a low interest rate of 1%, in order to increase industrial products. Currently, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce are studying specific lending and support plans. In the past, we also knew that the crackdown and restriction on the movement of goods inevitably caused obstacles and difficulties in the circulation of goods. We are now studying how to make it smooth and correct any obstacles separately. In this way, I firmly believe that there will be great effects on increasing production and suppressing prices.

Regarding ensuring security, there is already a considerable foundation for military construction. In the future, we should devote ourselves to training troops and improving the lives of soldiers to meet the requirements of security. In the past, the Clearing the Countryside movement has achieved considerable results in various places. In the future, we should further reform the agencies so that the security agencies in various places become a unified and effective enforcement agency, ensuring that people can live in peace and work happily. On the one hand, we establish the scale of autonomy. On the one hand, we concentrate all our efforts to achieve victory in the Greater East Asia War.

Finally, I would like to solemnly tell you, dear compatriots. Advocating integrity and eliminating corruption have always been the National Government's established policy since returning to the capital. The severe punishment of food fraud has given the people a deep belief in the government's determination to purify officialdom. I also know that the people are very excited about the government's determination this time. But I want to tell you that this time, the government should not take it as an exciting thing but as a very unfortunate thing for the country. In recent years, the government has been exhausted in comforting and appeasing refugees. Therefore, it is inevitable that officials have been treated with leniency and preferential treatment, which often leads to a failure to prevent crimes and indulgence in crimes. When the crimes are unforgivable, the laws are clearly enforced. This group of corrupt officials deserves to be punished according to the law. The government cannot shirk its responsibility for failing to prevent and cultivate crime in advance. We should blame ourselves for this with a spirit of self-reproach. I deeply hope that all authorities in the future will be stricter with themselves and more lenient with others, and they should not only focus on severely punishing crimes after they occur. They should especially focus on preventing crimes before they occur. Do not indulge them first and punish them later. Punishing one person for a crime only brings temporary satisfaction, but the suffering of the people has long been unbearable. In this way, on the one hand, the vitality of the country and society can be preserved, and on the other hand, politics can achieve great justice and clarity. Today, at the time of starting anew with the people, I do not hesitate to solemnly reiterate the government's original intention.

### Congratulatory Message from the Ambassador of Manchukuo - Announcement of the Completion and Publication of Essay Competition Judging

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – Today is the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. Manchukuo Ambassador Lü Ronghuan specially issued a congratulatory message, the main points of which are: The National Government's return to Nanjing has been four years in the blink of an eye. Thanks to the exemplary leadership and arduous efforts of the Supreme Leader Chairman Wang Jingwei, his indomitable spirit is truly admirable and touching. Last year, on October 30th, the alliance treaty was concluded with Japan, and on November 3rd, it participated in the Greater East Asia Conference and issued the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration in Tokyo, laying the foundation for eternal amity and unity in East Asia. Thus, China's position in the international community has become increasingly consolidated. Currently, the Greater East Asia War has entered the decisive stage. The final victory will surely be in our hands, and the peace of the overall situation will surely be realized. On this memorial day, I not only congratulate the National Government but also congratulate the bright future of East Asia.

### Graduation Ceremony of the First Class of the Party Training Corps - President Chen Delivers a Speech on Behalf of Chairman Wang, Who is Concurrently the Head of the Corps

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – The first class of trainees of the Party Affairs Workers Training Corps has completed its training. At 10:00 AM yesterday (29th), a graduation ceremony was held in the auditorium of the Central Party Headquarters. Members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees Lin Baisheng, Chen Qun, Peng Nian, Xu Suzhou, Ye Peng, Bao Wenyue (represented by Zhou Zheng), Chen Jicheng, Ma Dianru, Li Fuyi, Chen Changzu, Yang Jie, Wang Manyun, Li Wenbin, Li Kaichen, and Cheng Zhongkuang, as well as various working comrades from the departments, offices, and secretariats of the Central Party Headquarters, and more than 100 trainees, attended the ceremony, which was presided over by Director Chen and Deputy Director Dai of the Corps' Education Department. After performing the ceremony according to etiquette, Director Chen first gave a report, followed by Wang's understanding of the work and future tasks, and encouraged them. All the trainees were greatly encouraged after listening. Then, the trainee representative delivered a speech, and finally, Director Chen presented diplomas and certificates of merit. After taking photos, the ceremony was completed in the resounding sound of military music.

### Speech by the Head of the Corps

Today is the graduation of the first class of trainees of the Central Party Affairs Workers Training Corps. The head of the corps is unable to attend the speech in person due to incomplete recovery from illness. I would like to write down a few points for the comrades:

Since the Sixth National Congress of the Party, the slogan of peace, anti-communism, and nation-building has been called, and the process of the National Revolution has entered a new stage. Following this, the Greater East Asia War broke out, followed by the National Government's implementation of participation in the war, to save the establishment of the Sino-Japanese alliance, which not only laid the foundation for the permanent friendship of the countries of the Greater East Asia but also laid the foundation for the permanent peace of the world. The Party is the mother body of the National Government. Today, when the National Government is shouldering epoch-making major tasks, how should the party members of the Party redouble their efforts? Uphold the spirit of "leading the people and being the vanguard of the people," and take things before the heavens. Be the first to take the risk, and be the first to take the difficult task. It must be known that the power of a party member's individual identity to mobilize the masses and advocate the atmosphere is greater than mutual persuasion and greater than coercive orders. Therefore, future party members cannot regard themselves as superior to the masses, and future party departments cannot be compared with the government. Party members should go deep into the people to persuade, and party departments should assist the government. In the past, party members were bureaucrats, and party departments were government offices. The rulers were suspected of having a dual leadership, and the masses felt at a loss as to what to do. Such accumulated habits must be completely eradicated. In today's new era, the new spirit of all party comrades must be revitalized in order to break through new obstacles and complete new missions.

### Soviet Offensive on the Banks of the Prut River Obstructed - Germany Announces Withdrawal from Nikolaev

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Haitian News Agency reported that responsible officials here stated that German troops have withdrawn from Nikolaev (northeast of Medisa) and the bridgehead on the east bank of the Dnieper River. All military equipment was destroyed before the withdrawal, and all troops and materials were withdrawn.

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Haitian News Agency reported that Soviet troops between the Homburg River and the Bug front in the central section of the southern route. From Transnistria to Galicia, heavy pressure continued, but due to the continuous bombing of German aircraft, the Soviet offensive began to slacken. The German-Romanian joint forces are still firmly defending every stronghold in the Balti-Kishinev area. At the same time, the rearguard of the German troops in the area is also responsible for covering the German troops' retreat from the Prut River to new positions. Although the vanguard of the Soviet army has reached the Prut River, it has not yet crossed the river. The German army launched a flanking attack on the Soviet army and engaged in fierce battles between northern Galicia, the Dniester, and the Prut River. Soviet troops launched a two-pronged attack southward between Ternopol and Boroskolov. The troops in Kamenets-Podolsk are also being contained. The defenders of Boroskolov, fearing the danger of being encircled, have begun to retreat to the southeast, and the rearguard is fighting fiercely with them. The German troops there are gradually retreating to the Dniester to make contact with neighboring friendly forces. The obstacle terrain south of Nikolaev and Berdyansk is in good condition, and the Soviet army has also admitted its offensive failure and has abandoned its attempt to cross the Lower Bug River. The Soviet army's attempt to advance southward from Berdyansk-Balta and threaten the flank of the German position has also been thwarted in recent days. The German troops defending the southern part of the Lower Bug River are strictly resisting the Soviet army advancing along the Black Sea. The German army's counterattack north of the Homburg River has been obstructed to advance towards Lvov (Lemberg). The vanguard of the Soviet army between Dubno and Kovel has also been obstructed and fierce fighting for Kovel has begun.

### Fierce Air Battles Over Northern Germany

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reported: Military News: A large formation of American bombers invaded northern Germany at noon today, resulting in fierce air battles.

### Rommel Inspects Fortresses on the Dutch Coast

At the same time, Marshal Sperrle inspected the air defense bases in the Channel area, gave speeches to the local garrison troops, and instructed them on their current and future work. He also awarded medals to those who had contributed to the recent air battles.

### Mayor Chen's Remarks on the Fourth Anniversary of the National Government's Return to the Capital - Working Together to Build a New Shanghai

Four years have passed since the National Government's return to the capital. As the Greater East Asia War enters a decisive stage, the whole country is becoming more and more motivated. A Central News Agency reporter believed that it was especially important to commemorate this historic anniversary after the recovery of the Shanghai concessions. He specially interviewed Mayor Chen, who gave the following remarks:

### The Chinese Nation Will Surely Obtain Light

Four years have passed since the National Government's return to the capital. Looking back on the changes in the East Asian situation over the past four years, they have been extremely rapid. Fortunately, the central authorities have adhered to the original intention of returning to the capital, overcome all difficulties, and spared no effort. The policy guidelines of adjusting foreign relations, renewing politics, ensuring security, unifying currency, and strengthening economic construction have been reiterated and gradually implemented. Such gains are enough to tell the people. Since the Greater East Asia War entered its second year, the National Government, in cooperation with its allies, swept away the brutality of Britain and the United States in order to seek China's restoration and East Asia's liberation. On January 9th of last year, it resolutely declared war on the enemy countries Britain and the United States. At this point, the relationship between China and Japan has become increasingly harmonious, and China's wartime system has gradually been established. On November 6th of the same year, the publication of the Greater East Asia Declaration further ensured the unity of the East Asian nations, and the heroic and vigorous efforts of the allied forces on the front line have repeatedly dealt blows to the enemy. In recent years, good news has been frequently reported, and the people are very excited, and they have redoubled their efforts in following the national policy, promoting increased production, eliminating opium and gambling, and eradicating corruption. This not only symbolizes that the Chinese nation will surely obtain light, but also proves that the East Asian countries will surely be liberated.

### Municipal Administration is Proceeding Smoothly

As far as this city is concerned, since I was ordered to govern Shanghai, it has been more than three years in a blink of an eye. There have been no amazing achievements, but in this short period of time, I have also been determined to improve the people's food, security, transportation, and education. By August of last year, with the cooperation of the allies, all public and special concessions were recovered one after another, and the extraterritoriality of various countries in China was also completely abolished. Shanghai, which had suffered from the unequal treaties for a century, was fortunately liberated today. In February of this year, the original administrative boundaries were eliminated, and the deformed status quo was adjusted. At this point, the administration of this city was unified. With the assistance of people from all walks of life in this city, the municipal administration is proceeding smoothly. The most difficult task recently, suppressing prices, has also achieved good results. However, although I have achieved some gains, I still dare not be complacent. I can only continue to work hard and realize the policy guidelines as soon as possible, and complete the municipal construction as soon as possible.

### Strive to Increase Production and Eliminate Corruption

Today's Shanghai administration is following the instructions of the National Government, taking the efforts to increase production, ban opium and gambling, and eliminate corruption as urgent tasks. The increase in production is hindered during wartime. Due to the lack of raw materials, production in this city has decreased sharply. Although we have tried repeatedly, we have not been able to break through the difficulties. Recently, there have been some solutions to the raw materials problem, and whether the increase in power supply and the reduction of interest rates on bank loans will provide assistance to the increase in production, the production problem in this city may be expected to be effective gradually. Regarding the elimination of opium and gambling, since the National Government promulgated the outline of the opium ban measures and the regulations on the administration of narcotics, and decided to implement them today, the work of prohibiting drugs has been actively promoted. This government has already issued a ban on gambling dens in this city, and will close them all today. After the opium and gambling are banned, the people of Shanghai should find proper entertainment to strengthen their bodies and minds and devote themselves to their own work. As for eliminating corruption, it is the clean government that I have always advocated. Before the Northern Expedition, when I was in Guangdong, I had followed Chairman Wang to actively advocate it. After the National Government's return to the capital, I wrote articles to advocate it again. At that time, it was said that if clean government could not be established, the goal of peaceful nation-building could not be achieved. Today, we can further say that if clean government cannot be established, the goal of building a new Shanghai and reviving China can never be realized. Recently, the central government has severely investigated corrupt officials, and the special court has strictly enforced the law, which shows that the government is determined. This government often follows the intentions of the central government, earnestly implements them, and strives to take clean government as the starting point to achieve the goal of building a new Shanghai. However, any administration by the government must rely on the cooperation of the people. This is the case on weekdays, and it is even more so during wartime. In the future, I still hope to work closely with the citizens, work together, and strive for the realization of the construction of a new Shanghai and the completion of the revival of a new China.

### Minister Tian Held a Tea Party Yesterday

During the tea party, Minister Tian introduced the new Minister Usami to all walks of life, and the situation was very enthusiastic.

### First District Chief Secretary Concurrently Held by Director Wu

As for the position of Chief Secretary, it will still be held concurrently by Mr. Wu. There have been no internal staff changes. Only Chinese typists have been added to various departments and sections. From now on, all official documents of the First District Public Office will be changed to Chinese-style official documents.

### Japan's War Against India and Burma Making Extremely Favorable Progress; Japanese Army Press Department Reviews the War Situation

The Japanese Army Press Department stationed in Shanghai held a routine meeting with the city's Chinese journalist group at the Hua Mao Hotel on the eighth floor yesterday at 3 p.m. Mr. Akari gave an impromptu speech on the war situation in India and Burma as follows:

### Vigorously Advancing, Like Splitting Bamboo

It is even more meaningful for us to review the military development situation in Burma and India before the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to liberate the East Asian peoples and establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in order to promote the realization of Pan-Asianism. This has been fully stated in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, but how can we achieve this noble goal? Undoubtedly, we must strive for it through war. We have already witnessed the independence and liberation of the two major ethnic groups of Burma and the Philippines, and furthermore, the independence and liberation of the 300 million people of India. This is not just empty talk, but a concrete expression of facts. We have seen the announcement by the Omori camp yesterday regarding the situation in Burma, which is developing in a very favorable manner. In particular, on the central Indian-Burmese border, the Japanese army and the Indian National Army are fighting side by side, with mechanized units as the vanguard, fiercely advancing along the Tagaung and Imphal roads, like splitting bamboo. They are only ten kilometers away from the Indian-Burmese border and only ninety kilometers away from the enemy's positions based in the Imphal ruins. The Indian National Army's breakthrough of the border has had a tremendous impact on its homeland. As a result, under the independent tricolor flag of the Indian National Army, the number of people surrendering is increasing daily. Wherever the unit goes, it is restored and becomes territory of the Indian Provisional Government, which proves that the liberation and glorious independence of the Indian nation is actively unfolding in reality.

### Driving Out the Aggressive Forces of Britain and the United States

In other words, the advance of the Indian National Army is a manifestation of the withdrawal of the aggressive forces of British Imperialism, starting from the Indian side. From the perspective of the 300 million Indian people hoping for independence, it can also be said to be their natural inclination. The attack on India is, so to speak, an unfortunate fratricidal conflict in Greater East Asia, but in fact, it is not targeting the Indian army. Its goal is to drive out the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States. We cannot immediately assume that the Indian National Army's attack on its homeland is proceeding on a smooth road, because the war there is greatly related to the war in Europe with Germany. In an indirect way, it also has significant meaning, because if Britain loses India, it will not be able to continue fighting in Europe. Therefore, Britain cannot ignore the crisis in India and open a second front in Europe. We can also confidently say that once the crisis on the European battlefield becomes very pressing, it will certainly have a considerable restraint on the East. The enemy once constructed Imphal as a base for the British army in the "Kingdom of Manipur," so the front-line enemies of the Japanese and Indian armies are the British 14th Division. If we look at the reactions of the United States or Chongqing, we can understand how panicked the enemy was about the advance of the Japanese and Indian armies on Imphal.

### Enemy Emphasizes Japanese Army's Attack on India

I will now list several examples below: Reuters, New York, 24th: "The news of the Japanese army's attack on India has been published on the front pages of New York newspapers for days, in a very prominent position. Especially in the post offices there, the news of the Allied forces' disastrous defeat in India is widely circulated. Therefore, the military commentator of the New York Times, Mr. Eldredge, said: "The Japanese army's attack on India is seizing a very good opportunity, and it has full certainty in terms of land and politics." Therefore, NBC Radio in New York broadcasted on the 27th regarding the attack on India, saying that the Allied forces have now encountered a second Singapore situation. The Japanese army's attack on India is more serious than generally imagined. Once the Japanese army reaches Imphal, the Allied forces' vast military supply stations will be completely cut off, and the New Guanshan Highway leading to Chongqing will also lose its value. Furthermore, according to the London Times on the 24th, if the Japanese army's operations are only partially successful, the Allied forces in the entire hilly area will have no choice but to withdraw. In addition, the New York Times correspondent in Chongqing, Mr. Mazar, cabled on the 25th: "The general public in Chongqing are deeply worried and distressed. They believe that the last lifeline of Chongqing will be cut off soon, so they cannot regard this current crisis as trivial." Due to the above-mentioned unrest, it has even affected the value of Indian currency, causing the rupee, which has always been of high value, to suddenly plummet.

### Cloth Merchants and Wholesalers Organize a Joint Operating Office with a Total Capital of 100 Million Yuan

Regarding the centralized allocation of cotton cloth, the Bureau of Commerce and Industry has instructed the Shanghai Special City Cloth Merchants Association to organize a joint operating office with all wholesale members, under the guidance of the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, to handle the allocation of cotton cloth to retailers and other designated allocation matters. Currently, the association has drafted the articles of association for the Shanghai Special City Cloth Merchants and Wholesalers Joint Operating Office and submitted them to the Bureau of Commerce and Industry for approval and organization. The Bureau of Commerce and Industry has also appointed preparatory personnel to convene a preparatory meeting, deciding to organize a large-scale registration of members. All wholesalers who joined the Cloth Merchants Association before October of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, before the government announced the Provisional Regulations for the Purchase and Sale of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth, and who declared sales of cotton cloth exceeding 30 bolts, can apply to join the joint operating office as members. The total capital of the office is set at 100 million yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, divided into one million shares, each share worth one hundred yuan, to be subscribed by participating merchants in proportion to the total number of bolts of cloth they applied to sell to the Bureau of Commerce and Industry. Those who sell 30 bolts or more can subscribe to 10 shares, and those who sell less than 30 bolts will not be counted. The internal organization consists of 15 committee members, who form a committee to preside over all affairs. Five standing committee members are elected from the 15 committee members, and a chairman and vice-chairman are elected from the standing committee members. The chairman manages all affairs of the office, the vice-chairman is the external representative, and the standing committee members assist the chairman in handling daily affairs. The Shanghai Special City Cloth Merchants Association serves as the natural supervisor, supervising all business and capital operations. The office has three departments below the committee members: General Affairs, Business, and Finance, to handle various affairs. It is reported that the joint operating office will be officially established in early April.

### Citywide Youth League Holds Charity Sale of Air Raid Lampshades

Economic Commentary

### What Must Be Done Now

The new director of the First District Public Office of this city, Director Wu, stated in his speech yesterday: "The improvement of district administration is certainly the most urgent task, and the rational solution of people's livelihood issues and how to transform social customs are even more fundamental priorities." This opinion is particularly pertinent and concise.

Today's economic predicament in Shanghai lies in the failure to thoroughly adjust people's livelihood issues and the failure to fundamentally reform social customs. Regarding the former, there is a constant shortage of food, constant panic over fuel, the inability to maintain the government price limits for people's daily necessities, and the inability to provide relief to the poor and needy. Robbery of pedestrians and property is widespread at night. Such problems abound. Regarding the latter, there are speculative thoughts such as hoarding and speculation, a decadent atmosphere of indulgence in smoking, gambling, and dancing, and bad habits of extravagance, waste of money, and materials. Such problems are also numerous.

Indeed, we know that the authorities are making their greatest efforts and determination to solve the serious issues of people's livelihood and the bad social customs, but the solutions always seem to be superficial and limited to certain areas. Could it be that the underlying problem has always been that they have the will but lack the power? If that is the case, then what must be done now is to strengthen the power of local administration. Everything related to solving people's livelihood issues and transforming social customs must be done so that "orders are strictly enforced" and thoroughly implemented. This is certainly the shortcut to saving Shanghai's economic crisis.

Special Edition Celebrating the Fourth Anniversary of the National Government's Return to the Capital

### Foreword to the Special Edition

Today is the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. We are issuing a special edition from a professional standpoint to express our congratulations. However, in order to thoroughly reflect and review the past, address shortcomings, offer suggestions for improvement, and promote reform, we believe that this is the most actively meaningful way to celebrate and commemorate. Based on this idea, we publicly solicited articles from readers earlier this month, with the scope of topics being reform suggestions. We received enthusiastic submissions from readers and selected ten articles. Due to space constraints, we are publishing the first two articles in this special edition. The remaining articles will be published in the April issue of the monthly magazine. We would like to inform you of this.

### Education

— Guo Zhongren

The use of education is great: understanding the general trends of the world and developing a love for the country; understanding mechanical principles and increasing work efficiency; knowing right from wrong and eliminating ignorance; knowing benevolence, justice, morality, and eliminating fraud; enlightening virtue, renewing the people, and reaching the ultimate good—what can be achieved without education! Therefore, countries that stand on firm ground and want to become rich and strong all regard popularizing education and reforming education as the most important tasks.

The lack of popular education in our country is evident throughout the world, with illiterates accounting for more than 80%. Coupled with the corruption of existing education, the results of education are completely wiped out. Looking around today's world, those who ruin the country and harm the people in order to enrich themselves, those who are incompetent and fill positions without merit, and even those who are very muddled-headed and take advantage of opportunities are everywhere. A country with thousands of years of culture is almost like a deep mountain swamp, full of birds and beasts. If we still do not take education seriously, the extinction of the race and the demise of the country will come in the blink of an eye. How can we talk about joining the ranks of powerful countries?

There are two ways to discuss education: educating out-of-school citizens and improving the current education system. In various powerful countries, compulsory education is implemented, so there is no problem of out-of-school citizens. However, our country is different. For decades, we have only been engaged in war. Those in high positions in the morning may not be settled by evening. With five-day mayors, who will reform the education system? The education system is generally formulated by a few students who have studied abroad. Many of them do not conform to the national conditions and cannot be compared to the natural development of the country. This point cannot be ignored.

### Compulsory Education

Our country has never had compulsory education. Poor families do not know the importance of education, and the burden is extremely heavy. Young children of seven or eight years old are relied upon to work to supplement the family's income. How can they have time to study? For the current plan, we should set up compulsory education schools for out-of-school citizens so that they can have the opportunity to receive education again. Then the foolish will become upright and the fraudulent will become wise. This is not an unrealistic hope.

The greatest matter is funding, and those who advocate it must take this into account. I believe that the site of the compulsory schools can immediately use existing schools, because existing schools are often empty at night and have nothing to do. Compulsory schools can take advantage of this, so there is no conflict. Desks and chairs in classrooms are not distracting. Studying at night does not conflict with working during the day. This can save money. Classrooms, etc., can be filled by students of various levels. If it is not enough, then recruit enthusiastic people. I think it should not be a problem. As for books, stationery, and utensils, it is the government's responsibility to bear half of the cost, and the people should not refuse to donate half. Then the economic difficulties can be slightly alleviated. As for the duration of education, I think it can be temporarily set at three years. After the success of the program and the gradual enrichment of the national treasury, it can be extended. This is certainly possible. The teaching materials should be practical and simple, and can be filled with the national language, common sense, and arithmetic.

We should also use the baojia system to establish these schools. If there are many illiterates in a joint bao, then set up a joint bao compulsory school. If there are fewer, then several bao can be combined to set up a joint bao school. Then the effectiveness can be further increased.

### Continuing Education Schools

The above discussion is about compulsory education, that is, everyone must be forced to receive instruction. Above this is the primary continuing education school. Anyone who graduates from compulsory school and aspires to further study can enter. At this time, the country can decide whether it is compulsory education based on its financial resources. If the economy is exhausted, then primary continuing education schools can charge fees to help subsidize them. The classrooms and teachers should make the most of existing schools to save expenses. Those who are easier to set up can enter higher continuing education schools, whose nature is similar to today's continuing education schools, but improved.

Currently, continuing education schools are mostly business-related, followed by foreign language departments. Without these two, they can be called "continuing" schools. We all know the importance of revitalizing industry and the lack of intelligent and skilled agricultural workers, which is enough to affect the improvement of agriculture and industry, and there is no organization to support capable workers. Is this not strange? Therefore, the so-called skilled workers in our country (meaning workers with high work efficiency) have served in factories for many years, and then they are familiar with the work experience and the operation of machinery. They know what to do but do not know why, and they are conservative and unwilling to improve. How can such people meet the ever-increasing needs? The best way to remedy this is to set up morning industrial continuing education schools.

### Elementary School Physical Education

Today's elementary schools (and middle schools as well) have a much larger number of students than normal due to the special environment. The complexity of the elementary school curriculum also needs to be improved. Taking the second grade of senior elementary school as an example, the books they read include national language, arithmetic, English, abacus, society, nature, and Japanese. Considering the age of the students, they are generally from eleven to thirteen years old. It is doubtful whether such young students can bear such a burden, and whether they understand what they learn is even more questionable. The impact on health is even more serious. I have often seen young children reviewing their lessons, with books on national language, English, and Japanese placed on their desks, like experts. However, when asked about what they have learned, few can answer. This is certainly not enough. The unreasonableness of the school subjects is not only in foreign languages, but also in abacus. What is taught is mostly addition and subtraction, and at most multiplication. From the perspective of self-employed people, it is still practical, but from the perspective of the majority of students who go on to higher education, it is nothing more than that their hopes are not as ideal as they had hoped. This is not only true of elementary schools, but also of middle schools and universities.

There are also problems with the teaching materials. For example, in English, what is taught is classical and literary, which is completely contrary to the needs. Also, in national language and other subjects, the society is advocating the use of vernacular and abolishing classical Chinese, but the teachers are doing the opposite, abandoning vernacular and using classical Chinese. The world is advocating the development of individuality, but the school authorities are still clinging to the old methods of centuries ago, making students write eight-legged essays. All of this must be corrected.

### Secondary Education

In recent years, secondary schools have tended to specialize in different subjects. However, the most needed agricultural science has not yet been officially established. This is a great regret. The need for agricultural talents is greater than that for industrial talents, because China is an agricultural country, and farmers account for almost 80% of the population. The area of cultivated land is evident throughout the world. However, they are ignorant of insect prevention, fertilizer application, the influence of climate, and the suitability of soil. Therefore, half of the crops are damaged by these factors. The so-called "harvest" is just a remnant of nature! If we prepare for prevention in advance, then with such a large population and such a large land, wealth and strength can be expected. It is not deliberately sensational to say that agricultural talents are more important than workers.

After specialization, one thing must be paid attention to, that is, the restriction of each subject. The Ministry of Education should make a thorough count of the number of vocational personnel, the location of needed talents, and the number of young people in school. Based on the needs and the shortages, it should then stipulate how many people should be in a certain subject and how many people should be in a certain subject. Then, after graduation, individuals will not have the joy of having no place to use their talents, and the society will not have the pain of not having talents to use. Then the industry can progress and the function can be evident.

The method of restriction can also be used in universities. If the Ministry of Education sees that there are too many talents in liberal arts and too few talents in science and engineering, it can order the liberal arts departments to stop enrolling students for one year and increase the number of science and engineering schools. Then the supply and demand will be equal, and the saying that graduation means unemployment will become a thing of the past.

Secondly, our current education neglects moral, physical, and social education. What is called education seems to only refer to intellectual education. If you look at the school curriculum, 90% of it is intellectual education, and there is none for moral and social education. Even the one or two physical education classes are regarded as unimportant. Teachers have become insignificant, and students leave and return at will. Physical education has long existed only in name. Is the age of ten not the time to determine health in life? If you do not exercise your body at this time, will you look forward to the next life? Moreover, the body of a sick person is passed down from generation to generation, and this has been the case for thousands of years. If one generation is not strong, it will be even more difficult for future generations to be strong. If we do not abandon the bad habits of thousands of years, then if people do not destroy us, we will destroy ourselves. And if you do not exercise your body when you are young, it will be difficult to succeed even if you work hard. Should schools not pay attention to students' physical education?

### Women's Education

Looking at women's education, our country and Europe and the United States are equally divided, but the different personalities of women and men cannot be concealed. Since coeducation, the benefits of women receiving education are countless. However, looking at the consequences, most of them are housewives. Receiving education does not help in the slightest. They cannot do housework, nor do they want to do housework. They cannot serve the society, nor can they manage the family. They cannot be like European and American women who enter and leave society, nor can they be like old-fashioned women who sweep and serve the family. Decades of education are just parasites of society and family. All of this is because educators are ignorant of the national conditions and want to make women equal to men. Do you not look at Japan? Their women's education is very different from men's, because they know that wanting to make women equal to men is like saying that the wise must be the same as the foolish. The failure is certainly appropriate. I think women's education should be divided into two types. One is the same as men's, so that they can serve the society. The other is to train them to handle housework, similar to Japan, so that they can manage the family. In this way, they can avoid being broad but lacking essentials, and working hard but achieving little.

### Other

Finally, there is something about education that must be loudly emphasized: "The Application of the National Language." The barriers of language are enough to divide a country. The previous National Government, aware of this, adopted the Beijing dialect as the national language, explicitly ordering schools to use it in teaching, which proved quite effective. However, with the outbreak of war, supervision was lacking, and a few schools openly defied the order, disregarding it and abandoning it halfway. What a pity! Although urging and advising, with the power of public opinion, is an undeniable duty.

Regarding educators, there are two points that require attention: First, the living conditions of teachers. Unstable living conditions and teaching on an empty stomach are inherently difficult. To achieve a mind free from external disturbances, stable living conditions are essential. I believe that schools, regardless of size, should be organized and managed by the teachers themselves. The sole establishment of a principal inevitably leads to the exploitation of teachers' rights, like a middleman merchant. Otherwise, those who are not principals will not have an advantage, and those who are teachers will face hardship.

The qualifications of teachers must be strict. Filling positions with unqualified individuals is a grave mistake. Japanese primary school teachers may only have the equivalent of a first or second-year high school education in our country, but their primary education results are far superior to ours. Why? Because teachers are highly respected. In our country, a mere diploma is sufficient to become a teacher, leading to many instances of malpractice. I suggest that, like doctors, teachers should be required to pass an examination before being allowed to practice. Perhaps this could slightly reduce the corruption.

### Discussion on the Collection Methods of Wartime Consumption Special Tax

— Jiang Jun

Since the Ministry of Finance of the National Government announced the collection of the National Wartime Consumption Special Tax on January 16th, two months have passed in an instant. The taxable items and tax rates are roughly divided into three categories: retail of goods, banquets and hotels, and entertainment. The first category, retail special tax, stipulates a 10% tax on gold and silver jewelry, antiques, furs, and luxury goods; and a 4% tax on other ordinary goods. The second category, banquet and hotel special tax, includes public restaurants, teahouses, coffee shops, etc., all taxed at 15%. The third category, entertainment consumption special tax, is divided into three categories: A: movies, horse racing, music; B: drama, singing, storytelling, acrobatics; C: other luxury entertainment such as dancing, taxed at 10% to 40%. However, this tax has not yet been levied. Necessities such as rice, coal, and salt are exempt from the tax, and it is stipulated that it is part of the national tax revenue. This tax measure, during wartime, aims to passively restrict national consumption and promote frugality, which is undoubtedly appropriate. Moreover, other countries have similar precedents during wartime, and the general public has no objection to paying the tax. Furthermore, Shanghai has been collecting a 2% retail donation and a bill stamp donation since June of the 31st year of the Republic, so the general public does not perceive it as an excessive tax. However, the collection methods were not detailed and definitive at the time, leading to numerous malpractices over time. Now, without discussing how the three provinces and one city are collecting the tax, based on what the author knows about the Shanghai area, the actual revenue of the tax authority is estimated to be only about 20-30%. 70-80% has already been pocketed by the collectors along the way!

Since February 1st, when the 182 districts were merged, the authorities established a special tax section within the finance department of the district office to specifically collect the consumption special tax. Unfortunately, the collection method follows the precedent of the former Shanghai Municipal Council, where each store submits the tax on its own every month, and then the section sends inspectors to examine each household to see if it matches the total amount of daily retail income. If there is false reporting, strict penalties are imposed. This method seems flawless at first glance, and under the general principle of a sound accounting system, it is appropriate. Formal partnership stores and companies do report every detail without falsely paying the tax. However, in most old-fashioned Chinese ledgers, there are many loopholes! Based on what the author has seen and knows, the following is a brief description:

### The Origin of Cheating

First: Most small retail stores only have a husband and wife, and hire one or two apprentices. These stores have no accounting equipment at all, and the monthly income can be completely different from the original revenue. Because they only have a very simple record of receipts and payments, the amount of income and expenditure can be entered at their own discretion. For example, small tobacco shops and fried food shops. Furthermore, for larger stores such as grocery stores, candy stores, and department stores, they rarely give customers invoices when they sell goods, and their accounting is in the old-fashioned ledger system. Every day they can casually deduct a certain amount of business income and record it in other accounts, so the tax evasion is extremely obvious. For example, small hotels and restaurants, their daily turnover is also mostly reported as less than the actual amount, because although they issue bills, they rarely have stubs to keep.

Second: The inspectors sent by the special tax section feel it is extremely difficult to audit, because it is almost impossible to investigate some stores, and a few luxury goods stores and restaurants even have two sets of accounting books, one real and one fake. The real account is secretly recorded at night, because the investigators will never come to check at night! For example, a certain clothing store on Shilu Road only pays about four or five thousand yuan in taxes every month, and a candy store only pays three or four thousand yuan. However, a check of their general ledger shows that the monthly expenditure is always between one and two hundred thousand yuan, plus a huge amount of purchase funds. Where does the difference come from? However, they all claim it is wholesale income, but if you carefully check the wholesale return orders and the store numbers and re-examine them, it is not difficult to find loopholes!

Regarding the above two extreme situations, the tax authorities are often confused, unlike the bystanders who are clear and understand. It is estimated that the current special tax revenue is about 50 million yuan per month, which is much higher than the millions of yuan in the past during the Shanghai Municipal Council period and the one or two million yuan last year, and the results are remarkable. However, the increase in tax evasion is difficult to estimate, and the rapid increase in prices far exceeds the increase rate of tax revenue. Since the Lunar New Year, the price index has almost doubled, but this tax revenue has not increased dramatically, so the author can conclude that: except for a few large companies on Nanjing Road and companies with a perfect and honest accounting system, all have more or less suspicion of intercepting tax revenue. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the collection methods as soon as possible so that the taxes paid by the common people with their hard-earned money will not be lost halfway. It is necessary to ensure that every penny goes to the public, so that those who take the opportunity to intercept taxes will restrain themselves and have no way to apply their tricks! The considerations and experiences gained are nothing more than three points.

### Improvement Measures

First: The Ministry of Finance can issue a kind of consumption special tax ticket, the form of which can be the same as stamp tax stamps, etc., and each store can separately purchase it monthly according to its total sales amount, and when selling goods and collecting taxes, paste it on the invoice together with the stamp tax stamp. If a small retail store does not issue invoices to customers, it can be directly pasted on the wrapping paper of the goods. Then, the store stamps or marks it to cancel the ticket. If it is an item like cigarettes that does not have wrapping paper, it can also be pasted on the cigarette carton. If the invoice or goods do not have tax tickets pasted, the purchaser can refuse to pay the tax. The tax ticket amount can be divided into six types: one hundred yuan, fifty yuan, ten yuan, five yuan, one yuan, and five jiao, and pasted on the invoice or bill according to the amount due.

Second: In order to prevent collusion between stores and buyers to cheat and to encourage each store to actively sell the tax tickets, the special tax collection authority can stipulate that the collecting store will be given a handling fee of 5%, like the handling fee for withholding income tax! That is, the tax ticket can be sold to each collecting store at 95% of its face value! This method does have printing expenses and a 5% commission loss, but the total expenditure is less than 10% of the total tax revenue, which is much more perfect compared to the current loss of 70-80%.

Third: In addition to the above two methods, the investigators still go to each store to check whether the total amount of business revenue is consistent with the amount of tax tickets purchased, and whether there are still fraudulent acts in the existing number of remaining tickets, and report them.

If the above three points are implemented, both the stores and the people will benefit, and all will be happy to comply, and the government's national tax revenue will inevitably increase dramatically. For the Shanghai area alone, it is estimated that it can increase to more than 20 million yuan per month. To remedy the tax system is not a small thing, which is what our people deeply hope for.
