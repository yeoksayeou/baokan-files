### Examination, Selection and Enlistment

We said in our editorial on the 11th that monitoring and impeachment are methods to purify officialdom, while examination, selection, and enlistment are methods to improve personnel systems. The biggest problem with officialdom in China today is the recommendation of relatives and friends, the control by clerks and underlings, and the distribution of spoils and corruption. Therefore, to reform officialdom, the first step is to purify the path to officialdom, so that corrupt officials have no foothold. The second is to establish an examination and enlistment system, so that people with real talent and learning can serve the country through the examination system, and those who are already serving the country can have opportunities for promotion through the enlistment system. The third is to emphasize efficiency, so that everyone can make the most of their talents. Only then can the country use the least amount of money and the fewest officials to do the most for the people.

The importance of examinations is already generally understood. Although the National Government has established an Examination Yuan, its actual effectiveness can be said to be very minimal. The biggest reason for this is that the appointment of general officials still relies on recommendations and requests. In this case, who would be willing to take the exam? Therefore, to improve the examination system, people who pass the exam must be able to get a job. To increase the number of people taking the exam, those who administer the exam must be interested and willing to take responsibility, and those who pass the exam must be hired immediately.

The most important responsibilities of enlistment are threefold. The first is to assess current personnel to determine whether they are suitable for their positions. The second is to review new personnel to determine whether they should be hired. The third is to evaluate current personnel to determine their rewards and punishments. Many regulations of the Enlistment Department have been promulgated, but the work of the Enlistment Department is not much. The biggest reason for this is that the Enlistment Department has no power. Various departments and agencies are unwilling to send their personnel for enlistment, and the Enlistment Department has no way to force them. The methods determined by the Enlistment Department are not implemented by various departments and agencies, and the Enlistment Department has no way to enforce them. Therefore, to make enlistment effective, the Enlistment Department must first have power, so that people who have not gone through enlistment cannot be hired, and the reward and punishment methods decided by enlistment must be implemented immediately. Then, the task of improving personnel will be almost nine-tenths complete.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen stipulated that the power of examination is one of the five powers. The National Government further stipulated that the power of examination should be exercised independently by the Examination Yuan, which is in charge of examination, selection, and enlistment. For the appointment of various civil servants, unless otherwise stipulated by law, if it is found that they do not have the legal qualifications, the Examination Yuan may directly request demotion or dismissal without disciplinary procedures. However, sadly, the Examination Yuan is unable to exercise its powers. When the entire officialdom is not on track, when the entire administrative organization has not broken away from the old-fashioned patterns, and when the entire court is full of relatives, old friends, and fellow villagers, how can the Examination Yuan alone bear this responsibility? But examination and enlistment are the only way to promote enlightened politics, and enlightened politics is the most important and most necessary thing for the revival of China. If we want China to revive, we must promote the success of this system. Here, we hope that the current wise leaders will first lead by example, send their subordinates for enlistment, follow the opinions of the enlistment, and appoint personnel who have passed the examination distributed by the Examination Yuan, showing impartiality and selflessness. We hope that the Examination Yuan should solemnly administer the examination and enlistment affairs. We also hope that the people of the country will enthusiastically support this examination and enlistment system, as the pioneer of administrative reform and the backing of all aspects.

### Japanese-Indian Troops Occupy Kanglatongbi in Moonlight Night Attack; Heavily Bomb Imphal Enemy Airfield

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - From the Indian Front: The Japanese-Indian allied forces, fiercely attacking Kanglatongbi, the largest strategic point on the Kohima-Imphal highway northwest of Imphal, and the highlands southeast of that location, again utilized moonlight on the evening of the 7th to carry out a bold and heroic night attack. After fierce fighting, they finally completely occupied this strategic point and are currently pursuing the defeated enemy. The details are as follows: On the evening of the 4th of this month, Japanese troops advancing fiercely to the south acquired advantageous positions in the highlands and launched a general attack on Kanglatongbi together with successively arriving troops. The enemy troops attacking from Imphal with tanks and artillery relied on their superior mechanical weapons and did not show weakness. They also dispatched over 30 aircraft to launch a fierce attack on the highlands from both the air and land. The two sides engaged in fierce fighting for a time. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, the Japanese-Indian allied forces decided to carry out a night attack operation. Starting at 12:00 AM on the night of the 7th, they charged into the enemy's main positions in one go, ultimately smashing the enemy's strongholds in one fell swoop.

Somewhere on the Indo-Burma front, 12th (Central News Agency) - The elite units of the Japanese-Indian forces approaching the bottleneck of the Imphal highway from Tonzang launched an encirclement and annihilation battle against several hundred enemy troops defending the bottleneck at 5:00 PM on the 9th, occupying the area. A fire broke out in a village 10 kilometers northeast of Terben, along the road, due to enemy artillery fire. Other elite Japanese units are also rapidly pursuing the retreating enemy troops, reaching the east of the Terben highlands, forcing the enemy troops in that area to retreat. The enemy in the Imphal basin, under the fierce attack of the Japanese forces, abandoned a large amount of ammunition and fled, having lost their will to fight.

Rangoon, 12th (Central News Agency) - Elite Japanese-Indian troops are currently carrying out a heroic suicide attack on the main British stronghold of Tonupal, 15 kilometers southeast of Palel, penetrating deep into the enemy's fortified positions. The main force of a certain Japanese army corps in the north, under the cover of artillery, also broke into the enemy's positions on the afternoon of the 10th, successively capturing and suppressing them. The fall of the enemy's positions is imminent. The enemy's positions surrounding Tonupal are collapsing, and the enemy troops are in a state of chaos.

A certain base in Burma, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army air force on the Burma front launched a surprise attack on the enemy's airfield north of Imphal at dawn on the 9th. One part of the enemy airfield was hit and destroyed, and six locations caught fire. The Japanese aircraft safely returned to base after achieving their objectives. Another Japanese bomber squadron launched a strong attack on the enemy airfield used by Imphal on the 10th, concentrating their bombs on its runway and thoroughly destroying it. The Japanese aircraft then safely returned to base.

### Indian National Army Cadre Discuss Battle Experiences

Rangoon, 12th (Central News Agency) - The morale of the Indian National Army fighting on the Kaladan front has been increasingly boosted since the Japanese army's rapid advance towards Imphal. The Indian National Army achieved great results in the night attack on Myintha, south of Kaladan, and deeply recognized the vulnerability of the British army. The following are the impressions of the army's cadres after fighting against the British and West African troops: A certain lieutenant said, "Our battles are for ourselves, for the liberation of a free India. We are fully aware that unless we defeat the British, our motherland cannot be liberated. Therefore, the National Army hates the British. Due to the Japanese army's elite combat power and heroic attacks, the enemy has no will to fight and is easily defeated. After several battles, we are confident in the strength of our army. We will fight to the end for the freedom of our motherland." Sergeant Sarda Singh said, "I bravely pursued and stabbed a West African black soldier. I also disguised myself as a black soldier but was discovered by a British man who shot me in the hand with a pistol, injuring me. However, the British man was immediately killed by my comrades. The reason why we can kill the enemy so bravely is that we have deep confidence in the inevitable victory of the Japanese army. Although this is our first time fighting against the British army, we already know that they are not to be feared. The bravery of the Japanese army is even greater and should be emulated by us." Private Brinton said, "When searching for British soldiers, we couldn't find a single one, but seeing the miserable situation of wounded comrades, we couldn't help but feel furious and wanted to capture and kill the enemy. We are very happy to fight and advance together with the Japanese army, but it is a pity that we cannot kill the enemy thoroughly. In the next attack, we will not allow the enemy to escape and will avenge our wounded comrades."

### Philippine-Indian Overseas Chinese Launch Donation Campaign

Manila, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Philippine branch of the Indian Independence League received news on the 12th of the Japanese-Indian allied forces breaking through the Indian border. As this day was the 25th anniversary of the "Amritsar Massacre," in which Indians were brutally murdered by British troops, the branch launched a 500,000 peso donation campaign among the overseas Chinese in the Philippines to commemorate this significant day. The donations will be presented to the Provisional Government of Free India. At the same time, they are also starting to recruit volunteers for the National Army to support the Indian National Army.

### Civilians Cooperate with Japanese Army to Annihilate British Paratroopers; Burmese Minister of Propaganda Discusses the Process

Rangoon, 12th (Central News Agency) - The British-Indian army, extremely anxious due to repeated defeats, attempted to disrupt the Japanese army's rear. In early March, they dispatched paratroopers and air force assault teams to land near Katha in northern Burma, hoping to achieve their goals. However, they suffered heavy losses after being ambushed by the Japanese army and Burmese civilians in various locations. Their complete annihilation is only a matter of time. The Burmese Minister of Social Propaganda explained the situation of Burmese civilians cooperating with the Japanese army to annihilate the enemy air force assault team on the 17th as follows: When the British army attacked Arakan last year, local civilians in Arakan voluntarily cooperated with the Japanese army to suppress the enemy. When the Arakan operation began this year, the residents of the area again cooperated with the Japanese army in defense, doubling their efforts. According to people from the Seiko tribe in the Bhamo region of northern Burma, a member of the tribe's National Service Corps encountered 25 Indian soldiers led by a British officer (part of the air force assault team) during an outdoor patrol. The service corps member lured this group of British-Indian soldiers into the village and provided them with food and drink to prevent them from becoming suspicious. He ordered five other service corps members to quickly report to the local Japanese army. Subsequently, five Japanese soldiers and the Burmese police team arrested the group of enemy soldiers. Furthermore, according to a villager in Bhamo County, after the Japanese army received information that 300 enemy soldiers were camping near the village, about 30 Japanese soldiers and local villagers rushed to the enemy camp and launched a brave attack. Although the enemy soldiers were numerous, they were ultimately no match for the Japanese army, leaving behind more than 50 corpses and retreating towards the dense forest area. In addition, similar events occurred in the Gaza area. After the Japanese army received information that about 1,000 enemy soldiers were attempting to cross the river and were forcing the villagers, a small number of Japanese soldiers, with the help of the villagers, fiercely attacked the enemy soldiers, killing 300 and capturing 100, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Currently, Burmese civilians are especially cooperating with the Burmese people and are organizing National Service Corps, defense teams, and anti-espionage teams to actively search for enemy soldiers. Furthermore, enemy prisoners in Bhamo and Gaza have also admitted that Japanese, Indian, and Burmese cooperation is very close. A certain young British officer verbally stated: "We came to Burma to fight under orders from our superiors, but what we did not expect was that the Burmese civilians would report our actions to the Japanese army and cooperate with the Japanese army to arrest us."

Wallace's private secretary said that this visit to Chongqing is an official visit, and Wallace is going to Chongqing as an official of the US government.

### That's All There Is to the United Nations

— By a Contemporary Person

When the Japanese air force launched its historic massive attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, a serving British admiral openly scolded the shameful state of the American navy, saying: "American sailors are no match for the sailors on British fishing boats." But who knew that before that admiral's scolding had died down, another tragic scene unfolded in the seas off Malaya, with the British battleship Prince of Wales and the battlecruiser Repulse being sunk one after the other by the Japanese navy. Then came America's opportunity to retaliate, with the entire American press filling its pages with material cursing the British navy. We probably still remember it very clearly, that the so-called "unwavering friendship" between Britain and America could only be maintained with difficulty when the war situation was favorable. If the war situation was not going well, then the fox's tail would be revealed, and they would curse each other bitterly. This is a completely farcical approach, and the situation is the same this time with the Japanese attack on India.

American Dissatisfaction

The fall of Imphal has already become a fait accompli, and the tragedy of the Assam Railway being cut off by the Japanese army is also becoming a real problem. At this time, Britain and America are again saying bad things about each other to vent their inner frustrations. Here is an example that can represent this: a telegram from the Washington correspondent of the New York Sun on March 27th said: "There are various voices of dissatisfaction in America towards Mountbatten, but the general public still places great faith in him. However, the British government has not shown sincerity in assisting Mountbatten, which is frustrating, and the Indian government has taken no active action to defend India." Regarding this matter, NBC news commentator Chapelin expressed his views. He said: "Judging from the situation on the Ma Paing plain, Britain has encountered a second Singapore, and Britain has now reached the point of defending India with all its might." His wording was very euphemistic, but full of sarcasm. Of course, what they are saying, in other words, is: "Why hasn't Britain shown any effort in defending India?" If the Japanese army succeeds in cutting off the Assam Railway, then it will be a victory in the Hu Kong Valley. At that time, the American troops under Stilwell, as the Manchester Guardian reported on the 8th, will not be able to receive even a single soldier or a single bullet in supplies. The construction project of the Ledo Road will also have to be abandoned halfway, and it can be predicted that Stilwell's army will be tightly surrounded by the Japanese army, meeting the fate of total annihilation. Therefore, it is not unreasonable for the United States to constantly urge the strengthening of Britain's defense capabilities. Recently, US Secretary of War Stimson publicly said: "The purpose of the US military operation in Burma is only to open up the Ledo Road." What he meant was that the United States only needs to focus on opening up the Ledo Road, and Britain should assist in the construction of the road by blocking the Japanese army, suffering its defeat. Britain is naturally greatly dissatisfied with this selfish argument of the United States. The British side believes that during the Quebec Conference, the United States had forcibly pulled Churchill, and both sides had agreed that Britain and the United States should jointly counterattack East Asia. However, this time, they are not providing any assistance in the defense of India, and are using the blood of the British and Indian armies to connect the Ledo Road, attempting to establish an imperialist hegemony in China.

British Rebuttal

Recently, the British weekly "New Statesman" published an article that sharply criticized the United States' selfish attitude. According to the report, "The United States claims that there is discord between Mountbatten and Stilwell, but the United States itself is no different. Nimitz and Stilwell also hold their own opinions. Nimitz advocates attacking the South China Sea and building air force bases in Fujian Province, attempting to directly attack the Japanese mainland, while Stilwell advocates connecting the Ledo Road and launching a counterattack on the Chinese mainland. If we observe with a calm attitude, adopting Nimitz's strategy, which cannot be achieved quickly, to relieve Chongqing's predicament is of no use. Opening up the Ledo Road is the only shortcut. In other words, the United States is turning its Pacific operations towards India, sending a large army to India to expedite the completion of the Ledo Road." Of course, the main point of the "New Statesman" weekly article is nothing more than wanting to use American military strength to strengthen the defense of India.

The conflict in British and American arguments will intensify as the Japanese military operations progress. This is certainly predictable. Britain and America verbally say "unchanging friendly relations" and "close joint operations" on the surface, but removing their masks, we can see that they mutually hope that the other side will make major sacrifices while they themselves absorb the benefits.

Chongqing's Argument

Chongqing has not been mentioned above, but this is by no means to imply that Chongqing is not involved in the fox's and raccoon's line of relationships. Originally, Britain and America had also urged the Chongqing army to participate in the Burma operation, but Chongqing. On the 25th, the "Sweeping Report" advocated that the Allied forces should strengthen their military presence in Burma. His argument was that he hoped that Britain and America would concentrate their forces in India, attempting to make the British and Americans bleed as much as possible to connect the Ledo Road.

The Japanese army's current operation in India has various major implications. It can completely shatter the British, American, and Chongqing's attempt to launch a general counterattack in East Asia. Cutting off the Ledo Road makes Chongqing even more embarrassed and can promote the Indian national movement. The so-called British, American, and Chongqing relationship under consolidated unity has revealed its true colors here.

### Agricultural Production Promotion Council Decides to Actively Advance Work; Strictly Prohibits Illegal Price Increases for Fertilizers, etc.

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - The candidate for Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan's Agricultural Production Promotion Council has been decided and approved by yesterday's Executive Yuan meeting, with Huang Jin appointed. A reporter specially visited Mr. Huang yesterday (the 12th) to inquire about the council's future work plans and the current work priorities. He replied as follows: "The council's future work will still be carried out step by step according to the established plans, focusing on practical work, and striving to seek agricultural production increase, living up to the meaning of the state's establishment of this council. The need for agricultural fertilizers during the summer plowing season is extremely urgent, so the council's current work also pays great attention to this point and is considering the distribution quantity and price of agricultural fertilizers. Regarding the distribution of chemical fertilizer ammonium sulfate, the quantity will be appropriately increased compared to last year. In previous years, a large amount of ammonium sulfate fertilizer flowed into the interior, which affected the high market price. Currently, the black market price reaches as high as 150,000 yuan per ton. The distribution of ammonium sulfate in this city must ensure that it is truly sold to farmers for use in increasing agricultural production and absolutely does not allow for the exploitation of farmers or illegal profiteering in the middle. This afternoon, the council will hold a meeting, and there will be concrete decisions on this issue."

### German Forces Take the Initiative, Defend Eastern Europe with All Their Strength, Germany Announces Retreat from Kovel

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) Renowned German military commentator Lieutenant General Dittmar said in a broadcast yesterday that the Soviet forces fighting between Stanislaviv and Kovel have lost their initiative. If the Soviet forces were to occupy this area, their power would inevitably be very strong, as this is historically the main route into Europe. However, the initiative, which is the main prerequisite for military success, is no longer in the hands of the Soviet forces. The German army's relief of the troops besieged in Kovel is an important symbol, showing that the German army's offensive and defensive capabilities are increasing. The defense of Kovel proves that the German army's defensive strength remains intact, and the lifting of the siege of the city indicates the German army's offensive power. The German army upstream of the Dniester River rescued its besieged infantry to join forces with the main German force coming from the west. This is also very important. A connection was established from Stanislaviv to the line west of Kamenets-Podolsky, and the German front line has been pushed far to the east. The Soviet forces' goal was to force the powerful German forces to the Black Sea coast to encircle and annihilate them, but the German forces have been able to contain this Soviet attempt. Although the retreat from Odesa is regrettable, it is unavoidable under such circumstances. Therefore, the territory of Greater Romania will be defended with all efforts. The rumors spread by the enemy and neutral parties that the German army specifically abandoned the two countries of Romania and Hungary are strategically foolish actions. The Germans will keep their promise.

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) The German News Agency quoted an official German war report as saying that in the northern part of the Crimean Peninsula, the German-Romanian Allied forces broke free from the enemy in fierce fighting and retreated to the southern positions. After destroying all military facilities, the German army has withdrawn from the city of Kovel. The Soviet army is pressing hard and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with it. German troops at Ovidiopol (east of the mouth of the Dniester River) repelled a strong enemy offensive and annihilated its vanguard. Northeast of Orhei and Iași, the Soviet army launched an offensive to break through with the assistance of tanks, but it was ineffective. Between Stanislaviv and Ternopol, the German-Hungarian Allied forces broke through the enemy's stubborn resistance and occupied several villages. The German forces in Kovel have dispersed and attacked many groups of enemy forces.

### British and American Diplomatic Talks Take Place

According to the Istanbul News Agency, it is reported that the Turkish government has announced that the negotiations have broken down. During the negotiations, Turkish representatives requested short-term delivery from the United States, but U.S. representatives, citing the difficulties of the U.S. military industry and domestic needs, insisted on a delivery period of 30 months. As a result, the two sides failed to reach an agreement.

### American Planes Attack Germany in Broad Daylight, Shooting Down Over a Hundred, New Tactics of the German Air Force Succeed

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) Huitong News Agency reports: Yesterday afternoon, German air defense forces shot down over a hundred American planes over northern and central Germany. German fighters and destroyers repeatedly attacked the invading American four-engine bombers with great success. Ground artillery also provided effective support. The dogfights between fighters were particularly active. Reports of numerous American planes crashing and being forced to land in the southeastern area of Berlin have been received, while observation posts throughout the northern foothills of the Harz Mountains in central Germany reported that enemy planes dropped large numbers of bombs and fled. The enemy planes returned at approximately 1:00 PM, while the intrusion into German airspace occurred at 11:00 AM. A portion of the enemy planes was forced to flee between Braunschweig and Hanover. As for the American planes invading via the Baltic Sea, they were intercepted by German planes before reaching the Pomeranian coast.

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) Huitong News Agency reports: When American planes attacked Germany yesterday morning, German planes launched collective attacks on the invading American planes, but engaged them individually when the enemy planes returned. German anti-aircraft fire was also very effective. American planes invaded German territory from the northwest and north, with several groups intruding into the vicinity of Berlin. The incoming planes all flew at high altitude and sought cover in the clouds over central and northern Germany.

Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) The U.S. Air Force Command announced: Large formations of American planes attacked mainland Germany on the 11th in broad daylight. In this battle, 64 bombers and 16 fighters were lost.

British and American Plane Losses in the First Quarter of This Year Total 3,300

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) German authorities announced on the 11th that although air battles have reached their peak in the past year, air defense forces have consistently achieved great results, and the number of planes shot down from the anti-Axis forces has doubled compared to June of last year. German military factories have mass-produced new fighters in the past few months, so when the anti-Axis air force subsequently bombed Europe, especially when bombing mainland Germany, they often suffered extremely heavy damage. In March alone, the confirmed British losses amounted to 1,234 planes. If the losses since January are accumulated, they actually total 3,315 planes. Among the enemy planes shot down, 80 percent were four-engine bombers. The anti-Axis air force has lost over 22,600 pilots since the beginning of this year alone.

### Portugal to Hold Large-Scale Military Exercises

### Soviet Union Extremely Dissatisfied with Wavering Attitude of Britain and the United States

Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency) The southern front of the Eastern Front has entered a new phase due to the continued Soviet offensive. However, Britain and the United States still refuse to form a second front, so there is a great risk that relations between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States will deteriorate. It is rumored that the Soviet authorities may make important strategic decisions in the near future. The Soviet weekly "War and the Working Class" published an article yesterday by Colonel Tolchanov, which strongly criticized the anti-Axis powers for delaying the opening of a second front in Western Europe. The article stated that the long-term fighting of the Soviet army against the main German forces has allowed the Allied powers to stockpile sufficient ammunition and reserve military strength. If Britain and the United States believe that accumulating large amounts of ammunition is enough to frighten Germany, they are simply daydreaming.

### The Indian National Army and the Chongqing Regime

— Russell

April 13th is the anniversary of the famous "Amritsar Massacre." On this day in 1919, the British, who had deceived the Indian people and resources into serving on the European battlefields and promised independence to the Indian people, instead gave them whips and artillery fire. This shocking tragedy occurred in the suburbs of Jallianwala Bagh, where Indians gathered to commemorate a religious festival. This is indeed something the Indian people will never forget.

On this memorable day, it feels particularly meaningful to discuss the issue of the Indian National Army.

The Existence of the Free Indian National Army

The Free Indian National Army, under the command of Chandra Bose, has historically entered Imphal in eastern India for more than 20 days. During this time, enemy propagandists have constantly done their best to distort and deceive about the new facts created by the Japanese army. However, there is one thing that the enemy's propaganda machine will never touch upon, and that is the existence and actions of the Free Indian National Army.

If we talk about the Indian National Army, then the shameless anti-Axis propagandists will say: "We don't care about the Free Indian National Army, only the Japanese talk about it all the time."

Okay, let's just say that's right. But what exactly is the Free Indian National Army? Since 1757, when the last free Indian nation, the Mughal Empire, collapsed after bravely resisting the British forces led by Clive at Plassey, this is the first time an army organized by Indians for India has begun to act. The leader of this army, Chandra Bose—whose outstanding military career even Sir Simon and Churchill cannot deny—and this army did not suddenly or forcibly begin to act in India. It was based on the resolution of the Indian National Congress held in Bombay on March 8, 1940, in which Gandhi issued a "declaration of war without weapons" to the British; and it is in response to the silent demands of all 300 million Indians.

Shameless anti-Axis propagandists may say: "Oh, we know all about that. But it's all made in Japan." Those who are enthusiastic about the Atlantic Charter and coldly ignore national desires and sacred emotions naturally have this kind of argument. However, I think that might shock them.

I said that not long ago, anti-Axis propagandists never talked about the Free Indian National Army. This is not entirely true, because there are two bases. The first basis is what the Washington Evening Star said in its editorial on March 25: "Speaking of Burma, there is one phenomenon that we find particularly painful, and that is that the Indian National Army is participating in the Japanese army. Indeed, as long as the Indian army enters Indian territory, it may arouse radical Indian independence elements to rise up."

The second basis is what the American "Afternoon Paper" said in its editorial on April 11: "Chandra Bose's entry into Indian territory will have serious consequences for the Indian independence movement. The British must immediately release Nehru and prepare to deal with several emerging situations."

These observations are almost correct. To some extent, I highly agree with the arguments of these newspapers, because their regarding the historical fact of the Indian army's entry into Indian territory is a matter of "common sense." If so, then is the concealment of this fact by London and Chongqing a lack of common sense, or is there another purpose? Undoubtedly, it must be the latter. So what is their purpose? The purpose of London and New Delhi is very obvious, because they know that no matter how the Indians are whipped by them, as long as the Indian National Army enters India to a certain extent, it will definitely affect the morale and spirit of the Indian masses and rise up against the British. This is extremely natural.

Chongqing's Attitude

Let's focus on Chongqing's attitude. Before discussing the details, let's quote an ancient Chinese poem: "Burning beanstalks to cook beans, the beans cry in the pot, born from the same root, why are you so eager to harm each other?" How does Chiang Kai-shek feel when he hears this? He calls himself the successor of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, propagating Pan-Asianism. He is also the one who expounded the concept of Asian consciousness in the book "China's Destiny." Chiang Kai-shek's answer to this question is not only to cooperate with the British and Americans and build the Ledo Road to prevent Indians from establishing India, not only to massacre the people of Burma and trample on Burmese territory, at least Burma has obtained national dignity and independence; but also to participate in the Allied forces and fight against the Indian National Army.

In the book "China's Destiny," Chiang Kai-shek said: "China's liberation is based on a stable and independent national sentiment." Indeed, this is correct. But on the other hand, how can Chiang Kai-shek, who so sacredly and firmly adheres to national sentiment, explain what he has already done and is doing in India and Burma? Here I discover the reason why Chongqing never talks about the Indian National Army.

Finally, our conclusion is: there is no reason for Chongqing not to recognize the national liberation engaged in by the Indian National Army. Similarly, a deep and significant feeling is also being created in Chongqing's celebration camp to consider the policy of continuing the war of resistance.

Short Commentary

### Lights Must Not Leak Outward

In the past few days, we have often received letters from readers reporting that the city's blackout regulations are gradually being relaxed. Between 8:00 and 9:00 PM, lights leaking outward from tall buildings are a common sight. For example, many windows in the Dagong Building on Guilin Road are leaking light, indicating a clear lack of attention to shielding.

We have already discussed twice that we should pay attention to long-term compliance with the implementation of long-term air defense and should never be inconsistent or gradually reduce it to a mere formality. Now, based on readers' reports, we will further express our humble opinion as follows:

On the one hand, we hope that citizens will understand the meaning of wartime air defense, develop the habit of remaining calm in emergencies to protect their safety, and earnestly comply with all air defense regulations, especially the shielding of lights. On the other hand, we hope that the Municipal Air Defense Headquarters will pay attention to the implementation of air defense regulations at all times and that personnel in the baojia system will persuade and correct windows that are leaking light, so that residents develop the habit of compliance. If those who do not comply with the rules are not corrected in a timely manner, they will become lazy over time, and the air defense regulations will become mere formalities, and the meaning of air defense will disappear invisibly.

As for the use of street lights, they should be adapted to the actual needs, with standard brightness and standard shielding methods, and should be widely installed to prevent petty theft.

### North China Basketball Expeditionary Force, Beixing Suffers Another Defeat, Loses to Hualian 26 to 31

The Beixing team of the North China Basketball Expeditionary Force suffered its second Waterloo last night, losing to the Hualian team by a score of 31 to 26. Hualian took the lead in the first half with a score of 17 to 11. The crowd at the China Youth Gymnasium was not as dense as in the first game, with approximately 700 to 800 fans. The Beixing team was unfamiliar with the venue, lacked experience, and their tactics seemed outdated, so they were unable to win, which is a great pity.

### Japanese Army Press Department Analyzes the Situation in Burma, Emphasizing the Significant Meaning of the Indian Offensive

Yesterday (12th), at a meeting with Chinese journalists in Shanghai organized by the Army Press Department of the Allied nations, Mr. Akahoshi, on request, provided a very detailed analysis of the recent situation in Burma. The substance of his discussion is recorded below:

The Chongqing side's policy is "War of Resistance Against Japan," using the war to strive for liberation. This is their goal. However, the Axis powers are fighting for the liberation of the entire East Asia. After the liberation of East Asia, China will naturally be resolved. This offensive against India is a step in the liberation war of East Asia, so its significance in the liberation of the entire East Asia is extremely significant. Therefore, after the launch of the offensive against India, the impact on the Allied side, especially the British, American, and Chongqing sides, is extremely significant. Since the launch of the war against India, it has proceeded very smoothly, and the military base in A-mi Province, which is also a transportation hub, has been occupied. Furthermore, the capture of Imphal is just around the corner, causing great panic among the British, American, and Chongqing sides.

Indian Offensive Divided into Five Theaters

As for the development of the Indian offensive, it is described below in five areas.

"First Area" is in the Arakan region, where fierce battles have been fought with the British 7th and 5th Divisions. The British 7th Division in the Buthidaung area has been annihilated, so the fighting in this area can be temporarily concluded. The enemy has vigorously promoted that "they can land from the Bay of Bengal, attempting to recapture Burma," but if the enemy really lands here, it can be said that it is just a repeat of the tragedy.

"Second Area" is in the Kaladan River basin, where the enemy's West African local force, the 11th Division, has also been surrounded and annihilated by our army between Kyauktaw and Kaladan.

"Third Area" is the British Indian Army's 17th Division between Tiddim and Tonzan, which has also been surrounded and annihilated.

"Fourth Area" is slightly north of the third area, which is the Maline and Tadam front, which is the so-called battle in central Burma. Now, this aspect of the battle can be called "the war to invade India," which has a more profound meaning. This aspect of the war is to break through the national border, with Imphal, Kohima, and Dimapur as the target of the offensive. The enemy's forces in the area are the British Indian Army's 20th and 23rd Divisions, as well as the remnants of the troops that were surrounded and annihilated by our army in the Tiddim area.

"Fifth Area" is the Fort Hertz area. This area is the base for Chongqing's counter-offensive against Burma, so the war is particularly fierce. The area has Chongqing's 22nd, 30th, and 38th Divisions, and the two American brigades led by Colonel Merrill. The above is the enemy's counter-offensive before the rainy season (May). However, the battle line is too long, and there is no consistent transportation, so the army's operations are very chaotic. The reason is that the views of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Chongqing are different, so the operations are not unified. In other words, the reason why the operations cannot be unified is that the operational goals of each other are different. In this situation, the enemy will inevitably be defeated.

Imphal Isolated

As for the current situation, due to the above reasons, Imphal, the enemy's base for the counter-offensive against Burma, has become an isolated area, so the Eastern Indian Railway feels a serious threat of being cut off. Although the enemy attempts to cut off the Burma Railway by air transport troops, it is like a moth to a flame, throwing itself into the net. The Japanese army's offensive against Imphal is extremely fierce, and the airfield there cannot be used. Even if the enemy has such actions, it will be trapped in a dead end. Judging from the war situation in the above-mentioned fifth area, we can know that the most intense counter-offensive by the enemy is in the Fort Hertz area. Although the armies and American forces in the Fort Hertz area have tried their best to revitalize and acted several times, they were forced to be restrained by the fierce Japanese army's offensive against Imphal, and ultimately failed. The London Manchester Report commented on the situation in Burma in an editorial on April 8: "The line from the A-teng-mi Railway through Kohima to Imphal has unfortunately been cut off by the Japanese army in two places, and the Japanese army has advanced to the western area only forty miles away from this railway. If this railway is cut off by the Japanese army, not only will Stilwell's troops fighting in the Fort Hertz valley be trapped in a desperate situation, but also the construction of the Ledo Road will not be able to continue due to the lack of supply of materials," and so on.

Chongqing Side Causes Major Repercussions

In this situation, the Chongqing side has already caused a major repercussions. It is reported that the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao published on April 5: "The British army fighting in Burma has no actions worthy of our attention. The British army responsible for operations in Southeast Asia should make actions beyond the current actions based on their progress," and so on. At the same time, the Chongqing Communist Party's organ newspaper, the "Xinhua Daily," also issued extremely dissatisfied remarks on the same day, saying that the armies in western Yunnan, watching this situation, why are they still standing still? The war situation in Imphal is as described above, and its importance is further analyzed. On March 24, the Southeast Asia Joint Command announced: "Anyone who can secure Imphal will threaten the transportation of Stilwell's troops attacking Fort Hertz. Under the joint offensive of the Japanese and Indian armies, the operation against India is very important, so it is no problem for the Japanese army to occupy Imphal. If the area falls, the British, American, and Chongqing attempts to recapture Burma will be in vain, and the British and Americans will not be able to make any further actions against Burma. As for reopening the Burma Road, it will be hopeless, needless to say. What the Chongqing side is currently concerned about is to use the counter-offensive against Burma to reopen the Burma Road in order to receive foreign assistance. The American side intends to use this to reopen the Burma Road so that it can send American troops to strengthen its forces in order to fulfill its ambition to attack Japan through the Chinese mainland. The reason why the British side is trying to win the war is to try to re-oppress India. Now, in this war situation, the goals of the enemy's British, American, and Chongqing sides are all focused on Burma. However, as a result of the fierce Japanese offensive, the three sides have been dealt a major blow. Secondly, the Burma-India war has a political significance, that is, the Indian army has shown its ability to support its government and establish a strong independent government.

Economy Economic Commentary

### Are We Having a General Mobilization for Increased Production?

The first sentence of President Wang's New Year's Day address this year was, "This year should be a year of general mobilization for the increased production movement." Time flies, and one-third of the so-called year of increased production has already passed. If we ask whether the increased production movement has implemented a general mobilization, then the few sentences that the President has said are enough to make us all reflect on ourselves! He said: "Excess idle capital should be used for increased production, unproductive labor should be used for increased production, spare time should be used for increased production, excessive enjoyment and unnecessary consumption should be saved as much as possible and used for increased production, and daily necessities and surplus waste from agriculture, industry, and commerce should also be collected and used for increased production."

Everyone should feel that the few sentences quoted above are still ringing in our ears, but the facts that tell us are just as described in the previous newspaper's short commentary, which is clearly in a contradictory position with what the President instructed and expected. Therefore, we hope that entrepreneurs will unanimously transfer a part of their strength to the establishment of handicrafts. Its subjective effect lies in using excess idle capital, unproductive labor, spare time, and unnecessary consumption, so that they will no longer become worms of corruption. But its objective effect is to promote the production of various departments necessary for the people's daily use, so that they can be self-sufficient. As far as we know, handicrafts have occupied an important position in Guangdong in recent years: since the establishment of various handicraft factories in 1942, handicrafts have been divided into weaving, machine weaving, chemical crafts, and bamboo and wood crafts, and their main production is cotton cloth and towels, and they are actively increasing production every day. This is exactly what we in Central China should learn from. Therefore, if the increased production movement is not yet a general mobilization, please start with the establishment of handicrafts as soon as possible, in addition to increased agricultural production!

### Economic Security Office Important Personnel Decisions Original Special High Section Economic Division Abolished

The Economic Security Office of the First Police Bureau, which has been preparing for a long time, will be officially established today. The bureau specially issued Police Order No. 1037 yesterday, which stated: "In order to meet the needs, the Economic Security Office will be established from April 13, 1944, and the original Economic Division of the Special High Section will be abolished from today." It is known that all the important personnel of the office are as follows: Director Goshima Shigeru, Deputy Director Yao Junbo, Commissioner Yamaguchi Heijiro, Section Chief of the First Section Sai Zhihai, Deputy Section Chief of the First Section Kishi Aizo, Section Chief of the Second Section Fukuda Shigeichi, Deputy Section Chief of the Second Section Yang Guangjun, Section Chief of the Third Section Jin Mianceng, Deputy Section Chief of the Third Section Uragami Fumio, Economic Police Captain Yang Guangjun (concurrent), Economic Police Deputy Captain Kimura Sotaro. It is said that the above organization has a major relationship in suppressing and stabilizing people's livelihood, so all sectors are paying great attention to and expecting the future activities of the office.

### Exchange Supervisory Committee Held 10th Standing Committee Meeting

Approved Seven New Stocks for Listing

The Shanghai Exchange Supervisory Committee held its tenth standing committee meeting the other day. All the members, including Chairman Chen, attended the meeting. The committee approved the listing of seven new stocks, discussed several important cases. Moreover, the committee noted that the recent sharp drop in stock prices and rumors from the outside that the exchange had sold off stocks that had not been transferred and issued temporary receipts for circulation in the market, which led to the sharp drop in stock prices due to the increase in stock chips. In order to clarify the truth, it has sent the head of the audit team to the site for investigation. It is estimated that the total number of company stocks transferred by the exchange before and after is 109, with a total of 11,657,756 shares, and 30,737 temporary receipts were issued. As of March 31, 25,771 of these temporary receipts had been recovered and exchanged for the company's stock certificates, totaling 10,127,202 shares, and there were still 4,966 temporary receipts that had not been recovered, totaling 1,530,554 shares. Among these shares, 100,425 shares are being transferred, 2,200 shares were printed incorrectly, and 8,874 shares are temporarily suspended from transfer. As for the 1,418,455 shares that have been exchanged for stock certificates but have not been exchanged by the holder of the temporary receipts, they are all stored in the exchange for temporary receipt redemption at any time. After a random inspection of several companies, the numbers were all accurate, and there was no case of private use. The exchange has also announced a deadline for the redemption of temporary receipts, and it will no longer handle the division and transfer of accounts from April.

### Preventing Hoarding Ban on Transfer of Goods No Delay in Futures

The authorities have recently been paying close attention to the daily transactions of merchants in various industries. No matter what kind of goods, once the guest sells to the firm, the firm must immediately sell the goods to the store that operates these goods, and then the store displays them in the store for legitimate users to choose from, and it is strictly forbidden to transfer and sell them. If the firm trades with the firm, or the store buys and sells with the store, there are many malpractices due to the transfer of sales, which easily leads to hoarding and speculation, manipulation and monopoly, and other bad phenomena. At the same time, mutual profits invisibly increase the seller's costs and raise market prices. Therefore, in order to completely eliminate these illegal transactions, for all firms, stores, and guests, when goods are sold or purchased, the buying and selling parties must issue a transaction slip when the price is agreed and the transaction is officially concluded. The names of the seller and buyer's stores, the name of the goods, the quantity, the price, the date, and the signature and seal of the resident agent should be stated on the slip. Each party should keep one slip, and another slip should be sent to the market management committee or the industry association for inspection at any time. However, when the buyer purchases these goods, it must hire a car to pick up the goods from the warehouse or pier within the prescribed time limit, and must not deliberately delay. Once overdue, the firm may freely sell the goods to other parties, and the original buyer shall not stop it, but the payment may be given as appropriate to avoid disputes.

### A Glimpse of the Nursery of the Women's Christian Association

With a cheerful mood, I walked on Dashilu Yi Dingpan Road, looking up and counting the house numbers, "No. 66," ah, here it is! Walking into the iron gate, a tall Western-style house stood facing me, quite magnificent in appearance. A circle of bamboo fence was erected near the steps, and the courtyard was quiet and silent. I went around from the side door, and a nurse in white invited me into the office. The director of the nursery, a very young lady - Zhu Peien, but from her conversation and attitude, one could see her competence and ability. I inspected the whole room, which was a very spacious office. Many framed charts and lists were hung on the walls, which were enough to explain everything about the nursery's structure, organization, work situation, and service achievements. There were also many photos of children reading, playing, extracurricular activities, and health check-ups, which decorated the room, seeming to have both a scientific layout and an artistic flavor!

Inside Information

The nursery accommodates a total of 100 children, 59 boys and 41 girls. The procedures for admission require a health check-up, an intelligence test, and a recommender and a guarantor to be qualified. The nursery has two teachers, three nannies, seventeen staff members, and seven workers. The principles are to strive for popularization, scientificization, education, and familialization. It is said that the children in the nursery wash their hands and faces by themselves and eat and dress by themselves. Children aged four or five can develop good habits of self-help and responsibility from an early age, and because it is a collective life, it is also easy to develop a spirit and attitude of mutual assistance and cooperation. The nursery also pays attention to the health of the children, with adequate nutrition, fresh air and sunshine, and sufficient sleep. As for the planning of funds, it can be divided into fundraising and subscription. The former refers to the collection organized by the Women's Christian Association, and the latter can be done by all readers. As long as they are interested in the nursery movement and willing to subscribe, they can donate 100 yuan per month for each child's food expenses, or 1,200 yuan per year. The nursery also has an honorary memorial method for donors. (Here, the writer would like to ask for help on their behalf, hoping that enthusiastic people can provide more assistance.)

Various Features

After inquiring in detail about everything in the nursery, Ms. Zhu accompanied me to visit various places. Climbing the stairs, first there was the "bedroom" (it is said that there are eight rooms in the nursery, three game rooms, one washroom, one convalescent room, two isolation rooms, and one kitchen, which is not a small scale). Opening the door of a bedroom, the sunlight shone on the small iron beds, with neat rows, white sheets, and a soft and quiet atmosphere, which made people feel like they were in a hospital. Most of the small iron beds are for single people, and there are also larger and shorter beds for two younger children to climb up and sleep together. There are also several bed frames with a square bronze plaque engraved with the name of the donor in memory. After seeing it, it gave me an impression of "neatness and simplicity." Then I went to the "washroom," where rows of wooden racks were placed with numbered washbasins and mouthwash jars, and the hand towels were hung on hooks. It is said that the female workers have to wash them with sand soap every evening. There is also a feature here, that is, more than a dozen nurses all wear white clothes, which has a hospital atmosphere.

Walking into the "convalescent room," the sunlight was very sufficient, and the air was also very fresh. It is said that this room is for children to rest and live in after they are sick. I went to visit the "isolation room," where several children suffering from infectious diseases were lying quietly on the beds. Some nurses were bandaging children with skin diseases. I heard that children in various nurseries have been suffering from this kind of epidemic recently, which is called Munips in English and mumps in Chinese, and is called "pig腮肿" in the local dialect. It is very serious among children. It is said that if boys suffer too much, it will affect their future fertility, so the severity of the disease can be known.

I also visited the "game room." The car was broken and placed high on the top of the tree, and the steering wheel of the foot-powered car was also dropped and needed to be repaired. The rest are some very simple toys. Here, I also ask on their behalf that all sectors donate some old and tired toys that children play with, but are enough to inspire children's intelligence, such as building blocks, chess, balls, and other toys to benefit the nursery.

Farewell Message

Finally, when I left, I expressed my admiration to Ms. Zhu for their service enthusiasm and hard-working spirit, but she smiled and replied, "... Our spiritual rewards are very great!" Indeed, to serve children, first, you must be interested, and second, you must be patient. You must have love and enthusiasm. Only by possessing these conditions can you be worthy of being a kind mother to children!

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang

Shark (1)

There is about half a month between entering the port and departing for a voyage. The local newspaper published an announcement: "Temporarily suspending publication during the mooring period in the home port, please forgive the readers."

Makoto and others took a freshwater bath in the Yokosuka Suikosha bathhouse, which they had not been able to take for a long time, and then ran to the road to take a few steps, feeling that their steps on the land were very happy. Since landing in Futami, this feeling has occurred, which Makoto finds strange. Makoto suddenly realized that this might be the taste of "home port."

The roads in Yokosuka are slightly narrower than those in Kure and Sasebo, and wherever you go, you feel a pungent smell. He was still thinking in his heart that he would like to visit the Kyoto he had never seen before as soon as possible.

Tokyo is where his elder brother Kakuzo lives, somewhere in Koto Ward. Because the place is not easy to find, he will write a letter first.

Coincidentally, on September 15th, all candidate officers above the rank of special warrant officer in the fleet decided to go to Kyoto to receive supreme glory.

When Makoto saw the Double Bridge, he said that he already felt that he was standing in the respectable center of Japan, so his body trembled. After worshiping the forbidden area of ​​the Imperial Palace, he felt that everything had become a dream.

A small candidate officer was able to receive such supreme glory, so Makoto's heart was filled with gratitude and nothing else. This was more than a hundred times the gratitude he had expressed at the Ifuku training ground during his second middle school life. "The people in Tokyo are a bit unkind. There are such restaurants, but everyone pretends not to know..."

Kato said these unfair words while holding a fork.

After Makoto withdrew, wearing his original dress uniform, he visited the Meiji Jingu Shrine and the Yasukuni Shrine, and then returned to the ship that day.

On the third day, he took a special electric train from Yokosuka to Kyoto to visit the capital. At the same time, he also arranged to meet Kato, and they went together. He planned to visit Ueno Park first; but when he arrived at Ueno Station, he got lost.

"Then, how do we go?"

"Have you asked?"

"You ask!"

The two pushed each other. Wearing the first type of candidate officer's uniform and asking passers-by on the road was a bit embarrassing. However, the two walked along and unknowingly came to a place similar to a park.

The two carefully visited the museum and immediately felt very hungry, but as naval officers, it was not very elegant to eat and drink in an inappropriate place. Although there were teahouses in the woods of Ueno, there were no restaurants.

The two had no choice but to stop being embarrassed and finally took turns asking where the restaurants were. At this time, a Seiyoken restaurant was found behind them.

### Women's Christian Association Opens a Family Second-Hand Market

At this time of emergency and rising living costs, the impact on family life is both deep and significant. Therefore, many families are willing to sell surplus household items to slightly supplement the family burden, and some families are willing to purchase household items at a lower price to reduce family expenses. The Adult Department of the Women's Christian Association has launched a "Second-Hand Market" to meet this need, which will be held on April 21, 22, 23, and 24, from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. every day. The types of items consigned include clothing, kitchen utensils, toys, ornaments, cosmetics, daily necessities, and stationery. The market is completely service-oriented and acts in accordance with the regulations, only taking 10% as all expenses.

He donated 10,000 yuan specifically to help the Pingjiang Children's Education and Training Institute, hoping that all sectors of society would respond to the call and entrust the institute to distribute the funds as needed for the purpose of cultivating talents.
