### Construction Talent

As the war becomes more intense, construction becomes all the more important. The establishment of the rear determines the strength of the front lines; therefore, the quantity of construction in the rear can determine the victory or defeat of the war. At a time when the nation urgently needs construction, the importance of construction talent is especially evident.

In this Greater East Asia War, China is still in the rear for the time being. The responsibility of the rear is to increase production, and increasing production is construction. If our construction efforts have good results, then the Greater East Asia War will have good results. If our construction efforts are unsuccessful, then China, located in the rear, will naturally be in trouble, and the results of the war on the front lines will be self-evident. China is a country with backward industries, with few production enterprises and few construction talents. Therefore, we place great hope on the talents who are currently engaged in construction. The government should cherish them very much, and the construction personnel themselves should have a great sense of self-respect.

First, the government should cherish talent and not use it excessively or insufficiently, or improperly. Destroying their future and losing the people's faith is most regrettable. The so-called "knowing people and making good use of them" and "taking the strengths to make up for the weaknesses" are the only ways to select and cultivate talent.

Second, the government should trust talent. After the selection is decided, absolute trust should be given. All responsibilities must be based on authority, and authority must be based on trust. It is a mistake in handling affairs to grant authority without trust, and to restrict it after granting authority, so that it cannot be exercised. It is even more inappropriate to force people to bear responsibilities that exceed their authority. The government should give those who handle affairs full authority, and those who handle affairs should naturally bear full responsibility.

Third, the government should make talent public property. The meaning of talent as public property is that talent is a public resource of society and the nation, not a tool of a certain party, faction, or person. Construction talent is publicly owned by the nation, and it is not subject to the control of any party or individual. No party or individual can have a possessive mentality, thinking that it must be used for their own purposes, thus delaying national affairs.

First, construction talent itself should be diligent in their duties. This is the basic condition for doing things, and construction work is even more important, because it is related to the present and the future. It cannot be achieved with empty words, and it cannot deceive the world. People who are cultivated by the country must be down-to-earth and show their achievements, so that they are worthy of themselves, worthy of others, and worthy of the country.

Second, construction talent itself should be honest in conduct. Construction projects are always related to economics, and most construction projects are related to public economic interests. Dishonest conduct can become a great crime against the country, destroying oneself and dragging down national affairs. "A moment's mistake" can lead to "lifelong regret," and this is something that should be most encouraged.

China is currently in an era of active construction, and the need for construction talent is more urgent than any other matter. The urgency of time no longer allows us to merely "sit and talk," but requires us to "stand up and act." We will determine our fate with the results of our actions. In this great era, both the government and the construction talent themselves should pay close attention.

### The Soviet Diplomatic Offensive in the Mediterranean

The Soviet Union's recognition of the Badoglio government was not announced to the United States and Britain in advance, so its true intention has caused anxiety among the authorities in Britain and the United States and their left-wing forces. In particular, many facts, such as the Polish issue, the South Country issue, and the Italian partition issue, all provide strong evidence that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union will not cooperate. Although the United States and Britain faithfully implemented their national treaties concerning Italy, the Soviet Union actually established diplomatic relations with a conquered country, which obviously violates the spirit of the armistice treaty. As a result, the United States and Britain had to follow the Soviet Union in a way that would not hurt their own face and had to recognize the Badoglio government.

### The True Intention of the Soviet Union is Unclear

As a result, Badoglio's position has been temporarily strengthened, and the issue of King Victor Emmanuel III's forced abdication has been shelved. The left-wing factions in the United States and Britain, and the Communist Party of the United States, which have been fiercely attacking Badoglio and Victor Emmanuel III, are confused by the Soviet Union's diplomatic tactics. However, Stalin will ultimately not support the principle of the monarchy. The Soviet government's policy is of course more concerned with military matters than ideological facts. As long as it is a government that is at war with Germany, no matter what kind of government it is, it will be supported. By supporting the Badoglio government, the entire Southern Italian society is thrown into chaos, creating a base for the outbreak of a full-scale revolution.

However, fundamentally, the Soviet Union's actions this time are obviously based on its vast Mediterranean policy. From this point of view, issues such as the North African French government, the Soviet Union's work in West Asia, the Tito regime in Southern Europe, the Italian fleet, and the Soviet Union's attitude are undoubtedly inseparable.

### The Anxiety of the United States Government

According to a Washington dispatch, Roosevelt summoned Secretary of State Hull to the White House on the 15th for a lengthy discussion and was quite concerned about the Soviet government's unilateral diplomacy after the Tehran Conference. It is generally speculated that the recognition of the Badoglio government may lead to diplomatic measures against the Soviet government.

According to information from political circles in Washington, in the matter of recognizing the Badoglio government, the Soviet representative to the Italian Advisory Commission, Vyshinsky, was recalled to his country and a new representative was sent to succeed him. In response, the United States and Britain are quite concerned, believing that the Soviet Union may be determined to withdraw from the Italian Advisory Commission. It is generally speculated that the United States and Britain have a dominant position in the Italian Advisory Commission, and the Soviet Union has long expressed its dissatisfaction. Therefore, the Soviet Union's withdrawal from the commission is not impossible. If this move is realized, the opposing relationship between the United States and Britain and the Soviet Union in the Mediterranean will develop into a new stage.

### Japanese Army Enters Assam; Continues to Advance; Fierce Fighting in Imphal Basin

Tokyo, Central News Agency, 28th. According to a dispatch from a certain base in Burma, enemy glider troops landed in the Dangon area within Burmese territory, attempting to threaten the Japanese army from behind. However, these troops have no other way to transport supplies except by air. Therefore, such a foolish move by the enemy headquarters is tantamount to self-entrapment and is enough to expose its weakness of being at the end of its rope. The US Air Force commanded by Stilwell can currently only take care of the supply of the Fagon front line and the US-Chongqing army, so it has no extra energy to take care of other things. Therefore, the Japanese army in central Burma and India, taking advantage of the void to advance, can exert its combat power without any restraint. Therefore, the glider troops, which originally intended to disrupt the Japanese army's rear, not only failed to achieve their goal, but also sent themselves to their deaths.

Lisbon, Central News Agency, 28th. According to a broadcast from San Francisco: The Japanese-Indian Allied Forces are fiercely fighting with the British-Indian army on the highway between Tiddim Tong and Imphal, and it is reported that they are advancing further towards Imphal.

Guangzhou, Central News Agency, 28th. According to a radio broadcast from India, General O'Reilly, commander of the Indian-British army, reported on the war situation again at the Central Legislative Council meeting on the 27th, saying that the Japanese-Indian army that invaded Assam is continuing to make favorable progress. In the future, the war situation should be considered, and the anti-Axis forces from the Near East and Italian fronts should be quickly transferred to reinforce.

Tokyo, Central News Agency, 27th. After the Japanese-Indian army broke through the Indian border, it has gradually crushed the enemy's resistance and continued to advance deep into Indian territory, and is approaching the enemy's most important stronghold, the Imphal Basin. Therefore, the war situation in that area has reached its climax.

Japanese Aircraft in Large Formation Strikes Chittagong

Tokyo, Central News Agency, 28th. According to a dispatch from a certain Burmese military base, the Japanese army broke through the Indian border and is advancing rapidly. Japanese aircraft responded and suddenly launched a joint large formation of fighters and bombers on the 25th, attacking the enemy airfield in Chittagong. They engaged 30 enemy Spitfire aircraft in the airspace over the area and repelled them. Amidst the intense enemy anti-aircraft fire, they repeatedly strafed and bombed the enemy airfield, destroying one large aircraft and one small aircraft. On the way back, they encountered eight enemy rocket-powered P38 fighter aircraft over a certain base and engaged in an air battle, destroying six of them (three of which are unconfirmed), and all returned safely to their base.

### Mr. Toshio Shiratori Expresses His Views on the Significance of the Japanese-Indian Allied Forces Attacking India

Tokyo, Central News Agency. Under the support of the Indian National Army, the Japanese army finally entered India, and the Indian provisional government is preparing to promote administration. The former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Shiratori Toshio, recently talked about the political and military significance of the Japanese army and the Indian National Army's attack on India, saying: "Mountbatten must be panicked by this time. He has done nothing in the past year since he took office. Now, he is not only unable to regain...in the operation..., but he himself is also shaken. The Indian National Army's attack on India has extremely profound military implications and has given the enemy a great blow politically. The Indians are not a warlike people and are extremely calm. At the same time, they have a huge population of 350 million. Although most of this population is under British oppression, it has not diminished. Now, its vitality and unlimited vigor have finally formed a group and can be fully exerted. Moreover, the Indian National Army has now begun an armed attack in order to seek sincere independence. The Indian people will definitely respond in droves. Once the 350 million Indian people rise up, what is there to fear from the two or three million British and Americans. This operation is an expression of absolute confidence in the Indian independence movement, so its significance is great. It is expected that Britain will soon begin to suppress or inspect the Indians, but most of the leaders of the Indian independence movement have already been imprisoned, so further suppression will have no effect. If they want to thoroughly clear it, they must inspect the entire 350 million Indians. Moreover, Britain itself is still facing the second front problem in Europe and the German bombing of the British mainland. Also, Britain relies on the United States for everything, so it can be seen that the five countries no longer have the ability to deal with the Indian problem. Now the United States is more concerned than Britain. The most worrying thing is Chongqing. Now the retreat route from Mumbai has been blocked, and the construction of the Burma-India highway is also very bleak. Although the United States also helps with construction, this is completely different from the construction of the Alaska Highway. At the same time, Chongqing is completely isolated from India and can only move towards destruction. Due to India's independence and the isolation of Chongqing, the Axis camp has lost two major bases. As a result, the Anglo-American attempt to launch a counteroffensive in East Asia has become a bubble. Mr. [name] believes that the Indians will definitely rise up to resist the British. Even if the Indians who rise up in India are not well-equipped, they can win more with less. The size of the population is one of the factors that determine victory or defeat in this war."

### Battles on the Bessarabian Plain; Germany Transports Reinforcements from Hungary

Zurich, Central News Agency, 28th. According to front-line news, the focus of the war situation in the southern part of the Eastern Front is still in the three areas of northern Bessarabia, the lower reaches of the Bug River, and the vicinity of Kamenets-Podolsky. The fighting on the Bessarabian Plain is extremely fierce. The vanguard of Konev's Soviet army has arrived in Prut, which has no strategic value. It is generally believed that the Soviet army must aim to reach the front of Romania in order to gain..., increasing the military suppression of the Soviet Union. It is reported that the German army is now continuously transporting large numbers of reinforcements to the front line via Hungary, determined to defend the national border to the death. The Soviet army admits that it is most difficult to break through the German defense line in the Carpathian Mountains, but it fears that the battle line will become deadlocked. It is reported that it has begun to actively utilize the Tito and other troops in Yugoslavia.

### Japanese Army Air Force Attacks Jian'ou Again

Tokyo, Central News Agency, 28th. According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in China, the Japanese army bomber squadron attacked the Jian'ou airfield again at 5:30 PM on the 27th despite bad weather, destroying all of its remaining runways. Although the enemy's ground fire was unusually fierce at the time, all Japanese aircraft returned safely.

### Ten Enemy Aircraft that Attacked Rabaul Were Shot Down

### Special Court Recovers Embezzled Funds from the Hou Hu Case

Nanjing, Central News Agency, 28th. Hou Dachun and Hu Zheng, convicted of treason, were sentenced to death by the Special Court of the National Government and executed by shooting. It is learned that in order to effectively recover and confiscate the embezzled funds, the court, in addition to quickly sending personnel to various places in Jiangsu and Shanghai to seal up all the properties of the convicts, is still concerned that there may be omissions and incidents of hiding under false names. Therefore, it issued a public notice in the newspaper yesterday, stating that regardless of who it is, anyone who manages or stores Hou Dachun and Hu Zheng's movable and immovable property, bank and money house deposits, stock shares, and all other securities (not issued by the court) should truthfully report to the court from now until April 30 of this year for verification. Those who fail to report within the deadline will be prosecuted for political crimes once the facts are verified.

### The Municipal Government Ordered Wu Song to be Appointed as the Director of the First District Office; He Took Office Yesterday

Wu Songgao, the Chief Secretary of the First District Office, was recently appointed as the Director of the office by order of the Municipal Government. He took office yesterday (the 28th) and issued a notice to inform the public. The full text of the notice is recorded below:

"According to the order of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, Hu City No. 3082: It is hereby ordered that the aforementioned official be the Director of the First District Office of this city, awaiting further briefing. This order, etc. Upon receiving this order, the Director of this office took office on March 28. In addition to reporting and distributing the order, it is hereby announced to inform the public."

### Director Wu's Remarks

"Since the administrative power of the former Shanghai Public Concession was returned to our country on August 1 last year, the First District Office was declared established. Mayor Chen Gongbo concurrently served as the Director of the First District Office, and entrusted me with the position of Chief Secretary. For more than half a year, thanks to the guidance of Mayor Chen, the assistance of my colleagues, and the cooperation of all relevant parties, I have been able to avoid making mistakes, for which I am very grateful. On February 1 this year, the two districts were ordered to merge, and I was again ordered by Mayor Chen to adjust the internal organization and personnel of the office to fully adapt to our country's administrative system. In just two months, the takeover of the second district was largely completed. The boundaries of the concessions have been eliminated, and various facilities can now respond to each other and be gradually promoted. The recovery of the former two concessions in this city has come to an end. Now that Director Chen is concurrently serving as the Director due to his busy government affairs, he has re-appointed me to succeed him. I have always served in diplomacy and am ashamed to say that I have no experience in local administration. Moreover, given the complexity of Shanghai's situation and the importance of the first district's administration, I fear that my talent and ability are not up to the task. However, at this time, it is not permissible to avoid responsibility for the sake of public welfare. Therefore, I have accepted this position today. From now on, I will continue to serve the citizens with my consistent spirit. The improvement of district administration is naturally a matter of urgency, but the rational resolution of people's livelihood issues and the transformation of social atmosphere are even more fundamental goals. It is only with the full cooperation of all parties that we can achieve success. I hope that people of insight from both China and Japan will come forward to teach me."

### Allocated Cotton Cloth of Various Colors Must Not Be Refused for Selection and Purchase; Retailers Will Be Numbered and Posted Separately

The National General Association of Commercial Control, to meet the needs of citizens, has legally stipulated to first implement the temporary allocation of cotton cloth. The quantity and price of the temporary cotton cloth allocation have now been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and a "Cloth Purchase Certificate" has been prepared. It will soon be issued by the Municipal Government in accordance with the household rice allocation method, with each household receiving one cloth certificate per person, entitling them to purchase one and a half yards of superior quality cotton cloth at a price of ten yuan, one dime and four cents per yard. It is expected that the general allocation will begin in early next month. Citizens can present the "Cloth Purchase Certificate" to designated cotton cloth retailers to pay for and select their purchases. It is hereby stipulated that all cotton cloth retailers who have joined the Municipal Textile Industry Association as members and operate a storefront with a physical shopfront shall be registered and numbered by the Association. The Commercial Control Association will then print and distribute a "Retailer Number Sign" to each retailer, to be distributed by the Textile Industry Association to each retailer for posting in a prominent place on the storefront.

### Displaying Cloth Samples in Showcases and on Counters

Each retailer's allocation of cotton cloth of various colors should be displayed as samples in showcases or on counters, so that citizens can select from the available cotton cloth and must not refuse them. Retailers selling cotton cloth should only sell to those who hold a purchase certificate designated for that retailer, and should sell at the retail price announced by the Commercial Control Association, issuing an invoice for record.

### Charity Sale of Air Raid Lampshades - Practical and Useful, Acknowledged and Supported by the Air Defense Headquarters

The Municipal Xin Yun Branch initiated a charity sale of air raid lampshades by youths on the anniversary of the selection of the capital city. It is learned that the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters has expressed special support for this endeavor. According to reports, since the implementation of lighting controls in the city, citizens have been able to cooperate, which is deeply gratifying. Regarding streetlights, the Headquarters has decided to find ways to improve them. However, due to the difficulty for citizens to purchase cloth, indoor lighting has not yet reached the expected results, with some turning off lights very early, affecting daily work. To remedy this deficiency, the Municipal Xin Yun Branch has launched a charity sale of two types of paper air raid lampshades, which are not only practical but also convenient to use. Furthermore, the shades are printed with alert signals and air defense slogans, allowing citizens to refer to them at any time, providing a warning. This is also particularly effective for air defense publicity. It is hoped that relevant agencies will provide as much assistance as possible, and that citizens will adopt them universally, so that the city's air defense lighting controls can achieve the best possible results.

### The First Xin Yun Games Closed Successfully Yesterday

The Municipal First Xin Yun Promotion Conference, on the second day of the conference, continued to hold discussion sessions in the morning, with reports from various district branches and district sub-group headquarters on past work.

### Validity Period of Moving In/Out Permits

Recently, reporters inquired with the Commercial Control Association and learned that the applicants for the moving in/out permits and removal approval letters often requested an extension of the deadline because they were unable to transport the goods before the deadline. To facilitate applicants, the validity period has been revised as follows: The moving-in permit is uniformly two months. The moving-out permit is uniformly one month. The removal approval letter is uniformly two months. If the goods cannot be transported on time due to transportation issues, those with proof from the shipping agency will be granted a one-time extension. If the goods still cannot be transported on time after the extension, those with proof from the shipping agency will be allowed to apply again free of charge. However, if the goods are not transported after the deadline, regardless of the reason, no further extension will be granted. All issued moving out permits or approval letters, whether used or not, will not have their service fees refunded.

### Police Consumer Cooperative Receives Enthusiastic Support from All Quarters; Tea Party Held Yesterday with Leaders from All Industries

The Municipal First Police Bureau, in order to improve the lives of police officers and enhance service efficiency, is planning to establish a police consumer cooperative. On the 16th of this month, the Chairman of the cooperative, Mr. Chen Gongbo, hosted a reception for the industrial, commercial, and financial communities of the city to elect supporting committee members to carry out preparations. A first discussion meeting was then held on the 18th of this month. Yesterday (28th) afternoon at 4:00 p.m., Su Chengde, Deputy Director of the First Police Bureau, again invited leaders from all industries to a tea party at the Police Club.

### Attendees

At 4:00 p.m. sharp, guests arrived one after another, including Wen Lan-ting, Li Si-hao, Tang Shou-min, Lin Kang-hou, Ye Fu-sun, Shao Shu-hua, Shen Er-chang, Xian Nan-qun, Xie Xiao-chu, Ren Xiao-shan, Wu Yun-qi, Wang Huai-lian, Li Zu-fan, Zhu Chuan-gao, Dai Jiang-quan, Zhan Pei-lin, Tang Zhi-liang, Zhang Wei-ru, Lu Feng, and more than 100 chairmen of various trade associations, who were warmly received by Su Chengde, Deputy Director of the cooperative, and the heads of various departments.

### Speech by Deputy Director Du

Deputy Director Du delivered a speech, stating: "Regarding the establishment of the police consumer cooperative, we have held two discussions before, and the methods have been reported in the newspapers, which you are all aware of. Currently, prices in Shanghai are soaring, and life is unstable, especially for the police, whose income is meager and difficult to sustain. Therefore, we plan to establish a consumer cooperative to allocate various daily necessities to the police at flat prices, so that the police can serve with peace of mind. This matter depends on the enthusiastic support of all sectors, and we are very grateful."

### Speech by Deputy Director Su

Deputy Director Su then delivered a speech, stating: "On the 16th of this month, we invited guests from all walks of life to a tea party to request support for the organization of a consumer cooperative. Since then, we have received enthusiastic responses from leaders from all walks of life, especially Mr. Wen Lan-ting of the Municipal Welfare Association, Mr. Zhen Deng of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Tang Shou-min of the Commercial Control Association, Mr. Ye Fu-xiao and Mr. Lin Kang-hou of the Banking Association, Mr. Pei Yun-qing and Mr. Lu Shu-chen of the Money Trade Association, and the authorities of the Central Reserve Bank and the Hua Xing Bank, as well as Mr. Sheng You-he, who have generously offered their assistance. The Shanghai press has also been very supportive of the cooperative's publicity efforts. On the 26th, Shen Sun published an article by Changfeng Jun, whose insightful opinions are highly admirable. Since the government's funding is difficult, we can only request support from all sectors to enable the police to obtain some flat-priced daily necessities to supplement their livelihoods. This is the motivation for organizing the police consumer cooperative. Changfeng Jun argued that the police consumer cooperative should not be limited to one district but should cover all police in Shanghai, which is of great value. The entire Bureau fully supports and appreciates this. There are currently about 20,000 police officers in Shanghai, and about 100,000 people including their families. Therefore, after careful statistics, the capital requires at least 100 million yuan. This fund is purely a loan, which will be repaid in the future. We ask that leaders from all walks of life provide special support, and it would be best to raise enough money within ten days so that it can be established as soon as possible. As for the custody and disbursement of the cooperative's funds, we plan to invite representatives from the Banking Association and the Commercial Control Association to supervise and handle it, to show our prudence. As for the method of allocation by various industries, we have also conducted extensive research. Mr. Chen Bin-su will report on this shortly."

### Speech by Li Si-hao

Li Si-hao spoke first, stating: "The original capital of the police consumer cooperative was set at 400,000 yuan, but now that the scope is all police in Shanghai, this number is naturally too small. Rather than gradually increasing it in the future, it is better to raise enough at once. I fully agree with the suggestion of raising 100 million yuan. This is a basic way to establish Shanghai's public security. I hope that the financial community and various trade associations will do their best to support it and promote its success."

### Speech by Tang Shou-min

Tang Shou-min, Chairman of the Commercial Control Association, stated: "The responsibility for the public security of Shanghai lies with the people. We rely on the police to shoulder this responsibility. Therefore, the citizens should have the greatest sympathy for the hardships of the police's lives and do their best to help them improve their lives. Moreover, in the current critical period of the war, the security of the rear is particularly important. The greater the responsibility of the police, the more necessary it is to ensure their livelihood. At present, the salary of a police officer is only about one thousand yuan per month. Under the current circumstances of rising prices, it is impossible for them to support a family of five. Therefore, it is essential to organize a consumer cooperative, and I fully agree with it. As for the Commercial Control Association, we will do our best to assist within the scope of our capabilities. The purpose of the cooperative is to help 20,000 police officers and 100,000 family members solve their livelihood problems. Although a capital of 100 million yuan may seem large, it may still be too small to completely solve the problem. As for the fundamental solution, we citizens still have to ask the municipal authorities to adjust the police's treatment."

### Speech by Director Wu

Wu Song-gao, Director of the First District Office, continued to speak, stating: "The economy is closely related to peace, and spiritual life is inseparable from material life. As the saying goes, 'Only when clothing and food are sufficient can one know honor and guidance.' The work of the police is related to the citizens at all times. The ineffective work of the police has a great impact on the welfare of the citizens. The police consumer cooperative is initiated by the government and hopes to be supported by the people. The government is a vertical organization, and the people's organizations are continuous organizations. The cooperation between officials and the people can solve all the problems in Shanghai. Shanghai is a wartime economic center, so officials and the people must work together, and then cooperate between China and Japan. The success of the police consumer cooperative can reflect the degree of success of other undertakings in Shanghai in the future."

### Speech by Chen Bin-he

Chen Bin-he then reported that he had been entrusted by the police authorities and instructed by local elders such as Lan-ting, Lin Kang-hou, Li Si-hao, and Ye Fu-tun to negotiate loans with all parties, and that all parties had been very enthusiastic in their support. For example, the authorities of the Central Reserve Bank and the Hua Xing Bank first agreed to lend a large sum of money. On the morning of the 25th, he visited Mr. Tang Shou-min and discussed in detail the quantity of daily necessities to be requested for allocation and the loan method for three hours. On the evening of the 24th, he visited Mr. Sheng You-shi and was immediately granted a loan of 2 million yuan. Other leaders from all walks of life, such as Wu Yun-zhai, Zhang Wei-ru, Xu Guan-qun, Xu Xiao-chu, Dun Shun-shao, Shu-ju Xiang Kang-yuan, Wu Yong-an, Chen Bo-fan, Chen Cheng-lun, Zhan Pei-lin, and Xie Xiao-chu, also expressed their enthusiastic support. Now, the 100 million yuan in capital should be allocated and borrowed as evenly as possible. First, we will request the Central Reserve Bank and the Hua Xing Bank to increase the amount of their loans. Second, we will request the Banking Association to lend 20 million yuan. The Money Trade Association will lend 10 million yuan. Third, there are about 100 units in various trade associations in the city. Assuming that there are 60 units, they will be divided into three grades, and we will request 10 units to lend 2 million yuan, 20 units to lend 1 million yuan, and 30 units to lend 500,000 yuan, for a total of 55 million yuan. Fourth, we will request special commercial companies and general companies, assuming 20 units, to allocate 500,000 to 1 million yuan per unit. The above allocation methods have been approved by the police authorities and local elders. The Municipal Welfare Association will send letters to the leaders of various trade associations within one or two days, detailing the loan amount and various methods. This matter concerns local security, so we must do our best to support it.

### Speech by Wen Lan-ting

Finally, Wen Lan-ting, Chairman of the Municipal Welfare Association, stated: "The police are responsible for maintaining public security. Although organizing the police consumer cooperative is a matter of helping to improve the lives of the police, it is actually a matter for the citizens themselves. I hope that the leaders of various industries will understand this and enthusiastically lend the 100 million yuan. As for the payment date, it is best to set it at ten days to two weeks so that all of you can arrange for it." Deputy Director Su expressed his gratitude, and then they all had refreshments, and the meeting adjourned at 5:30.
