### Editorial: The Negation of Selfishness

Mr. Yuen-Di Yu-Song, speaking at Shanghai University on "The Path Forward for Chinese Youth," said that the central idea of Buddhism lies in the negation of selfishness. He also said that Eastern morality originates in cultivating oneself and managing one's family, extending to governing the country and bringing peace to the world. One who cannot conquer the thief in his heart, how can he possibly eliminate the thieves in the world? Therefore, a spirit of fairness and selflessness is absolutely essential. Dedicating oneself to one's village, community, and nation, rather than solely focusing on one's own interests, is of utmost importance. Mr. Yu-Song therefore hoped that Chinese youth would first cultivate noble morals, so that they could save China.

The words quoted above can be said to be the traditional spirit of Eastern nations, the driving force that has allowed Eastern nations to endure for so long. However, in the past hundred years, the Chinese people have been infected by Anglo-American ideas; egoism and utilitarianism have at least deeply imprinted themselves in the minds of urban residents. If this mindset is allowed to continue, the Chinese nation-state will inevitably move towards self-destruction, and every Chinese citizen will become a stateless Jew. All those concerned about the future of the nation cannot but loudly denounce and attack this selfish mentality. Although the target of the attack may be a certain individual or group, the starting point of the attack lies solely in correcting the selfish mentality and does not imply any ill will towards any particular individual or group. Friendly foreign figures who are concerned about China's problems and willing to assist in China's revival also frequently voice similar opinions; now, Mr. Yu-Song can be said to be representative of them.

Shanghai is the most important port subjected to Anglo-American cultural invasion. Shanghai citizens, under such circumstances, are at least consciously or unconsciously tainted with some degree of selfishness. Especially before the recovery of the concessions, relying on special privileges, most people followed the Anglo-American enemies, doing things solely for their own benefit. Due to the abnormal development of commerce, almost all Shanghai citizens became merchants who were only interested in profit. Because money could buy personal enjoyment, almost all Shanghai citizens became believers in money worship. Common upstarts are even more the standard of utilitarianism and egoism, and are most likely to shake the will of ordinary wavering citizens in society, which over time will affect the entire society. Just look at Shanghai's abnormal prosperity in recent years, the decline of Shanghai's social morality, and the weakness of Shanghai's social will; everywhere indicates that Shanghai is not on the right track but is instead treading a crooked path.

One must know that in a society or nation, the extreme development of individual nationalism indicates the extreme decline of the society or nation. When the society or nation regresses to the point where it cannot exist and is destroyed, the individual citizen will also fundamentally cease to exist and perish together. Historical precedents are countless, and Shanghai is now walking down this path to destruction. How can this not cause people to worry and panic? This social psychology is deeply rooted and its symptoms are already critical. If it is not treated now, it will inevitably be incurable in the future. In order to revitalize the psychology of Shanghai people and to save Shanghai's future, it is necessary to eradicate this social psychological malady from its roots with the greatest determination. The government should use political power to sanction it, and society should use the power of public opinion to criticize it. We must gather the strength of all sides to attack the same goal. If we do not eliminate this thief in our hearts, Shanghai has no future.

### Japanese Planes Night Raid Saipan Island, Inflicting Heavy Damage on Enemy Boat Groups; U.S. Ship Crew Shortages Increasingly Serious

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Japanese aircraft, in cooperation with land forces, bombed enemy boat groups near Cape Achigan and Obiamu in southern Saipan Island on the night of the 21st, inflicting heavy damage. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to their bases.

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Since the United States changed its shipbuilding plan, resolutely converting Liberty ships into Victory ships, the shortage of ship crews has become increasingly serious. Although efforts have been made to minimize the number of crew members on Liberty ships, Victory ships require more crew members than Liberty ships. Furthermore, with the recent construction of medium-sized cargo ships of 4,000 tons, the shortage of crew members will become even more acute. The U.S. government has made every effort to train crew members. The shipbuilding plan for this year totals 2,161 ships, requiring more than 7,100 ordinary and senior crew members. In addition, it is still necessary to fill the crew shortages, with the shortage of engineers among the senior crew members being the most severe. To seek countermeasures, the Maritime Transport Bureau's Merchant Marine Training Department has specially added merchant shipping schools directly under its jurisdiction. They quickly become crew members after only three months of training, and their capabilities are naturally quite poor.

### Japanese Troops Advance Towards Hengyang Along the Xiang River; Chongqing Authorities Evacuate Population

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to a United Press correspondent in Chongqing, the situation in Hunan and Henan is as follows: The Chongqing military authorities announced that Japanese troops are advancing southward towards Hengyang along both the east and west banks of the Xiang River, and admitted that the right wing of the Japanese army has advanced to Xiangxiang (88 kilometers north of Hengyang), while the left wing has occupied Liling (120 kilometers northeast of Hengyang). Furthermore, in Henan, the Japanese troops are advancing south from the east of the Pinghan Railway, and have advanced 48 li towards Zhengyang. Therefore, the connection between the Japanese positions south of Zhengzhou on the Longhai Railway and east of Xinyang is only 48 kilometers away, which can be completed soon.

Guangzhou, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to Chongqing Radio, the Chongqing military authorities admitted on the 21st that Changsha had fallen, and stated that the authorities had been actively and forcibly evacuating the population from Hengyang, the provincial capital of Hunan, for several days. It is reported that this evacuation work is now largely completed.

### Chongqing Troops' Fighting Spirit Declines

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Mr. Tsumiyama, information officer of the Third Section of the Japanese Cabinet Information Bureau, met with the Chinese press corps stationed in Japan on the afternoon of the 21st, and spoke about the Changsha operation and the decline of the morale of the Chongqing troops, stating the following: The Japanese army has captured Changsha in this Hunan operation. The most noteworthy aspect of this operation is that it is completely different from the previous situation. Usually, after the Japanese army attacked Changsha, the Chongqing troops would withdraw in full, so the city was not affected by the war at all and was safely handed over to the Japanese army. The replenishment of the Chongqing troops is extremely weak, and it is questionable whether the United States' arms lending to Chongqing can actually be implemented. Even if there is some lending, it is limited to the troops based on the U.S. military stationed in Chongqing. Other local troops have not received any lending. In this Hunan operation, the Japanese army, with skillful tactics, has specifically dealt heavy blows to the U.S. and British forces stationed in Chongqing, who are disrupting Asian stability, and to the Chongqing troops, who are running dogs of the Anglo-Americans and trampling on the Chinese people, while avoiding, as much as possible, causing the innocent people to suffer from the war. As for the morale of the Chongqing troops, as evidenced by the fact that a large number of Chongqing troops surrendered to the National Government during the Henan operation, it is clear that the Chongqing troops no longer have the same fighting spirit as before.

### Chongqing Planes Attack Japanese Navy at Jinggang

A certain Japanese military base in Hunan, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The various units of the Japanese Army in Central China launched an offensive in the plains of Hunan on May 27th. At the same time, the Japanese naval forces also began an offensive along the Changsha route of the Xiang River. On the morning of June 6th, they captured Yingtian (a key point along the Xiang River). Afterwards, they continued to attack Changsha by water, and finally broke into Jinggang (40 kilometers northwest of Changsha) on the 17th, completely occupying it. Among them, the Xiang River offensive operation between Jinggang at the mouth of Dongting Lake, a distance of approximately 100 kilometers, was completed after many hardships. Since the Xiang River is the main waterway of the entire Hunan province, the Xiang River is the economic lifeline of the province. Now that most of this waterway is in the hands of the Japanese army, it is a great blow to the Chongqing side. Therefore, the Chongqing air force stubbornly attacked the Japanese naval forces. For example, near Jinggang, the Chongqing air force often attacked with joint formations of fighter-bombers numbering about 30 to 40 aircraft. The Japanese naval forces used anti-aircraft artillery to inflict considerable losses on the Chongqing forces and repelled them.

### Movement Trends of the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force

A certain Japanese military base, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The U.S. Air Force previously used Kunming, Yunnan Province, as its central base, and scattered several large and small reserve airfields around it as supply bases for the entire Chinese front. At the same time, it also established a forward base in Guilin, and built a number of base groups centered on it in a fan-shaped border area to the northeast, including Hengyang, Lingling, Suichuan, and Jian'ou, thereby strengthening the air power of southwest China. The Japanese Air Force has continuously attacked them and monitored the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force, sometimes thwarting the U.S. Air Force's attempts. Before the U.S. planes bombed northern Kyushu on the 16th, it launched a surprise attack on Lingling and Hengyang on the 10th, destroying 13 Chongqing planes. Then, on the 11th, it launched an air raid on Suichuan, destroying 35 Chongqing planes in one fell swoop (including large aircraft). On the 12th, it launched a surprise attack on Enshi (Hubei) and Liangshan (Sichuan), destroying 12 Chongqing planes of various sizes. Furthermore, on the 13th, it bombed Jian'ou (now regarded as the most powerful airfield for attacking the Japanese mainland), destroying its runway and auxiliary facilities, rendering it unusable. Now, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, with its war-making capacity in southwest China suffering under the continuous pressure and frustration from the Japanese Air Force, seems to be planning to move to the northwest region in order to avoid the sharp advance of the Japanese Air Force. According to Japanese reconnaissance planes, the number of bases in Hanzhong (central Shaanxi Province) and other airfields has recently been increased. It is also reported that Shiji, Tianshui on the Longhai Railway, and Lanzhou in Gansu Province are also powerful bases for the Chongqing Air Force. The movement of the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force from southwest China to the northwest is, in fact, a crucial indicator of the future movements of the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force, so its movements are worthy of attention.

### Chongqing Planes Appear in the Beiping Area

Beiping, 22nd (Central News Agency) – At approximately 10:00 PM on the 22nd, a large Chongqing aircraft appeared in the Beiping area. The Japanese army took air defense measures, and the Chongqing aircraft was unable to accomplish anything and quickly left.

### Philippine Foreign Minister Cables Minister Chu to Express Gratitude

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – When the Chinese youth held the Second General Inspection some time ago, the Filipino youth in China were invited to participate. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the Philippines, Mr. Recto, sent a cable to our Foreign Minister Chu to express his gratitude.

### Wallace Fetes in Chongqing

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to a Chongqing dispatch, U.S. Vice President Wallace is holding talks with Chiang Kai-shek after arriving in Chongqing.

### Canadian Troops Reappear East of the Orne River

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – A Havas report: U.S. troops near Carentan are apparently seeking to expand their bridgehead to the west and southwest, and are seeking to clear the German obstacle positions south of Quineville. It is believed that the U.S. troops will launch another offensive in the Prautot area, as the U.S. troops were driven back after breaking into the German positions in the area on Tuesday. There were no reports of fighting south of the Carentan bridgehead yesterday. The Canadian 3rd Division, which suffered heavy losses in the early stages of the war, has reappeared in the area east of the Orne River. The weather in the battle area was good yesterday, and it could almost be described as true early summer weather.

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Havas: Sources report that the Allied headquarters announced on Wednesday evening that fierce fighting is taking place in the Tilly area.

Field Marshal Rundstedt issued a command, 22nd (Central News Agency) – A Havas report: The General Headquarters of the German forces on the four fronts announced that, up to June 20th, the German forces had destroyed no less than 650 Allied tanks, a number roughly equivalent to the strength of four and a half British tank divisions. Furthermore, in the first two weeks of the invasion of Europe, approximately 5,000 British, American, and Canadian soldiers were captured. The number of enemy soldiers killed is estimated to be over 100,000, while the number of wounded and sick is countless.

### Japan and Germany Sincerely Express Continued Joint Warfare

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – A German news agency reported: Taking advantage of the German forces' initial successful strike against the Anglo-American invading forces, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo sent a telegram to the German leader, expressing Japan's determination to work hard to defeat the common enemy and strive for final victory. The German leader replied by telegram, thanking the Japanese Prime Minister and expressing his belief that final victory could certainly be secured. At the same time, Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Aoi and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also exchanged telegrams, expressing in sincere terms that they would continue to fight together to defeat the Anglo-Americans.

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Japanese airman Warrant Officer Teigen Motomura, when enemy U.S. planes raided northern Kyushu at dawn on the 16th, stepped forward to intercept the enemy planes, first shooting down an enemy B-29 aircraft that was supposedly invincible, and subsequently shooting down or destroying three more enemy planes, achieving outstanding military achievements. Chief of Staff Tojo, to commend his outstanding achievements, presented him with a military sword and a reward, which was delivered to the warrant officer by the Chief of Staff of the Western Army on the 21st.

### New French Ambassador Couesme Arrives in Japan

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The new French Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Couesme, arrived in this country by plane with his family on the afternoon of the 22nd to assume his duties. The ambassador previously served as Deputy Director of the Asian Bureau of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Minister to Greece, and other positions. He was transferred from Ambassador to China to Ambassador to Japan in November of last year and is an outstanding diplomat.

### Intense Battle for Cherbourg; Germans Destroy Port Facilities; General Helmich Heroically Falls in Battle

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – A German news agency, citing an official German war report, stated: The enemy forces in the Normandy theater launched several offensives against the German encirclement east of the Orne River yesterday, but were all repulsed. The enemy forces launched another offensive against the Cherbourg fortress with large reconnaissance units, but were also repulsed. General Helmich, commander of the 243rd German Infantry Division, heroically fell in battle on June 17th while defending the Cherbourg Peninsula.

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Havas correspondent Insen reported: The Allied forces launched a concentrated attack on the Cherbourg fortress. The German forces, with a smaller force, continue to destroy the facilities of the port. Most of the port facilities are already unusable, and navigation of ships has also been blocked. Countermeasures to prevent naval attacks by the Allied powers have also been implemented. Allied battleships and cruisers seem to have abandoned shelling around Cherbourg, probably due to the power of German artillery. The German side has done its best to thoroughly destroy all port facilities in Cherbourg to prevent the enemy from using the port after its abandonment. German officials believe that, under the current circumstances, Cherbourg can be held for a considerable period of time, even if the German forces cannot launch a rescue offensive on the Cotentin Peninsula. If the Allied forces want to carry out a large-scale landing elsewhere, they must do so after occupying Cherbourg. Therefore, the main ground battle will have to be developed until the second phase of the war.

### Rommel Orders Troops to Defend the City to the Death

Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to U.S. sources, the invasion forces' command announced that U.S. infantry, with the assistance of artillery and aircraft, have entered the southern outskirts of Cherbourg. Cherbourg will soon be occupied. The German defense of Cherbourg is extremely sophisticated.

Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Havas reported: According to the United Press in London, U.S. forces yesterday joined the final battle for Cherbourg, the third largest port in France. With the aid of artillery fire, they attacked the city's inner defense fortifications. It is also reported that the German defenders of the city have rejected the Allied forces' request for surrender, and the German forces are currently destroying the port facilities, causing heavy smoke to obscure the sky. It is also heard that Field Marshal Rommel has ordered the Cherbourg defenders to defend the city to the death.

### Germany Remains Silent on the Finnish Issue; Finnish Ambassador to the U.S. Has Departed for Home

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The German Foreign Ministry remained silent on the Finnish issue yesterday. Regarding the Swedish reports that the Finnish cabinet will be reorganized and that Foreign Minister Ryesi may become Prime Minister, a spokesperson hinted and said that Marshal Mannerheim would be in a very important position in this matter. The spokesperson also mentioned that the Swedish Communist Party's newspaper stated that the Soviet offensive was carried out with the consent of the Anglo-Americans. The newspaper cited a certain U.S. broadcast as proof, saying that when the Anglo-Americans put pressure on Finland, the Soviets had already set their timetable.

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to Washington sources, Finnish Ambassador to the U.S. Procope, who was expelled by the U.S. government, left the U.S. yesterday with two counselors from the embassy to return to his country. It is not yet known which route he will take.

### Marshal Mannerheim

Helsinki, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Havas reported: On the day of the completion of training for young officers, Finnish Commander-in-Chief Mannerheim issued a message saying: We have steadfastly fought for a long time, and the war is fierce. Our army must work harder. The capabilities and fighting spirit of the Finnish army will encounter more severe tests. Defending the coast is the key to the Finnish front. Warships and coastal batteries share the heavy responsibility of coastal defense. General Mannerheim also encouraged the new officers to be brave and calm, loyal to the country, and to be role models for future generations.

### The Review Work of the Rice and Grain Problem in Various Regions Has Been Lagging Behind

The establishment of the rice control committee and the determination of specific procurement policies have been too far behind schedule. Procurement began one to two months later than usual, thus missing the most important procurement period. Work in various regions began in late November or early December. The rice control committee committed a great error at its inception, or even before its inception. Moreover, not only did the start time come too late, but the loan of funds was also too slow, and procurement prices were announced without any preparation. The prices were not based on the prices offered by farmers, but on the prices at which purchasing merchants delivered to the rice control committee. The result after the announcement was a sharp rise in market prices. People in the four regions all pointed to this as the main reason. This failure is worthy of attention. These people certainly do not disparage the various reasons pointed out by the offices of the Songjiang and Kunshan rice control committees, but are people who have personally felt the difficulty of procurement in a harsh environment. Even if this harsh environment exists, if the rice control committee had not delayed in establishing an institution in Shanghai, and had ordered the lower-level institutions to carry out procurement at the same time as the harvest, at least a considerable amount of procurement could have been achieved. After the announcement of the procurement policy of the rice control committee last year, the reporter held a symposium for procurement operators in Changshu. At that time, the overall opinion was the same as above. Therefore, this failure was not only clear after implementation, but its failure was expected before implementation. The reporter personally witnessed the people of Changshu gritting their teeth and standing by when the new rice appeared on the market. This failure is different in nature from the case of no follow-up after the procurement of cotton yarn and cloth, which led to a major flaw in the policy. From the beginning, it cannot be said to have been a good strategy, and it is something that the National Government authorities should reflect upon. The delay in this procurement work, as mentioned earlier, not only caused those who were procured to suffer the pain of procurement difficulties, but also caused farmers to suffer unnecessary hardships. To cite an example, a farmer from Kunshan sent a letter to a procurement merchant, the content of which is as follows:

We hope that you can start procurement as soon as possible. After the harvest, we can sell rice to buy enough necessities for life. But the procurement of the merchant designated by the rice control committee is too late, and we have no choice but to sell to other merchants. However, after we sold a considerable amount of rice, we were forced to sell it again, and we had no choice but to sell it a second time. Moreover, at that time, the procurement price and the market price were very different, which was extremely unfavorable for us sellers. Why is it that when there is rice, it is not procured, and when there is no rice, it is forced to be sold? In the future, I hope you will consider the interests of the people, and start procurement earlier and end it earlier.

### Quickly Prepare a Fundamental Countermeasure

Even if the environment is harsh and the policies are imperfect, if the timing of the start of procurement is not so late, the results of the procurement would not be so bad as they are today. There are many people in the mainland who say this, and we must humbly accept it. In order to overcome this lag, the rice control committee must make four or five times more effort. For example, in a certain area, all the preparatory work at the time of the founding of the army was quickly put into practice between March and April. During this period, the amount of rice and grain obtained by the rice control committee in the three months after its establishment was collected in ten days in that area. This is truly an amazing thing.

The reporter asked people from various regions: "If we had started earlier and completed the preparations for the three to four months before the New Year, the procurement could have proceeded smoothly, right?" People from various regions all agreed. The new working methods, as in the recently announced rice and grain methods, do not contain a long list of ten or twenty articles, but only one article: "Quick and decisive." Now is no longer the time to calculate the age of a dead child. What we ask of the National Government and the rice control committee is: has the policy for this year's harvest been decided? Has the preparation for immediate implementation been completed? If the same mistakes as last year are made, no matter how perfect the policy is decided, it will be the same as giving medicine to a dead person. Someone said to the reporter: "Even if you are enthusiastic about preparing, it is useless." These are words that we must not ignore. According to last year's experience, even if the various agencies in the mainland complete all preparations and systems, the announced policy will make those preparations all useless. As a result, the people who cooperate in the preparatory work cannot gain the trust of the farmers.

### Director of the Third Department of Propaganda Issues Important Statement Clarifying the Concept of the Greater East Asia War

Hankou, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Since the Japanese army began operations in Henan in April, it has occupied Zhengzhou and Luoyang in succession with the force of a bamboo splitting, thoroughly smashing the Chongqing side's attempt. Last month, it launched operations in Hunan, and Changsha, the key point of Hunan Province, has now been captured by the elite Japanese army. This has greatly impacted the Chongqing side in terms of military affairs and economy. The Director of the Third Department of Propaganda of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army Headquarters, Mr. Mishina, gave a special statement on this matter. The contents are as follows:

The forward-deployed Expeditionary Army first attacked Luoyang and Shanxian, the important points of Henan, and opened up the Pinghan Railway, sweeping through the First War Zone of the anti-Japanese regime, destroying its main force. It then turned its attention to the southern region of the Yangtze River, attacking Changsha, the lock of Chongqing's defense of Hunan. In late May, with close cooperation between the army, navy, and air force, it carried out a surprise attack operation, and in a short period of time, it eliminated the main force of the Chongqing army in the Ninth War Zone in the surrounding areas. On June 18th, it completely captured Changsha, and is currently conducting mopping-up operations in the surrounding areas.

The mission of the Japanese Expeditionary Army is to use the justice of the Greater East Asia War to overthrow the Anglo-American imperialist forces that are sacrificing China to realize their ambitions of aggression in East Asia, to secure a strategic line of defense for the mainland, so that the Chinese nation can break away from Anglo-American oppression and aggression as soon as possible, move towards the path of liberation, and then complete the historical mission of unification and nation-building. Therefore, the war that has been shaking the mainland since this spring is based on the unwavering belief and active combat operations of the Japanese Expeditionary Army, which transcends the enemy's fragile psychology of all doubts, speculations, fears, and anxieties.

### Reality Shatters Illusion

As for the capture of cities and the destruction of resistance forces, the daily triumphs of war are not what the Japanese Expeditionary Army concerns itself with. However, there is something that must be clarified and warned about, both internally and externally, and that is the delusion and hope towards England, America, and Chongqing. Namely, that Japan's national power is exhausted due to entanglements and drains in the Pacific or Asian regions, losing its offensive capacity and falling into a state of exhaustion. The current operation serves as a solemn factual demonstration of this, a stern warning of iron and fire, using reality to shatter their illusions. "If the Japanese army in Asia is not completely annihilated, Japan cannot be defeated," a statement first made by the enemy general Nimitz. Subsequently, military commentators like Wien-Ta and special correspondents from American newspapers in Chongqing, such as Ato Kai En-Su, unanimously echoed this sentiment. However, upon closer examination of their words, although containing a significant amount of elements, it can be considered a clear and genuine call, further proving the Japanese Expeditionary Army's continental decisive battle posture and proactive position.

Looking at the battle line starting from the Northwest's Guanimen and Luoyang, far suppressing the fertile lands of Henan to Wuhan, and directly attacking Changsha in Hunan, the Expeditionary Army's mighty general war strength, with its outstanding mobile warfare strategy, is well-matched and methodical. As for Chongqing and the American air force, they have already seized their throat from the Northwest to Sichuan, controlling their fate.

### Revealing the True Essence of the Operation

Currently, wherever the Japanese Expeditionary Army goes in Henan and Hunan, their military operations are like a swift wind sweeping away withered leaves, and their governance of the people is like a spring breeze nurturing all things. Therefore, the children of Luoyang and the elders along the Pinghan Railway line offer water and gruel to welcome them, which is truly touching. The people of Hunan must also eagerly wish to escape the suffering of war. In the future, the people in various post-war areas will be able to live in peace and enjoy happiness. The Expeditionary Army has been fighting on the continent for seven years, experiencing countless hardships, but today its military appearance is solid, its strength is growing daily, and it can continue to advance. Wherever the Expeditionary Army goes today, the discipline is strict and orderly, so the people, unknowingly, replace all the unrealistic dreams and resentments of the past with new trust. When Commander-in-Chief Yan’s conversation was published during the signing of the Sino-Japanese alliance last autumn, it declared the fundamental spirit of the Expeditionary Army’s command. Therefore, the Expeditionary Army, from top to bottom, consistently upholds the fundamental concept of the continental war, and its true essence has been fully demonstrated in this operation.

### Revising Air Defense Regulations: Authorities Explain Significance: Announcement by the Japanese Army Air Defense Command

The Japanese Army Air Defense Command, noting that in the past, when alert warnings were issued in the city, vehicles did not stop, causing considerable traffic chaos, issued Notification No. 24 on the 20th to amend this. This amendment is because, after an alert warning is issued, detecting the movement of enemy aircraft relies on auditory perception, which is hindered by constant noise. Therefore, this amendment was made. Recognizing the importance of the matter, the Air Defense Command authorities issued a statement on the 22nd, explaining the significance of the amendment in detail as follows:

Item (B) of the notification stipulates that five minutes after the local alert warning is issued, cars and other vehicles may begin to travel at a speed of 20 miles or less, and pedestrians may resume walking, provided they do not hinder air defense work or cause traffic accidents. The term "local alert warning" is used because the sounding of alert sirens is not consistent throughout the city. Some sirens are not sounded until five minutes or more after the Air Defense Headquarters issues the alert. Therefore, the time when the local alert is issued is used as the standard. Because the time when local alerts are sounded varies, the time when traffic stops and resumes also varies, and may not coincide with the time when the Air Defense Command issues the alert. This must be noted. Pedestrians should follow the regulations in the notification and go to nearby shelters or the outer edges of roads immediately after the alert is issued.

Sometimes, an air raid warning may be sounded immediately without issuing an alert warning. In this case, noise and traffic control are even more necessary. All vehicles and pedestrians must stop traffic as before. Also, after an alert warning is issued, if there is no suitable shelter or air raid shelter nearby, pedestrians should return home quickly ten minutes after the local alert is issued. Furthermore, the authorities have repeatedly called attention to the fact that blackout measures are incomplete, and there are many light leaks, which is regrettable. Those who do not have blackout equipment should turn off the lights immediately after the alert is issued and not turn them on until the alert is lifted. Violators will have their electricity supply cut off as a minor warning. It is hoped that all citizens of Shanghai will be encouraged to fully understand the purpose of this notification, obey the command of the authorities, and strictly observe noise and traffic control.

### Japanese Minister Usami Hosts a Banquet for Mayor Chen: Guests Exchange Courtesies in Their Speeches

Minister Usami of the allied nation hosted a banquet for Mayor Chen and other municipal officials at the Broadway Mansion at 7:00 PM on the 31st. Representing the municipal government were Mayor Chen, Secretary-General Wu, Advisor Shen, and various bureau chiefs. Representing the embassy were Minister Usami, Consul-General Yano, Counselors Okazaki and Sakata, Clerks Okudo, Ogawa, Matsudaira, and Nakata, Investigator Tagitsu, Consul Fukuma, and others, totaling over 30 people. During the banquet, Minister Usami gave a speech, saying: “Our embassy has always received support, for which we are deeply grateful. Shanghai is the center of China's economy and culture, and also the place where Sino-Japanese relations are closely developed. I am very willing to make efforts in this role, and I hope that the mayor and everyone will give me more guidance. Tonight, I offer this glass of wine to express my respect, and I hope everyone will enjoy themselves.” The Mayor replied, saying, "I have often received invitations, but I have not had the opportunity. I am very happy to be invited tonight. I remember when I first met the Minister, it was in Tokyo. I have long admired the Minister's reputation and his aspirations for Sino-Japanese cooperation. I extend my warmest welcome to his post in Shanghai. Shanghai is currently in a difficult period, but fortunately, the administration has been unified. I am confident that close cooperation between China and Japan will overcome the difficulties. Recently, the city will be re-divided into districts. This has been discussed for a long time, and it is thanks to the Minister's assistance that it will soon be realized. I would like to express my gratitude here, and I wish you good health."

Special Silk Tax Office Expands Organization: The Special Silk Construction Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance, in order to manage the national silk construction special tax affairs, in order to enhance the special tax administration and enrich income, has been approved by the Ministry of Finance and passed by the Executive Yuan meeting to expand the scope of the group. The five branch offices under the jurisdiction of the office in Wuxi, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou are changed to District Collection Bureaus, and in Nanjing. Danyang. Three collection bureaus are added to each district in Wujiang. According to the amount of donations collected in each district, they are divided into one to three grades. The internal organization of each district collection bureau is divided into the first and second sections, which manage general affairs custody and special tax collection, cargo inspection and registration, and all other affairs. The candidates for the director have now been appointed, and it is scheduled to be changed and established on July 1.

### The Economic Bureau Orders Various Trade Associations to Donate Iron

In order to cooperate with the Greater East Asia War and strengthen the belief in certain victory, a citywide voluntary donation of scrap metal movement was launched. Since the launch, the people from all walks of life in the city have been enthusiastically donating. The Municipal Economic Bureau also specially convened all trade associations in the city yesterday afternoon to hold a symposium, at which the bureau explained that the original deadline was set for the end of this month. However, due to various reasons, the deadline was extended by ten days to July 10. There is no limit to the amount of donation, but no excuse for non-payment is allowed.

### Economic Security Office Explains Illegal Hoarding: Factories Increasing Production Will Not Be Punished

The Economic Security Office of the First Police Bureau, in order to crack down on illegal hoarding, issued a statement on the 19th of this month, with very detailed content. Its explanation of hoarding is that all industries or factories that hoard materials that are deemed to increase production during wartime will not be punished. However, those who attempt to monopolize the market for huge profits are not included in this exception. In addition, the patrol team of the office in plain clothes only investigates hoarding and does not exercise the power of detention. This refers specifically to the previous investigation of rice. Furthermore, plainclothes officers are also dispatched for other work, and they can exercise the power of detention. For fear of misunderstandings from all walks of life, a special explanation is given above.

### Rice Is Shipped to Shanghai Continuously: Market Prices Continue to Fall: Various Efforts to Transport Rice to Shanghai

Since various parties have made efforts to transport rice to Shanghai, the rice merchants have achieved considerable results in transportation, and the rice is continuously being shipped to Shanghai, and the price continues to fall. Details are as follows:

### Eleven Temporary Passport Offices

The general public’s enthusiastic rush to the Grain Control Committee to fill out application forms and obtain temporary certificates for moving more than five dou and less than ten shi of rice is overwhelming. From morning to night, the crowds are unbearable. The staff of the Third Section of the Transportation Office of the Association is extremely busy, and the procedures for issuing certificates are extremely fast, with the amount of certificates issued reaching over 120,000 shi per day.

The Shanghai District Temporary Passport Office of the Rice and Grain Control Committee has determined the location of the office at 11 locations: Hongqiao Road, Hu Min Road, Chang'an Road, Fuxing Road, Zhoujiaqiao, North Station, Jianghai Customs, Longhua Town, South Pier, Zhongshan Road, Guangxin Road, Jiangwan, etc., and appointed Tang Hongyi, Xian Xingnan, Tan Zanchen, Liu Zhisheng, Hong Sen, Takahashi Hiroshi, Tanaka Shigesaburo, Wang Zefang, Yun Shizhou, Sun Shaonong, Ojiko Sadano, Xu Yanpei, and others as directors. Each office has 6-7 staff members, and the Security Office sends security teams to various offices to maintain order. Because the crowds applying for certificates have been overwhelming in recent days, various offices will start issuing certificates within two or three days to facilitate the application of citizens and rice merchants.

### Revising the Price of Comprehensive Rationing

The price of rice for the Rice and Grain Control Committee, which was previously stipulated, differs too much from the cost of the rice recently purchased by rice merchants. In order to take into account the cost of rice merchants, a decision was made to increase the newly revised price several times to show understanding.

The Shanghai Special Municipal Government and the Rice Control Committee are actively planning the temporary measures for Shanghai's citizens' food management and are comprehensively formulating policies. Once everything is in place, it can be adjusted and implemented for rationing.

### Strict Investigation of Extortion Reduces Market Prices

According to recent reports from rice merchants dispatched to various places to purchase rice and residents from the suburbs of the city, there are still unscrupulous elements along the way who are making things difficult and attempting to extort money, which has a great impact on the transportation market price. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will pay attention to this and take effective measures to suppress it. There is a clear announcement from the Standing Committee that the transportation of rice by rice merchants is exempt from donations and taxes along the way. If there are any difficulties or extortion, they can report it to the Chongfu government and the Rice Control Committee at any time for investigation.

Rice merchants have begun to purchase rice in various suburbs of the city. Most of this rice is distributed to various rice shops for free sale. The quantity is very large. Yesterday, the rice transported into the city was extremely popular, especially in Zhoujiaqiao and North Station, where each place had 2,000 to 3,000 shi, with the total amount reaching 20,000 shi. As a result, the market price continued to fall. It is said that a large batch of rice arrived at the port yesterday, with eight guan being the price, and even peddlers bargained for around nine guan. According to general observations, if the rice purchased can continue to arrive in Shanghai daily, the market price is likely to continue to fall.

### Old Order Complete List Arrangement Method

The rice grain committee purchase of rice, the old order complete list sorting method, the food plan has been drafted and reported to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation published later: 凡 All procurement vendors have an order and have not yet delivered the goods in full shall be sorted out in accordance with this method. A. Those who have an order to receive funds, but have not delivered any rice so far, shall be limited to deliver half of the rice by July 15, and deliver the full amount by August 15. B. Those who have an order, receive funds, and have already delivered half of the rice, regardless of whether they continue to borrow the second half of the funds or not, shall be limited to August 15 to deliver the full amount of their order. In order to sympathize with the merchants' difficulties, all procurement merchants who have not been able to pay off their order in full may apply for a certificate to transport rice to Shanghai. They will transport the rice to Shanghai, and 40% of the rice will be used to offset the number of orders, and the remaining 60% of the rice may be sold in the Shanghai area at the market price. (The purchase price is still the original public price and the allocation of 30% of materials, and transportation costs will be subsidized when transporting to Shanghai). If the procurement merchants cannot complete the clearing according to the first clause by the due date, they shall be dealt with in accordance with the following methods. A. If the item in the first clause has not been paid in full by July 15, the order procurement merchant will be transferred to the relevant local government or court for punishment in accordance with the law, and the guarantor of the merchant will be severely punished for delivering the rice. If the rice cannot be delivered by August 15, the guarantor will be subject to joint and several punishment, and will be sent to the relevant local government or court to seize the rice, or seal and sell the property of the procurement merchant and the guarantor to compensate for the number, calculated according to the local market price of rice. B. If the item in the first clause has not been paid in full by August 15, the procurement merchant will be transferred to the local court for detention and urged the guarantor to pay the rice. If the rice cannot be delivered by September 30, the guarantor will be transferred to the court for arrest and prosecution, or the property of both the procurement merchant and the guarantor will be sealed and sold to compensate for the loss. The number shall be calculated according to the local market price of rice. After the procurement merchant signs the contract, if the procurement merchant himself is not responsible, but difficulties arise due to other reasons, and he cannot fulfill the contract, after reporting to the Association for verification and verification, the joint punishment method may be reduced and approved separately. This method is presented to the Executive Yuan

### A Glimpse of the European Landing Battle

The Launch of the Invasion

On the 6th of this month, at 1:00 AM, British and American airborne commandos landed on the coast of France north of the Kessel Island. At 1:30 AM, the British 1st and 6th Airborne Divisions landed between the Havre-Orne River estuary. The American 8th, 2nd, and 101st Airborne Divisions landed between the Orne River estuary and Cherbourg, aiming to secure landing points. The points of attack were at Barfleur, Carentan, Isigny, and Tourlaville.

On the other hand, the anti-Axis fleet, covering the landing troops, was assembled between the English Channel and Kessel Island. At 5:30 AM, amid thundering barrage, landing craft groups and airborne troops of the Anglo-American forces surged toward various locations. The German defense forces swiftly and calmly launched a counterattack, engaging the naval fleet with coastal artillery and torpedo boat squadrons. On the ground, on the same day before noon, the airborne commandos in the Barfleur, Seine River, and Orne River areas were annihilated. By dusk, the anti-Axis forces between Kessel Island and the Havre-Cherbourg area were either annihilated or forced back to sea, with only a portion of the landing forces remaining in a small area 20 kilometers wide and 2 kilometers deep near Alemanni on the banks of the Orne River.

According to a communiqué from the German Führer's headquarters, the enemy's landing operation on the northern coast of Normandy, between the ports of Havre and Cherbourg, has been covered by naval fire since the morning of the 7th. Many airborne commandos who landed behind the fortresses aimed to support the landing operation and prevent German reinforcements, but they suffered heavy losses upon landing due to anti-aircraft fire and were cleared out after a short interception. The enemy forces that landed from the sea successfully gained footholds at several locations. However, most of the bridgeheads that were built were destroyed by German counterattacks, and the coast was littered with the wreckage of landing craft.

Fierce fighting is currently underway at the mouth of the Orne River and north of Carentan, and the enemy forces holding the bridgeheads are being pressured by German forces.

Furthermore, on the morning of the 6th, German torpedo boats attacked the enemy's main fleet in the Bay of Seine.

The Terrain of Normandy

The Normandy peninsula in northern France is named after the Normans, who invaded across the dangerous waves of the North Sea over a thousand years ago. The Normandy region faces the English Channel, with a hilly area approximately 200 to 150 meters high from the Bay of Mont-Saint-Michel to the Bresle River. The cultivated fields are vast, the villages are sparse, and the valleys are hidden in the forests. From January to September, the slopes of the mountains are covered with snow-white apple blossoms, making for a beautiful and pleasant scenery.

The coastline consists of gray-white cliffs, like screens, below which are steep rocky reefs, stretching narrowly. The estuaries of the Seine River and the Vire River, etc., all gather in the trumpet-shaped Bay of Seine, connecting to Cherbourg, an area of flat terrain with white sand and green pines, making it an excellent place for landing. If the enemy establishes a bridgehead in the Normandy peninsula and advances into the interior of Europe, then advancing into the Paris Basin from here would be ideal. Moreover, the road network here is well-connected, which can be utilized, making it the best place for the German mobile forces to be active.

The Seine River and the Paris Basin meander between the fingers. From Rouen, the Seine River communicates with Le Havre. The Seine River to the suburbs of Paris is also navigable by small vessels, so there is reason for the enemy to choose this as a landing site. Le Havre is located at the mouth of the Seine River, serving as the outer port of Paris. It is one of France's leading ports, with a population of 158,000, accounting for a quarter of France's national trade before the war. The streets are wide and there are many beautiful views, and it is considered a modern city among the antique cities.

Cherbourg is located at the northern end of the Normandy peninsula, connecting Calais and Dieppe, serving as a key port for controlling the strait closest to England. Louis X had already planned to establish it as a naval port during his reign, and Napoleon built it into a large-scale naval port, making it a famous naval port in France. The nearby Cotentin coast is humid, with continuous green fields and thriving livestock farming.

Caen is a quiet hilly area south of the Seine River, with an elevation of less than 100 meters. With a plain at its center, it was only engaged in animal husbandry until the beginning of this century. After coal was discovered in the south, it leaped to become an industrial center, and the population also exceeded 50,000. There are many stone buildings on the streets, and relics of medieval architecture such as the Abbey of Saint-Étienne and the Château de Caen still remain.

The islands of Jersey and Guernsey, where the landing forces were completely annihilated by the German forces, are the largest islands in the Channel Islands. Geographically, they are close to the Normandy peninsula and were under British control before this war. Jersey has an area of 28 square miles and a population of 5,000, while Guernsey has an area of 16 square miles and a population of over 4,000. Although they are British territories, they are fully immersed in French culture, and the local customs are completely Frenchified. The south coast of Jersey has a large bay and beautiful sandy beaches, and London tourists flock here to escape the cold in winter.

Enemy Commanders

The Supreme Commander of the anti-Axis forces in the European offensive campaign is the American General Eisenhower, with the British General Tedder as the deputy commander. Below them are the commanders of the land, sea, and air forces. The background of each person is briefly described below:

Eisenhower is 54 years old and was born in Texas, USA. He grew up as a farmer in the Kansas cornfields during his youth. Judging from his surname, his ancestors were actually Germans who immigrated to the United States. He graduated from Kansas University, the Army Infantry Warfare School, the Army War College, and the Engineering Department. He initially had no reputation, but was later valued by General MacArthur, the commander of the Philippines, and appointed as his chief of staff, thus showing his talent. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, he was recalled to Washington and appointed as the Deputy Chief of the Operations Planning Division of the US General Staff, dedicating himself to drafting the plans for the North African landing. In June 1941, he was appointed as the US Commander of Operations in Europe, and in November of the same year, he was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa, achieving fame in one fell swoop. His personality is brave and resolute, as can be seen from his decision to choose the most heavily defended European fortress for the landing.

Tedder is 55 years old and graduated from the History Department of Cambridge University. He entered the Air Force Department from army service. In 1936, he was appointed as the British Far East Commander, and the following year as the Middle East Air Force Commander. Since 1941, he has served as the Air Force Commander in the Mediterranean region and is also known for his role in the North African campaign. In February last year, at Tedder's suggestion, the British Air Force Department established a new "Operational Air Force Unit" and a "Strategic Air Force Unit" within the Coastal Air Force Command to conduct organized bombing of Europe. As a result of this opportunity, he was appointed as the Deputy Commander of the European Invasion Force.

The Commander of the land forces of the European Invasion Force, British General Montgomery, is known for his "steadiness." He is 58 years old, born in Ireland, and suffered defeat in the Battle of Dunkirk four years ago, but he became prominent again after the end of the North African campaign.

The Naval Commander, British Admiral Ramsay, comes from a distinguished family and has served as the Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies Fleet. In the current operation in northern France, he commands the fleets of Britain, the United States, Canada, as well as the fleets of the exiled governments of Norway, Poland, the Netherlands, France, and Greece.

German Ingenious Tactics

The German army had made thorough preparations before the launch of the landing battle in Western Europe. It is said that when Field Marshal Rommel, the overall commander of the German army in Europe, once inspected the northern coast of France, he only saw green pastures and miscellaneous flowers growing, and he could not help but exclaim "Wonderful!" The accompanying staff were all surprised, and Field Marshal Rommel turned to his subordinates and said, "Wonderful, beneath these flowers, 80,000 landmines are buried, waiting for the arrival of the enemy." This is one of the ingenious tactics of the Germans. Since the start of the invasion, new and unusual German weapons have emerged one after another. After landing, the anti-Axis air forces have been detonating mines in succession, and the flames have soared into the sky, like a fiery hell. The enemy is using air forces on a large scale this time, which the German side estimates to be four to six divisions strong, with a formation extending up to eighty kilometers. Most of these air forces are transported by large gliders, but more than a thousand of them have been shot down by the German army. (Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun on June 8, 9, 10, and 12)

### The Opening of the Beijing-Hankou Railway

After the Japanese army in North China began its offensive in the Henan Plain, in less than ten days, on May 9, they opened the entire Beijing-Hankou Railway line, a link in the continental longitudinal railway. This operation was even larger in scale and planning than the Battle of Xuzhou and the Battle of Wuhan. After waiting for seven years since the incident, it has finally been realized. Previously, the northern section of the Beijing-Hankou line from Beijing to Xinxiang had already been operated by the Japanese side. The southern section of the Beijing-Hankou line between Hankou and Xinyang had also been restored. The section newly repaired by the Japanese side is the approximately 350-kilometer section between Xinxiang and Xinyang. It is rumored that the tracks and all railway equipment in that section were taken away to the interior by the Russians. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway line is a zone connecting Central China and North China, which is extremely important not only militarily but also politically and economically. The Japanese army in Central China and North China joined hands in Queshan, which is a fatal blow to the Chongqing army that is responding to the Pacific offensive and counterattacking on the mainland.

The US seems to be increasingly exerting malicious economic pressure on both countries in Northern Europe.

Britain Stops Issuing Navigation Certificates: A dispatch from London: According to news from the London merchant shipping industry, the British government has stopped issuing sea certificates to ships from the neutral countries of Spain, Portugal, and Switzerland from the 2nd.

### Construction Song

— Jiang Feng

"Hey yo... Ai yo, Hang... yo!"

On this vast expanse of ruins, the rhythm of labor is clear and melodious.

"Ai yo, Hey yo... Hang... yo!"

On this desolate land, the sacred call is passionate.

We, tens of millions of workers, shoulder the mission of history, bear the burden of the times, and hold firm confidence: united in heart and effort, continuing our efforts, with the same goal – to rebuild the shattered mansion on this desolate square!

Day and night, month after month, year after year, forgetting entertainment, forgetting rest, regardless of the scorching summer or the freezing winter, we are always - as busy as bees, working like ants.

We know: how arduous and vast the reconstruction project is; we know: how long it will take to complete the vast project; we know: that we who labor must also endure patiently; we know even more: that if we fall, the younger generation will follow closely behind...

"Hey yo... Ai yo, Hang yo... Hang yo, carrying bricks and moving earth, building and laying foundations. Foundations are solid and deep, work is firm and solid... Working hard, working stubbornly, working diligently. Wait, on the desolate ruins, a towering mansion will finally stand tall!

### Preliminary Remarks Before the Public Performance of the National Music Research Association

— Hai Yan

Shanghai can be said to be a city with the most intense musical atmosphere. Compared with other parts of the country, Shanghai citizens have the highest level of interest and appreciation for music. However, since the influx of European culture, Shanghai, which has always been at the forefront of trends, has seen its people immerse themselves in the study of Western music, while the essence of our country's inherent music has become increasingly obscure and unfamiliar. There is little talk of research and improvement, let alone its promotion and development! Currently, general music schools teach only Western music, and so-called musicians all carry violins and play pianos, naturally performing only Western tunes.

In fact, Chinese ancient music, in the course of world music history, can be considered to have developed very early. As early as the Zhou and Qin dynasties, it was listed as one of the Six Arts. By the Tang and Song dynasties, it flourished greatly due to the advocacy of emperors. However, as it has been passed down to the present, because there has been no improvement in the areas of musical notation theory and instrument construction, the essence of the national quintessence has not been preserved, and there is a tendency for it to be lost, which is all the more regrettable.

Every country's music has its own unique national character, and Chinese music naturally has its own unique style. Although we can try our best to abandon shortcomings and adopt strengths, and adopt the forms and techniques of Western music, we must preserve the essence of national music that is representative of our national character!

The characteristic of national music lies in its richness of Eastern sentiment. Its timbre is beautiful, its melodies are both elegant and popular, and its expression of emotions is even more beautiful and graceful. Through the sublime and refined performance of string and wind instruments, it can often unleash a profound power of touching people, stirring up resonance within people's hearts, and exchanging emotions. If we were to symbolize music with colors, then the symphonies of Western music are multi-colored, colorful, while national music is pure, elegant, and rich in the gentle, indifferent, tranquil beauty of sky blue! - Of course, this does not mean that national music is purely composed of quiet melodies. For example, ancient marching songs also have many that are majestic and magnificent, and the splendor, grandeur, and excitement expressed in imperial court music can also rival Western symphonies. In addition, the cries of the people from the streets and alleys, the sufferings of the people, are often conveyed through string and wind instruments in melodies that touch people's hearts. How can national music not be popular and accessible music?

Now, I am happy to report to everyone a piece of good news - the National Music Research Association, in response to the requests of various circles, has decided to hold a public performance at the Lyceum Theatre on the 28th and 29th of this month from 5:30 to 7:30! The National Music Research Association has gathered more than a dozen members who are committed to amateur study with the preservation of national music as their responsibility, and their footprints have even reached overseas, with the intention of promoting national glory. The chairman, Mr. Sun Yu, has humbly researched and explored the ancient music of our country. His musical talent and skills have especially enhanced the association. Its previous public performances have been highly praised by the audience. This time, they will continue their efforts and perform wonderful famous pieces. Mr. Ye Daquan and Ms. Zhao Yuyu will be invited to perform the traditional Wudang swordsmanship, and Ms. Shen Shuqin will sing to add to the fun. It is hoped that this will universally awaken the people's understanding of national music and their interest in studying it together, so that national music can shine brightly on the world's music stage!

### Meteor

— Zhu Jingqing

That which shone with faint light in space, a star, has clearly fallen. It has carved a mark in the azure sky, saying: this is life. And then it immediately disappears without a trace. Star! You have only begun the first journey of life, but it is also the last. Your faint light will shine on the night travelers in the wilderness, but who will pity the passing of your life?

### Sports The Rise of Volleyball Matches in Season and Their Contribution to this Year's League

In recent years, ball sports in Shanghai have shown a thriving trend, reaching a prosperous autumn. The large number of spectators at each match is proof of this. Even the recently concluded basketball and football games, which were past their season, still caused a sensation. This further proves that promoting sports is originally intended to strengthen the physique of the people and cultivate their spirit of perseverance. It should be carried out regardless of the weather. However, it is always necessary to conform to the season in order to avoid deviating from the original purpose and even harming the body, which would be ideal.

The volleyball league has emerged in season and will soon begin on July 2nd at the Qingnian Hui in Ruixian Bridge. Volleyball matches, after changes, have developed equally with football. Every match is extremely exciting, but unfortunately, their level has not yet improved. We can recall the fierce attacks of Cao Tingzan, Qiu Guang, and Wei Ding, as well as the wonderful sets and spikes of Zhou Dayun and Li Lianze. Such miraculous skills cannot be seen again today. Even those who are currently dominating the volleyball scene are generally veterans such as Tan Yongzhan, Jiang Deyuan, and Guo Bingkun, who are famous for a while, but later generations cannot reach their level. The same is true for women's volleyball. If Huang Xingfen has been playing for more than ten years and has not been surpassed, and Li Bo has had children but is still not inferior to others, it shows that there are no successors. In this year's volleyball league, all the heroes are sharpening their swords and preparing to show their skills. We sincerely hope that in addition to the grand occasion, the most important thing is to improve the level. This point is indeed very complex and has many reasons. In short, if we can pay attention to the following two points, it will be helpful.

### Venue

Regarding the volleyball venue, some say that indoor is better than outdoor, while others say that outdoor is more suitable than indoor. Each has its own reasons, and it is difficult to judge. However, in my opinion, it should be outdoor. The most obvious point is that in the hot summer weather, being confined to a room, especially with many spectators, is not a healthy practice. Let us recall the previous Hongyi Cup competition, which was also held on an outdoor playground. It was held at night, with electric lights installed, providing sufficient light and spacious surroundings, making it easier to perform. Unfortunately, due to current electricity restrictions, this may be difficult to achieve. It is best to hold this year's league outdoors. In this way, the venue will be wide, the air will be sufficient, and the players will be able to invigorate their spirits and perform excellently. But at this time and in this place, I wonder if this wish can be fulfilled?

### Referee

The role of the referee is the most important in all ball games. In tense matches, the outcome can be manipulated by the referee's words. Volleyball is no exception, and even more so than other ball games. This is because balls such as net touches and double hits can be misunderstood and cannot be protested. Recently, in a volleyball friendly match, the reporter witnessed a referee making numerous mistakes, which caused the players' fighting spirit to dissipate and the performance to decline from a high level. This was indeed due to the referee's incompetence, which led to the poor performance. This phenomenon has been seen repeatedly in the past. Therefore, it is hoped that the referee committee will pay special attention to this matter.

Finally, the reporter learned about the current situation of the teams and recorded it briefly.

The men's Group A includes Yuehua, Huaying, Zhongbei, the White Team, and the Yong'an Team, who are all preparing vigorously. However, personnel issues are still uncertain and need to be resolved through negotiations. As far as we know, Yuehua is the most well-organized, with Guo Bingkun, Ma Canxi, Chen Xueshui, Jin Huanzhong, and Ze Jianzhen all on the list. If there are no changes in the future, the team will have great hope. As for the Zhongbei and Huaying teams, there are many overlapping selections, which will depend on the official registration.

Women's Group A The Green Team has been established in response to the trend after winning the basketball and field hockey championships. Looking closely at the list, it is indeed ambitious to win the championship. Veterans such as Huang Xingfang and Zhu Shifang have reportedly returned. It can be seen that the team has the ambition to collect all the championships in the competition, which is admirable! However, the teams from the Three Provinces and Huada are also extraordinary. I dare say that this year's women's performance may have a slight improvement. I hope that the teams will train hard and discover new talents, which would be fortunate! The seven members of Ke Bulinji, Que Libotuo, Sasha Kejin, Yelong, and Ao Chailiao have left the team.

### Xiqing Tactics

Xiqing continues to use its usual style, using man-to-man marking, relying on its height, strength, and agility, which gives them a considerable advantage. Every shot must wait for the tall Founick to guard the enemy's basket before the ball is passed. Then, in case of a miss, Founick can catch it and shoot again. At the same time, Que Libotuo and others take the opportunity to advance and prepare to fight for the rebound, making it difficult for the opponent to take it away.

### Commentary on the Final Match Between Zhongqing and Xiqing in the Charity Basketball Game for This Newspaper's Scholarship Fund

The basketball teams of the Chinese Youth Association and the Western Overseas Chinese Youth Association held a charity basketball game to raise funds for this newspaper's scholarship fund. It was held last Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in the gymnasium of the Ruixian Bridge Youth Association, using a best-of-three system. In the first two games, each side won one game, and the battle situation has been recorded in the previous issue of this publication. The 16th was the final battle to determine the winner, and both sides were unwilling to give in because of their reputation. The audience also believed that Zhongqing's defeat in the second game (Zhongqing won the first game 23-18, and Xiqing won the second game 29-11) was too miserable and that they must avenge their shame. Knowing that there would be a fierce battle, the venue was extremely crowded that night.

Both Squads

Zhongqing made improper adjustments in the second game, resulting in a disastrous defeat. For this game, the deployment of troops was particularly cautious. After discussions between team leader Zhang Huixiang and captain Yu Hongzi, it was decided to select the five main generals from Hualian: Fan Qinggong, Xi Lin, Zhang Xianlun, Wu Chengzhang, and Ma Canxi from Renyu. This lineup was maintained throughout the game, and they finally won. Zhang and others made great contributions. Xiqing still used the seven members of Kaixuan, Miluofu, Founick, Taobolin, Ge Que, Que Libotuo, Sasha Sijin, Yelong, and Ao Chailiao, taking turns to play.

Xiqing Tactics

Xiqing continues to use its usual style, using man-to-man marking, relying on its height, strength, and agility, which gives them a considerable advantage. Every shot must wait for the tall Founick to guard the enemy's basket before the ball is passed. Then, in case of a miss, Founick can catch it and shoot again. At the same time, Que Libotuo and others take the opportunity to advance and prepare to fight for the rebound, making it difficult for the opponent to take it away.

Zhongqing's Offense and Defense

Zhongqing adopted a zone defense that day. When defending, they used a man-to-man style within the zone defense. In the first half, the offensive was slightly dull. After getting the ball, they failed to launch a surprise attack and go straight to the heart of the enemy. Often, after a slight hesitation, the opponent had already deployed a tight defense, making it difficult to penetrate the enemy camp. In the second half, they were much more agile. The defensive method seemed to have been carefully planned. Fan Qinggong used a zigzag pattern to disrupt Xiqing's offensive. Wu Chengzhang always guarded the tall Founick, sometimes blocking him behind the board and sometimes pulling him out of the circle, causing the ball-holder to be afraid to shoot easily, thus slowing down the action. Unfortunately, when Xiqing attacked, Wu Chengzhang pulled Founick away, and his position was too far back, failing to form a quincunx formation. Otherwise, one person could block two enemies, and Fan Qinggong and Zhang Xianlun would not have been so exhausted.

Key to Victory or Defeat

Basketball is originally a sport that requires both intelligence and courage. Looking at this game, Xiqing had plenty of courage and strength, but lacked intelligence. Therefore, their defense and offense, in addition to following the old methods of man-to-man marking and zigzag attacks, had no new tricks. On the other hand, Zhongqing was able to learn from others' strengths and compensate for their weaknesses, and fully demonstrated the unique spirit of basketball, making it difficult to defeat the enemy (the final score was 25-20). The fact that Xiqing had very few ball possessions that day was also one of the reasons for their failure. In the first half, they only had possession for seven minutes, and in the second half, they only had six or seven minutes.

Audience Attitude

During the game, the referee's responsibility is extremely important. However, the audience's attitude is also very important. For example, according to惯例 (custom) , when Zhongqing gets a free throw, the side with more people can use several balls to practice. On this day, there were more than a dozen people in Zhongqing's three teams, and each person only had one chance, resulting in inaccurate throws. Whenever Zhongqing got a free throw, the audience shouted encouragement, which made the thrower feel uneasy and trembling. It is not surprising that only four out of fifteen were successful. Until the end of the game, some people shouted, "Teach them slowly!" "Don't rush!" "It's almost over!" It seemed to lose the demeanor of a civilized country that cherishes etiquette.

Essence of Basketball

I believe that it is necessary to correct the individual skills of basketball players in Shanghai. The organization of basketball emphasizes that individuals can work together and help each other, forming a group of excellent players, which is the essence of basketball. Ma Canxi's strength lies in this, and the score should not be used as the only criterion for evaluation. Therefore, in European and American basketball games, it is not a matter of which team is playing against which team, but of which coach is playing against which coach. While players are responsible for charging and fighting, there is someone else in the command tent who is planning the strategy.

### Sports News

The Western Overseas Chinese Youth Association in this city has now been renamed the East Asia Association. Mr. Ke Jiemilov, the person in charge of the association's sports director, the giant Yenuoke, has resigned and is said to be going to work in the sports department of the University of Yue.

Due to water and electricity issues, most swimming pools are now rarely open. The Hongkou Park swimming pool, which usually opens in mid-May every year, is already June and there is still no news. Zhangyuan has become a calcium factory. Although Zhongqing is open, the pool is small and crowded. Other private swimming pools in schools are not worth mentioning.

Football and basketball are now out of season. In addition to swimming, summer sports include tennis and softball. Unopened tennis balls are worth 20,000 yuan a dozen. It is said that in the near future, domestically produced tennis balls will be available, which is good news for tennis players.

The Softball League is held annually by the Western Overseas Chinese, with students from Yue University and its affiliated high school accounting for the majority of Chinese participants. There are only two women's teams: Yizhong and Kangai. Since last year, the Philippine Yangqin team has held a Group A league at Jiaozhou Park, charging 2,000 yuan per team this summer. It is recently heard that the Shanghai Sports Association authorities want to hold a city-wide softball league in the racecourse. If this can be achieved, then the sport is expected to develop universally, as the racecourse has been the center of stickball and softball activities for many years. (Ke)

In addition to the basketball association, the team, and all related parties, Mr. Zhang Xiangxiang, manager of Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory, and Liang Zhao'an and Chen Yilin of the Zhongqing Sports Department, have contributed greatly to the charity basketball game for this newspaper's scholarship fund.
