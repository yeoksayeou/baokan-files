### Psychological Wartime System

Mr. Tokutomi Sohō, a veteran of the Japanese press, published an essay entitled "A Moment of Emergency," which was translated and published in this newspaper yesterday. The most important sentence in it is the wartime system of mind and reason. He said, "As long as there is spirit, knowledge, and courage, I will go forward even if there are tens of millions of people." It turns out that the power of the spirit, as the ancient Chinese saying goes, where sincerity reaches, metal and stone will open, is higher than all material power and is the guide of all material power.

What is a wartime system psychologically? First, we must firmly believe that this Greater East Asia War is a revolutionary liberation war, and victory is beyond doubt. Second, we must understand that this is an arduous war that requires extreme endurance, perseverance, and hard work. In other words, the psychological wartime system consists first of confidence in victory and second of determination to work. Without confidence in victory, there can be no enthusiasm for work, and without determination to work, there can be no final victory.

Shanghai is a city with the most rumors. All kinds of rumors are most likely to shake the public's beliefs and affect the public's efforts at work. However, Shanghai is the center of Chinese culture and economy. The psychological changes of the general public in Shanghai and the efforts they put into their work are all related to the overall situation. Now that the situation is becoming more and more serious and rumors are increasing, the impact is even greater. Because of this problem, we are extremely anxious. We are concerned about the future of the East Asian situation, and we are even more willing to use our greatest strength to awaken the citizens of Shanghai to create a wartime system psychologically.

At present, the most important thing is that those with confidence should contact the public at all times and use their own confidence to awaken mutual trust among the public, and from mutual trust among the public, progress to mutual assistance among the public. Wasn't Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution first started by one initiator, slowly gathering many comrades, and then gaining the support and cooperation of the public to succeed? If you are not firm in your confidence, then don't think about the success of your career, and don't think about others' trust. You should immediately withdraw from the front line and not hinder others' progress. If you have a strong sense of confidence, you should stand up and use your own psychological wartime system to transform everyone's psychological wartime system.

Secondly, those with the determination to work hard now need to show their work to everyone, lead by example, and move forward bravely. The development of the situation may still encounter more difficult situations, but the progress of work should be more diligent because of the difficulties. The performance of work is by no means a matter of words or papers, but all real achievements that are beneficial to the country and the nation. To hope that others are determined to work hard, you must first set an example of working hard yourself. In this way, those above will lead first, and those below will naturally follow. The principle of success in a career is nothing more than this: one person's determination to work hard can motivate many people's determination to work hard, and the determination to work hard of a few people can motivate the determination to work hard of the entire society.

The last five minutes of a long-term war are the most tense situation, but the justice of those engaged in the liberation struggle will eventually eliminate the ambition of the invaders, and the continuous efforts of the liberation fighters will eventually lead to the natural collapse of the invaders. Mr. Tokutomi said, "As long as we have determination, we are not afraid of anyone, and nothing is worrying."

### Land and Air Battles on Omiya Island; More Than a Thousand Enemy Troops Annihilated; Japanese Troops Hold Defensive Line Northeast of Akashi Bay

Central News Agency from a certain base in the mid-Pacific: The Japanese garrison on Omiya Island is currently engaged in a bloody land and air battle with the enemy. Among them, the spirit of the company led by Lieutenant Ishii of the Army fighting bravely against the enemy is most admirable. Since Lieutenant Ishii and his men landed on Akashi Bay on the island, they have been fighting alone to stop the enemy from advancing for six days and nights, causing the enemy to suffer as many as a thousand casualties. At the same time, Ishii's troops also fell one after another, so the enemy continued to suffer casualties, and finally almost reached a state of complete annihilation, but they still fought bravely to defend the stockade. They are currently preparing a new front-line command unit active in the northeast of Akashi Bay.

### Japanese Navy Secures Waterway Transportation on Xiang River; Battle of Hengyang Reaches Climax

Central News Agency from a certain front-line base of the Japanese army on the 6th: The Japanese naval forces assisting in the Hunan operation have now secured the waterway from Dongting Lake to the Xiang River, making a great contribution to the rear transportation of the army. On July 7, the Xiang River retrograde unit even went directly to Hengyang, the focus of the Hunan operation. Securing the waterway ensures that the army does not have to worry about the rear. On June 6 and 17, the Yujun strongholds along the Xiang River in Yingtian and Jinggang were first suppressed. The elite of the retrograde unit has opened up more than 300 kilometers of waterways in more than 40 days since the start of the operation, and the Yujun has tried to obstruct it in various ways. In mid-July, hundreds of Yu-American aircraft attacked along the Xiang River. Also in that month, the Japanese army disposed of more than 100 mines laid by the Yujun. Recently, due to the activity of the army's air force, the YU-American air force's actions have been completely suppressed. The Japanese naval forces are now on high alert to ensure the waterway.

Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th: The battle for Hengyang has reached its climax. As the Japanese army's offensive intensifies, the Yujun seems to feel that it is approaching the final moment, and has recently repeatedly revealed lamentations about defending Hengyang. According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing on the 4th, a Yujun affairs officer said that the situation in Hengyang city was still chaotic. Due to the fierce hand-to-hand combat that has lasted for more than a month, the Yujun corpses were lying everywhere, and there was no time to bury and transport them, causing a foul odor. The Yu reinforcements are continuing to reinforce Hengyang from the southwest, west, and north, and their vanguard troops have reached a location four kilometers away from Hengyang. Because the Japanese army has opened up Changsha and Hengshan, and a large army is advancing southward, it is expected that it will launch another large-scale attack soon.

### Japanese Wings Political Association Strengthens Cooperation with Government

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: After Mr. Kobayashi, an admiral of the Navy, succeeded as the president of the Japanese Wings Political Association, the progress of the association's affairs will be further strengthened due to President Kobayashi's detached determination. The association plans to hold a general meeting of members, at which President Kobayashi will express his views, which will surely give the members exceptional inspiration. In addition, President Kobayashi plans to start by reorganizing the personnel structure, and then use the full power of the Wings Political Association to cooperate closely with the government, shoulder the heavy responsibility of wartime political associations, and move toward victory. Under this major turning point, what the Wings Political Association wants from the government is to clarify the government's policy direction to China and foreign countries. The reason is that the Japanese people's hearts have been renewed and the united Koiso-Yonai coalition cabinet has emerged. It is time to take this opportunity to show the empire's unwavering determination to the outside world and make 100 million people rise up together internally. At this time, the two houses of nobility and衆議院 can also show their determination to support the government in the people's place of production, and at the same time, they can represent the people to actively launch public discussion with the government to fulfill the reality of supporting貴。

### Japanese Industrial Council Decides on Three Policies

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: In order to meet the urgent needs of wartime, the Japan Important Industry Association has formulated three policies under the close combination of operations and production, in order to sign and command the highest level of wartime production: Establish the function of the Wartime Production Design Headquarters. Utilize the knowledge and experience of the industrial world and stimulate a high degree of production will. Strengthen and apply air defense countermeasures. On the 5th, the main points were presented to the government, and efforts were made to recruit outstanding talents from the government and the people, as well as representatives from the control associations or other industrial departments, to jointly strike the army and navy's unified operations, to establish production plans, and to comprehensively determine the policies for production and distribution, and to adjust the combined procurement and sales procedures, as the basic purpose. The assertion that the function of the Wartime Production Design Headquarters should be established is very noteworthy.

### Beiping New People's Association Holds Advisory Meeting

Central News Agency, Beijing, 5th: The general meeting of the New People's Association-affiliated Advisory Meeting was held at the New People's Association Public Residence in Dongjiaomin Lane, Beiping, starting at 10 a.m. on the 5th. Under the participation of Supreme Advisor Iwamatsu and representatives of various related military and civilians, various discussions were held.

### Youth Labor Camp Entrance Ceremony Today

Central News Agency, Ba, 6th: The second phase of training for the youth summer labor life camp of the New National New Movement Promotion Committee, with more than 100 male and female vocational youths from various provinces and cities, have arrived in Beijing one after another and completed the registration and entry procedures. It is learned that the camp will hold individual talks on the 6th, review the student survey forms separately, and decide on the matters of the captains and vice-captains at all levels. The entrance ceremony will be held at 5 a.m. on the 7th, and Deputy Camp Director Xu Xiqing will personally preside over it to show the grand occasion.

### National Textbook Planned to Increase Price by Two Times

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th: The national textbooks compiled by the Ministry of Education have been entrusted to the Shanghai China United Publishing Company for printing, and it is expected that they can be sold before the opening of schools. Now, due to the lack of newspaper sources and high prices on the black market, the company plans to increase the original price by two times. In view of the imminent opening of schools, the Ministry of Education believes that the sale of textbooks is a matter of urgency, so it is discussing the above issues with the company in order to ensure that they can be sold to schools across the country for application by the end of August.

### Japanese Koiso New Cabinet Completes First Goal and Advances Toward Breaking Through the Battle Situation

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: In order to closely coordinate with the Army and Navy General Staff Headquarters, the Japanese government abolished the liaison meeting that had always been heard by the government's General Headquarters on the 5th, and established the Supreme War Guidance Conference to determine the fundamental policy for guiding the war and adjust the military and political strategies. Thus, the first goal of the new cabinet's formation was completed that day. From now on, the Japanese government will concentrate all its efforts to complete the war. Before long, emergency and important measures to respond to the decisive battle situation will be quickly established and implemented. The Japanese government's policy is almost as stated by Prime Minister Koiso and Navy Minister Yonai in the cabinet meeting a few days ago. It lies in boosting morale, clarifying public opinion, rapidly increasing air force combat power, and emphasizing the strengthening and simplification of state affairs, seeking to increase military production and leapfrog food production. That is, to clarify the determination to complete the war and move toward breaking through the battle situation.

### Profile of Japan's New Prime Minister, General Koiso

Inclusiveness

General Koiso Kuniaki, in his demeanor as a politician, is full of courage and practical power to advance if he can advance and act if he can act. On the other hand, he has an inclusive and inclusive power, which is an indispensable element for politicians, and is possessed by his nature. He has accumulated meritorious service in the army and has been tempered. He has served as the Vice Minister of the Army and the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. During the Manchurian Incident and the founding of Manchuguo, he was a pioneer in building a new order in East Asia. He then served as the commander of the Korean Army and twice as the Minister of Colonial Affairs. His political skills were well received in the central government. His achievements as the Governor-General of Korea for the past two years have consolidated the general's political position.

Tiger of Korea

General Koiso is from Yamagata Prefecture and is 65 years old this year. He graduated from Yamagata Middle School, the 12th term of the Army Officer School. He was a classmate of Generals Sugiyama Gen, Yan Junroku, Yanagawa Heisuke, Ninomiya Jiju, and Ushijima Sadao. He has served as the chief of the General Staff Headquarters, the chief of the General Affairs Department of the Aviation Headquarters, the director of the Equipment Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, the director of the Secretariat, the Vice Minister of the Army, and then the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. After doing his best to deal with the Manchurian Incident, he was appointed the commander of the 5th Division, and then promoted to the commander of the Korean Army. In Showa 13 (1938), he was awarded the title of Army General and had the nickname "Tiger of Korea," which was highly praised. After serving for two years and eight months, in July of Showa 13 (1938), when Itagaki任 was the Minister of the Army, he was incorporated into the reserve service, and since then he has been a planet in the political world and has attracted attention. In April of Showa 14 (1939), he was appointed Minister of Colonial Affairs in the Hiranuma Cabinet. In January of Showa 15 (1940), when the Yonai Cabinet was born, he was re-appointed Minister of Colonial Affairs. In April of Showa 16 (1941), he became the chairman of the Manchuria Immigration Association. In May of Showa 17 (1942), he personally served as the Governor-General of Korea, until today.

His graduation score in middle school was eighth. When he entered the Army Officer School, he entered as a candidate. He graduated in the middle grade. When he graduated from the Army University, his performance was above average. The so-called great talent matures late. In middle school, he was silent and restrained, upright and meticulous. His classmates called him "Zhuge Liang." When he joined the Hiranuma Cabinet as the Minister of Colonial Affairs, he said in his inaugural speech: "The essence of politics lies in penetrating the lowest level of the people and grasping what they want and think. It is imperative to avoid officials from being alienated and making decisions arbitrarily to handle various administrative matters. Disunity between superiors and subordinates will disrupt the foundation of administration." This shows the face of politician Koiso.

A Master of Mediation

When he was the Minister of Colonial Affairs in the Yonai Cabinet, Representative Monono Ryosuke and Army Minister Yan argued fiercely about the military budget in the parliament. Just as the two were about to clash head-on, Koiso came forward to mediate and satisfactorily resolved the dispute, which was highly praised in the House. Also, during the Second Konoe Cabinet, when the Japanese-Dutch negotiations were in progress, Prime Minister Konoe appointed General Koiso as a special envoy. In this regard, the general had no confidence in the success or failure of the Japanese-Dutch negotiations, and did not know whether the government was determined to break through if the negotiations broke down, so he refused to be a special envoy.

When the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy was concluded, the general ran around behind the scenes to promote it, showing the general's position on Axis diplomacy. When he was the Governor-General of Korea, he advocated establishing a moral Korea and avoiding empty political programs. The general ruling policy was to draw on the enthusiasm of visiting and seeing each place and to strive for its fulfillment according to the level of the people. The focus is especially on the thorough understanding of the essence of the national polity, the renewal of officialdom, and the penetration of industrial and economic measures based on Korea's inherent geographical conditions. The political achievements in two years were remarkable. The level of the people is gradually increasing, and the development of granaries and heavy industry bases is excellent. The implementation of the Korean conscription system was also during his tenure as governor-general.

Filial Piety

On the other hand, the general is known for his filial piety. He put on his military uniform, carried his elderly father on the train, and took care of him carefully. He took meticulous care of him when he took a bath. During his time as the director of the Military Affairs Bureau, he built a house for his 80-year-old mother in Hayama to live in. In the bold side, there is a deep human touch. In the past, he loved to drink, and he would not refuse a jug of wine. When he was drunk, he would sing his own Yalu River song, and his singing was beautiful, earning him the nickname "Kajika."

Now, at this critical moment of national crisis, the general, with his outstanding insight, strength, political skills, and rich human touch, how will he gather all his strength and move towards final victory? This is what all the people unanimously expect. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, July 21)

### German Counterattack on Eastern Front Gradually Stabilizes Battle Situation; Soviet Troops East of Warsaw Surrounded

Central News Agency, Berlin, 6th: German Headquarters announced that the German counterattack on the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains and the Vistula River has repelled the Soviet troops. The Soviet troops only occupy the areas southwest of Mirik and Warga. German troops are counterattacking these two areas. The German Army Guards and the Hungarian airborne tank division east of Warsaw have surrounded the Soviet troops. The Soviet troops are resisting stubbornly. In that area, the Soviet troops' diversionary operations have failed. In the area between the middle reaches of the Bug River and Memel, the Soviet troops are still continuing to attack. The attempt to break through has largely failed. Heavy fighting is still going on in several salients formed by the enemy.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 6th: German military authorities announced on the 5th that the Soviet army has no large-scale offensive on the Eastern Front for the time being, and is only attempting to advance westward to the Vistula River bridgehead west of Warga and the Steinshögen area in the East Prussian border area with powerful troops. The war near Warsaw is completely different from a week ago. The Soviet army's offensive has been repelled by the German army, and the Soviet army is now taking a defensive position in the area.

### U.S. Forces in Northern France Attempt to Attack the Bay of Biscay; German Fortress on Alert

Central News Agency, Berlin, 6th: German military authorities announced: It is true that U.S. forces broke through the German army's positions in the battle zone of 20 kilometers in the Afranche area and even broke into Bourdanis, but the U.S. forces have not yet achieved important results enough to affect the battle situation. There is still fighting in the Rennes area, and U.S. forces are successively increasing their tank and mechanized infantry units. Chateaubriant is still in the hands of the German army. The resistance of the German army on the north bank of the Loire River has become more fierce, causing the vanguard of the U.S. forces attacking in the opposite direction to retreat one after another. In addition, U.S. forces attacking westward from the Rennes area have not yet reached the Bay of Biscay. The German fortresses along the Bay of Biscay are on high alert.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 6th: German military authorities announced on the 3rd that the U.S. forces' attack on the Brittany Peninsula is a completely opposite manifestation of the initial operational goal of the anti-Axis forces taking Paris as their goal. The change in the operational goal is not due to the will of the anti-Axis headquarters itself, but is the result of the German army's use of tactics on the northern French front. The German army's tactics are to strengthen the eastern wing of the Seine bridgehead and to make the reserve army fight in that area. According to general observation, due to the strong defense of the German army, the British army's advance is in a state of stagnation. Later, the U.S. forces turned to attack Brittany, and the German army was able to send reserve troops from the eastern wing of the bridgehead to Brittany. From the perspective of the ratio of the attacking and defending forces in Brittany recently, it is actually favorable to the German army. At present, the U.S. tank teams in Brittany have still not formed a unified battle line, and on the 5th, they seemed to be fighting alone in various areas. If the U.S. forces cannot quickly obtain the support of reserve troops, their attack will be ineffective.

Channel Islands Still in German Hands

Central News Agency, Berlin, 6th: German military authorities announced on the 5th that the anti-Axis forces still have not attempted to transport supplies to Brittany by sea, and the Channel Islands, including诺 Island off the west coast of the Cotentin Peninsula, are still in the hands of the German army, and the port of Saint-Malo is also within the firing range of the island's artillery.

Heavy Losses for Invading European Troops

Central News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 6th: German news agency: According to a report from the anti-Axis headquarters, as of July 30, the anti-Axis forces' losses in Normandy totaled 117,000 men. During this period, the British army's losses were 39,594 men, the U.S. army's losses totaled 70,009 men, and the Canadian army's losses were 6,545 men.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 6th: According to the German Western Army Command, the anti-Axis forces lost 400 tanks in the battles on the 3rd and 4th, three-quarters of which were "Lion" tanks.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 6th: German news agency: According to military sources, thousands of U.S. troops and hundreds of tanks were lost in Seine Bay due to shipwrecks on the eve of August 3. In addition, a British cruiser sank within minutes of being hit, and hundreds of sailors died.

### Japanese Army Assists with Rice Rationing in Shanghai; Spokesman for Propaganda Department Expresses Admiration

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th: The spokesman for the Propaganda Department of the National Government issued the following statement regarding the military authorities of the Allied nations assisting Shanghai in restoring rice rationing for citizens: The suspension of the rice rationing system for Shanghai citizens has caused a panic over food, which not only affects Shanghai. Shanghai is the industrial center of the country. Problems with the rice supply for citizens directly affect soaring prices and rising wages, which in turn affect rising prices throughout the country. Therefore, this serious problem is not just a local problem in Shanghai. The Allied military's cooperation with our country's economy, starting with assisting the Shanghai municipal government in solving the problem of Shanghai's food supply, is the most meaningful measure. Because the Shanghai area is important, its economic fluctuations are enough to affect the whole country. If Shanghai's food economy can be stabilized, the whole country will also be affected. We are truly impressed by the Allied military's enthusiastic cooperation in solving the problem of Shanghai's food supply. After the Greater East Asia War, the source of foreign rice was cut off, and the supply of rice from the interior also became difficult. Due to road traffic obstacles, and the largest rice-producing areas, such as Henan and Hunan, are still in a state of anti-Japanese war and guerrilla chaos, it is not easy to supply food to Shanghai and other industrial cities. This time, the Allied authorities launched military operations in Henan and Hunan, not only eliminating the military bases built by Britain and the United States in China, but also relieving the chaotic state of the rice-producing areas, allowing rice sources to flow continuously. From then on, the regulation of our country's economy will be easier. Although the rice rationing in Shanghai this time has been fairly resolved with the cooperation of the Allied nations, it is still hoped that the citizens of Shanghai will cooperate with the authorities to maintain the stability of rice prices, strictly implement food conservation, and strictly prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and manipulating. It should be known that the food problem in Shanghai is enough to affect the price fluctuations throughout the country.

### German Troops in Italy Retreat to North Bank of Arno River; Terrorist Air Raid on Mantua

Central News Agency, Berlin, 6th: German news agency: On Friday, the British army failed to continue its large-scale attack on Florence, but it has gradually approached the south of the Arno River. Some of the German rearguard troops have been forced to retreat to the north of the Arno River.

Central News Agency, Milan, 6th: German news agency: On Saturday, British and American aircraft carried out a terrorist attack on Mantua, causing serious damage to various parts of the city. The famous St. Andrew's Church and many historical monuments were severely damaged.

### Turkish Cities Prepare to Evacuate Residents

Central News Agency, Ankara, 6th: Hatong News Agency: The Turkish government has now submitted a bill to the National Assembly to evacuate some cities.

Soviet Union Remains Silent After Germany and Turkey Sever Relations

Central News Agency, Berlin, 6th: Hatong News Agency: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said that the Soviet Union's silence after Germany and Turkey severed diplomatic relations is suspicious. Based on past experience, when the Soviet Union remains silent, it often has more demands. The Soviet Union has demanded bases in Turkey, which seems to be opposed by the Turkish people, who are deeply concerned that once the Soviet Union gets involved, it will get an inch and want a mile. The spokesman did not answer whether Britain and the United States had demanded bases and whether the demands of Britain and the United States conflicted with the demands of the Soviet Union, but the construction of airfields in Anatolia was supervised by British engineers.

### German Social Party: Cadre Meeting Reviews Total Mobilization Measures

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - Based on the Führer's decree of July 25th, the General Secretary of the German Social Party, Mr. Bormann, convened a plenary meeting on the 3rd in Berlin, attended by national leaders and new regional leaders of the National Socialist Party, to review and thoroughly implement mobilization measures. Under the chairmanship of Dr. Goebbels, Director-General of Total Mobilization, the meeting lasted two days, during which implementation strategies were discussed in detail. The meeting concluded on the 4th. During the meeting, Goebbels explained the vast mobilization measures as follows: The German people possess immense combat power within the country. If this can be fully mobilized, Germany can remain invincible. Unleashing Germany's total strength is not only the urgent task of all citizens but also a new mission to safeguard the reputation of the leadership, as well as the most significant challenge for the German middle and upper classes. The German people must rise up as one. Furthermore, Minister of Armaments Dr. Speer detailed the development of Germany's military-industrial complex to date as follows: Germany's military industry must enhance production and technologically surpass the enemy. Not only should quality and quantity be abundant, but also a large number of soldiers must be sent to the front lines. If the German people can mobilize all reserve combat power, they will undoubtedly be able to fulfill this task. If Germany can consistently seize opportunities in technological advancements, final victory can be expected soon. Finally, Minister of the Interior Himmler, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Home Army, spent several hours explaining the causes and consequences of the July 20th incident, as well as the future direction and measures of the Home Army Headquarters. He stated that the current great war, which will determine the future of the nation, is a holy war of the nation. The National Socialist Party and the people must be completely united, even more so than before, to overcome numerous difficulties and guide the war to a favorable outcome.

### Galenborg Appointed to Important Position

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports that Galenborg, Director of the Ammunition Department of the German Armaments and War Production Ministry, has been entrusted by Führer Hitler to oversee a highly important combat mission, with special powers granted.

### Manchurian Coal Production Increases Sharply

Xinjing, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a survey by the Manchurian Coal Association regarding coal production in the first period of this year (April to June), all coal mines will continue to maintain optimal performance during the winter emergency production period. Except for a few small coal mines that are slightly inferior, most are extremely good and have achieved expected results, with even more progress compared to the first period of last year. After entering July and August, the situation of reduced production in the past summer has been overcome. The lack of coal in the summer of last year has been safely eliminated this year. Although related labor and materials are gradually deteriorating, very good results can still be achieved. This is mainly due to the government's proper measures, so the increase in production in various coal mines has achieved practical results. Recently, the labor efficiency of large coal mines has increased sharply, which is the main reason.

### Japanese Minister Usami Hosted Minister Lin Yesterday, Mutually Wishing the News Association to Fulfill Its Mission

Mr. Usami, the Minister Plenipotentiary of the allied nation Japan to China, hosted a banquet last night at 7:00 PM at the Broadway Mansion, in honor of Minister Lin of the National Government's Propaganda Department and Mr. Guo Xiufeng, President of the Central News Agency, who came to Shanghai to preside over the establishment of the Chinese News Association. In addition to Minister Lin and President Guo, there were also Mr. Hu Yingzhou, Vice President of the Central News Agency; Mr. Chu Baoheng, Director of the Shanghai Branch; Mr. Wu Linzhi, Director of the Newspaper Management Office; Mr. Xu Liqiu, Acting President of the China Daily; Mr. Jin Xiongbo, President of the Ping Bao; Mr. Lu Feng, Editor-in-Chief of the New China News; Mr. Huang Jingqi, President of the National News; Mr. Fu Zhongquan, Deputy Manager of the News; Mr. Chen Binma, President of this newspaper; as well as Mr. Izubuchi, Director of the Japanese Army News Department; Counselor   Saki of the Embassy; Director Matsudaira of the Information Department; Vice-Consul Fukama, and over twenty others. During the banquet, Minister Usami first stood up and delivered a speech, saying: "Minister Lin and President Guo of the Central News Agency have come to Shanghai this time to establish the Chinese News Association. Tonight, I take this opportunity to prepare a simple meal and invite the preparatory committee members of the Chinese News Association and representatives of the propaganda and news circles. I am most honored that you and gentlemen have been able to spare time to attend during this time of multiple crises and intense heat.

Usami's Speech

"I have heard that the results of yesterday's first meeting of the preparatory committee were very harmonious, and the association will soon be established. I deeply admire the efforts of Minister Lin and all those involved and hope that they will continue to work hard in the future.

"As the war enters a decisive stage, the importance of the ideological war need not be elaborated upon. However, I would like to share some of my thoughts on this point with you gentlemen for your reference.

"The most important thing in the ideological war is to establish a unified ideology, to popularize this ideology thoroughly, and to consolidate the organization. Regarding the former, the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration established a common ideology for all countries in Greater East Asia. At the same time, the keynote of this ideology is to liberate Goa, complete the independence and autonomy of East Asian countries, and ensure equality among all countries internationally, which need not be repeated.

"However, in order to thoroughly popularize this ideology, there must be individual efforts in propaganda and reporting. However, if individual organizations are in a state of disunity, no matter how hard they work, they will not be able to concentrate their strength to achieve their full effect. Not only that, but there is even a risk of causing ideological opposition and leading to adverse consequences. Therefore, when implementing propaganda and reporting work, in addition to establishing ideology, the most important thing is to establish an organization, which you gentlemen already know. However, at this time when we are about to devote our greatest efforts to the real war, it is truly gratifying to hear the good news that the newspapers, which bear the heavy responsibility of guiding public opinion, will soon organize a news association in order to expand and strengthen their organizations. The Japanese newspapers will gladly participate, needless to say. This embassy hopes to work together with the army and navy to provide the greatest cooperation in order to achieve victory in the ideological war as well. In this sense, I once again express my hope for the future efforts of all the preparatory committee members. I raise my glass to wish you and all the gentlemen good health and success, and to wish for the completion of the ideological war."

Minister Lin's Reply

Minister Lin then gave a reply, saying: "Today, I am honored to have Minister Usami's grand invitation. I, on behalf of the Chinese press colleagues who have been invited, express my gratitude. The Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage. At this time, the actual propaganda war is particularly important. Brother, along with President Guo Yi, came to Shanghai this time to establish the Chinese News Association. The allied embassies and the reporting authorities of the army and navy have given much guidance and cooperation, which is greatly appreciated. The most important issues in propaganda and reporting work are firm will and concentrated strength. If these two conditions can be met, the expected results will be achieved. Brother participated in the News Association Preparatory Committee yesterday and deeply knows that the official and the press can work together with the same heart, the Chinese press can also take unified steps, and the Chinese and Japanese press can also take completely the same will and steps. From this point of view, all the press colleagues related to this News Association can follow the basic principles of unified will and concentrated strength on the central and important issues, and work together hand in hand to fulfill their original intentions. The goal of the propaganda war is to destroy the Anglo-Americans and awaken Chongqing. But in addition to that, we should also pay attention to Shanghai. Shanghai is a place where rumors breed, so we must first strengthen the Shanghai propaganda mechanism in order to achieve propaganda results. Finally, I, on behalf of the Chinese propaganda colleagues, express my gratitude to the allied authorities for their enthusiasm in assisting our country's propaganda cause over the years, and at the same time hope that they will continue to provide double the assistance and guidance in the future in order to achieve propaganda purposes and destroy the Anglo-Americans," and so on. After the speeches, the guests dispersed at about 10:00 PM, all in good spirits.

### The City's Registered Residents' Rice Will Be Universally Sold Within Days. Representatives of All Public Offices Gathered Yesterday for a Meeting.

The rice for registered residents in this city, which has been suspended for two months, will soon be continuously implemented under the supervision of the city's Goods Allocation Office. The old prices of all the registered residents' rice have been clearly stipulated, and a meeting was held yesterday morning with representatives of all public counties and offices in the city to provide instructions on strengthening the allocation mechanism. The details are recorded separately below:

Jinxing Meeting: Rapid Rice Sales

The city's Goods Allocation Office was ordered to continue handling the city's grain distribution based on population. The rice distribution for the first ten days of this month is now actively being discussed. Mr. Feng Jianzhi, the director of the office, presided over the meeting and gave detailed instructions on strengthening the public office mechanism in order to quickly implement rice sales and alleviate the serious threat of popular greed. The meeting did not end until 12:00 noon.

Remaining Rice: Deadline for Registration

After convening a meeting of all public counties and offices yesterday morning, the Goods Allocation Office immediately issued a notice to each public county and office, stating that the city's registered residents' rice will soon begin to be allocated. In order to effectively rectify the situation, starting from the 6th of this month, all public joint offices and rice retailers, etc., operating the free trade of national rice should report the amount of national rice operated truthfully to the office by today (7th), Monday, awaiting verification. If the quantity exceeds 125 piculs, they must first purchase a rice registration form from Room 701 of the office to complete the registration procedures. All rice inventory reports from rice retailers under the jurisdiction of the former First District should be sent to Room 703 of the Goods Allocation Office at 209 Jiangxi Road for verification and receipt. The rice inventory reports from each public county under the jurisdiction of the former Grain Association Bureau should be sent to the Public Grain Section at the old address of the former Grain Association Bureau on Penglai Road in Nanshi for verification and receipt. Each public county office and retailer must not dispose of the stored rice themselves.

Advance Payment by the Mother First, Then Pay the Deposit

In the future, the Goods Allocation Office will allocate rice to each public county in the city due to the rice retailers in each of those counties. Those offices do not need to advance payment first. That is why they should pay the deposit again. It is stipulated that each registered number of rice retailers within the jurisdiction of the former First District must pay a deposit of 10,000 yuan again, which must be submitted to Room 624 of the office today (7th) for verification and receipt. Each public county office under the jurisdiction of the former Grain Bureau must also pay a deposit of 10,000 yuan, which must also be submitted to the accounting office at the old address of the former Grain Bureau today (7th) and must not be delayed.

Registered Residents' Rice Price: Re-investigation

Regarding the universal sale of registered residents' rice in all districts of the city in the first ten days of this month, it is said that the principle is two liters per person. The selling price of registered residents' rice has also been re-adjusted, and it is internally set at 3,500 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates per picul, that is, 35 yuan per catty. The Goods Allocation Office will formally announce this to the public within days.

### The City's Rice Arrival Volume is Extremely Strong

The city's rice, because the new grains will soon be on the market, farmers in the suburbs are selling old rice, and the arrival volume is extremely strong, the market is flat. Recently, a large batch of rice procured by rice merchants in this city in Wuhu was reduced in price to just over 3,000 yuan per picul. The first batch arrived in port yesterday (6th), totaling 4,875 piculs, which was immediately stored in the designated warehouse of the Zhejiang Xingye Bank. The rest is being shipped one after another and will arrive in Shanghai soon. It is expected that the price of rice in the wood market will continue to fall.

### Agricultural Products Are Continuously Shipped to Shanghai; Last Week's Price Trend Was Stable

Last week's price trend in this city did not show any significant fluctuations, and most of the prices hovered at the original prices. This was due to the frequent decline in rice prices, the stabilization of people's minds, and the failure of credit to ease in various industries. At the same time, most hoarders felt that the materials they hoarded had been around for a long time, and they were eager to release them at the current market prices, so the availability of spot goods for various materials has obviously increased a lot. Therefore, the market situation of all industries will be stable for a long time, but the economic authorities have not relaxed their thorough investigation work. The reporter learned from various industries yesterday that since the past month, agricultural products from various places have been transported to Shanghai in an endless stream. These items are mostly obtained by various trade control associations through barter. The manufactured goods of this city are first transported to various places to exchange for important agricultural products from the locality, and then these agricultural products are transported to Shanghai by water and land routes for use by various large and small factories as raw materials for goods. Therefore, the city's material raw materials are still abundant.

### The Relationship Between the Thrift Movement and Crime Prevention: Director Li of the Judicial Department Broadcasts a Speech

The Shanghai Special City Thrift Association is actively promoting the thrift movement and held a regular broadcast. At 7:45 PM yesterday, Li Shiyu, Director of the Judicial Department of the City Police Bureau, gave a broadcast speech on "The Relationship Between the Thrift Movement and Crime Prevention" at the Great Shanghai Radio Station, stating that the thrift movement aims to cultivate a frugal atmosphere among the people, save materials on weekdays, and enhance the country's wartime strength. Standing in the position of the judicial police, I should cooperate to promote this movement, because when we investigate crimes on weekdays, eight or nine out of ten are caused by extravagant enjoyment and improper living, and it can also be said that extravagant consumption is the factor of crime. Therefore, to thoroughly prevent crime and maintain social tranquility, we should eliminate those who only know how to enjoy and do not abide by the law.

Recently, this office, in order to carry out Mayor Chen's will to cooperate in building a great Shanghai, decided to start by clarifying social evils and launched crime prevention work. The objects of our crime prevention are of course the villains, hooligans and corrupt exploiters who generally do not abide by the law, but in order to make this work thorough, we will not easily let go of the wasters who spend their time in improper pleasure. People who lead improper lives are most likely to go astray.

Preliminary Crime Prevention Work

There is a slogan for crime prevention work called "Prevent crime before it happens, safeguard the dignity of the law, promote savings together", and at the same time it points out that "Helping the authorities to prevent crime is to protect your own safety". This sentence says it even more clearly. It turns out that everyone should cooperate in the development of crime prevention work and study it together. I think that the thrift movement is a cooperative crime prevention movement, but relying on empty talk is useless, so I think that if citizens can practice thrift, they have done the preliminary crime prevention work. On the one hand, we hope that citizens will report to the authorities the illegal merchants in Shanghai who disregard the law and only exploit the people for their own enjoyment, so that they can be punished by law and never be seen again. At the same time, the crime prevention section has implemented surveillance and crackdown on all entertainment venues that are gold mines, so that everyone is thrifty and everyone abides by the law. In that case, people can cultivate their own thrift and cooperate with us to complete the purpose of eliminating bad people and reducing crime. But I think that any movement should be promoted with the three forces of guidance, control, and remediation in order to achieve results. It is not enough to just promote empty talk. I hope that all of you dear citizens will earnestly practice thrift and work hard to prevent crime.

Reader Assistance Message

### Happiness Is Entrusted to Studies: Cannot Become an Adult After Dropping Out of School. A Student's Anxious Emotions

Yesterday, we issued a call, asking all readers to make their final contribution to help more than 3,000 out-of-school youths. Because in this year's application to help 7,000 students, in addition to university seniors, more than 6,000 students have already participated in the written examination procedures organized by this newspaper, and most of them have excellent grades, and they should be subsidized. Unfortunately, the amount of donations now can only subsidize 3,000 students, and the remaining half will inevitably be unable to help. After this news was published, we received letters from two applying students that night, expressing anxiety and deep fear of dropping out of school without getting a grant. One passage in particular made us feel very touched. He said: "...I am sixteen years old this year. My father died of depression this spring because he lost his job, leaving behind an old mother and four brothers and sisters. The eldest brother is disabled, and the sister is young. The old mother left home with tears to prepare for others. I read the newspaper in the morning and do housework at night. I will study in high school next semester. If I do not get the grant from your newspaper, I will inevitably drop out of school, but I feel that my lifelong happiness is completely entrusted to my studies. If I drop out of school, it will prove that I am not as good as others, a mediocre person, and my future is bleak, and I will not be able to become an adult in the future, and it is better to die than to live. I have no choice but to ask first whether I can be included in the approved assistance list..." In addition to replying to the letter to comfort and correct his hasty ideas, I deeply feel that there are many students seeking help in this kind of loop. Especially among the more than 3,000 students who have not been able to get subsidies, most of them are clean and excellent, and everyone has a heart of compassion. How can they bear to order them to drop out of school? Moreover, helping students is to cultivate talents and plant trees, and its contribution to the country and society has a positive significance, which is different from the usual passive benefit. I believe that there is no lack of enthusiastic people in the society, especially the wealthy and rich, who hope to donate generously, the more the better.
