### National Survival is Everyone's Responsibility — A Sincere Message to My Good Chinese Friends —

— Tatsujiro Funatsu

Yesterday, the *Shen Bao*'s editorial discussed "Do Not Be Lazy," expecting the government to do more for the country and seek more benefits for the people. It encouraged the people to contribute all their strength and do more for the country and society. Indeed, the nation is a whole group, and the people are the constituent elements of that whole group. To demand that the whole group exert its strength, it is of course based on the individual efforts of each constituent element. Therefore, a national of a country who hopes that the country is strong and that the country is restored to prosperity must first clearly recognize that it is the duty of each and every citizen, and that no one can abandon this responsibility. If the people abandon their responsibility to the country, then the entire strength of the country will tend to be weak and gradually decline. At this time, the fate of the people will naturally fall into a tragic situation. As the saying goes, "If the skin is gone, where will the hair attach itself?" I think truly patriotic citizens will certainly clearly understand the crux of this matter. In other words, if a citizen cannot contribute all his strength in a down-to-earth manner, fulfill his duty to the country, and shoulder his responsibility to the country, and yet boasts of being patriotic and hopes for the country's restoration and prosperity, then, I ask, who will bear the fruit? This is not only not patriotic, but simply enough to mislead the country. "The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every individual." These two sentences concretely illustrate that every citizen has a responsibility to the country. Mr. Gu Yanwu is admired by the Chinese people, especially those in the knowledge class who boast of being patriots. They all know the spirit of these two sentences, so they should absolutely abide by this instruction.

I have been in China for fifty-six years, and China is like my second hometown. I love China the most. Therefore, I am not promoting Japan, but rather comparing the Japanese people and the Chinese people. To be honest, the Japanese people's sense of responsibility to the country is more universal and enthusiastic than that of the Chinese people. Of course, there are quite a few Chinese citizens who have a high sense of responsibility to the country, but perhaps in their minds they have the idea of patriotism, but in fact they abandon their responsibility and stand by with their hands in their sleeves. This is my sincere and frank statement from the standpoint of a Japanese person who loves China. I hope that these Chinese friends will thoroughly change their views and take on the responsibility to the country. Take on the responsibility of revitalizing China.

Furthermore, the present is the decisive era of the Greater East Asia War. Japan and China are both major participating countries and have a common responsibility for striving for victory. At this critical juncture of survival, no citizen should be allowed to stand by with his hands in his sleeves and stay out of the matter. We people in Shanghai must especially understand Shanghai's position as an important base in the rear of the war. The efforts of the people of Shanghai are closely related to the victory of the Greater East Asia War. Second, even if we are not thinking about the victory of Greater East Asia, but only about the happiness of Shanghai, then all the responsibilities of Shanghai should also be borne by the people living in Shanghai, and no Shanghai resident should be allowed to stand by and stay out of the matter. What is "protecting oneself wisely"? What is "keeping oneself clean"? They are all passively evading responsibility.

I would like to sincerely tell my good Chinese friends that we people living in Shanghai should at least jointly bear the responsibility for everything in Shanghai. In the past, strengthening Shanghai's municipal administration and the welfare of Shanghai citizens were believed to be the concerns of every citizen living in Shanghai. Now, the Shanghai municipal authorities are determined to strengthen the municipal administration. Judging from the recent measures to improve personnel and eliminate gambling, this is sufficient to prove this initially. The establishment of the Municipal Administration Advisory Committee is an expression of striving for improvement. I very much hope that my Chinese friends, especially those with qualifications and knowledge, will change from a passive concept to an active concept, without political prejudices and without partisan prejudices, and with the spirit of "If I don't go to hell, who will?" jointly shoulder the responsibility and seek happiness for the citizens.

The rise and fall of the world! Every individual is responsible! The rise and fall of Shanghai! The people of Shanghai are responsible!

### Imperial General Headquarters Announced Yesterday the Occupation of the Strategic Point of Kohima, and a Decisive Battle Will Also Be Launched in the Kaladan Area

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 5:10 PM on the 8th: Japanese elite troops and the Indian National Army occupied Kohima, a strategic point on the Imphal-Dimapur road, on the morning of the 6th. The attack by our troops on the enemy's airborne troops in the Gasa area is progressing smoothly.

Rangoon, 8th (Central News Agency) – The largest stronghold of the enemy army on the Burma-India border defending India, Chika, has been severely weakened by the fierce attack of the Japanese army. On the dawn of the 4th, elite Japanese troops surged from the mountains on the left side to the Chika fortress and completely occupied it. The mopping up of the remnants continues, and they have advanced from the dense forest area within India to the Imphal Plain.

Rangoon, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese vanguard and the Indian National Army continued to fiercely attack the enemy's positions at dawn on the 8th. The fall of Imphal is only a matter of time. Looking back, since the Japanese army launched an offensive on the central India-Burma border on March 8th, although the enemy army desperately counterattacked with mechanized units and air force, the Japanese army was still able to defeat them by surprise and cut off the enemy's ring road between Imphal, Ukhrul, Tamu, and Tiddim, in just one month, forcing them to approach Imphal. In addition, the enemy's airborne commando unit, although it was active in northern Burma for two months, attempting to disrupt the Japanese rear positions, eventually fell into isolation and was completely defeated.

Kaladan Valley Front Line, Burma-India, 8th (Central News Agency) – The main force of the West African army, about 4,000 strong, surrounded by the Japanese army, is trying to resist stubbornly. However, now a unit of Indian trucks is fleeing north, and the remaining enemy troops are facing a desperate situation, and their collapse is imminent. On the 4th, the Japanese army intercepted enemy troops who were crossing the river near Kalemyo, achieving great results, and are continuing to mop up. The day before yesterday, other Japanese troops detoured to the north and cut off the enemy's retreat route, shattering their organizational strength, so the enemy has been completely surrounded. Therefore, a major annihilation battle will be launched in the Kaladan Valley area.

### The Situation in the Indian Ocean is Tense, the Strength of the British Fleet is Weak - Japanese Military Experts Express Four Views

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese-Indian army's offensive operation into India is progressing extremely smoothly. The strategic point of Imphal is expected to be captured soon, and encirclement battles are being launched everywhere. The crisis of the complete annihilation of the British-Indian army is imminent. However, while the enemy's ground operations are extremely dangerous, the British fleet in the Indian Ocean is still taking a indifferent attitude, willing to bear the ugly name of the "silent fleet." Military experts here recently expressed their views on two questions: "Why is the anti-Axis fleet in the Indian Ocean keeping silent?" and "When will it move?" as follows: First, the reason why the Indian Ocean fleet has not been active so far is because it lacks the confidence to win a decisive battle with the Japanese fleet. According to observations in *De Transvaler* at the end of last year, the enemy's Indian Ocean fleet has only seven to eight battleships, five aircraft carriers, and eight heavy cruisers. In addition, there are a small number of destroyers. With this level of strength, it naturally does not have the courage to fight against the powerful Japanese fleet. In particular, the British Indian Ocean fleet is very different from the navy when it was operating in the Pacific. The Indian Ocean is very far from the British mainland. Once its fleet suffers a heavy blow, the time required for its replenishment and reinforcement is too long, and it is absolutely difficult to recover in a short period of time. This may also be the biggest reason why Britain does not dare to gamble on a sea battle in the Indian Ocean. Second, there is a lack of transport ships. The ships retained by the United Kingdom are very few, except for those necessary for the country. Even if the United States has many ships for its use, they are being used in the Italian campaign, and the supply work, and since the grand plan to form a second European front is about to be completed, it is also necessary to gather a large number of ships in the country, so it is absolutely difficult to have a large number of ships sailing to the Indian Ocean. Third, there is insufficient air power for operations in the Indian Ocean. The British Air Force's biggest mission is to defend its homeland, so the manufacturing industry of long-range bombers developed relatively late. In modern naval warfare, in addition to fleet air power, it is also necessary to have a base and the protection of the air force. This has a great impact on the situation of the war, which goes without saying. However, the performance of British long-range bombers is unfavorable in this type of operation, and it is bound to receive assistance from the US Air Force. However, it is by no means easy for the US Air Force to assemble a powerful base air unit at present. Fourth, the bases of the Indian Ocean Fleet have not yet reached the point where they can carry out large-scale operations. Because Britain's naval ports in that area, in addition to Bombay, have been actively working to make Ceylon Island a base since the fall of Singapore, as an advanced maritime base for defending India. Therefore, it has been actively preparing the two ports of Colombo and Trincomalee on the island. This is already a well-known fact, but it is still extremely difficult to use this as the base of the Indian Ocean Fleet and the base for carrying out large-scale operations. Because when launching operations in the Indian Ocean, damaged ships must sail to Durban in South Africa or Australia to be repaired. However, the anti-Axis fleet in the Indian Ocean cannot remain silent forever. The Indian Ocean fleet, which is mainly composed of the British Navy, in addition to the purpose of combat, also has the mission of suppressing the anti-British movement of Indian citizens and carrying out political goals. It is thought that the Indian Ocean Fleet under the command of Somerville will cooperate with ground operations to gain prestige among Indian citizens. In the near future, it will still launch a counterattack regardless of all adverse conditions and sacrifices. The situation in the Indian Ocean is about to become tense.

### Food Supplies in Eastern India Transported to the West

Bangkok, 8th (Central News Agency) – Reliable sources say: The British authorities, fearing the loss of eastern India, have begun to transport the food supplies stored in that area to the west. O'Kinchley, the person in charge of supplies for the Southeast Asia anti-Axis Command, has repeatedly stated that the anti-Axis forces will repel the Japanese army, but the current unfavorable war situation cannot be concealed. Recently, he ordered that the food supplies stored in the two provinces of Bengal and Assam be transported to the northwestern frontier provinces of the west, and to the areas of Baluchistan. It is generally believed that this move is the vanguard of the British implementing a scorched earth tactic.

### Japanese Planes Attack Nanning

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to a post-war assessment of the results of the Japanese air force's attack on Nanning on the 5th, in addition to what was previously announced, two more enemy planes were shot down, bringing the total number of enemy planes shot down or destroyed on that day to fourteen.

### Manchuria Increases Production and Construction Nationwide, Determined to Cooperate in Completing the War - Ambassadors Lu and Chen Give Speeches in Nanjing

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) – The Manchurian Ambassador to China, Lu, met with the capital's press corps at 3:00 PM on the 7th and gave a very detailed account of Manchuria's construction situation and the overall situation of production in cooperation with the Greater East Asia War. He also answered questions from the press corps, which lasted for quite a long time. The following is a record of Ambassador Lu's speech and answers to the press corps: I returned to my country last year. Because I had been away from my motherland for a long time, I was extremely concerned about various situations, so I made a special trip to visit various places. Seeing the progress of domestic construction, I was very gratified. Last year was the second year of Manchuria's second phase of construction. The whole country, from top to bottom, was working hard for the country's development prospects in accordance with the predetermined national policies. Remarkable results have been achieved in the development of minerals, the development of industry, and the increase in agricultural production. In particular, the agricultural harvest of sorghum, soybeans, and other miscellaneous grains increased significantly compared to the previous year, so the domestic economy is abundant, the distribution is smooth, and the people's lives are stable. Everyone is exerting their own strength to contribute everything to the country. This year, with the assistance of the friendly nation of Japan, we will engage in large-scale agricultural production. Japan will provide strong assistance to Manchuria in all aspects of labor, technology, and resources. After Ambassador Lu finished speaking, he continued to answer the press corps' questions as follows.

Material Exchange Completes Increased Production

(Q) Regarding the exchange of materials between our two countries and the promotion of smooth progress, I would like to hear your Excellency's high opinion. (A) Regarding the flow of materials between the two countries, because North China is close to Manchuria, that area is the hub for material exchange. Last year, the northern belt of China had a small cotton yield, so very little was transported to Manchuria. Manchuria, in order to increase production, greatly expects the increase in production work in northern China. (Q) Since your country was founded, the prohibition of opium has been the most effective. Please briefly describe the key points of the anti-smoking measures and the implementation process. (A) Manchuria's anti-smoking measures initially implemented a ten-year plan, which first strictly investigated the number of smokers, and then issued licenses for sale, gradually reducing the amount of smoke. At the same time, hospitals were established to forcibly quit smoking within a limited time, and unauthorized private smoking was strictly prohibited. At the same time, private smuggling and sales were prohibited, and new smoking was prohibited. Therefore, after ten years, the satisfactory effect of eliminating the scourge of smoking was achieved.

Youth Training is Remarkably Effective

(Q) What is the impact on your country after the signing of the Japan-Soviet fishing treaty? (A) The signing of the Japan-Soviet fishing treaty has no direct impact on Manchuria. However, with such a satisfactory diplomatic relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union, the future diplomacy between Manchuria and the Soviet Union can also have a satisfactory harvest. We greatly approve of this concord agreement. (Q) What is the general situation of youth training in Manchuria? (A) The youth training in Manchuria is practical training in practical work, and the training is training in practical work. The scope of training is very widespread, and it especially emphasizes the youth training in the countryside. The contribution to the country is also very significant. For example, the railway project between Changchun and Harbin was originally scheduled to be completed in three months. After careful research, it was decided to use young people to be responsible for this project. Young people in the area were mobilized to actively start work, and the entire project was completed in only nineteen days. There are many other similar cases where we benefited from the assistance of young people. Because youth training in Manchuria has practical work, it is very easy to arouse the interest of young people, so there are remarkable results.

The Authorities of Both Countries are Still Working Hard

(Q) Regarding the issue of material exchange between China and Manchuria, please express your high opinion. (A) Material exchange between China and Manchuria is a major issue under the wartime system. In recent years, Manchuria has transported food, timber, etc., and we are also working hard to complete important work during wartime. (Q) Manchuria has the most abundant agricultural production. What are the key points of its promotion methods? (A) Manchuria's agricultural production increase has indeed achieved remarkable results. The reason for this is due to the improvement of agricultural seeds and the expansion of agricultural land, and the establishment of security is also an important reason. Others include the construction of rural areas in terms of personnel, and the organization of agricultural cooperative societies. The agricultural talents cultivated over the years not only have proficient technology, but also have the training of the spirit of national construction. The newly established Agricultural Development Bank makes agricultural finance more smooth.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) – This year is the decisive year for the Greater East Asia War. All one billion people in East Asia are donating everything to strive for the final construction of the Greater East Asia War. The friendly nation of Manchuria is also exerting all its strength to cooperate in completing the war. At this time of decisive battle, the key points of its future administration and how to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War are especially valued by us. After Ambassador Lu met with reporters and gave a speech, the reporter also visited our ambassador to Manchuria, Chen Jicheng. He raised several questions, and Ambassador Chen answered each one in detail. They are recorded as follows:

Key Points of Administration to Enhance Combat Power

(Q) What is the focus of the current political advancement in Manchuria? (A) Currently, the entire country of Manchuria is focused on enhancing combat power, and among the enhancement of combat power, increasing production is the most important. Not only is there a large production in the mining industry, but there is also an annual increase in agricultural products. (Q) Please briefly describe the situation of the publishing industry in Manchuria. (A) The Manchurian government has established a Hongbao Office under the State Council, and Hongbao branches are set up in various cities to guide, supervise, and promote propaganda and reporting in various provinces and cities across the country. As for the news industry, in order to unify the whole country, Kangde News Agency was established in Changchun, and branches were established in various provinces and cities. Although there are not many publications, there are many publications issued in the field of literature and art, such as *Kirin Shuowen Zhi*, *Xingya*, and *New Manchuria*, which are widely circulated. Other publications concerning society and youth include *Minsheng* and *Youth Culture*, etc. (Q) The rationing system in Manchuria is quite perfect. Please briefly introduce it. (A) The rationing system is indeed an important product of the present era, but it is not easy to manage it perfectly. The rationing system in Manchuria has been in place for many years and has been gradually improved, so that people's lives can be stabilized.

The Authorities of Both Countries Are Still Working Hard

(Q) Regarding the issue of material exchange between China and Manchuria, please express your high opinion briefly. (A) Material exchange between China and Manchuria is a major issue under the wartime system. In recent years, Manchuria has transported food, timber, etc., and we are also working hard to complete important work during wartime. (Q) Manchuria's agricultural production is the most abundant. What are the key points of its promotion methods? (A) Manchuria's agricultural production increase has indeed achieved remarkable results. The reasons for this are due to the improvement of agricultural seeds and the expansion of agricultural land, and the establishment of security is also an important reason. Others include the construction of rural areas in terms of personnel, and the organization of agricultural cooperative societies. The agricultural talents cultivated over the years not only have proficient technology, but also have the training of the spirit of national construction. The newly established Agricultural Development Bank makes agricultural finance more smooth.

### Soviet Offensive Stalled in the Prut River Basin

Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) - The German army's fierce offensive across the front line from the Carpathian Mountains to the Prut River basin is intensifying, and the Soviet offensive has been completely contained. According to front-line news, although the Soviet army had advanced to Orgeiev, 30 kilometers north of Chisinau, it suffered a German counterattack and was again engaged in fierce fighting. According to information from Moscow, the Soviet army had previously encircled the German forces in Skalat, between Tarnopol and Proskurov, but in reality, the encirclement was not complete, and because German troops attacked from the southwest of Tarnopol, the Soviet army is now focusing on defensive battles. The battle for Odessa is showing signs of gradually intensifying. The Soviet army wants to incorporate the port into its encirclement, opening up from Berezovka, 30 kilometers southwest of Novaya Odessa, towards the Black Sea coast, but its vanguard seems to have been defeated by the German army. A Reuters correspondent in Moscow reports that the battle for Odessa may turn into a long and difficult war.

### U.S. Under Secretary of State Arrives in London, Dr. Bowman and Others Accompany

Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to Havas, British newspapers jokingly reported that U.S. Under Secretary of State Stettinius arrived in London yesterday, accompanied by Matthews, Assistant Secretary for European Affairs, Murray, Director of the Near East and Africa Division, and Dr. Bowman, President of Johns Hopkins University, a renowned geographer. When reporters asked Stettinius about the purpose of his trip, he declined to answer, saying only that he would stay in London for two weeks and meet with British Foreign Secretary Eden and other cabinet members. It is said that the issues he will discuss include Poland, the Atlantic Charter, Anglo-American recognition of the Badoglio government, and the status of the Greek and Southern European governments in exile. The participation of Dr. Bowman is considered to be of great significance, as it is believed that he and others will at least study post-war border issues. Bowman served as an advisor to President Wilson at the Versailles Conference and has since been a member of numerous international organizations.

### Negotiations Held on Various Issues

Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to Havas, the London correspondent of the Swedish Dagens Nyheter reported that political circles in London consider U.S. Under Secretary of State Stettinius's trip to London to be the most important of the anti-Axis negotiations, but that the discussions will be only preparatory in nature. The decisions to be made are: 1. The policy to be adopted towards Portugal. 2. The gasoline issue. 3. Economic issues, including the tonnage of U.S. merchant ships and the cancellation of Lend-Lease aid. 4. The use of post-war Pacific and Axis bases. 5. The settlement of European Soviet land issues. It is likely that Soviet Ambassador Gusev will participate in these discussions. Regarding Pacific bases, it is likely that all anti-Axis countries will be allowed to use them, and the Australian and Dutch authorities share this view.

### Goebbels Concurrently Appointed as Governor of Berlin, Concentrating Efforts on the War

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports that Führer Hitler has appointed Propaganda Minister Goebbels as Governor of Berlin, concentrating the city's administrative power in one person, with special emphasis on wartime administration. Officials below the mayor are under his control, in order to concentrate all efforts on the war. The administrative regulations and charters of Berlin have been abolished. This appointment does not affect Goebbels' other official positions.

### Declaration of War by the National Government

At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th of the previous year, the National Government, based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with its friendly neighbor Japan. Since then, it has embarked on the New National Movement, committed to ensuring public security, improving the people's livelihood, and increasing national strength to assist in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, the United Kingdom and the United States continue to pursue their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and have intensified their efforts by enticing elements from Chongqing to join the so-called Anglo-American front, sending troops to Burma and India to have East Asians slaughter East Asians. Recently, as their violence has been successively defeated by the armed forces of our ally Japan, and their bases of aggression in East Asia are being lost day by day, they have become even more cunning. Moreover, disregarding the peaceful development of the areas under the rule of the National Government, they have instigated elements from Chongqing to continuously harass us, hindering the progress of various constructions, and directly using their own aircraft, based in Chongqing, to repeatedly bomb our Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, massacring civilians. The elements in Chongqing, willingly driven by the United Kingdom and the United States, shamefully act as rebels of East Asia. The United Kingdom and the United States, harboring deep-seated intentions towards East Asia, exhaust their ability to sow discord, in order to achieve their ultimate ambition of annexation, which is something that all East Asian nations should unite against. The National Government hereby declares that, from today onwards, it is in a state of war with the United Kingdom and the United States, and will devote all its strength to cooperate with its ally Japan, to sweep away the brutality of the United Kingdom and the United States, in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The two countries of Manchukuo and Thailand have long maintained friendly relations and share the same heart for the prosperity of East Asia. In the future, we should further promote cooperation in order to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality and virtue. Our allied countries of Germany and Italy have been engaged in a struggle with the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States in the West for several years, achieving glorious victories. Our country now joins the Greater East Asia War, and we should echo each other, in order to ensure the implementation of a just new order for the entire world. All our citizens should always know that this is the only opportunity to realize the grand Pan-Asianism of the Founding Father of the Republic, the revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the protection of the faith, justice and peace of the entire world. Let us be of one mind and one heart, and work hard from beginning to end, in order to thoroughly fulfill the great mission of this great era!

January 9th, the 32nd year of the Republic of China Chairman: Wang Zhao Ming

### ABCD Coastline - The Focus of the European Landing Campaign

In recent days, in the southern region of the Eastern Front, from Kuiavia in former Poland in the north to Nikolaev at the lower reaches of the Bug River in the south, the German and Soviet armies have launched large-scale offensive and defensive battles. The vanguard of Konev's Soviet forces, their momentum undiminished, crossed the Dniester River on the 18th, mustering their remaining courage, and invaded Bessarabia province of Romania.

Strengthening Daylight Air Raids

Echoing the fierce offensives of the Soviet army on the Eastern Front, the issue of the Anglo-American opening of a second front in Western Europe has once again attracted attention. Originally, at the Tehran Conference, the United Kingdom and the United States had assured the Soviet Union that they would launch a war in Western Europe when the situation on the Eastern Front reached its most opportune moment. Recently, the Anglo-American attempt to destroy German-occupied territories and German industrial areas, and to reduce the strength of the German fighter fleet, and strengthen daylight air raids, is actually the prelude to a landing operation. In addition, the re-activation of the Cassino front in southern Italy and the concentration of large forces in the port of Naples, to distract German forces and conduct a diversionary operation in the south, is noteworthy. Therefore, the opening of a second front seems to be an increasingly urgent matter.

If the United Kingdom and the United States were to conduct a landing operation in Western Europe, where would they choose the location? There are varying opinions. In order to cover up the main attack or to disperse German forces, new operations may be launched in Italy, the Balkans, southern France, and Northern Europe, in order to prepare for the main landing. The northern coast of France remains the most talked-about landing site in Western Europe. Using this as a base for landing operations, it is closest to the British mainland, and the use of ships and the support of the air force are most advantageous. On the British side, there is also the intention to retaliate for the defeat at Dunkirk in 1940.

Assuming that the United Kingdom chooses this location, the United Kingdom and the United States boast that 10,000 aircraft have been assembled in southern England, waiting for the opportunity to move. About seventy divisions of Anglo-American Allied forces will cross the English Channel and arrive in northern France, determined to carry out a major adventure.

Topography of Northern France

The topography of the northern French coastal area, the imagined landing site of the Anglo-Americans, is a coastline generally open at a right angle with Cape Gris-Nez in the Pas-de-Calais department as its vertex. Centered on Cape Gris-Nez, the coastline extends approximately 50 kilometers from the port of Calais in the north to Boulogne-sur-Mer in the south. The famous white cliffs of Dover have been eroded by the waves for thousands of years, forming an average width of about 200 meters of cliff formations. However, the German defensive positions in this area are extremely solid, and the terrain is favorable, forming an impregnable wall. It would be extremely difficult for Anglo-American landing craft to approach. The enemy may avoid choosing a location near Cape Gris-Nez, and instead turn to the flat coastline of white sand and green pines extending south from Boulogne-sur-Mer to Abbeville, or the coastline north from the port of Calais to the area near Dunkirk, where the British army retreated from Europe in the past. The railways and waterways in this area are well-developed in all directions, making it a battlefield since ancient times.

Abbeville is abbreviated as A, Boulogne-sur-Mer as B, Calais as C, and Dunkirk as D. This connected area is called the ABCD coastline of northern France, which is most coveted by the Anglo-Americans. At present, the warm spring has arrived, the weather is turning warmer, and the days are getting longer, which is gradually favorable for landing operations. The Allies may take advantage of this opportune time and favorable location to launch a counter-offensive on the northern French coast in an attempt to open a second front. But it is more appropriate to say that the opportune time and favorable location are on the German side, rather than on the Anglo-American side.

In mid-February of this year, the German army achieved results in the air raid on London. Over the past year, the German army has patiently abandoned the Eastern Front, accumulating forces, and has the ambition to rebuild the air force. In addition, the new type of bomb cannon has been developed, shooting down aircraft with unparalleled accuracy. The construction of the second and third supplementary fortress lines has made the fortress line on the Western European coast, especially the northern French coast, as solid as iron. The German troops guarding this fortress are waiting for the enemy to attack from the sea and give them a head-on blow. It is expected that the English Channel will witness the largest annihilation battle in history, and the raging tide of the Channel will be dyed red with blood.

### Today is the Fourth Air Defense Day - Rescue Training to be Held - Thousands of Members of the City's Defense Corps Mobilized

Today (9th) is the fourth Air Defense Day. In order to strengthen the city's air defense, thousands of members of the city's defense corps will be mobilized to devote their full efforts to rescue training. The City Air Defense Headquarters will dispatch a large number of instructors to various locations to provide guidance. What the relevant authorities are most concerned about is the comprehensive training of Chinese and foreign citizens to be carried out in front of the Telegraph Bureau within the jurisdiction of the Hongkou Branch, or on Minhang Road, from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM this afternoon. In addition, China Film Company has specially dispatched photographers to various locations to capture materials suitable for the air defense headquarters' current plan to produce air defense films.

Air Defense Headquarters Distributed Air Defense First Aid Kits to Various Schools Yesterday

The City Air Defense Headquarters held a ceremony at 10:30 AM yesterday (8th) to donate air defense first aid kits to various schools. 430 air defense first aid kits were donated to 38 schools that participated in the air defense badge charity sale movement on the first Air Defense Day, January 9th of this year. At a time when various materials are scarce and it is difficult to purchase materials needed for first aid, fortunately, the citizens sympathize with and understand the schools' air defense, so the plan to prepare and distribute air defense first aid kits to various schools can be fulfilled as desired, making the fourth Air Defense Day even more meaningful, which is truly gratifying. The Air Defense authorities are now working hard to strengthen the air defense facilities of various schools and plan to hold another charity sale movement. We sincerely hope that citizens from all walks of life will cooperate. During the donation ceremony, the Air Defense Headquarters also awarded bonuses to the schools with the best results in the previous charity sale movement, such as Feihong Model Primary School, Chengyi Middle School, Zhabei Primary School, and Municipal Model Middle School, each receiving a bonus. Director Sun of the General Affairs Department spoke on behalf of Director Chen, saying: "I am Sun, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the City Air Defense Headquarters. I am honored to be able to take this opportunity to speak to you on behalf of Director Chen. January 9th of this year is the anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war. In order to reveal the true meaning of participating in the war, and to devise countermeasures to cope with extraordinary times, the City Air Defense Headquarters designated this day as the first Air Defense Day, in order to awaken citizens' attention to air defense. At the same time, an air defense badge charity sale movement was held, inviting various schools in the city to participate to provide assistance. The total amount of money raised from the charity sale has been published in the newspapers on March 9th. Shanghai is not only the center of China, but also a major center of East Asia today. It is difficult to predict when the enemy planes will bomb us, but the Headquarters' responsibility lies in making efforts to properly prepare measures to ensure safety, which requires the spiritual and material preparations of the general public. Air defense in schools is also necessary. Today, first aid kits are distributed to various schools. In terms of both quality and quantity, these first aid kits are not perfect, but the intention of the Headquarters is to use this opportunity to enable each school to expand the expansion of first aid equipment within its possible range, and it is also necessary to expand fire prevention and evacuation facilities, so that air defense in schools can be further strengthened, so that Shanghai's air defense affairs can be perfected."

For the sake of your own life and property, don't leave lights exposed outdoors;

For the safety of our people, prepare everything without delay;

For the survival of our nation, concentrate all our strength to resist the enemy;

For the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia, everyone quickly rise up, rise up!

Air defense! Air defense! Quickly rise up—to defend against the air!

Air defense! Air defense! Everyone's unified—action!

Second Place

—Imitation of Man Jiang Hong—

Iron wings spread high, gazing at the sky, what difference is there from the battlefield? Don't believe it, look, the world is filled with the smoke of war, air raids are rampant. Swarms of planes directly attack collapsing tiles, a rain of bullets sweeps across crying flesh. Don't idly dream of safety, do your best.

Be highly vigilant, be careful with fire prevention, control the airspace, fortify the strongholds, cooperate with the military police to build iron walls of copper. Moths flying to the flame cannot intimidate the enemy, the bravery of my people will prevail. May our compatriots welcome the year of victory, and strive for self-improvement.

Air defense, air defense, work hard at air defense,

Don't treat life as worthless grass, or turn property into a desolate mound.

Air defense, air defense, work hard at air defense, when enemy planes come they are truly frightening, bombing is really fierce, bombs fall like a torrential rain, fires blaze red across the sky, people, livestock, and houses, everything turns to nothing.

If there is no preparation, the suffering will be endless. Air defense, air defense, work hard at air defense,

When the alarm sounds, don't panic, don't go outside unless necessary, better to hide at home,

Don't let lights be visible from outside, always have sand and water ready,

If neighbors suffer a disaster, quickly spread the word, rescue others and rescue yourself, cooperation requires division of labor,

Everyone work together, to protect the Shanghai sky,

Air defense, air defense, work hard at air defense, don't treat life as worthless grass, or turn property into a desolate mound.

National Forum

### Offering Some Opinions on Suppressing and Stabilizing Prices

— Chen Tianzhuo

The government authorities established the Materials Investigation Committee to suppress and stabilize prices. It has been more than two years since its establishment, but prices still continue to rise. Everyone believes that price increases are due to inflation and wartime supply shortages. This is certainly part of the reason, but the main reason is whether the authorities' management is effective. Japan is a good example. Since the start of the war, prices have only risen by an average of about two times. This proves that even during a period of inflation, suppressing and stabilizing prices is not fundamentally impossible. I will record my humble opinions as follows:

Ineffective Investigation: Investigators always base their investigation of shop prices on their invoices from the previous month. Is checking the prices of goods with old invoices reliable? It is very unreliable. We need to know the name of the goods, but the investigator has no way to start. Not only can the name of the goods be changed, but even the names and trademarks of the factory and wholesaler can be changed at any time. Today it is Xing Ji, tomorrow it can be Fa Ji; today it is Ma brand, tomorrow it can be N brand. In this way, there is no way to investigate.

The Impact of Price Increases on Rationed Goods: For example, household rice, flour, sugar, oil, cigarettes, etc., and even the price increases of public utilities can also affect the rising prices of other goods. For example, the price increase of household rice also caused the price of rice in the black market to rise. (This has always been the case). Recently, the price of beer doubled, and the black market also rose by one times. This is enough to affect the price increase of other goods. For example, if the ratio of item A to item B is 1 to 10, and now item A has risen by one times, it becomes 2 to 10, and item B must of course maintain a ratio of 10 to 1, and it also rises. A affects B, B affects C, C then affects D, and it continues to affect others, so the rising trend rises as a group. Therefore, very small things often have a big impact, so to the extent possible, the prices of public goods must not be raised.

Raising Price Limits: Raising the price limits of many goods often affects the price increase of other goods. Now, when the black market price often exceeds it, it is instead used as an excuse for black market prices "The price limit has reached so much." The black market naturally raises the price to a commensurate level. Therefore, setting a high price limit also violates the drawbacks of the second article, which is also raising the black market price.

I hope that the authorities will reform what is said above. At the same time, I suggest the following methods to prevent illegal hoarding and black market price gouging:

Because manufacturers and wholesalers raise prices, retail stores have to buy at high prices in order to operate (not necessarily close down). So they have no choice but to sell at higher prices. To control prices at the root, it must be implemented from manufacturers and wholesalers.

The products of factories should be graded A, B, C, and D according to their quality, and fair prices should be set. It is not allowed to manufacture a wide variety of goods, so as to standardize wartime production, and it will also be more convenient for investigation.

In addition to standardization of production, the name, number, price, and sample of the manufactured goods must be submitted to the authorities for recording before they can be sold.

All products of factories must indicate the date of production. Price increases are not allowed for all products of this period.

When retail stores sell goods, the invoice must indicate the name of the goods, factory number, item number, and price. If any of these is missing, it will be considered a black market transaction.

Personnel must be dispatched every day to supervise and inspect rationed goods to see if they are being sold off, short-weighted, or sold on the black market.

A general registration should be made for all inventory, regardless of stores, private individuals, factories, etc. The authorities should issue a registration certificate stating the name of the goods, owner, quantity, and location. In the future, sales must also be registered with the authorities for transfer of ownership, and the price must be stated to prevent black market transactions.

Investigate all warehouses, shops, and residences for illegal stockpiling, manage them, and sell them at the price limit.

Dispatch personnel to investigate all specialized speculation, black market businesses, commercial firms, and companies, and force them to close down with impartiality, to reduce the hotbeds of speculation and black market manipulation.

For entertainment venues such as dance halls, theaters, cafes, restaurants, tea rooms, or park tickets, etc., all should be limited and not allowed to raise prices freely. Although it is not important to the overall situation, it can also cause an increase in the cost of living index, which also affects the rise in prices of other goods.

Reward people for reporting illegal speculation and hoarding. If it is true, give appropriate rewards.

Finally, the authorities must pay absolute attention to the behavior of the investigators and send special personnel to supervise them to prevent bribery and fraud. As for the investigators, they also need to be transferred and moved to different places from time to time to reduce sentiment, power, bribery, and many other shortcomings. At the same time, the cunning merchants will not be able to cope with such different newcomers every time.

### A Glimpse of the Shanghai Huaiyou Orphanage

The Shanghai Huaiyou Orphanage is a religious organization that hosts an educational institution. It has been established for four years. During these four years, they have moved several times, from Yuyuan Road to Qingxin Girls' High School, and then from the girls' high school to its current location - Qingxin Hall at the Dafochang.

Although the living quarters were unstable during the four years, the educational work did not stop. The current number of children in their care is about 20. Because the place is small and temporary, they are not prepared to expand the number of children in their care. The children are between the ages of six and sixteen, both boys and girls. Most of these children ran away from home, and some were sent by the Children's Welfare Section.

According to the nanny, most of the children who come to the orphanage are children with problems. Because of the poor family environment, their character is affected. The approach is still to transform them in a family-like manner.

Their lives are relatively simple. They go to class in the morning and are divided into senior and junior classes. After 1:00 PM in the afternoon, they do handicrafts. The only craft is sewing. The clothes they sew are for their own use and are not made for others. At 8:00 PM in the evening, there is a family gathering to review their lives.

Reformed Children

There is a girl who has lived here for the longest time, and has been here for three years. At first, because she could not stand the abuse of her stepmother, she ran away in anger. After arriving at the orphanage, she often quarreled with other children and ran away again. Later, she was taken in by the Children's Welfare Section. The nanny went to see her, and she cried. She confessed that running away at the beginning was wrong, and she was willing to return to the orphanage, but according to the rules of the orphanage, children who ran away were not allowed to return. Finally, because of her plea, she was given the opportunity to return. After that, she realized that running away was not a good thing, and her behavior gradually improved. The orphanage sent her to the Public Concession Children's School, and she has been ranked first in the past two years. What she hopes for now is to learn a skill at the orphanage, so that she can serve society in the future.

Their current house is borrowed from Qingxin Hall. The place is narrow and they cannot live there for a long time. The most urgent problem at the moment is the problem of the house. The nanny said to me: If the house can be a little bigger, they can increase the number of children they can take in, but the current house requires a large transfer fee, which they certainly cannot afford. They hope that enthusiastic individuals or organizations in society can help them solve the problem of the house, which is what they pray for most.

### The Navy

"Perhaps the second Japan-Netherlands naval battle has already taken place." Kato took a deep breath of smoke and said this. Shinzhen had not yet smoked, so he sat quietly, feeling the caress of the breeze.

"Perhaps in this war, Germany also needs battleships very much. The main thing is air combat and submarine warfare!"

"They will definitely bomb London and Paris thoroughly!"

"Is France's Maginot Line really solid?" What is more important than this is that we should know how powerful the HMS "George V" and HMS "Prince of Wales" are."

"I heard that the 40,000-ton "Lion" class battleship secretly started construction this year."

Their center of interest, or rather, what attracted their fervent emotion, was the British Navy.

"However, will the United States rise up and participate in the war?"

"Perhaps they will join the war soon."

Everyone agreed with this, so they were silent for a moment. Tsunashi Nakano said in a low voice: "Shouldn't we participate in the war a little sooner?"

These words seemed to have touched everyone's feelings like something, and they burst into laughter involuntarily. However, the laughter disappeared immediately.

"What exactly will our empire do?"

Okazaki said this, which caused everyone to think. Now they are no longer students at the naval academy, and they are qualified to talk about such issues.

"Now is not the time to talk about bizarre and absurd things!"

"The Pacific Ocean will definitely be affected."

"This requires preparation..."

"Hmph, preparations have long been completed. Now it's just a question of how to decide. Old Tani, what do you say?"

Nakano asked this, and Shinzhen finally opened his mouth.

"Everything is waiting for orders."

The voyage from Xiamen to Sasebo was the first long voyage they had ever experienced. Various training exercises were held along the way. Once, the main gun roared with a loud bang. There was also an incident in which the small team commanded by Shinzhen was the first to salvage a hypothetical drowning person - a soy sauce barrel - during a rescue operation.

All the cadets' hearts were inclined towards ocean navigation, but they could not afford to lightly ignore the Sasebo naval port. Because in their hearts, a fraction of them had the idea of making this naval port their home port in the future. Moreover, because on the boards of their minds, they remembered that this naval port had played a great role during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 and the Russo-Japanese War. Whether it was the island shadow of Bantentao or the prosperity of Sakaemachi, they were all deeply imprinted in their eyes, so much so that they could never forget them.

### Colleagues at the Huada Factory Generously Donate 10,000 Yuan to Charity

Mr. Pan Yangyao sent a letter yesterday, stating: "The Dahua Factory, which I co-founded with friends, has long been closed. I sympathize with the difficulty of maintaining charitable organizations in Shanghai. Relief is really necessary. Therefore, with the consent of my colleagues, I have specially withdrawn funds at the time of closing to be used for public welfare. I am hereby donating Central Reserve Certificates worth 10,000 yuan to your organization. I know that a cup of water cannot put out a cartload of fire, but it is my humble intention to hope that the industrial and commercial circles will share this sentiment and provide funds at any time to be used for charitable purposes. This can serve as a preliminary initiative, and perhaps a good atmosphere can be created. This is what my colleagues and I earnestly pray for. Sincerely, to the New General Charity Hall." (Note: The donation will be forwarded to the New General Charity Hall and thank you on their behalf.)
