### Do Not Be New Jews

Some people say that a portion of Shanghai people are new Jews. This statement is a tremendous disgrace to the people of Shanghai. To wash away this shame, we must demonstrate through actions that Shanghai people do not possess a Jewish mentality, that Shanghai people are fundamentally not new Jews.

The first characteristic of Jews is that they are solely driven by profit. Because they are solely driven by profit, they disregard everything and stop at nothing to desperately seek money. For money, they can disregard their reputation; they can engage in all kinds of deceitful, vulgar, and despicable activities that ordinary people cannot imagine; they are willing to sacrifice their character and disregard all moral constraints. Such people are of no benefit to anyone or to society; naturally, they are despised by society and abandoned by it. If Shanghai people do not want to be Jews, then psychologically, they must first remove the two words "solely profit." We must be driven by "solely righteousness." Righteousness means appropriateness. Anything that should be done, whether it is profitable or not, we should do. Anything that should not be done, no matter how great the benefits, we must never do. Confucius said, "The gentleman understands righteousness, the petty man understands profit," and also said, "Wealth and rank obtained through unrighteousness are like floating clouds to me." The first statement illustrates the difference between righteousness and profit for gentlemen and petty men; the second statement illustrates that unrighteous wealth and rank are like floating clouds, which can dissipate in an instant. These two statements, in the current extraordinary environment, more easily reveal their certainty and are worthy of everyone's deep reflection.

The second characteristic of Jews is egoism. Jews can truly be said to be the standard of "not doing it even if it benefits the world by plucking out a single hair." For the sake of themselves, they can disregard all feelings, disown their relatives and friends, and engage in all kinds of shameless actions. They can even harm their friends, society, and their country. Who would want to be friends with such people? What country would want such people as citizens? The fundamental reason why Jews can only be solitary, wandering exiles is precisely this. If Shanghai people do not want to be Jews, then psychologically, they must remove the two words "egoism." We must "sacrifice ourselves to benefit others." Although we may not be able to "wear out our hair and wear down our heels to benefit the world," we should always engrave this great spirit of benefiting others in our hearts, and we should always make it the standard for our actions.

The Jews' sole pursuit of profit and their egoism have caused them to lose their homeland. The Jews are forever a stateless people in the world, and they have become true and thorough stateless slaves. People of Shanghai, think, do we have the mentality of being solely driven by profit and egoism? Do we have actions motivated by profit and egoism? If we do, then we are following in the footsteps of the Jews, pursuing the path of becoming stateless slaves. We must quickly correct ourselves, strive for reform, and become citizens of the Republic of China anew.

In this newspaper's editorial on the 20th, regarding the police consumer cooperative, we raised the issue of the general wealthy class being indifferent to social welfare and indulging in extravagance and excess for their own enjoyment. These are all Jewish mentalities and Jewish actions, and Shanghai people should painfully and resolutely eliminate them. The reason why we are verbally and in writing criticizing is that the development of these behaviors is enough to destroy Shanghai and its people. The police consumer cooperative is a test of how many people in Shanghai "sacrifice themselves to benefit the group." Moreover, the advance payment is not a donation, so there is fundamentally no need to "sacrifice oneself." Maintaining civic order, "benefiting the group" is "benefiting oneself." We are willing to wait and see the reduction of a portion of the new Jews in Shanghai.

### Ten Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in the Sea West of Sumatra, Japanese Forces on High Alert in the Indian Ocean

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 21st: On the morning of April 19th, an enemy task force appeared off the west coast of Sumatra and attacked Sabang Island. Japanese forces immediately engaged, shooting down ten enemy aircraft. Japanese losses were light. Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – The commander of the anti-Axis forces in Southeast Asia, Mountbatten, in order to cover up the defeat on the Indo-Burmese border, will launch some kind of naval operation in the Indian Ocean. This has long been anticipated by the Japanese. Therefore, the Japanese army stationed in the area is constantly on high alert. As expected, on the morning of April 19th, under the command of Admiral Somerville, commander of the British Indian Ocean Fleet, the enemy task force advanced into the waters west of Sumatra, with approximately 90 aircraft from the fleet attacking the Japanese base on Sabang, north of Sumatra. The attacking enemy task force was mainly composed of one or two aircraft carriers, with a bomber group escorted by fighter planes. When news of the enemy attack arrived, the Japanese forces stationed in the area immediately engaged, leading to a fierce aerial battle. As announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, ten enemy aircraft were shot down, and Japanese losses were extremely light.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – On the Indo-Burmese border, since the Japanese army launched the offensive into India, the fall of Imphal is imminent. The anti-Axis forces are deeply embarrassed by repeated defeats and active criticism from all sides. At the same time, in his embarrassment, Mountbatten has moved his headquarters to Ceylon. To cover up the defeat at Imphal, he recently attempted to launch some kind of offensive in the Indian Ocean. It is believed that this raid on the waters west of Sumatra by the enemy task force is a manifestation of his offensive. The enemy aircraft attacks on the waters of Sumatra have been very frequent since the end of last year, but have subsided somewhat since the beginning of this year. Since March, only three enemy Mosquito aircraft have attacked the Andalas area, one large enemy aircraft attacked the Simeulue area southwest of Sumatra on March 26th, and twelve enemy aircraft attacked Port Blair. Under these circumstances, there has been no significant change in the Indian Ocean theater. However, the Japanese army's engagement with the British army on the Indo-Burmese border will likely cause some kind of movement in the Indian Ocean war situation. This has long been anticipated. Now, the Japanese side is fully prepared to counterattack in the Indian Ocean, awaiting the enemy's arrival.

### Imphal Area Has Entered Fortress Warfare, Enemy Forces in Eastern India Greatly Reduced

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – From a certain base on the Indian front: The enemy's Fourth Corps, which is stubbornly resisting the southward advance of the Japanese-Indian army units on the line of defense more than ten kilometers north of Imphal and is desperately trying to stop the advance of the elite Japanese-Indian troops south of Imphal, is putting up an unusually fierce resistance because the Imphal northern position and Palel are their lifeline. However, due to the continuous fierce attacks by the Japanese-Indian allied forces, the enemy army has suffered heavy losses, and the Japanese-Indian army's encirclement is gradually shrinking. The Fourth Corps' combat power has weakened significantly, and the enemy's losses are most severe in the 17th Division, reaching at least 30,000 or more. The British-Indian army's 36th Division and mechanized 44th Division, which were dispatched by the 33rd Corps, the Eastern India General Reserve, to the front of Kohima, have also suffered heavy losses due to the fierce attacks by the new Indian army. Therefore, the enemy army's troop movements in eastern India are in a state of distress.

Zurich, 21st (Central News Agency) – According to United Press International: The anti-Axis command in Ceylon announced: "The Japanese-Indian army in the Indo-Burmese border has launched a very intense attack on Imphal and Kohima in the past 24 hours." It is rumored that bloody battles are unfolding in the area. Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the Assam front: The Imphal capture operation is gradually evolving into fortress warfare. Although the enemy army is in chaos under the fierce attacks of the Japanese-Indian army, they still hope for the arrival of the rainy season and are deploying their air and land forces to the area, attempting to launch a desperate counterattack. The battle situation in the area is extremely fierce. The Japanese army's fierce attacks have indeed been effective, and the area is now being gradually encircled.

### Manganese Ore Discovered in Korea

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – A large manganese ore deposit has recently been discovered near Cheorwon in Gangwon Province, Korea.

The Geological Survey Institute of the Government-General of Korea has also organized a special inspection team, which will conduct on-site surveys in the Gyeongseong (Seoul) area from the 22nd and is scheduled to return by the end of the month.

### Propaganda Guidance Department Announces Special Broadcast

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) – U.S. Secretary of State Hull's so-called foreign policy speech on April 13th contains many contradictions.

### Anhui's First District Clearing and Suppression Office Investigates Japanese Language Schools

### Zhenjiang Begins Levying Land Tax

The Taxation Administration Bureau is following the regulations and organizing a land valuation committee for the urban area, with County Magistrate Zhang serving as the chairman.

### Enemy Attack on Sabang Island Strategically Unimportant

Central News Agency, Shanghai – The sudden dispatch of a task force by the enemy Southeast Asia anti-Axis Command to attack Sabang Island at the western tip of Sumatra is a perfunctory tactic adopted by enemy commander Mountbatten after continuous defeats due to extreme boredom. The following is a summary of the opinions of local military experts regarding the enemy's action:

Since taking office on August 25th of last year, the enemy Southeast Asia anti-Axis commander Mountbatten has been loudly proclaiming the slogan of a counteroffensive in Southeast Asia, but in reality, there have been no significant achievements to speak of. On the contrary, the elite Japanese army units stationed in Burma broke through the Indo-Burmese border, causing major threats to the Bengal-Assam railway, a vital artery in the area. This has caused absolute dissatisfaction from the United States and the Chongqing government. In order to placate this dissatisfaction, the enemy launched the attack on Sumatra. However, Sabang Island, the target of the enemy attack, is a small island located at the westernmost end of the Japanese-controlled area. Strategically, it is not very important. The enemy's propaganda claims to have achieved great results, but in reality, it is impossible to achieve great results in this strategically unimportant location. Furthermore, the enemy's attacking force is said to be a large fleet composed of battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, and submarines, but in reality, the enemy fleet in the area is merely a collection of remnants of defeated ships from the Western Pacific and European theaters, with no real strength. The enemy's action will have absolutely no impact on the Japanese-Indian allied forces' liberation of India. If its purpose is to contain the Japanese-Indian allied forces in India, then even Mountbatten, as foolish as he is, would not launch such an attack, which would only be a futile waste of energy. Moreover, the enemy's Southeast Asia Army Headquarters has moved to Ceylon, and the enemy air force under General Manner is said to have moved from New Delhi to Calcutta, so the battle situation in the area seems to be gradually shifting from land to sea. The Japanese navy is currently considering all conditions and waiting for an opportunity. If the enemy dares to launch a large-scale offensive, it will be completely destroyed.

### Industrial and Commercial Enterprise Investigation Committee Decides on Work Guidelines, Emphasizing Business Conditions and Capital Integrity

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) – In order to investigate the actual situation of industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai, with a view to promoting sound organization and increasing production, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has joined forces with the Shanghai Municipal Government to establish an Industrial and Commercial Enterprise Investigation Committee. The committee's internal personnel have been jointly appointed by the ministry and the Shanghai government, and prominent figures in the industrial sector have been invited to serve as members. It is reported that the committee's work will focus on investigating the business conditions of various enterprises, their internal situations, and related businesses. Therefore, the establishment of the committee is of great concern to all parties, and high expectations are placed on it. In order to understand the committee's future work guidelines and the specific assistance it will provide to industrial and commercial enterprises, the reporter visited the person in charge of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and inquired about everything. According to the official, "The ministry has noted that since the outbreak of the war, many industrial and commercial enterprises have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, especially in Shanghai. In order to establish close contact with various companies and enable them to develop normally with sound organization, the ministry will join forces with the Shanghai government and invite prominent figures from the industrial and commercial sectors to jointly organize this committee. Regarding the main tasks in the future, the first is to investigate the business conditions of companies, the integrity of their capital, and the situation after capital increases, to determine whether they are engaged in legitimate business or using speculative funds to manipulate hoarding and profiteering illegally. Therefore, in order to understand the truth, the ministry has distributed various forms to manufacturers for verification and will then provide assistance or make adjustments based on the situation. The ministry has also agreed with relevant parties to implement loans to enable them to purchase and store raw materials for continuous production. Otherwise, if the situation is not clearly investigated, unscrupulous elements may use these funds to fuel hoarding, which would harm society and the people's livelihood. Therefore, the main task is to investigate the content. Furthermore, regarding adjustments, the ministry is also planning to consolidate factories, such as match factories and soap factories, by considering the situation and encouraging them to merge in order to concentrate the electricity and materials of various factories and choose a factory with more favorable conditions to start production. In this way, production can be fully and continuously increased. The owners of the merged factories can also obtain considerable profits at the same time. This measure has now been implemented, and the factory owners have expressed their agreement. Therefore, it is expected that considerable results will be achieved in the future, not only avoiding the hoarding and manipulation of speculative funds but also actively increasing production to achieve a balance between supply and demand.

### Japanese Aircraft Bomb Hanzhong Airfield

Amidst heavy enemy ground fire, Japanese air warriors fiercely attacked their runways and military facilities, crushing their plans. The Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.

### Central Political Council Passes List of Third Legislative Yuan Members

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Central Political Council held its 134th meeting yesterday (the 20th) and passed the list of members of the first session of the Third Legislative Yuan as follows: Chen Jinshou, Lian Long, Zhu Qiaoyue, Lan Wenjin, Zhang Shijie, Zhang Yi, Li Qiguang, Lin Guocai, Zhao Yongbai, Wen Zizhen, Zhu Dazhang, Zeng Xing, Ai Ludan, Xie Chongfang, Fan Xinshan, Huang Qingzhong, Zhou Zhengyi, Ji Hua, Long Muzu, Kuang Jing, Zhao Shuangfeng, Zhao Nuo, Han Qingjian, Huang Ti'lian, Huang Qizhong, Cen Dexian, Wu Chengyu, Mo Guokang, Wang Yusheng, Sun Zhuojing, Lei Bisi, Wu Tunan, Kuang Yunyou, Ju Yu, Huang Qingwu, Wu Taqing, Su Liping, Zhang Fuzeng, Chen Yi'jiong, Li Jinggang, Zhou Kuang, Wang Shouyi, Qian Jiuwei, Hua Jianchao, Sun Jiwu, Zheng Chengyi, Peng Ximing, Mei Songnan, Li Guochang, Hu Yongyi, Liu Weiru, Zong Weigong, Tan Kongxin, Zhou Jin, Zhang Jianqing, Cai Dingcheng, Xu Qingqi, Ji Guoyi, Zhang Binghui, and Zhang Runsan, totaling sixty people.

### The Chongqing Side Encounters a Profound Crisis; The Solution to the CCP Issue

Central News Agency report: Recently, Chongqing has gradually abandoned "democracy" and moved towards a dictatorial system, which has aroused discussion in American public opinion. Whether this move by American public opinion is a momentary disillusionment with "Free China" among American intellectuals, or a reflection of the intentions of the American authorities, is still unclear. However, this kind of American public opinion seems to have given the Chongqing authorities a considerable shock. Regarding this matter, Liang Han-tsao, Minister of Propaganda of the Chongqing government, said when recently meeting with foreign reporters: The Chongqing side is like a dilapidated house, and is now embarking on the path of

Democratic Nation

construction, so please forgive any imperfections. This proves that the Chongqing side has indeed been shaken. Even within the Chongqing regime itself, various criticisms have been made against Chongqing's undemocratic methods, which is truly eye-opening. At the same time, Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan of Chongqing, also expressed his opinion in a recent speech, saying that the Kuomintang has not been able to realize democracy in the past twenty years, and that the Kuomintang has lost its inherent characteristics and fallen into a domineering attitude and habit, strongly urging the authorities to reform this undesirable phenomenon. Because Chiang Kai-shek, in order to strengthen his dictatorial power, has fought with a small number of political enemies in the past, his

Fundamental Problem

in domestic affairs is how to handle the CCP issue. The CCP is deliberately demanding that the Chongqing regime thoroughly implement democratic politics. From Chiang Kai-shek's point of view, it is naturally reasonable to believe that the CCP is eager to usurp the Chongqing regime. At the same time, Chongqing's distress lies in economic difficulties. Foreign reporters recently pointed out the chaos under inflation, saying: The general public in Chongqing is extremely uneasy about their lives due to the economic chaos. It is worth noting whether Chongqing can implement democracy and grasp the power of control to alleviate the people's suffering. On the other hand, Chiang Kai-shek fears hurting the feelings of the United States, so Chongqing has no choice but to pretend to implement democracy. Given all these realities, Chongqing, one of the world's four major democracies, is indeed facing a profound crisis.

### German Commentator Observes That the Invasion of Europe is Imminent; Britain Will Surely Reap What It Sows

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch): According to Huitong News Agency, Pang Jiazi published an essay in the current issue of "Deutsche Wochenzeitung," stating that because President Roosevelt needs an overwhelming victory as a pretext for his re-election, because Churchill believes that an early end to the war is most beneficial to Britain, and because Stalin's means and insatiable greed are increasingly exposed, the three factors together determine that the timing of the invasion of Europe, which cannot be delayed beyond two months, has long been decided. The talk of invasion of Europe is no longer just enemy propaganda or a tactic for the anti-Axis forces to divert attention from their overwhelming difficulties. The author also raises a question that German newspapers have never touched upon before: "What will happen if the offensive fails?" The author answers that when the European countries that hope to restore the old order of 1939 with the help of Britain and the United States begin to collapse internally, the end of the opponents of the new Europe led by Germany will be at hand. Those who dream of relying on Britain to contain the Bolshevik surge and adopt a wait-and-see policy will awaken with a start. When the British witness the defeated troops returning home in a disheveled state, realizing that they are already powerless to deal with European affairs, how intense will the political and spiritual turmoil in their country be? After four and a half years of war, Britain has lost its world prestige and power. When it gains new allies, will it still be able to struggle to stand on its own?"

German Strategy

Pang then discussed the Eastern Front, saying in a tone that asks, "Is Germany's strategy this year to defend on the Eastern Front and fight quickly on the Western Front? After Germany has indeed eliminated the crisis on the Western Front, will it still move its troops eastward to determine the outcome? Or will it disregard the situation on the Western Front and directly attempt to settle the Eastern Front?" In answering these questions, the author insisted that anyone who does not judge the military situation based on gains or losses of territory would hardly believe that the situation on the Eastern Front is on the verge of despair. However, anyone familiar with modern military tactics knows that the Soviet Union has only recovered its lost territory and has not yet won a decisive victory over the German army. At any time, the German army has the possibility of challenging the Soviet army again, which is enough to show the combat power and courage of the German army. As for Germany's plans after the enemy collapses, the author believes that they are too extensive and should not be mentioned for the time being.

### Only Germany Can Prevent the Eastward Expansion of Communist Forces; Goebbels Publishes an Essay

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch): Huitong News Agency: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels warned the people of Europe in yesterday's "National Weekly" that even if Britain and the United States want to fulfill their promise to save the people from communism, they are completely unable to do so. It is a great mistake to say that communists will not be able to control Europe after they win. Even if individual countries launch resistance attempts, their strength is insufficient, and they will inevitably be resolved, and their leaders will be exiled to Siberia. No one can believe the reassuring words of British and American diplomats to neutral countries, but neutral countries have to pretend to trust them in order to escape unpleasant realities. Under these circumstances, if Europe does not have Germany's existence, it will inevitably suffer the scourge of war. If Germany's resistance weakens or collapses, then I ask, is there any other country that can stop the Soviet army from expanding eastward?

### The Mystery of Eden and American Deputy Secretary of State's Whereabouts

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch): Huitong News Agency: At yesterday's intelligence conference for foreign reporters of the German Foreign Ministry, the issue of the current whereabouts of British Foreign Secretary Eden was raised. A spokesperson stated that it seems that American Deputy Secretary of State Stettinius has also left London, and continued that whether Eden's trip is only a few kilometers or as far as a thousand kilometers will be clear in the future.

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch): According to dispatches received here, Australian Prime Minister Curtin and his party arrived in San Francisco yesterday on their way to London to attend the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference.

Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch): Huitong News Agency: According to an announcement from Canberra, Australian Prime Minister Curtin has gone to London to attend the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference.

Mr. Fraser will occupy a seat in the War Cabinet. Chief of Staff Northcott will serve as Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Axis Armies, and Blamey will serve as Deputy Commander.

### Australian Army Chief Believes War Will Be Protracted

Geneva, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch): A German news agency quoted a report from Canberra as saying that Australian Army Chief Ford declared today: "Our efforts must not be slackened, because the war will at least or still need to be prolonged for several years."

### Fierce Fighting Underway in the Upper Reaches of the Dniester River; Mountain Troops Link Up with German Forces

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch): Huitong News Agency: The German army's resistance on the Eastern Front has strengthened. Except for the Crimea and the lower reaches of the Dniester, the Soviet army's offensive on all sections has weakened. The German army took the opportunity to counterattack, and the defensive lines they held have been improved, especially Narva and the Southern Route. The German army's counterattack in the area from Tallinn to Kovel (Delaynkovel) has caused considerable anxiety to the enemy. The German army's operations between Lutsk and Ternopil are already drawing to a close. A major battle is currently taking place between Stanisławów and Buczacz, which is of great strategic significance. The troops operating between the Carpathians and Ternopil have made progress towards Czernowitz and Skala. The Crimean war is intensifying, forming a battle for Sevastopol. The German and Romanian coalition forces are holding mountain positions, and repelling the invading enemy forces head-on very smoothly. It is still difficult to predict how it will develop.

Budapest, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch): Huitong News Agency: The Hungarian army's war report yesterday stated that the Hungarian mechanized infantry operating between Halych and Stanisławów, after occupying Nadworna, have made contact with the mountain troops operating northwest of Tallinn and the friendly forces advancing from Stanisławów. Responsible military officials told Huitong News Agency that the Hungarian army's counteroffensive against the Soviet army in the upper reaches of the Dniester River and the Carpathians is proceeding smoothly. The Hungarian troops that had been operating independently have made contact with the two forces, so the Hungarian united front has now been established in the Kolomea area. The Soviet army is now making a full-scale retreat to prevent the Hungarian army from continuing to advance.

### The Open and Covert Struggle Between Britain, America and the Soviet Union

The most prominent feature of the current international situation is the discord among Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, and the difficult situation of Britain. The most blatant expression of the discord among Britain, America, and the Soviet Union is the Soviet Union's formal recognition of the Badoglio regime. The opposition of Britain and America to the Soviet Union is precisely what the Soviet Union wants.

Britain and America initially thought that the Soviet Union was the most opposed to Badoglio. Churchill's statement said: "The British government supported the Badoglio regime before entering Rome." It still indicates that Badoglio will not be recognized in the future. According to the Manchester Guardian, the Soviet Union used this statement to instruct Italian communists to incite anti-British sentiment, and then suddenly recognized the Badoglio regime without consulting the British government, the Mediterranean Commission, and the European Commission. It is said that this was the plan of Vyshinsky, the Soviet representative in North Africa, and a manifestation of the Soviet Union's realistic diplomacy. When Roosevelt declared that the Italian fleet would be divided among the Soviet Union, Britain felt quite flustered, and opposed the move on the pretext that the Italian fleet would sink itself before extradition. The Soviet Union then recognized the Badoglio regime, expressing a friendly attitude, leaving Britain with no excuse.

The Mask of the Three-Nation Conference

British commentator Vernon Bartlett said in the London News Chronicle: "Because Britain and America want to allow Italy to withdraw from the war, they consulted with the Soviet Union to conclude an armistice treaty. The Soviet Union then formally recognized the Badoglio regime, which is incompatible with the armistice treaty."

The Times and other newspapers have also published similar arguments, saying that the interests and face of Britain and America have been completely overturned. Not only that, but the mask of the tripartite coordination advertised in the Moscow Conference and the Tehran Conference has also been completely exposed. American newspapers have also unanimously criticized and attacked the Soviet Union's attitude.

However, the discord is not only among Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, but also between Britain and America. America's threatening diplomacy towards countries such as Argentina, Spain, and Ireland has left Britain confused. If it succeeds, it is good, but if it fails, it will have no choice but to implement economic sanctions with the United States. However, in this way, it is Britain that is being blockaded. If Britain does not have meat from Argentina, zinc ore from Spain, and other things, it cannot endure it. However, the threatening diplomacy of Britain and America did not succeed, contrary to their expectations. This is because the credibility of Britain and America has been swept away, and the progress of the war has undermined their propaganda.

Excessive American Diplomacy

As for Britain's failure with Turkey, the Manchester Guardian said: "The failure of the Mediterranean front has hindered the establishment of Anglo-Turkish negotiations." Argentina did not accept America's demand for war against the Axis powers, and finally, under American pressure, President Ramirez formally announced his declaration of war, plus the recognition of the Farrell regime in Chile. Bolivia and Paraguay want to create a Pan-American bloc against American control. What is required of Spain is the complete withdrawal of volunteers on the Eastern Front, the transfer of Italian ships, the opening of the Tangier international zone, and the cessation of the supply of important materials to Germany. America is using material pressure, expecting to be able to succeed, but the situation has never materialized. The aforementioned Bartlett criticized the United States, saying:

Perhaps the action of suspending the import of meat from Argentina and zinc ore from Spain should be carefully discussed among Britain, America, and the Soviet Union before being implemented.

Criticism of Submitting to America

Regarding Ireland, British public opinion generally opposes following America and implementing economic sanctions. Britain and America also failed in the Finnish peace issue. The United States had already planned the Finnish peace last year, but it failed, and later Britain continued to work hard. Britain and America hoped that Finland would negotiate with the Soviet Union through Britain and America. However, the Soviet Union opposed advocating direct negotiations, and the Soviet Union and Finland disregarded Britain's efforts.

Roosevelt-Churchill New Talks

In response to the above situations, Britain and America have no choice but to seek new countermeasures. According to a Reuters dispatch from New York, Roosevelt and Churchill are preparing for new talks. It is said that the topics of discussion are the issue of recognizing the Badoglio regime after the occupation of Rome, issuing a new statement on postwar policies, unifying the various parties in the Southern Kingdom, and dealing with many political issues such as the countries that have withdrawn from the Axis.

The council has held meetings for several days to discuss preparatory matters, and they are now ready. The establishment meeting will be held at the Xingya Building on the afternoon of the 23rd of this month. The internal committee members will be two members selected by each organization participating in the organization, and the Minister of Industry will be the chairman. It is heard that after the establishment of the council, it also plans to establish "Regional Cotton Production Increase Agreement Councils" in major cotton-producing areas, and "Jiangbei Salt Reclamation Area Cotton Development Agreement Councils" in the Jiangbei salt reclamation area to handle cotton production increase matters in various regions. The list of committee members selected by the General Council is recorded below: Chairman Minister of Industry Chen, Vice Chairman Wen Lantao, Committee members Tong Lüqing, Tsutsumi Takashi (Cotton Control Council), Kōgami Yōichi, Chen Baochu (Yarn Factory Industry Association), Hishida Tsugu, Tomonaga Tōsaku (Japanese Spinning in China), Li Zuchu, Kobayashi (Cotton Production Improvement Association), Xue Xuesheng, Koike Katsu (Jiangbei Comprehensive Research Institute), Lin Qiming, Feng Junsheng (Cotton Industry Association), Horiyama Yasuo, Kamimatsu (Japanese Cotton Trade Association).

### Household Rice Planning Participation; Rumors of Price Increases Are Groundless; Ways to Make Up for Delayed Rations Will Be Found

The 63rd issue of household rice in the first district of this city and the 38th issue in other districts within the blockade line all began to be sold publicly starting yesterday (21st), at a price of 23 yuan per person for two liters. However, the rations for this period have been delayed due to the relationship with the purchasing procedures, resulting in various outside rumors, and there are also rumors of price increases. This reporter specially visited the relevant authorities yesterday, and it was learned that all of this is baseless. The authorities only have the intention of increasing rations, and they have never even considered the issue of price increases, and subsequent allocations can still be distributed on schedule. In addition, a decision has been made to find ways to reissue overdue rations, so citizens do not need to panic or allow unscrupulous merchants to take the opportunity to profit.

### Materials Investigation Committee; Eleventh Meeting

It has been learned that the council seized a case of private cotton yarn and cotton cloth, totaling 431 bolts and 99 sections of cotton cloth, 40 small packages. The National Commercial Control Association has been separately informed to go to the site for inspection and acceptance. The establishments opened for inspection included nine warehouses, one yarn factory, three cloth stores, two yarn stores, four cotton mills, and ten cloth factories, totaling 136 pieces of yarn, 3457 bundles, 763 catties, 32 boats, and 133 small packages, 10 pieces of cotton cloth, 12 bundles, 114615 feet, 4807 pounds, and 19206 bolts.

### Yesterday, Four Organizations Welcomed Japanese Minister Usami with a Grand Tea Party

Mr. Usami, the newly appointed minister of the Japanese ambassador's office in Shanghai, has assumed his new position. The Shanghai Benefit Association, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the China Civic Diplomacy Promotion Association, and the New News Federation jointly held a reception yesterday (the 21st) at 4:00 PM at the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association on the Bund to welcome him. Many people from various circles in China and Japan attended the event enthusiastically.

Attendees:

Principal guest Minister Usami and Secretary Nakamide arrived punctually. Guests included Matsuhara, head of the Information Department, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Section Chief Xiong, Director Su of the Police Bureau, Chairman Funatsu of the four organizations, President Osako, Mr. Komura, Mr. Akamatsu, Mr. Hidaka, Wen Lantao, Hugh Kang Hou, Li Sihao, Yuan Shu, Zhao Jinqing, Xiang Kangyuan, Min Bonjun, Xu Guanqun, Ren Xiaochi, Li Fang, Xu Jianping, Huang Yuqi, Wu Yunxiao, Chen Riping, Chen Shaogui, Jin Zongcheng, Zhou Mengbai, Lei Xianzhi, Xu Liqiu, Lu Feng, Zhao Ruli, Ling Daqi, Ren Yunpeng, and over two hundred others.

Chairman's Address:

First, Chairman Wen Lantao gave a brief speech, stating: "Today, the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, the Civic Welfare Association, the Civic Diplomacy Promotion Association, and the News Federation jointly welcome Minister Usami to take office in Shanghai. Minister Usami is an outstanding talent in the Japanese diplomatic world, with over thirty years of service and a long-standing reputation. Twenty years ago, he served as the Director of the Imperial Affairs Bureau of the League of Nations, already known internationally. In the 23rd year of the Republic, he came to China as Consul General in Fuzhou. When the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry was established the year before last, he served as the Director of the China Affairs Bureau, with great enthusiasm for Sino-Japanese cooperation. His appointment to Shanghai can be said to be a perfect fit. While expressing our sincere welcome, we hope that the Minister will treat each other with sincerity and promote the unfinished work of Sino-Japanese cooperation. Now, please Mr. Chen Binhe give a speech on behalf of us all."

Speech by President Chen of This Newspaper:

After the National Government returned to Nanjing, after China and Japan entered the war, after Japan implemented its new policy towards China, after China and Japan signed the alliance treaty, and after the Greater East Asia Conference issued a declaration, the meanings and spirits of all Sino-Japanese friendship terms such as Sino-Japanese cooperation, sharing joys and sorrows, and co-existence have long been determined and do not need further explanation and are no longer a problem. It can also be said that the entire destiny of East Asian co-prosperity and the destiny of Sino-Japanese cooperation have been determined and need no further explanation. The problem lies only in how to realize the "war participation," "new policy," "alliance treaty," "Greater East Asia Declaration," "Sino-Japanese cooperation," and "sharing joys and sorrows" to make them concrete and achieve common goals. If there are only good terms but they cannot be realized, they will become empty terms without underlying facts, and as time goes by, the general public will gradually become suspicious. Loss of faith due to suspicion is most dangerous. Therefore, we must urge both the Chinese and Japanese authorities to pay special attention to the issue of "implementation."

How to "implement"? Of course, it includes many issues. We believe that technical issues occupy a very important position. The editorial of the Shen Bao on the 17th welcomed Ogura, the supreme economic advisor, and said: "The main reason for the economic disease is poor politics, which should be reformed, but the technical aspects of economic measures are also very important. Especially when the principles and systems of economic measures have been determined, but must take into account the environment of adapting to national conditions and popular sentiments during implementation, measures are not immutable under the principle of not violating the wartime economy. For example, the system and principles of controlled economy are necessary for wartime countries, but when implemented in China, only its disadvantages are seen, and its benefits are not seen. China's implementation of control not only failed to stimulate production, but even hindered production. The reason is that it only knows how to swallow the principles whole and does not know how to adapt to the specific environment in terms of implementation technology." This needs to be repeated here. We believe that not only is this the case with the wartime economic control issue, but if everything related to Sino-Japanese cooperation has disadvantages and no benefits, or more disadvantages than benefits, the reasons should be studied. Why does it not work? It should also be thoroughly researched and remedied immediately. Therefore, if technical issues are not researched and resolved, and Sino-Japanese cooperation cannot be realized, the good intentions of the policy will disappear invisibly.

Shanghai's position is important, we have already said it, and the most important symptom of Shanghai's local disease is still the economic problem. Serious crises include soaring prices and declining production. Minister Usami is stationed in Shanghai and serves here, and he must already be keenly aware of the importance of Shanghai's position. The two economic crises of soaring prices and declining production must be well understood by the Minister. In that case, we hope that the Minister will provide special assistance in the technical aspects to find solutions to make Shanghai the economic center of the country and make contributions to the Greater East Asia War by integrating and leveraging economic power.

Finally, we know that Minister Usami is an outstanding talent in the diplomatic world of the allied nations. In the important position of Shanghai, in the complex environment, and in the face of the severe crisis, he will certainly be able to fulfill his mission of promoting Sino-Japanese cooperation by using his knowledge and experience within the scope of his duties.

Minister Usami's Speech:

Today, I am deeply grateful that the gentlemen of the four organizations in Shanghai have taken time out of their busy schedules to gather here for this grand welcome reception. Shanghai is the most important place for China's economy and culture, and it is also a place that has a closer relationship with Japan. My predecessor, Minister Tajiri, was honorably transferred to another position, and I am succeeding him with limited talent and shallow learning. On the one hand, I feel infinitely honored, and on the other hand, I feel a great responsibility. Before taking office, I served as the Director of the China Affairs Bureau of the Greater East Asia Ministry, and I have been handling matters related to China in Tokyo. Therefore, I am deeply concerned about enhancing Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation and the revival of China. I hope that the people of China and Japan can truly understand each other, be sincere, and cooperate closely to achieve the beautiful ideal of advancing towards the construction of a new East Asia. I am also prepared to do everything in my power to achieve this ideal. Regarding the various urgent issues at the moment, I am also prepared to observe the central policy, take into account the actual situation to determine the urgency, and gradually resolve them with mutual understanding and trust, and work with you to overcome this difficulty. I hope you will give me your full cooperation and assistance. In order to improve Sino-Japanese relations, the Japanese government first returned the concessions last year, revoked extraterritorial rights, and implemented resolute policies in politics and economics, sincerely cooperating with China. In short, the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty was concluded. The fundamental spirit of this consistent policy of Japan lies in restoring the natural state of relations between China and Japan, enabling China to restore its independent development of national power, and having China and Japan, the central countries of East Asia, jointly cooperate, eliminate the Anglo-American policy of aggression against East Asia for a century since the Opium War, establish a relationship of mutual trust and affection among the nations of East Asia, and move forward hand in hand, in order to establish a permanent foundation of coexistence and co-prosperity for all nations of Greater East Asia. Its spirit is exactly the same as the ideal of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration jointly issued by East Asian countries last year. The Japanese side has completely driven the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States, which hinder the construction of a new order, out of East Asia, and is fully cooperating with China to eliminate all past international and economic constraints so that China can develop independently and enhance cooperation between China and Japan. Japan's policy will remain unchanged in the future, and it will continue to do everything in its power to cooperate and make efforts in accordance with the established policy. However, at the same time, what must not be forgotten is that in order to realize this ideal of coexistence and co-prosperity for all countries in East Asia, each country and each nation must bear its own responsibility and make its own full efforts. As you all know, so-called coexistence and co-prosperity, so-called cooperation, are all based on the revival and progress of each country itself. The so-called revival and progress of each country must first rely on the efforts of the people of each country themselves. This is a natural principle, and as far as China is concerned, I also deeply believe that so far, the various new measures of the Japanese side will be difficult to achieve the desired results without the active efforts of the Chinese officials and people. For example, how China utilizes the return of the concessions and the transfer of military-managed factories, and how to achieve substantial effectiveness, all depend on the efforts of powerful people on the Chinese side. In other words, the most important issue in the future is to see how China can fully utilize its new materials to establish the foundation for China's truly independent self-existence. The National Government has fully considered this point and has worked hard in the past. Recently, it has further clarified that correcting thinking, ensuring security, and increasing production are the important policies at present, and is actively working hard to revive the countryside, revitalize production and industry, purify officialdom, and stabilize prices. I still feel that the National Government's policies will be difficult to be effective without the cooperation of the people. Therefore, I sincerely hope that you will fully recognize this point, cooperate with the government, and do your best to achieve the desired goals. It seems that I am saying too much in presenting this point. But because I love China and hope that China will be revived, I dare to make this expectation from the perspective of a friend of China, and I respectfully ask for your forgiveness. Moreover, the common war that we are waging to build Greater East Asia has entered the most intense decisive stage, and the prosperity of all countries in East Asia is tied to this. However, I firmly believe that Greater East Asia is gradually completing the goal of final victory in a sure-to-win and invincible posture. With this firm belief, we can generate the power to overcome all difficulties. Any country will inevitably have various spiritual and material difficulties during the war, which is a natural phenomenon, not only in China. I firmly believe that those who overcome the greatest difficulties will be able to achieve the greatest achievements. We must not be discouraged, pessimistic, or negative about the real difficulties, but actively persevere with courage and hope, and advance towards the completion of this great cause. Conversely, if we lose this hope and courage, East Asia will forever become a slave to the United Kingdom and the United States. Current issues, especially economic issues, are inevitably constrained by the wartime situation, and there must still be many difficult problems to solve. However, if we have sufficient creativity and thinking and make sincere and active efforts, I believe there will be a solution. Especially in Shanghai, which is an important city in China's political, economic, and ideological center, it is even clearer how much power the efforts of local social leaders have to solve problems and improve the situation. At the same time, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is often called for today, and I believe there is much to be done by all of you. Regarding Sino-Japanese relations, your country's father once said: "With Japan, there is China; without China, there is no Japan." Chairman Wang also mentioned that it is a relationship of sharing joys and sorrows and living and dying together. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the Chinese people can follow this instruction, cooperate with each other to overcome difficulties and reach the glorious shore. I firmly believe that only with the cooperation and efforts of all of you and us can we shorten the current time of sharing hardships and bring about the soon-to-come sharing of joys. Finally, I ask all of you to give more cooperation and efforts under this belief. The above is just to express my feelings, in order to thank you for your kindness. Finally, Li Fang, a member of the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, gave a speech, and the event ended in joy at about six o'clock.

### Burmese Representatives Arrive in Shanghai for the Third East Asian Medical Conference

The Third East Asian Medical Conference is scheduled to be held in Nanjing on the 25th of this month. Two special representatives from Myanmar, U Ba Than Hlaing, head of the Bureau of Sanitation of the Ministry of Education and Public Health of that country and Yangon, and U Mung Kan, Director of Public Health, departed from Yangon and arrived in Shanghai on the 19th of this month. Yesterday (the 21st) at 2:00 PM, they held a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters in the Shanghai Hotel on the 6th floor, and are scheduled to go to Nanjing tomorrow (the 23rd). According to Ba Than Hlaing and Mung Kan, there are six main topics for discussion at this conference, including lung disease, venereal disease, measles, bubonic plague, and serious infectious diseases. The conference will definitely play a major role in advancing medicine in Greater East Asia. They also said that Myanmar currently has two medical schools with more than 700 students. In order to meet wartime needs, the length of study has been shortened to five years in order to train a large number of medical talents. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the people of Myanmar have not only worked hard on construction, but also actively assisted neighboring countries in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. Myanmar is at the forefront, and there is a possibility of enemy air raids at any time throughout the country. However, officials and civilians across the country are responding to the enemy's frequent bombing with a fearless spirit. The government authorities have detailed plans for construction, but due to the impact of the war, they are gradually seeking to complete them as soon as possible. As for the cutting off of the Burma Road, it has no major impact on Myanmar itself.

### Strong Internal Defense Line of the Japanese Army in the Pacific, Remarks by Director Matsushima

The fleet press section of the Japanese army in Shanghai yesterday (the 21st), as usual, hosted a group of Chinese journalists, and gave a briefing. Director Matsushima, Lieutenant Ohta, the newly appointed Shanghai-based press officers Lieutenant Hirata, Liu Zhennan, and Wang Bingnan, attended. First, Lieutenant Ohta introduced Lieutenant Hirata to the reporters, and then Director Matsushima made an impromptu speech. The main points of his speech are summarized as follows:

The Second Front Will Become Concrete

The European second front will transform from a brewing situation into concrete reality. Regarding the preparations for this matter, we believe that the British government's announcement on April 17th to restrict the diplomatic activities of neutral countries is proof of this. What is most surprising to us is that this announcement also equally restricts the activities of the Chongqing regime's diplomatic personnel in the UK. This shows that the UK and the US, in addition to using Chongqing as their tool of sacrifice, have no other preferential treatment. Even if there is, it is only based on the interests of the UK and the US.

Chongqing's New Recruits Have Been Imprisoned

On April 19th, the Kunming correspondent of the US Associated Press cabled New York, saying that Chiang Kai-shek recently ordered the newly recruited soldiers to be separated from the old soldiers, and not to let them get close to the old soldiers. It seems that there is a meaning to prevent the old soldiers from escaping. This telegram proves that the Associated Press correspondent also has no good feelings towards Chongqing. He sent this unfavorable news to Chongqing, which shows his dissatisfaction with the Chiang regime.

Representatives of Chongqing's Army Were Killed and Injured in Bombing

According to a special telegram from New Delhi on April 10th: There was an explosion at the Mumbai pier, and General Wan Li, the representative of the Chongqing Southeast Asia General Headquarters, was killed, and Major General Chen Jingjia and another liaison officer were seriously injured. We express our sympathy to Chongqing for this sad event. The occurrence of this tragedy was due to the negligence of the British side's vigilance. Chongqing devoted its full spirit to serving the UK and the US, and the result was like this. In addition to sympathy, we feel especially pitiful.

Money Enslaves American Air Warriors

Regarding the fighting spirit of the American army in Europe, we can know it from the following facts. According to a telegram from Madrid: An American Air Force soldier landed in Madrid by parachute. He was born in Chicago. According to his confession, he can get a bonus of US$800 for each sortie. From this point of view, we know that the spirit of the American army's operations is all about money. They simply don't know how to fight for the country and the people, which is very lamentable and pitiful.

Sufficient Fuel for Victory

Regarding the Pacific war, it is still in a quiet state. The US has repeatedly promoted that it will launch a large-scale fleet to attack the Japanese army. The US's use of the island-hopping tactic will inevitably fail again, because the closer the US Navy gets to the Japanese internal defense line, the more difficulties it will encounter. For example, Japan's internal defense line is strong, and the US's sacrifice will be extremely large. In addition, the US has a long supply route, and each island in the middle is heavily defended. The problem of fuel for maritime operations cannot be solved smoothly. The Japanese side does not have the difficult conditions of the US Navy, especially regarding the fuel issue. The Japanese Navy is very well prepared and is very easy to solve, which can be said to be no problem at all. This can be proved by the recent "Japan-Soviet Northern Sakhalin Oil Concession Agreement." The Japanese Navy's abundant fuel is the way to victory. If the US Navy recklessly invades the Japanese internal defense line, it will suffer the same fate as the Russian fleet in the Baltic Sea that year. If the US military attempts to invade the Japanese internal defense line with the tactic of "one-shot operation", it is also impossible now, because it has no bases to use. If a ship is injured, it cannot be repaired and can only wait to be sunk. We often hear the US propaganda of large-scale offensives, but unfortunately the world is too big, making it impossible for them to succeed. On the contrary, the Japanese Navy's air force is becoming stronger and stronger, and we can wait and see when it will destroy the enemy in the Pacific.

Difficult to Start the War in the Indian Ocean

The success of the Japanese army in the operation in Imphal forced Mountbatten to move the headquarters to Ceylon, and the US Air Force moved to Calcutta. According to intelligence, a part of the enemy fleet is concentrated on Ceylon Island, with the intention of counterattacking Myanmar. We observe that the enemy fleet aims to contain the Japanese army's operations in Myanmar. If it is said to be a counterattack, then the strength is insufficient. The southwest monsoon in the Indian Ocean will arrive soon, and it is especially bad in July, which is not suitable for naval operations, which is obvious. The rainy season in Myanmar has also arrived, which is even more unfavorable for the enemy's operations. Therefore, we predict that the enemy's war propaganda in the Indian Ocean is just empty talk to cheer themselves up. The UK and the US have recently publicized that the Japanese army retreated because it suffered damage. The truth of this matter will be known in the second half of this year. In short, the Japanese tactics cannot be spied by the enemy, just like a big mountain is not hurt by a small stone, and a small mountain will roar wildly if it is hit by a big stone.

### Post Office Reduces Money Order Rates

The Municipal Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau and the Postal Administration and various branches have reduced the remittance rates for money orders to special exchange bureaus from today: Suzhou, Kunshan, Taicang, Songjiang, Jiaxing, Shi, 50 cents per thousand yuan. Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuwei, Changshu, Hangzhou, Wuhu, Bengbu, Suxian, Xuzhou, Haizhou, Lianyungang, 1 yuan per thousand yuan. Yangzhou, Taixian, Nantong, Huaiyin, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Shanghai, Yuyao, 1.5 yuan per thousand yuan, Anqing 2 yuan per thousand yuan, Hankou, Jiujiang, Nanchang 1 yuan per thousand yuan, Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, Kinmen 20 yuan per thousand yuan. The minimum remittance fee for each ordinary money order is 1 yuan, and the minimum remittance fee for a fixed-amount money order is 90 cents.

### Brief News

Today, the Luqin Strings are Available. The Jinpu Qin Society is the only organization in Shanghai that studies the guqin. Recently, seeing that the guqin strings have been out of stock for a long time, and those who play it suffer from it, it hired string workers to practice making them for the public. Now the product has been launched and is sold by the Xiling Seal Society at No. 239 Guangdong Road, Shanghai.

### Today's Junior Cup Football Quarterfinals Huatong vs. Police No. 1, Overseas Chinese United vs. Portugal in a Friendly Match

In this year's Junior Cup football match, there are 23 teams participating. Eastern China B, Huatong, Police No. 1, and Soquel are the four teams that advanced to the quarterfinal week. In the quarterfinal match, Eastern China B eliminated Soquel 2-0 to win the final. The match between Huatong and Police No. 1 is scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM today at the Jiaozhou Public Stadium. The referee is Xuan Gu Zhengzhu. Huatong was unfortunately defeated by Police No. 2 by one goal in the second division of the Shanghai Federation. Today, the enemies will meet on a narrow road, and they will try to seek revenge. However, the strong player Meng Yiliang will follow the Friendship Team to the plains, and the strength will inevitably be weakened. After the match, there will be another friendly match, in which the Overseas Chinese United will play against Portugal. The referee is Le Xiurong, and the tickets are sold for 40 yuan and 80 yuan.

### Chen Binhe's Statement

I, Chen Binhe, am grateful that my friends, both those I know and those I don't, visit me frequently. However, when you condescend to visit, I may sometimes miss you. When you entrust me with matters, I may sometimes neglect them. I feel deeply sorry for this. In order to reduce my sins, I plan to ask my friends for three things. I hope you will consider them:

My house is small, and I never dare to bother my friends to come. In the future, unless there is a special agreement, please do not condescend to visit. I am sorry that I cannot entertain you. If you have any business to discuss, please move to the Shen Bao and call in advance to make an appointment.

I, Chen Binhe, have always been talent-oriented, so I will never bend to personal feelings. I will never recommend people, especially to government agencies. In the future, if relatives and friends ask me to recommend them, I am sorry that I cannot comply. I will not reply to letters seeking employment.

Although I, Chen Binhe, often have contact with friends from allied countries, I am limited to official business. I will never ask for private favors. For example, my house is managed by the Japanese army, but I also pay a huge amount of rent to sublet it, which can be seen from this. If relatives and friends entrust me with requests for favoritism, I am sorry that I cannot comply. If you have been cheated or treated unfairly, please ask the Civic Welfare Association for help. Regardless of whether I know you or not, the association will handle it truthfully.

### On Mr. Wang Jimei's Paintings

— Wan

Painting has no other path, only lines and colors, striving to achieve the ultimate. However, the reason why Chinese painting surpasses Western painting is that it must also seek nobility and elegance. Therefore, the great master Bai Long, aka Wang Yiting, created a style that established an era. He truly founded his own school and became a master. Mr. Wang's lines are very rough, but they still retain the beauty of lines. What is the difference between roughness and refinement? As for his coloring, he mostly followed the ancients, and it was light and elegant, refined and not vulgar. After Mr. Wang's death, his son, Mr. Jimei, inherited his family's learning and worked hard to improve for thirty years as one day. Recently, he exhibited his recent works, more than one hundred pieces, at the China Academy of Calligraphy and Painting. With Mr. Wang's ultimate height, and Mr. Jimei also able to observe the art of modern times and understand the beauty of its coloring, and apply it to his brush, he not only retains the legacy of the Song and Yuan people, but also transforms it. Therefore, Mr. Jimei's dense and vivid paintings, resembling the Song and Yuan dynasties, surpass them. Mr. Jimei's recent works, such as the endless Yangtze River, willows and fishing boats, and mountain temple bell sounds, all show the antiquity and elegance, without the cleverness, sweetness, and vulgarity of modern times. Among the flowers and birds known for their coloring, there are peonies, bright pearls, orchids, lotus flowers, bald birds, rich and noble jade sparrows, small birds appreciating the late autumn, and many paintings of peonies and birds. Those who do not rely on coloring but show people with brush and ink are like the bare bamboo holding knots. The bamboo is flying and dancing, concise and refined, showing the depth of the skill. There are also those that are short and simple, but absolutely outstanding to read, such as magpies, decaying willows, and fragrant grasses. Often, even a single stroke cannot be added. In addition to lines and colors, Mr. Jimei can also make his works more perfect through the excellence of composition. Mr. Wang has many creations, and Mr. Jimei can not only retain his family style but also carry it forward. He will not let Nangong Bo and Mi Jia's father and son monopolize the beauty of the past. Mr. Wang's paintings will undoubtedly be even more valued by future generations.

### Promoting Homespun Yarn and Cloth: Should Improve Wooden Spinning Machines

Promoting homespun yarn and cloth in rural areas is indeed becoming popular for a time. However, once the goods have a market, farmers tend to produce them crudely and carelessly. This is a criticism of the farmers, but in areas such as Loutang in Jiading, my hometown, the homespun yarn is spun using wooden single-spindle machines, which are old-fashioned spinning wheels from decades ago. The output is low, the thickness is uneven, and the tensile strength is out of the question. These shortcomings must be addressed by improving the wooden spinning machines. Recently, I heard that in areas such as Pudong, Chongming, and Nantong, a "Improved Double-Spindle Wooden Spinning Machine" is producing yarn. I don't know how the results are. I hope local people will write reports to use for discussion and improvement. In Shanghai, there must be a small number of people studying and improving wooden spinning machines. I hope they can work together to research and conduct field experiments in cotton-producing areas such as Taicang and Jiading, and contribute an ideal and perfect wooden spinning machine. Then the future of the homespun yarn industry will be immeasurable! I hope people from all walks of life will carefully consider this. Then the society will be very fortunate! The nation will be very fortunate! (Zhu Shuxun)

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

In an instant, the gangway was placed on the shore, and the tide of humanity surged onto the ship.

Suddenly, the noise of conversation, the sound of footsteps, and the foreign fragrance of perfume filled the deck. The true people were stunned and mingled into the crowd.

"Are there any cadets from Kagoshima Prefecture? Cadets from Kake Bird Prefecture..." A man shouted loudly everywhere, seeming like an innkeeper soliciting business. This man was wearing a light gray suit and was a rather handsome middle-aged gentleman with beads of sweat on his forehead, walking and shouting like this.

With trepidation in his heart, the true person couldn't help but suddenly utter, "I am from Kagoshima."

"You are from Kagoshima?" the gentleman asked again, and immediately placed a large, soft, colorful garland on the true person's shoulder. It was a fragrant yellow garland. This was a symbol of blessing, and the true person felt quite embarrassed to wear it.

"Welcome, welcome! This is my name. I have lived in this place for fifteen years." The gentleman took out a business card, which was printed in English, and his title was doctor.

"Are there any other people from Kagoshima Prefecture?"

"There is another cadet named Kumazawa. He is on number eight."

"Please come with him, and I will definitely lead you on sightseeing tours everywhere. I will pick you up by car every day."

(Eight)

During the six-day berthing period, the true people had absolutely no free time except for visiting and being welcomed. It was strange, why did the local expatriates welcome themselves so warmly? It was really something that couldn't be figured out. The doctor from Kagoshima Prefecture drove his own car every day as usual, guiding them to visit inside and outside the city.

"There are so many Japanese people and Japanese shops!" the true person said to Kumazawa as the car sped along King Street. On the main streets and even in the remote alleys, as well as the places leading to Waikiki Beach, Japanese faces, shops and restaurants run by Japanese people could be seen everywhere. In one shop, the true person bought three leather handbags for his sister at home.

"But, there are 150,000 Japanese people in all of Hawaii!" said the doctor driving the car. Since the first immigration to that place during the Keio era, through the era of earning money, the era of settling down, and the era of becoming indigenous, up to the present day, the doctor explained these detailed circumstances.

"There are still old people from the first year of Meiji (1868) who came to Hawaii. As for the second and third generations, there are also people active in politics. This is truly a long history."

As if to confirm the doctor's words, the car passed in front of purely Japanese-style temples, shrines, and restaurants. On the roofs of Japanese tiles, golden shower tree flowers were intricately blooming, or adorned with coconut leaves, which felt a bit strange.
