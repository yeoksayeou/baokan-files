### Commentary: Answering a Guest's Questions

— Chen Bin Su

From the Henan Campaign to the Capture of Hengyang

Question: The war in both Asia and Europe has entered a decisive phase, but what we should pay most attention to is the new situation on our Chinese mainland battlefield. From the Henan Campaign to the fall of Changsha and Hengyang, the entire war situation has changed. May I ask, what is the real significance of this operation?

Answer: The Chinese battlefield has always been the main battlefield determining the future of the Greater East Asia War. Every move and stillness is closely related to the overall war situation. It is inevitable that the Allied Japan will eliminate the threats to its own country, protect the gains it has made, destroy the enemy's strategies, and complete the aims of the Greater East Asia War, thereby ensuring and expanding its victorious position on the Chinese mainland. Therefore, the recent operations in Henan and Hunan play a decisive role in the overall war situation.

Question: Now that the Japanese army has won victories in the Henan Campaign and the battles of Changsha and Hengyang, what important achievements have been made strategically?

Answer: The most important achievement is the beginning of the destruction of the anti-Axis powers' strategy of launching a counter-offensive in both Asia and Europe. This not only prevents the enemy from attacking the Japanese mainland, but also provides great assistance to the European Axis powers. Enemy American Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz has always advocated using the Chinese mainland to attack the Japanese mainland. Now, the strategic initiative in China has been completely in the hands of the Japanese army. Due to the occupation of Luoyang, Changsha, and Hengyang, the main arteries of the Chinese battlefield from South China to North China are completely controlled by the Japanese army, and Nimitz's plan to use the Chinese mainland has been completely shattered. At the same time, the island-hopping operations carried out by enemy American Southwest Pacific Commander MacArthur, from New Guinea, Borneo, and the Philippines to South China, are also severely threatened from the side due to the dramatic changes in the situation on the Chinese battlefield. Therefore, from the perspective of the Greater East Asia War situation, the achievements of this campaign are tantamount to laying the foundation for the final victory in the future decisive battle.

Question: The impact on Chongqing must be significant, right?

Answer: Generally speaking, there are about four points: First, the people under the rule of Chongqing, and even all the Chinese people, no longer believe in Chiang Kai-shek's power. The previous claims of a counter-offensive by Chongqing were just empty boasts, and this provides a strong counter-evidence. Second, the so-called Anglo-American aid to Chongqing is completely a deceptive trick in words only, and the strategy of leaving Sino-Japanese peace has fundamentally lost the faith of the general public. Third, the forces in the Chongqing regime that oppose the protracted war and criticize Britain and the United States will inevitably rise in the future, and friction will increase. Fourth, the Anglo-American attempt to use the Chinese mainland to attack Japan has been shattered.

Secondly, from a military point of view, the Central Plains theater with Luoyang as its center has always been a great fortress guarding the rear of Chongqing, and it is also the first line for preparing for the so-called "counter-offensive." The guerrilla forces active in North China are also maintained and supplied by this area. Now that it has been taken by the Japanese army, not only is there more solid security in North China, but the Japanese army has also opened the door to advance into Tongguan and suppress the Northwest. The strategic significance of Changsha is even greater than that of Luoyang. After the Japanese army occupied it, the Chongqing forces in the provinces east of the Yuehan Railway have been completely isolated, and their military collapse can be expected in days. In particular, after Hengyang fell in quick succession, the Japanese army is now in a superior position to directly attack the southwestern provinces. At the same time, this also means that Chongqing is in an increasingly difficult position. Moreover, Hunan Province is the richest in mineral and grain resources. The occupation of Changsha and Hengyang controls the entire Hunan region, which is of great value in wartime economy. On the other hand, the Jinghan and Yuehan railways can be connected, and the railway main line of the entire Greater East Asia region can be completed from Tokyo, Korea, Manchuria, Beijing, Hankou, Guangzhou, Vietnam, Thailand to Zhao Nan Island, the significance and value of which deserve special attention.

Question: So, is the political achievement of this operation also very great?

Answer: Let's not talk about the historical significance of large cities such as Luoyang, Changsha, and Hengyang. Just looking at their current status, Luoyang is the political center of the Central Plains. Whoever occupies that place has the possibility of controlling the entire Central Plains. As for Changsha, it is the center of the revolutionary movement in Central and Southern China, and during the war, it is also the political hub linking various regions in East and West China. As long as you open a map, you can see that the Japanese army has already controlled the Pinghan and Yuehan transportation lines, and Hengyang is also a major station on the Yuehan Railway and the starting point of the Xianggui Railway. Therefore, the provinces of Gan, Min, Gui, Yue, Chuan, and Qian are within the direct control of the Japanese army, and at the same time, the provinces of Su, Zhejiang, Wan, Gan, Min, and Yue are completely cut off from the southwest, which is the general base of "resistance." This has two major political meanings: From now on, Chongqing will become increasingly isolated and become a local regime in name only; the political forces in the peace zone can be expanded from now on. Therefore, the theory of Chinese unification is approaching the stage of realization.

Question: What are the future trends?

Answer: The victory of the Allied land, sea, and air forces in this operation has begun to break the enemy's strategy of counterattacking Japan, has strengthened the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War, and has also changed the entire political, military, and economic situation in China. However, military victories must continue to be expanded to prevent the enemy from using the Chinese mainland battlefield. At the same time, military victories must be guaranteed and expanded through political efforts. The so-called political efforts of course hope that the National Government will take advantage of this favorable situation to thoroughly reform politics, improve people's livelihoods, revive the war zone, promote construction, and improve the political faith of the people throughout the country in the peace zone. In particular, the people in the areas liberated by the Japanese army should quickly receive the grace of true benevolent governance, and gain a correct impression of the policy of resistance and peace and know how to choose. Only in this way will the ideal of Chinese unification be realized, and the so-called cooperation in completing the Greater East Asia War will have a real effect. We must follow up the Japanese military victory with a new political victory.

### Fierce Fighting on Saipan Island, Our Army Launches Effective Attacks, Three Enemy Ships Blown Up in the Central Pacific

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - A garrison team on Saipan Island reported from a certain base in the Central Pacific that it had launched an effective attack on the enemy, inflicting great damage. Enemy American forces launched an attack on the Japanese army's position from Mount Tapochau with integrated artillery and mountain artillery on the morning of the 28th. The Japanese army immediately launched a counter-attack and repelled the enemy. Several enemy tanks were destroyed in this battle. Also, a part of the American army came to attack the Donnay area on the east side of Saipan Island on the afternoon of the 27th and was immediately repelled. Five American tanks were destroyed. The battle between the Japanese and American armies on Saipan Island is becoming increasingly fierce.

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Aslito Airfield on Saipan Island has been occupied by the enemy army, so elite air force units have been repeatedly attacking the enemy army there day and night. From the night of the 27th to the morning of the 28th, the Japanese army launched a concentrated attack on the airfield, causing it to catch fire. At the same time, a large number of bombs were dropped on the nearby enemy supplies concentration point, also causing a fire. In addition, the Japanese air force also attacked and damaged three newly transported ships attacking on the water surface in that area. On the morning of the 29th, another unit of the Japanese air force launched a fierce attack on the enemy fleet, inflicting a powerful blow. The results of the battle are currently unknown.

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - The naval battle around the Mariana Islands has become increasingly fierce. To cover the troops landing on Saipan Island, the enemy is actively operating dozens of warships and vessels in the waters of Saipan, Tinian, Rota, and Guguan Islands. The enemy air force is also repeatedly attacking the Japanese army's various bases in the area.

### Japanese Army Occupies Hengyang Airfield, Fierce Fighting Occurs in the Sky Above

Hengyang City Surrounded on Three Sides by the Japanese Army

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 2:00 PM on the 29th: The Japanese army, which is currently operating in the Hunan area, occupied the Hengyang Airfield, a forward base of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, on June 26. The Japanese army is now using the airfield. Since the beginning of the operations in the Henan area, the comprehensive results obtained by the Japanese army as of June 20, as determined: A total of 61,862 corpses of Chongqing soldiers have been recovered by the Japanese side, 19,777 Chongqing soldiers have been captured, and 409 various cannons, 1,697 light and heavy machine guns, and approximately 24,000 rifles and other firearms have been seized, as well as 101 locomotives and trucks, 270 cars, and approximately 7,286,000 rounds of various ammunition. 47 airplanes have been shot down (12 of which have not been confirmed). The Japanese side suffered losses of 2,008 deaths.

A certain base of the Japanese army on the Hunan front, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army attacking Hengyang along the Yuehan Line made a three-sided breakthrough into the Hengyang Airfield on the east bank of the Xiang River before dawn on the 26th, completely occupying the town. Thus, one of the powerful bases of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. Furthermore, the Japanese army advancing south from the west bank of the Xiang River has completely surrounded Hengyang City, which is opposite the Hengyang Airfield, on the north, southwest, and three sides. Therefore, the main forces of the Chongqing 10th and 96th Divisions, which are surrounded, continue to resist relying on air fortress cover, but have already entered a heavy encirclement, and the Japanese army is now launching an annihilation battle.

### Chongqing Side Announces War Situation

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) - A Chongqing correspondent for the Associated Press stated on the 28th that the Chongqing military authorities announced the war situation on the night of the 28th, stating that the battle for Hengyang is currently progressing around the entire city. This is enough to imply that the Japanese army is besieging Hengyang. The loss of Hengyang is the biggest blow to Chongqing since the fall of Guangzhou and Hankou in October 1938. Due to the loss of Hengyang, the roads to attack Shaoguan, an important base of the Chongqing army, and Guilin, where the Chongqing-Guangxi provincial government is located, have been opened.

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing military authorities announced on the 28th that the battle for Hengyang is currently progressing around the city.

### Chongqing-US Air Force Base Retreats

A certain base of the Japanese army, 29th (Central News Agency) - The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing intended to use Hengyang to attack the Japanese mainland and disrupt the peaceful areas. After the Japanese army occupied Changsha, they took advantage of the victory to advance south. At the same time, the Japanese air force units in China also exerted their power, and the Hengyang Airfield was finally captured by the Japanese army. With the Japanese army occupying the Hengyang Airfield, the situation has changed. Jianyang, Lishui, and Suichuan, which are east of the Yuehan Line, have become the most advanced bases for Japanese aircraft. At the same time, a favorable situation has also been adopted against Guilin. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has fled from Hengyang to Lingling. Most of the US aircraft are launched from Guilin, with hundreds of aircraft every day. Since they have coveted the Japanese ground troops, they disturb the rear at night. With their backs to the water in Lingling and Guilin, their counter-attack force is like the end of a crossbow.

### Chongqing Side Hopes to Obtain Large Amounts of Material Assistance

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Chongqing, Liang Han Cao, Minister of Propaganda for the Chongqing government, said when meeting with foreign reporters on the 28th: What the Chongqing government most hopes from the anti-Axis countries is the assistance of large amounts of materials and the spiritual encouragement and inspiration. Later, a reporter asked, in the current situation, how can the anti-Axis armies provide large amounts of assistance to the Chongqing government? Liang Hancao replied, by increasing transportation methods. Zhang Pingqun, a spokesman for the Chongqing government, also requested the formation of a second battle line on the East Asian continent. In essence, the Chongqing side needs to build a harbor.

### Plans for Temporary Reconciliation with the Communist Party

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) - Under high pressure from Britain and the United States, the Chongqing regime is attempting to achieve a temporary reconciliation with the Communist Party. Around mid-May, Communist Party representative Lin Boqu went to Chongqing for negotiations. According to a dispatch from Chongqing, Liang Hancao, Minister of Propaganda for the Chongqing government, said when meeting with foreign reporters on the 28th that around mid-May, during the Henan front operations, the Chongqing regime ordered the North China Communist Army to contain the Japanese, but the Communist Party did not respond and did not fight. Regarding the meeting with Communist Party representative Lin Boqu, the government plans to seek a solution through political means, and has recently decided to submit a proposal, which is awaiting a response from the Communist Party. Solving the problem by political means is very simple, that is, the Communist Party abides by the law, and the Communist army obeys the orders of the Supreme Command, then all problems can be solved naturally.

### Korea to Excavate Potash Ore

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Keijo, potash ore is an indispensable raw material for manufacturing explosives and fertilizers during wartime, and its increased production has gradually been valued by the world.

### Various Provinces Actively Complete High-Level Clearing of the Countryside

Central News Agency News - After the National Government returned to the capital, in order to establish security, improve people's livelihoods, and establish a model of local peace, in order to gradually move towards a comprehensive peace. At the same time, in order to stabilize the villages and eliminate the bandits and communists, it was also necessary to start clearing the countryside. The actual clearing work started in July of the 30th year and has now reached its third year. At the beginning of the clearing of the countryside, the target was the four counties of Wu, Kun, Tai, and Chu in Jiangsu Province. In September of that year, the counties of Wuxi and Jiangyin successively began. In March of the 31st year, the clearing of the countryside began in Zhenjiang, Danyang, Yangzhong, and Wujin counties. In July, the clearing of the countryside began in seven counties in the southeast of Taihu Lake. At the same time, the Shanghai Special Municipality also began the first phase of clearing work in Chongming, Baoshan, and other places under its jurisdiction. In April of the 32nd year, the clearing of the countryside began in the four counties of Tong, Ru, Hai, and Qi in northern Jiangsu. In October, the clearing of the countryside began in the Hangzhou area. Thus, the clearing work started in Su, Kun, Tai, and Chu in Jiangsu and gradually spread to important areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. In February of the 33rd year, the heads of provinces and cities held a conference on liaison in clearing the countryside, deciding to shorten the one-and-a-half-year period of clearing the countryside to one year. The stages of the clearing work were based on a 363 system, that is, three months of preparation work, six months of full-scale work, and three months of supplementary work. After the meeting, the clearing work in Anhui Province began to prepare, and it was launched on June 1. The full-scale work of the clearing department in the Suzhou-Dang clearing area of Anhui Province began as early as February of this year. The preparation work for the clearing of the countryside in Guangdong and Hubei provinces has recently been completed and will be launched soon. At this time, when the five provinces of Su, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, and Guangdong have successively implemented the clearing of the countryside, it coincides with the third anniversary of the clearing of the countryside, and its significance is indeed significant. After three years of efforts in clearing the countryside, not only has the scope expanded, but also in terms of content, all items such as autonomous organizations, production capacity, and economic systems have gradually been put on track, so that people's livelihoods are stable and security is established. It is inevitable to promote production movement in the future, to further stabilize people's livelihoods and assist the war. On the occasion of the second anniversary of clearing the countryside throughout the country, which coincides with the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, it is hoped that efforts should be strengthened, and a high degree of clearing of the countryside should be actively carried out to stabilize the central and rear areas, increase production, and further cooperate in manpower. Therefore, the military and government agencies in various places held grand celebrations for this significant anniversary in order to awaken the public and strengthen concepts. In addition to organizing Qingxiang inspection groups to conduct on-the-spot inspections of the Qingxiang situation and report, the provinces where Qingxiang was launched have decided to convene people from the military, government, police, academic, and civilian circles, as well as representatives from various professions, to hold large-scale public gatherings, film and music gatherings, and other expanded propaganda activities to celebrate this anniversary with great significance.

### European War Approaching Decisive Stage, Fierce Battle for Caen

Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Central News Agency) - Since the German retreat from Rome, followed by the Allied landings in Western Europe and the start of the Soviet summer offensive, the German army has invited the enemy's large forces to attack on three fronts, and the war seems to have entered a decisive stage. According to German authorities' observation, the current Soviet forces in the central part of the Eastern Front are estimated to have at least 85 divisions and one tank army, with approximately 700,000 soldiers and approximately 1,500 tanks. The German army will continue to engage in bloody battles on both the Eastern and Western fronts. The Siege of Sevastopol is the best example, but this is only the prelude to the Allied large-scale offensive operation. The US and British armies are expected to carry out new landing operations in Western Europe in the state of Xu. It is expected that the Soviet army will also start a new offensive on the Front Line, which will be the final stage for the German army to exert all its strength and display its heroic spirit.

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - German authorities announced on the 28th: The British and American military headquarters have dispatched a large number of new and elite troops to the new front.

### Anglo-American Forces in Italy Heavily Reinforced

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency, Huitong News Agency) - The fighting west of Lake Trasimeno in Italy is intensifying. Although the British and Americans are heavily reinforcing with aircraft, artillery, and tanks, the German defenses remain unbroken. Haiye: Units such as motor vehicle troops must travel along major roads. If the roads are damaged and impassable, they have no choice but to travel through farmland. Originally, driving into farmland during wartime was not a problem. However, this time, the Japanese army must first obtain the consent of the village chief. On one occasion, an officer went with an interpreter to find the village chief, but was unable to locate him. It took two hours to finally find him. The army wasted two hours during its advance, which had a significant impact on the operation plan. However, the Japanese army disregarded this disadvantage and respected the opinions of the Chinese people. This is a special feature of this operation. Previously, when a major famine occurred in Henan, the Chongqing army stationed in Henan still levied harsh taxes on ordinary farmers, collecting one jiao (tenth of a yuan) of tax money and eight jin (four kilograms) of rice per person. Later, this was increased to sixteen jin (eight kilograms) of rice. This time, when the Japanese army entered Henan, the commander of the North China Army issued a proclamation stating that all taxes in Henan would be waived. The people were greatly moved by this proclamation. There are various heartwarming stories about construction. The Japanese army hired Chinese laborers and paid them wages. Their daily income was several times higher than that of Japanese soldiers, which often made the Japanese soldiers envious. A railway construction unit in northern Henan employed six Chinese children to do small tasks such as carrying bricks. In addition to a daily wage of five yuan in vouchers, they were also provided with meals. The Japanese soldiers were very kind to these children. When the unit completed the project and began to move south, the temporary laborers refused to leave. They begged the unit to take them along and their parents pleaded with the unit commander in every possible way. As a result, the unit commander agreed. On the day the unit departed, the children's families came to see them off. The section of railway from Zhengzhou to Yancheng has been mostly completed, and the remaining work is proceeding smoothly. It is expected to be open to traffic next month.

### Rice Control Commission Announces Methods for Transporting Rice to Shanghai, Twelve Temporary Permit Issuing Offices to Be Established Tomorrow

Since being ordered to ease restrictions on the movement of rice, the Rice Control Commission has, in conjunction with the Shanghai Special City Government, formulated temporary measures for the management of rice for Shanghai citizens. The regulations and announcements have been made regarding the application for and issuance of permits for transporting rice into Shanghai, as well as the types of permits and how they are to be used. In view of the panic over food in Shanghai and in accordance with Article 6 of the Outline of Temporary Measures for Rice in Beijing and Shanghai, the Commission has designated twelve temporary permit issuing offices in the city for entry. Before the establishment of these offices, the Commission will issue temporary permits and receipts, and no rice will be requisitioned.

### Requisitioning Begins

It is understood that the number of applications from farmers, merchants, and residents in various places for permits to transport rice to Shanghai has been increasing daily. It was learned yesterday that the Commission, in order to facilitate applications from farmers, merchants, and residents, has decided to establish the temporary permit issuing offices on July 1st to begin processing the issuance of permits and receipts, requisitioning rice, counting quantities, and inspecting rice quality. When transporting rice, except for those transported by train to Shanghai, all others are limited to transporting rice into the city between 6:00 AM and 8:00 PM daily. Any rice transported in after hours will be considered smuggled. Therefore, any rice transported to Shanghai with temporary import permits issued before July 1st will not be requisitioned, but must be verified by the permit issuing office for quantity and stamped before being allowed entry. For rice transported from other districts to Shanghai with permits issued on or after July 1st, the temporary permit issuing office of the Commission will requisition rice according to the requisitioning scope. Rice under five dou (approximately 50 kilograms) will be exempt from requisitioning, while rice over five dou will be requisitioned according to regulations.

### Various Procedures

The various procedures that citizens must follow when applying for a temporary import permit or license are disclosed below: Applicants should first come to the office to obtain a "receipt" and fill it out themselves. Applicants should maintain order and line up to receive it, without pushing or shoving. Applicants should present their citizen ID card along with the "receipt" for verification and issuance. Omitted. Each permit should be stamped with a one yuan stamp tax. The validity period of this permit is two days. It will be invalid after the expiration date. If seven days are needed, application can be made to the general office. When citizens transport rice to the port of entry, personnel from this office must verify the quantity of rice transported, weigh it, and requisition 30% of it according to regulations (i.e., three dou per shi (approximately 100 kilograms) for rice between five dou and ten shi). Payment will be made at the prescribed price. Rice under five dou will not be requisitioned. Citizens must obtain a license for rice under five dou and a temporary import permit for rice between five dou and ten shi before it can be transported into the urban area. Citizens can inquire at the issuing office if they have questions about the application procedures for permits. The temporary permits issued by the issuing office are free of charge, except for the one yuan stamp tax per permit. The amount of self-supplied food transported by citizens should be calculated according to the proportion of the population and should not exceed three months to limit hoarding. If the amount of rice transported by citizens exceeds the three-month consumption of the population of their household, they should indicate the amount exceeding the limit and sell it to rice shops registered with the municipal government. Otherwise, if discovered, it will be considered hoarding. These measures will be implemented from July 1, 1944.

### Distributors Are Illegally Exploiting Customers; File Accurate Complaints, Chairman Tang Said in a Speech

The temporary allocation of cotton cloth to citizens in the city, which was announced by the Municipal Government and the National Commercial Control Association on June 1st, has been underway for a month. During this period, it has been reported that some retail merchants handling the allocation of cotton cloth are not complying with the prescribed procedures and are exploiting the interests of citizens. A reporter from this newspaper yesterday visited Mr. Tang Shoumin, former director and current supervisor of the Commercial Control Association, to inquire about his opinion. He gave the following statement: "This time, the Commercial Control Association, together with the Municipal Government, submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan for approval to hold the temporary allocation of cotton cloth to citizens in the city. Each citizen can purchase 1.5 zhang (approximately 3.5 meters) of cotton cloth. The types and prices of the cotton cloth have been prescribed and announced. Detailed measures have been newly formulated for the cloth merchants handling the allocation, with the overall interests of the citizens as the main purpose. All cloth merchants should comply with these measures. As for some unscrupulous cloth merchants who do not comply with the prescribed measures, deceive citizens, and seek illegal profits, I have also heard about this, which is very hateful. I hope that citizens who encounter deception by cloth merchants will immediately file accurate complaints. This association will certainly investigate and deal with them according to law, in order to deter others from doing the same and protect the interests of citizens."

The reporter noted that Mr. Tang's expression and attitude were very serious. Citizens, for the sake of their own rights and interests, should file accurate complaints if they are subjected to illegal exploitation. Do not give up your rights, and effectively assist the authorities in correcting abuses. The Social Service Department of this newspaper can forward complaint letters, but they must be based on loyalty and contain detailed and truthful names, addresses, and citizen identification numbers.

### A Frontline Account from Henan

To Luoyang, to Luoyang, soldiers and horses awake all night, advancing step by step. For a continuous month and a half, marching at night, taking short rests, marching and marching at night again, fighting, advancing, taking short rests, so there was not a single time when we camped at sunset. Taking three or four hour short rests, we had to feed the horses, cook, and sleep, and prepare for the next day's battle in a short period of time. Fortunately, both the soldiers and their families were resilient and good at fighting and advancing. For four whole days, we had less than ninety hours of sleep, advancing to search for the enemy. Finally, on May 25th, we encountered a strong enemy force and engaged in fierce fighting. The Iron Cavalry unit of some name and the force group, which conquered Luoyang with great power, had been on a non-stop march for a full month and a half. This reporter followed the Iron Cavalry unit for 1,000 kilometers, experiencing the various situations of combat firsthand. The following is a brief account:

### Embarking on the Journey

At 2:00 AM on May 2nd, we received the order to "advance to the southwest of a certain place to block the enemy's retreat," and set off from Bizi Zhang, southwest of Xuchang. The moonlight was dim, and the cold air before dawn penetrated into our lungs. We marched mightily across the wheat fields of the Henan Plain, relying on maps, going straight ahead. While slowly eating breakfast, just as we reached a village to rest, "Bang, bang, bang," the machine gun began to roar. The horse reins were still in our hands, and we only heard bullets whizzing past our ears. "Move quickly!" We urged our horses to gallop past and occupied a nearby village to attack the enemy entrenched in the Xiaozhangzhuang village.

The enemy forces here were the 59th Regiment, about 1,500 strong, from the south, who were heading north to reinforce Tang Enbo's army. They were all regular troops. Relying on a thirty-foot-high and twenty-five-foot-thick earthen wall, they fired wildly with machine guns. The Japanese cavalry artillery unit immediately began to exert its power. The enemy army was finally defeated, leaving 1,200 corpses, and 278 people, including the regimental commander Liu Guochang, were captured.

After the battle, we were already exhausted, but we were unable to sleep for three consecutive days. We searched for the enemy near Shan County without success. Then, we received intelligence that the defeated enemy was gathering in Longmen Street, south of Luoyang, so we advanced day and night, heading straight for Longmen Street. The wind was strong, and sand filled the sky, making it difficult to open our eyes. The horses also lowered their heads and staggered with difficulty. At about 11:00 PM on the fourth day, we reached a village near Linru Town. When we heard the command "Take a long rest!" we were overjoyed, thinking that we could sleep soundly tonight. But immediately, the order came to get up at 1:00 AM and set off at 3:00 AM. We removed our rain gear, repaired our horses, cooked, and prepared dry food. All preparations were completed by nearly 1:00 AM, and we soon departed.

### River Crossing Surprise Attack

Then, just before dawn on the fifth day, fierce fighting broke out on the southern high ground of the Dragon Gate Street corner. "Today we capture the enemy in the secluded valley, tomorrow we break through the barricades of Dragon Gate Street, the day after tomorrow we conquer Luoyang, and then sleep soundly!" Hearing these words, the soldiers' spirits soared. Shortly after noon, the river crossing camp on the Ru River was completed, and the entire army bravely crossed the river in front of the enemy. The cavalry, using their favored surprise attack tactics, leaped into the enemy's embrace. On the river, a thousand meters wide, the mountain guns roared, and heavy mortars stirred up plumes of water, as dense as a forest. But the river crossing was finally successful. Our troops set up positions at the foot of the high ground in the enemy's lines, abandoning their horses and engaging in hand-to-hand combat at the foot of the mountain, penetrating deep into the enemy's interior. The enemy desperately fired their weapons.

Our cavalry artillery units set up gun emplacements on the riverbank, shattering the enemy's positions one by one. The artillery battle, lasting three to four hours, was exceptionally fierce. During the intense shelling, our assault troops lying in wait at the foot of the mountain remained motionless. Soon, night fell, the sound of gunfire gradually subsided, and the enemy's machine guns emitted a crackling sound like frying beans. At this point, we had a tendency to encircle them. Seeing that we had no support troops, the enemy, relying on their numbers, launched a counterattack, with battle cries shaking the sky. In the face of the enveloping darkness, a fierce bayonet fight gradually unfolded. At dawn on the sixth day, the enemy's previously extremely noisy positions suddenly fell silent. The enemy had fled far away. In order to search for more militarily important enemies, we abandoned the enemy here and turned to a new mission. That afternoon, along a certain street southward, the brave warriors, leading their horses southward, chatted and laughed, full of excitement.

At that time, four enemy planes attacked from extremely low altitude. Bullets from thirteen-centimeter caliber machine guns rained down on the heads of the advancing troops. The firing squad immediately returned fire in the nick of time. The reporter lay in the wheat field. Beside him, his beloved horse, "Yiyue," leisurely ate wheat stalks. Bang, bang, bang, shells flew past him, but "Yiyue" paid no attention to them, truly indifferent to the noise. The strength of the cavalry depends on the horse, and the weakness of the cavalry also depends on the horse.

That night, there was another night march, avoiding the main roads, traversing mountains and ridges. The horse hooves stepped on the small stones of the mountain path, the sound as clear as small gunshots. Crossing mountains, fording streams, moving forward, bypassing the enemy's pursuit route, we were never caught.

### Bereaved Over Beloved Horse

Sometime in May, this is a day that the reporter will never forget. On that day, we set off from a certain place at four o'clock in the morning, maneuvering through the mountainous area southwest of Luoyang, enduring the cold of dawn, the scorching dust, and sleepless nights. Just as we were resting by a small river, my beloved horse, "Yiyue," suddenly showed signs of distress, collapsing lifelessly, never to thirst again. The continuous forced marches had exhausted it. Once it fell, it could not stand up. The veterinarian tried all sorts of methods, but to no avail. A certain Major ordered to ride a packhorse instead. The saddle on "Yiyue's" back was transferred to the packhorse, and then we said goodbye to it. On the front line for a month, we went in and out of the hail of bullets together, inseparable. Now, this final farewell, how could I not be filled with tears?

After a while, at the veterinarian's request, he gave "Yiyue" an injection, and it passed away peacefully. Dying before entering Luoyang, it was truly a pity. Soon after, the reporter arrived at the gates of Luoyang, holding a lock of "Yiyue's" mane, cut off that day, in his right hand, as if he were riding it across to enter the fallen city of Luoyang. (Translated from the May 28th Asahi Shimbun, produced by the original newspaper reporter.) Plum rain season.

### Sketches of the Western European Battlefield

Nerve Warfare and Economic Warfare

The nerve warfare team under General Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the Anglo-American forces in Europe, had already begun operations concerning the landing operation in Northern France. According to news from the anti-Axis camp, three months before the invasion began, the London correspondent of the Associated Press had already reported the start of the landing in Western Europe, causing the American side to hurriedly cover it up. This was the first arrow of the nerve warfare team. Because the news was leaked before the landing, the Germans were prepared instead.

When the landing began on June 6, the anti-Axis side broadcast a pre-recorded speech by Eisenhower through a clandestine radio station. The general idea was:

"Regardless of men, women, old or young, all patriots have the task of achieving final victory. To the French people who are commanded by domestic and foreign leaders, I must tell you that you should act in accordance with orders. To organized groups, I must tell you to wait for me to issue the signal to attack Germany."

This action hoped to incite internal sabotage by the French people, but so far, it is questionable whether the French people, who are suffering under Eisenhower's iron fist, will act according to his wishes. (Translated from the July 11th issue of the Daily News.)

### Anglo-American Landing Craft

The landing craft used by the Anglo-American forces are as follows:

Landing Craft, Infantry (LCI) (American) / Assault Craft (British) Both are high-speed motorboats about ten meters in length, capable of carrying thirty soldiers.

Landing Craft, Vehicle (LCV) After the soldiers have landed, this craft is used to unload anti-aircraft machine guns for air defense, earthmoving tractors for road construction, or light tanks ashore. This craft has a shallow draft and can be used on shallow coasts. The front of the craft can be opened to the left and right, so that vehicles can immediately drive off the craft.

Landing Ship, Tank (LST) Larger than the Landing Craft, Vehicle, weighing several hundred tons, capable of carrying several heavy tanks. The front is equipped the same as the Landing Craft, Vehicle. "" (American) Amphibious military vehicle, resembling a tank in appearance, capable of carrying forty soldiers, driving on land after landing.

"" (American) Also an amphibious vehicle, with six rubber wheels, capable of carrying soldiers from the sea to land.

The Scenery of Northern France: The Normandy Peninsula, although protruding from northern France, is a region of warm climate and fertile land, with apple orchards and green pastures everywhere. The apple tree can almost be called the "national tree" of France, and there is no one in the world who loves apples more than the Normans.

The coastal area where the Anglo-American forces are now landing was once a resort destination for the ladies of Paris and was very lively in the past. The winding road connecting this place with Paris, lined with apple trees, meanders through the countryside like a green ribbon. In the past, it was luxurious cars that drove under the apple trees, but today it is the "caterpillars" of the German mechanized units.

Normandy is known as the "Kingdom of Butter," famous for its cheese production and exporting a great deal to foreign countries. It is said that the current focus of the battle is between Caen and Isigny. The anti-Axis forces have used many tanks to establish two bridgeheads in this area, and it is reported that the enemy has destroyed thirty-five tanks. Isigny is a famous butter-producing area in France. (June 10th Asahi Shimbun)

### Celebrating the Holiday

— Yuan Teng

The sun shines in a strange, yin-yang manner, making it hard to believe it's three o'clock in the afternoon.

But the main streets are still bustling with activity. The tramcars can't stop the people, especially since tomorrow is not only Sunday but also a remarkable holiday. The sidewalks, the shop windows, and the counters are all crowded with old men and women carrying baskets, as well as gentlemen and young ladies dressed in new clothes.

Among these people is Mr. Cheng Jun, his faded doctoral cap perched on his long hair, a newly washed cotton gown starched stiffly at the collar, making his neck somewhat uncomfortable.

A gust of wind blows from the Bund, raising the hem of his gown. Mr. Cheng Jun involuntarily shivers.

This shiver is almost identical to the one he felt yesterday at his fourth uncle's house.

His fourth uncle, facing this exasperatingly long-winded nephew again, spread his hands, indicating utter helplessness. His face was sullen. Our protagonist shivered again.

"Celebrating the holiday... everyone is as miserable as I am... truly... alas..." Mr. Cheng Jun forced a smile: "It's really difficult. The rent, the rent, the landlady has been urging me five times... It's the holiday, and I have to give a gift to the section chief. I heard there will be layoffs and raises... I have no choice..."

His fourth uncle laboriously pulled out five stacks of banknotes from his drawer:

"Here are five hundred. Truly, everyone is having a hard time now. I'm just like you. Here are five hundred. Alas... I heard rice is about to reach the ten thousand mark... Here are five hundred."

Understanding the other party's meaning:

"The interest is still five percent?"

"That's fine, that's fine," his fourth uncle nodded: "Alas, truly." ○……○

The entrance of Guanshengyuan (a famous Shanghai confectionery store) swallows and spits out various characters.

Mr. Cheng stops in front of the window.

"Red Bean Zongzi: 40 yuan."

"Zongzi." He thinks: "Giving Wu section chief zongzi isn't a bad idea."

His hand in his pocket, counting the stacks of banknotes that he's counted countless times:

"One, two, three... one, two... three, four, five, six..."

Three hundred and sixty yuan! He enters the store. A gust of the aroma of zongzi greets him, and Cheng Guangsheng can't help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.

"How many should I give?" he wonders.

"Salty Meat Zongzi: 45 yuan... Lotus Seed Paste with Egg Yolk: 55 yuan... Ham with Egg Yolk: 55 yuan..."

Ten is too many, 450 yuan isn't enough... Five? Five times five is twenty-five, five times four is twenty, that's close, but it feels a little stingy.

He hesitates for a moment, finally waving at the clerk: "Half a dozen salty meat ones." Fortunately, it's only half a dozen. The basket feels light and airy, and in this plum rain season, he'll sweat less.

"What will Section Chief Wu think?" he wonders.

Maybe everyone else will forget to give a gift, and he'll be the first.

Maybe Section Chief Wu will nod, revealing his two gold teeth.

"Excellent, I love eating salty meat zongzi, comrade, haha... " And then they'll talk about the taste of salty meat zongzi...

Taste? He's a little confused. He really doesn't know what the taste of salty meat zongzi is.

Or maybe they'll talk about raises.

"Well, you've been the most hardworking in the section for the past two years, Clerk Cheng! Uh! I know, I'll give you a raise, don't worry, Lao Cheng... Lao Cheng..."

"Lao Cheng, Lao Cheng!" Somehow, Section Chief Wu's voice changes into Lao Zhao's loud voice.

Ten steps ahead, the office clerk in his new suit, carrying a large ham.

"Buying ham?" Mr. Cheng greets him.

"For the section chief. ...Hey! I heard our section is the one with the most layoffs, so I have to take precautions. What did you buy, zongzi?"

"Uh, salty meat zongzi. I'm planning to deliver it right now."

But Section Chief Wu isn't home.

"The master probably won't be back until tonight. You can leave it here."

Mr. Cheng Jun asks the servant for a slip of paper, and then asks for a writing brush. He respectfully writes two lines of words.

"Presented with Respect to Section Chief Wu, by Cheng Jun, his subordinate."

He carefully places the slip of paper in the basket, and then personally moves it to a table inside before bidding farewell, finally relieved.

Tomorrow is Sunday. The day after tomorrow, Monday, Section Chief Wu will surely ask the tea boy to invite him to the section chief's office to express his gratitude in person, and also...

He's sure to get a raise!

He maintains this energy all the way back home.

His wife, upon seeing him, tells him with a bitter face that the landlady has been here. It seems that if they don't pay the rent before the holiday, there's a great risk of being evicted!

Mr. Cheng Jun angrily throws all the banknotes from his pocket onto the bed: "Give it all to her!"

His wife looks at the banknotes, soaked with countless sweaty hands, and sighs.

"Is there any hope for a raise?" she asks eagerly.

There's no reply. Her husband stares blankly at the banknotes.

"Should we make any special dishes tomorrow?" his wife asks, looking at the empty small pot on the small coal stove by the bed.

"Forget it!" is the simple reply.

His wife has no choice but to remain silent. She quietly sits down on the small stool in front of the coal stove.

Silence—an unbearable silence.

Memories of the grand scenes of past Dragon Boat Festivals flash through the minds of this young couple...

Breaking the silence is an unexpected guest.

"Eh! It's you, Lao Zhao!" Mr. Cheng says, jumping up from the bed in surprise.

"Cheng Jun! We... we've all been laid off! ...I just went to Section Chief Wu's place and ran into Wang Zong. He saw the list in the section chief's office. We... are all... laid off..." Cheng Jun suddenly feels a darkness before his eyes and immediately faints.

### Sports: Shanghai Softball League Begins: Introduction to the Strong Chinese Panda Team

— Shen Yimu

In recent years, the Chinese people have become increasingly enthusiastic about various ball sports, such as football and volleyball. Football, in particular, is very popular in Shanghai. Furthermore, the strong Chinese team Donghua won the championship in this year's Shanghai League, and the Chinese team won an international trophy, allowing the Chinese to finally exhale after years of weakness. As for baseball and softball, they are still not very popular in China. Only in Shanghai, Guangdong, and other places is there some competition in these sports. I still remember the excitement and tension of the Shanghai baseball final during the Sixth National Games. At that time, many of the best players in China were overseas Chinese from America and Japan, such as Gao Hanen, Yu Baihui, Zhou Longgan, and Huang Zhaotai, who represented China in the Far Eastern Games.

### This Year's Softball League Has Already Begun

Before the incident, there was also a Shanghai softball league, held every summer at the racecourse. At that time, there were almost no Chinese teams participating; only the Yale team competed. However, the championship was always won by foreigners, so the Chinese people paid little attention to this sport. After the incident, the Shanghai Baseball League was suspended. Last year, the Shanghai First Division Softball League was organized by Tang Qiaosi and others from the Shanghai Foreign Overseas Chinese Music Association (FMU) at Jiaozhou Park, but no Chinese teams participated. Therefore, very few Chinese people knew about this league. This year's softball league is still organized by Filipino overseas Chinese and began last Sunday at Jiaozhou Park.

### The Chinese Panda Team Is a Strong Team in the League

What is noteworthy about this year's league is that the Chinese are also participating. The participants are the Panda softball team, organized entirely by Cantonese people. In their first appearance last Sunday, they defeated the Jewish team by a score of seven to two. The audience praised the team's skills and believed that they would be a major threat to the strong Western teams in the league and had a great chance of winning the championship. Therefore, I am writing this article to introduce the team's strength and lineup so that the Chinese people can look forward to and support them. If the team wins the championship in the future, it will add a new color to the softball sport, which has been dominated by Westerners in Shanghai.

### The Team Is Full of Talent and Defeated the Jewish Team in Their First Game

The Panda team was established three years ago and has been trained by coach Zi Zhenyi for several years. The team participated in the privately organized league last year (organized by Percy Kok) and was undefeated, winning the championship. This year, they decided to participate in the open league. In their first game, they defeated the Jewish team. In the first five innings, none of the Jewish players reached base. If they hit the ball, they were either killed on the base or caught by the outfielders. Therefore, the team's defense is as tight as a wall, especially the quick catches and throws of the shortstop, and the catcher's flawless catches are the main reason for the team's victory. The audience also praised the team's strength in its speed and stability. As for offense, the team's players have their strengths in both long hits and bunts, making it difficult for other teams to defend. The team is good at hitting low and sharp balls, so they have many opportunities to reach base, and they are also good at stealing bases, making other teams wary of them. The team has a total of eleven players, all of whom are Cantonese. Captain Zhong Baoluo is a Yale student, tall, and plays right field. Zhong Zhaosen, who plays center field, and Lao Zhuangsen, who plays left field, jointly defend the outfield, preventing misses. First baseman Tang Weiye is a famous player from the Guangdong Nan team, catching the ball steadily. Wen Tianhua, shortstop Wen Ruixiong, third baseman Liang Yousheng, and catcher Huang Yingrui are all overseas Chinese students who studied in Japan. They played for the Japanese Zezhong team in Japan and represented Yokohama and other cities in the All-Japan League. Therefore, the skills of these four are impeccable. If the ball is hit between second and third base, it is sure to be killed because the shortstop and third baseman release the ball like arrows. They are especially good at underhand throws, and their speed in blocking steals and making catches is unmatched by other teams. In addition, Rover Wang Nianzu (the rover position is unique to softball and does not exist in baseball. This position is located between second base and center field) is also a Yale student and is very skilled in covering and catching balls. Another catcher, Wang Xiushan, is a Cantonese general. He cooperates with pitcher A Xi to prevent any missed catches and is good at killing "steals to second base" with sharp and accurate throws. Therefore, anyone who tries to steal second base from first base is often killed by this player. Furthermore, Wang is full of tricks as a catcher, making it impossible for other teams to predict when they hit the ball, so he often gives brilliant performances.

Looking at the skills of the above players, there is indeed great hope of winning the championship. The team leader is Dr. E. Sen, a famous Shanghai lawyer. The entire team wears gray uniforms, looking imposing and majestic, preparing to defeat the Westerners in this year's league and win glory for the Chinese people.

It is also heard that there are many famous teams in the league, such as the Western team, which has black pitching stars Ike and Osha. There is also the "Rustano" Red Team, the reigning champion, which has Fatty Tom Burer, a powerful player. In addition, the Zhuang, American, and Red Cross teams all have excellent skills and should not be underestimated. Moreover, the fastball pitcher of the Rustano team, Fatty Burer, is unmatched by other teams in his speed, and he is also good at hitting home runs, making him the soul of the team.

### This Sunday Morning: Battle Against Last Year's Champion

The Panda Team is scheduled to compete against the "Lustanuo" Red Team, last year's champion, starting at 9:00 AM this Sunday (July 2nd). These two teams are the strongest in the league. When two heroes meet, there will inevitably be a fierce battle. Who will be victorious is unpredictable. Those who enjoy this sport can visit Jiaozhou Park to watch. Admission is free, and it will also cheer on our team. We hope that the Panda team members will do their best, strive forward, and win glory for us Chinese.

### Football Season Nearing Its End: Chinese League to Play Four Consecutive Matches

This football season is fading away with the passage of time. The scorching summer is coming, the red umbrellas are raised high, and the heat is rampant. Players have been on the battlefield for a long time, and after the battles have just ended, it is time to rest and recuperate. However, charity matches are coming one after another. Fans can enjoy a few extra performances after the season ends, which is truly fortunate. There are four matches recently. Three have already been played, and there is still one today at Yi Yuan. Three of the matches are charity matches, and one is a friendly match. After watching the three matches, I have some feelings and would like to express my views briefly.

### Fundraising Charity Match: Chinese League Suffers First Defeat

In this battle, the Chinese League first fought the Portuguese League. The latter adjusted its lineup, inviting former St. Francis College players, the Fu'en Pantuo Zhan Kun brothers, to help. However, the Chinese League's command was improper, resulting in sluggish offense and defense. Fu'en of the Portuguese League was active again, scoring four goals alone, defeating the Chinese League by a score of five to four. Chinese League goalkeeper Liu Xianhan was extremely flustered and unable to save the ball, which was also a major reason for the defeat. Fortunately, Li Yao Han Longhai worked hard, still managing to score four goals, which was their best effort. Observing this battle, we can believe that the most important thing in football is momentum and cooperation. Otherwise, even with great generals, it will become a pie in the sky, and it will be difficult to expect good results.

### Friendly Match: Chinese League Suffers Another Defeat

The Chinese League's opponent was a police team. This time, the Chinese League focused on friendship in offense and Donghua in defense, making better adjustments. However, the weather was very hot that day, so there were few fans, and the players' spirits were lacking. Moreover, the ball was not in good condition, and they were down one to two in the first half. The police team relied on its abundant physical strength, and because its members had been resting for a long time, they were particularly energetic. Not long after the start of the second half, there was a heavy rain and strong winds. Although the players were still fighting hard in the rain, their performance was inferior. Both sides just muddled through in the water battle, and nothing was gained. The Chinese League lost one to two. In the first half, the Chinese League scored two goals, but both were disallowed for offside. The fans sighed in unison and felt that the referee was being overly strict. In fact, Huang Renyi's refereeing was indeed very dedicated.

### Chinese League Refreshes Lineup, Overcomes Japanese-German Team

The Chinese League's third match was played yesterday, with the Chinese League facing the Japanese-German League. The former, ashamed of the two defeats, refreshed its lineup, emphasizing Donghua in offense and supplementing the center line of the Chinese League with Zheng Yingquan and Song Dian, which greatly improved its vitality. The Japanese-German League had many individual experts. Each player's technique was quite good, but their connection seemed a little lacking. The Chinese League's performance and offense were so elusive that they almost left the opponent at a loss. The skillfulness of You Liang and Long in their positions was beyond description. Ah Dai was also seen to be agile, scoring two goals. It can be said that this is rarely seen. It is unbelievable that Ah Dai, who is already old, can still have such a wonderful performance. Who said that he is old and useless? There is indeed a lack of such talent among the younger generation. Ah Dai has been playing on the field for more than ten years, and he can still be so imposing, which is enough to be proud of. As a result, the Chinese League won by four to two, and they missed many good opportunities and a penalty kick, otherwise, how many more goals would they have won?

### Today's Last Match: Chinese League to Play Portuguese Community Again

This afternoon, a charity match sponsored by the Catholic Church will be held at Yi Yuan, with the Chinese League playing the Portuguese League again. This battle will be the last game of the season. Looking at the completeness of both sides' lineups, it can be believed that it will be a wonderful farewell game for the season. The Portuguese team's style is quite similar to that of the Chinese team, and they are also good at meticulousness. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the Chinese League will pay the most attention to the distribution of its lineup. They should respond to the other side's personnel and make adjustments accordingly, then victory will be very certain.

### Sidelines in the Sports World

Zhu Tufang is a very popular volleyball player. Yesterday, the reporter went to the Youth Association to watch the various events. The Green Team and the Long Team both had her name on the list. Everyone wanted to know which team this volleyball star would join.

The Shaoxing Cup Xia Guangzhai Two Basketball League will be held one after another, so that the lonely basketball world can be prosperous for a while. Chen Zhong, Zhang Juefei, and others will definitely work hard.
