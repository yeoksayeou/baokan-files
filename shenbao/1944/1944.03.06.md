### Japanese Troops Pressing Towards Indian Border, Burma Battle Enters Critical Phase: Indian National Army Advances Step by Step Towards the Motherland

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a certain base on the Burmese front, dated the 5th, states: Japanese forces on the southern Burma-India border have decimated the British 7th Division and are now approaching the Indian border, indicating that the Burmese battle situation has entered a new phase. Since assuming command of the Southeast Asia anti-Axis forces, Mountbatten has continuously convened military conferences and traveled to Chongqing to discuss counter-offensive plans in Burma with Chiang Kai-shek, He Yingqin, Chen Cheng, and others, suggesting that the Burmese battle situation will become even more pressing after the Lunar New Year. However, with the Japanese forces' skillful defense, they defeated the Chongqing forces in the northern battle of the Nu River. Following the defeat at the Nu River, Mountbatten adopted a gradualist approach, hoping to first secure control of the airspace over all of Burma, then retake Burma, and finally advance into the southern Japanese-occupied areas. However, after the Japanese forces initiated preemptive strikes, they were annihilated under fierce artillery fire. Furthermore, the Indian National Army, rising up to liberate their motherland, is now uniting with Indian soldiers who surrendered to the Japanese and advancing step by step towards their homeland. India, Britain's only treasure trove in East Asia, is now facing a political crisis. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the British Southeast Asia Allied Forces Commander, Mountbatten, hastily reinforced troops to obstruct the Japanese advance towards Chittagong and exerted all efforts to defend a certain point on the Indian border. This demonstrates that the situation on the Indo-Burmese border has entered a critical phase. Once the Japanese forces advance into India, the state of India will be uncertain. After the Japanese forces launched an offensive operation against Arakan, the battle situation has changed dramatically. The enemy's propaganda about counter-attacking Burma has now become a complete fantasy, and they are instead preoccupied with preventing a crisis in India.

Shonan, 5th (Central News Agency) - Since the Indian National Army launched an offensive in Arakan, Indian residents in various southern regions have become highly excited. The Indian Independence League-related newspaper, "Azad Hind," published an editorial on the 4th, titled: "The Indian National Army are all striving to oppose Anglo-American imperialism, seek the liberation and independence of the motherland, and expand their strength. The Provisional Government of Free India is recognized by nine countries, including Japan, China, and Germany, which not only acknowledges the existence of India but also recognizes mutual cooperation. For example, Japan supports India's independence and actively provides assistance in exercising its rights. Furthermore, to fulfill this commitment, it is engaging in warfare against the enemy, Britain and America. Burma is now exerting all its efforts to provide assistance, and the Burmese people, along with the National Army of the Provisional Government of India, are joining hands with the Indian National Army. Recently, the three armies of Japan, Burma, and India established a rapid communication channel to strengthen their joint operations. This measure has increased the credibility of the Indian National Army's independent existence. Indian soldiers are fighting under British orders, while the Indian National Army is fighting under the command and orders of the Japanese. At the same time, Indian soldiers under British command are subjected to discriminatory treatment in terms of salaries, food, and clothing. Moreover, Indian soldiers under British command are forced to fight, while the National Army is fighting for the liberation of their motherland as a matter of justice. Indians with spirit will never sacrifice themselves for the enslavement of their motherland. We firmly believe that the entire Indian National Army and its allied forces will march in unison, attack Delhi, and thoroughly eliminate British imperialism."

### German Naval Expert Comments: American Military Strategy in the Pacific War is Extremely Dangerous

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) - The naval correspondent of the "Marine-Rundschau," Erlwatt, wrote: "The battles in the Mariana Islands indicate that the American military strategy is to strengthen its offensive on both the naval and land fronts, and then seize air and naval bases along Japan's outer defense line. This strategy has been in progress for several months and is extremely dangerous because the Americans believe they have a larger navy than the Japanese and can afford significant losses. The Americans use ten aircraft carriers and eight battleships each time, indicating their intention to engage in a decisive battle with the Japanese navy. The American plan seems to be to seize various bases because the Japanese navy does notâ€¦ and the Japanese military does not appear for combat at other bases in the Mariana Islands. But this objective of the Americans has not been achieved. Most of the Japanese navy does not appear for combat, but the adaptive measures taken have made it impossible for the American air force, based on aircraft carriers, to operate. For example, only 200 American planes can be dispatched to bomb the Mariana Islands and Guam. The strength of the American fleet is also being diminished daily, while the Japanese navy is preserving its strength and can wait for an opportunity to strike. This is the advantage held by the Japanese navy."

### Japanese Planes Heavily Bomb Suichuan and Hengyang

Hankou, 5th (Central News Agency) - Japanese army air units heavily bombed Suichuan on the night of the 4th and returned safely to their base. The bombing took place at 10 PM, first in Suichuan, where they engaged in combat with enemy fighter planes, then heavily bombed our airfield, destroying one enemy large aircraft and one small aircraft, severely damaging two others, destroying one medium aircraft and four to five small aircraft. That same night, despite adverse weather conditions, they raided Hengyang, targeting the airfield and its runways. After achieving great results, the Japanese planes returned safely to their base.

### Japanese State Minister Kishi Visits Chief Secretary Hoshino

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - Japanese State Minister Kishi visited Chief Secretary Hoshino at the Prime Minister's official residence on the morning of the 5th for important talks lasting approximately thirty minutes.

### Japanese Emperor Visits Naval Headquarters, Lunches with Chief of Naval General Staff Shimada

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - Following an appearance at the Naval War College in the afternoon, the Japanese Emperor, accompanied by Grand Chamberlain Admiral Hasunuma and Prince Matsudaira, departed from the Imperial Palace by automobile at 10:20 AM and proceeded to the Naval War College in Shinagawa Ward to personally attend the graduation ceremony for students of Class A and related students. The ceremony was extremely grand. After the ceremony, he departed from the school at 11:15 AM and proceeded to the Naval Headquarters, where he lunched with Chief of Naval General Staff Shimada and other staff officers. Prince Takamatsu also attended. He returned to the palace at 1:05 PM.

### North China Political Affairs Commission Thoroughly Investigates Hoarding

Beijing, 5th (Central News Agency) - Since the Lunar New Year, prices in Northern China have been rising again, even doubling or tripling in some cases. According to common sense, this situation is due to a few people profiting from it, which affects the lives of the people. After the authorities in Beijing implemented investigations, prices have gradually fallen. The Political Affairs Commission has dispatched special commissioners to Tianjin, Qingdao, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, and other places, informing the local administrative officials of the investigation in Beijing. It has been confirmed that there is large-scale hoarding in various places, which is being investigated. Regardless of whether they are pure merchants or colluding with the enemy, the goal is to stabilize prices.

### Beijing Students Demand Suppression of Harmful Entertainment

Beijing, 5th (Central News Agency) - Yesterday afternoon, the Beijing Youth League expressed their opinions vehemently, hoping for concrete answers based on factual evidence.

### American Ambitions Fully Exposed, Chongqing Side Feels Pessimistic

Guangzhou, 5th (Central News Agency) - America's policy of aggression towards China is becoming blatant, while the Chongqing side is groaning in distress. Initially, they used the abandonment of unequal treaties and the amendment of Chinese immigration laws to deceive people, or used force to coerce the Chongqing side, etc., using various conspiracies to incite delayed counter-attacks in Burma, blaming Britain, and inciting resentment in the Chongqing side towards Britain, secretly and gradually revealing America's ambition to exclusively occupy China. America's true intentions towards China can be briefly summarized from the following political, military, and economic activities:

Annexing the Air Force

The most obvious of America's military actions towards China is the formation of the U.S. Joint Air Force in Chongqing last December. America's plot to annex the Chongqing Air Force is well known. On the one hand, they accommodate and train Chongqing Air Force personnel, intending to expand the power of the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing, thereby reducing the difficulty of replenishing its air force officers. Since the beginning of the year, the patriotic fervor has been deliberately stirred up by American intelligence agencies. After receiving some basic training within the group, they are incorporated into American teams in Burma, providing their wisdom for nothing. Such actions, which infringe upon the command authority of Chongqing, have also aroused dissatisfaction in Chongqing. Due to this, Chongqing's autonomy and military command are restricted by the Americans. Chongqing has already been reduced to a military colony of the United States, which is obvious. In addition, the recent expansion of American forces to the southwestern provinces of Chongqing and the situation of American military activities in Burma further confirm that this is not false. According to a Chongqing dispatch, Stilwell recently established a (K) Country Operations Headquarters in Burma, commanded by Frankton. This headquarters is actually the operations guidance headquarters for the Chongqing army in that area. The remnants of the Chongqing army that were defeated in Burma are being trained in India by American officers under American command. Therefore, this new organization has been established, and Stilwell has taken control of the command of the Chongqing army in that area. America is not only expanding its military power but also using its golden hands to entice the Chongqing side to borrow 500 million U.S. dollars, of which 200 million are in gold, intending to control the Chongqing side.

U.S. Dollars Flood the Market

Furthermore, the recent influx of U.S. dollars has caused extreme chaos in the financial market, which shows that this is the most sinister scheme of the Americans to colonize Chongqing's economy. According to regulations, these U.S. dollars, except for charitable donations, are not allowed to be transported to Chongqing. However, because prices in China are high, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing and American expatriates decided to fix the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and Chinese currency at one U.S. dollar to twenty Chinese currency units. But according to last year's black market, one U.S. dollar could be exchanged for eighty Chinese currency units, and recently it has risen to one hundred and eighty Chinese currency units. Moreover, this situation is greatly desired by Americans and related businesses, and even the Chinese are talking about U.S. dollars, expressing a pessimistic outlook. Everyone is competing to produce goods. This situation cannot be ignored, but the American side does not care at all, fearing that the Chongqing side will not quickly be colonized economically. The complete loss of autonomy by the Chongqing side and its willingness to be an appendage of the United States are foreseeable.

### Japanese Troops on the Burma-India Front Drive Straight to Chittagong

Since last October, Mountbatten's Southeast Asian Allied Forces have begun to move, calling for the recapture of Burma from the west. Their Fifth and Seventh Divisions attempted to invade the Arakan region but were lured by the Japanese army's strategic retreat. A portion invaded the Maungdaw area. However, since the second offensive, they have achieved results, and the enemy's two divisions have been completely encircled within the iron ring of the Arakan front. Their annihilation is imminent. (According to the war results announced by the Japanese Headquarters on the 4th of this month, the Indian-British 7th Division has been largely annihilated.) At the same time, they have indicated that they will drive straight in and seize Chittagong, causing great terror on our side.

The enemy's 7th Division, encircled in the Akyab Basin, ten kilometers north of Buthidaung, has a force of approximately 5,000 men, carrying 100 tanks and 500 trucks, forming a solid defense in a one-mile radius and resisting. On the 13th and 14th, due to the Japanese army's ground and air attacks, the enemy was completely surrounded. On the other hand, the Fifth Army, using tanks and carrying medium-caliber artillery, attempted to invade Maungdaw, but its connection with the 7th Division had been severed, and its retreat route to Chittagong had been cut off. It is heavily deploying medium-caliber artillery north of Maungdaw and defending its position. A portion of the enemy has urgently begun to retreat by boat from southern India.

However, the Japanese air force has begun bombing them, and the Dunkirk tragedy will be repeated in Arakan. It is worth noting that the enemy air force's records show a sharp decline. The dive bomber squadron flew approximately 270 sorties in January, but has recently greatly reduced its activity, taking the opportunity to drop food to the enemy ground troops within the encirclement. According to enemy intelligence, the enemy has been forced to dispatch air force rescue units to the Bay of Bengal and the Arakan coast to rescue pilots who have landed. A repetition of the Arakan tragedy seems unavoidable. The London Daily Telegraph reported:

"The Arakan war is the most intense war in the world. The Allied nations have not yet concentrated enough forces to launch a major offensive in Asia. British-Indian Army Commander-in-Chief Auchinleck believes that the Japanese army will eventually enter India and will use all means to contain the pressure on the British army on the Burma front."

He expressed great fear of the Japanese army's operations. Governor-General Wavell said:

"My first task is to assist the commander of the Southeast Asian Army to drive the enemy out of the gateway to India. Without crushing Japan's ambitions, India will have no peace or glory."

He is exerting all his efforts to cooperate with Britain in carrying out the war. However, the anti-British movement within India is becoming increasingly intense, following the advance of the Indian National Army under the command of Subhas Chandra Bose in Arakan.

Editorial

### Not Being an "American Comrade"

We have been advocating frugality for almost a year. At first, everyone merely published editorials in the newspapers, and then the Newspaper Federation contacted other organizations to jointly initiate the establishment of a Frugality Association, stipulating frugality regulations for further practical implementation. However, all we can do is to fulfill our responsibility of persuasion. We hope that everyone, while enjoying themselves, will think about the consumption of national resources and think about those compatriots who have no enjoyment, and therefore reduce all unnecessary waste. Over the past year, we have said many things and written many articles, but when it comes to achievements, we feel very ashamed.

For ordinary middle and lower-class compatriots, coping with daily life is already very difficult, so there is naturally no question of unnecessary waste. However, the extravagance and luxury of ordinary middle and upper-class compatriots are still apparent to everyone. The talk of frugality cannot defeat the psychology of enjoyment, moral exhortations are useless, and all the empty talk of saving national resources is useless. The atmosphere of waste, in terms of society, profoundly reveals the inequality between rich and poor, unconsciously causing people to develop resentment, and unconsciously guiding people to take the road of making money through corruption. In terms of the country, it is the countless waste of resources, and the waste of countless people's energy and time for no purpose. During wartime, consuming even a little more energy yourself is increasing the strength of the enemy, which is a great loss. Since the forces of social control cannot make people frugal, only the coercive power of the government can be effective.

Recently, on February 25, the Japanese cabinet decided to suspend specific requirements for luxury enjoyment, the contents of which were seen in the March 1 Tokyo Central News Agency dispatch in Japanese newspapers. The two most noteworthy points are: one is that it was planned by the government, and the other is that it was implemented immediately. (Implementation began nationwide on March 5) Under the wartime system, the Japanese government's spirit of saying and doing is truly admirable. Therefore, we hope that our government will have the determination to issue the same order to suspend luxury enjoyment.

Of course, the existence of luxury entertainment venues is of no benefit to the nation and its people during wartime. If it is said to be for tax revenue, then please compare the tax revenue figures with the figures for the consumption of materials to see which is more cost-effective. If it is said to be for the livelihood of the employees, then please compare the livelihood of the employees with the degradation and decadence of people caused by enjoyment, etc. Which is more important in terms of spiritual and material losses? Entertainment venues and their affiliated employees are a type of occupation in society, and we naturally should not oppose them. But what time is it now? Should the people be indulging in enjoyment? War is a great era, a major turning point in an era. What should be eliminated should naturally be eliminated without hesitation, and what should be reformed should naturally be reformed immediately.

Yesterday, this newspaper published an article from the Japanese Asahi Shimbun titled "Reviewing the Must-Win Life," in which it said: "People do not go to work in factories even with a slight illness because they earn so much and live a leisurely life. Those who call on the people to 'reform their lives and desperately increase production' during the day, luxuriously host banquets at night." To regard such people as "American Comrades" is such a profound irony. We hope that our compatriots, especially the middle class, will take heed of the irony of the phrase "American Comrades" and practice frugal consumption.

### Ministry of Industry Plans to Revitalize Light Industry

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) - In order to revitalize light industry, promote increased production, and adapt to the wartime economic system, thereby balancing people's livelihoods and ensuring stability, the Ministry of Industry previously sent personnel to Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuxi, and other places to inspect the actual production of various cotton mills and their difficulties. The adjustment work was completed at the beginning of last month. Currently, emergency relief measures are being studied with relevant parties based on the actual situation, and they will be implemented as soon as a concrete decision is made.

### Agricultural Production Increase Conference Prepares Work Plan

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan has scheduled the following work promotion plan for early this month: The Executive Yuan will promulgate agricultural production increase project plans for each province and city. The Ministry of Food will transfer agricultural production agencies to train technical personnel. Each province and city will be designated to convene meetings of agricultural agencies and related personnel, as well as individual talks in each county and district. Specialists will be appointed to promote agricultural production increase and revitalization in each province and city. Cooperative societies for agricultural production and sales will be promoted in each area. Seedlings in each province, city, and county should also be repaired in the spring.

Domestic Briefs

Hebei designates counties for increased production: Baoding, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Hebei Provincial Government has recently designated 54 counties as key areas for increased production based on natural factors such as soil and climate, as well as other necessary conditions, to implement increased production of wheat, coarse grains, cotton, aquatic products, and sugar beets.

Wuxi registers stored rice

Wuxi, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Suhu District Office of the Rice Management Association originally planned to purchase 0 packages of rice in the near future, but the amount purchased so far is far from the original standard. To investigate the exact number of rice in storage for merchants who have not paid the purchase amount, personnel were dispatched to various collection commercial firms yesterday. In addition, in order to understand the truth about the depletion of crowd sources, the association will also fully register the rice stored by rice merchants throughout the county.

### On the Former Polish Border, the Soviets Mass Heavy Troops: The War Tends to Become White-Hot Again

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) - Transocean News Agency: The battles at various focal points on the Eastern Front have tended to slacken. Before long, it will be known whether the reason for the slackening is the arrival of the muddy season, or whether it is intended to pause to transfer new reserves. A recent, comparatively strong attack was south of Narva, with the Soviet forces advancing to the north, south, and west. The enemy advancing south only advanced 200 meters, while the other two routes were blocked. In the Nevel area, the Soviet forces attacked Linna Fortress, but without much success. The fighting at the junction of the central and northern fronts is gradually becoming a stalemate. In the salient of Velikiye Luki, the Soviet forces are using heavy artillery fire and are expected to intensify their attack soon. On the southern front, the Soviet forces at Krivoi Rog and Kirovograd, although massing large numbers of tanks, are being hindered by the mud and have not yet been active.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities discussed the Eastern Front situation on the 4th: In the area between Shpetovka and Lutsk, there was active local fighting. German grenadier units occupied several important locations.

### The United States Announces Severance of Relations with Argentina

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington report, Undersecretary of State Welles announced at a press conference on Friday that the United States and Argentina have severed relations, and the U.S. Ambassador to Argentina has been instructed to cease diplomatic activities.

### Only Artillery Fire on Anzio Beachhead

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) - The German High Command reports that the battle at the Anzio beachhead was relatively calm on Friday, not as intense as in recent days, but artillery fire continued.

Rome Suffers Bombing, 600 Killed

Rome, 5th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports that Rome was bombed by Allied aircraft on the 3rd in an unprecedented major air raid, killing more than 600 people. More than 350 bodies have been excavated from one air raid shelter, and the rescue work has not yet been completed. Another air raid shelter contains approximately 150 bodies. Approximately 10,000 people are homeless.

### One-Third of Italian Warships Transferred to the Soviet Union

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington report, U.S. President Roosevelt explained the issue of the disposition of Italian warships when receiving reporters, stating that the Allied powers had previously negotiated to transfer one-third of the Italian warships that surrendered to the Allied forces, as well as other warships of equal quantity, to the Soviet Navy. This has now been agreed upon. Furthermore, Britain and the United States will control the majority of the remaining warships. Regarding the disposal of the Italian fleet, Roosevelt previously instructed the Soviet ambassador to the United States that "this decision is not merely temporary and may become permanent." There is no need to specify the number of Soviet warships or their establishment, but it can be stated that some of the crew members of the Italian surrender fleet were Italian soldiers, but some were formed by Allied soldiers. A member of Congress questioned whether the disposition also applied to the Italian warships that had fled to the Spanish-controlled Balearic Islands. Roosevelt replied that this was another issue and would be decided by Spain.

### President Takaishi of the Mainichi Shimbun Returns to Tokyo, Delivers Speech: Impressions of Surveying the South and Passing Through Shanghai Are Good

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - President Shin-Goro Takaishi of the Mainichi Shimbun recently visited the South to survey the construction situation in various front-line locations such as Manila, Menado, Makassar, Palau, Guadalcanal, and Shonan, and also spoke with local military officials and civilians. Having completed his trip, he took a plane via Shanghai on the afternoon of the 1st and returned to Tokyo. According to Takaishi, his impressions of this trip were: The South is truly a land blessed by nature. When we went to the South on January 19, the weather was already extremely warm. The homes of the natives are mostly made of bamboo, while ordinary residences are made of brick and tile. The interior is extremely cool. Our group had a hot pot dinner with executives from the Celebes News Agency in Makassar, and we did not feel hot at the time. The climate in that area is very suitable for living, and there are no sudden changes from cold to hot. Newspaper offices in various locations are diligently governing the country and working hard. Newspapers also have reserves, with some having enough for a year. There are plans to manufacture paper locally, and some have already started manufacturing. Furthermore, I met with hundreds of army and navy officers in the Southern occupied areas. Although they are military personnel, the Southern areas have already established a self-sufficient system, actively reclaiming wasteland to increase food production. The Japanese army and navy personnel there are all full of confidence in victory and do not waver in the face of minor obstacles. Local newspapers have a Japanese katakana column, and the natives are eager to learn Japanese. Furthermore, they have no common language, so Japanese is likely to become widespread. It is not uncommon to see people who can now read Japanese and speak Japanese. The cooperation of Indonesians and overseas Chinese is also quite admirable. They need woven silk products such as skirts (worn by the natives of Java and the Moluccas) and undershirts, which are imported from Japan. I only stayed in Shanghai for three days this time and was warmly welcomed by the local Newspaper Federation. Among them, the presidents of the Chinese-Japanese Daily and the Central China Daily came to Japan to attend the Greater East Asia Newspaper Conference. I also invited Chinese journalists to hold a symposium, which was very well attended. They are also paying close attention to Japanese newspapers and are striving in their respective positions to complete the great undertaking of restoring China and protecting East Asia as soon as possible.

### The Authorities Actively Proceed to Thoroughly Stabilize Prices by Starting to Assist Production, Management and Consumption

Various authorities in this city, in order to fully suppress and stabilize prices and adequately allocate major commodities, have now obtained close cooperation with the highest authorities of both China and Japan. Concrete measures have been successively formulated, deciding to assist production and manage consumption, so that production and consumption can be balanced. Furthermore, in order to address both symptoms and root causes, strictly monitor merchants' buying and selling, and guide the commercial market onto the right track, it has been decided to manage the entire price level according to new countermeasures. All retailers in various industries must not raise prices privately, change grades of goods, use inferior or mixed goods, or engage in other improper behaviors. If a business has a real need to change the selling price due to cost reasons, it must submit the reasons to the authorities through the relevant trade association and request a change in the price limit; otherwise, it will be considered an illegal price increase.

The Grain Bureau Summoned Trade Associations for Talks

In order to maintain Shanghai's food supply and stabilize prices, the Grain Bureau specifically scheduled a discussion meeting with the chairpersons of the Grain Trade Association at 10:30 AM on the 7th of this month at the bureau. The Bureau Chief, Ji Hua, attended and sought cooperation from various parties. In addition, in order to distinguish between the Grain Trade Association and the grain merchants participating in the association, the Ministry of Food has specifically formulated "A Categorized Table of Elite Business of Various Grain Trade Associations," and issued it to food bureaus in various provinces and cities, instructing local grain trade associations to comply. The Grain Bureau of this city has already notified the various associations accordingly.

### Matsushima, Reporting Minister, Discusses the Conflict of Interests Between Britain and the United States, A Strategic Inconsistency

Central News Agency Dispatch: The former Anglo-American allied forces made extensive propaganda, claiming that the counter-offensive in Burma was a crucial key to determining the success or failure of the counter-offensive in East Asia. However, since its launch, there has been no progress. Their ambition was originally to attempt to recapture Akyab, but the result was severely attacked by the Japanese army. As announced by the Japanese Army Headquarters on the 4th, the enemy lost 7,600 personnel. This struggle not only exposed the US attempt to maintain contact with Chongqing and the British desire to preserve their source of exploitation, India, causing a rift between the two sides, but also clearly indicated a strategic inconsistency between Mountbatten, Commander of the Southeast Anti-Axis Forces, and Stilwell, Commander of the US Forces in Chongqing, due to the "Arakan tragedy." The unified front between Britain and the United States in East Asia will trigger a crisis of collapse. Therefore, the Chief of Staff of the Southeast Asian Army, Meyer, immediately returned to Washington to request President Roosevelt to mediate between Stilwell and Mountbatten. The United Press of America has provided detailed coverage of this matter. In the past, strategic inconsistencies due to conflicts of interest between Britain and the United States were not uncommon, but this time the disagreement is so severe that the unified front is on the verge of splitting, so the problem is quite significant, especially causing Chongqing to hesitate about its future course. Matsushima, a Navy Reporting Minister stationed in China with the rank of Major, gave a speech to reporters on the 5th regarding this matter as follows:

Finally Causing a Tragedy. He stated that since the outbreak of this World War, the strategic inconsistencies between Britain and the United States have been repeatedly exposed without exception. The internal affairs of the Allied Forces, who only seek private interests, have been fully exposed. However, in order to cover up these shortcomings, Britain and the United States have spared no effort to convene military and political leaders' meetings multiple times. However, each meeting only served to further demonstrate the conflict of interest between Britain and the United States. The so-called post-war issues only made those in the know sneer. This time, the operational opinions between Mountbatten's headquarters and Stilwell's headquarters have diverged. The Chief of Staff of the Southeast Asian Anti-Axis Forces, Meyer, suddenly returned to Washington to request a ruling from Roosevelt. From our perspective, this is merely the result of the Quebec Conference. The Southeast Asian Army headquarters, which was decided to be established during the Quebec Conference, initially failed to conduct large-scale counter-offensive operations, and its actions were very passive, repeatedly suffering from Japanese preemptive strikes, finally causing the Second Arakan Tragedy. However, in order to deceive the eyes and ears of the world, the British side announced false battle situations. Churchill even sent a telegram congratulating Mountbatten, which was truly a farce. However, the American people, who know the truth, are not surprised that Britain is not responding to the great sacrifices made by the United States in the Pacific and its enthusiasm for the counter-offensive. Previously, McWhorter had strongly stated that in order to defeat Japan, it was necessary to defeat the Japanese forces on the Chinese mainland. This statement may have been aimed at Mountbatten. McWhorter's opinion is the same as that of Stilwell, who drove the Chongqing forces to launch a counter-offensive against Japan based on the Chinese mainland. Therefore, he urged the Chongqing side to reopen the Burma Road. However, this hope was not realized due to Mountbatten's passive operations, causing Stilwell to lose face and express great anger at Mountbatten. This is also a direct reason for the rigid opinions of the British and American sides. It can be asserted that

The Conflict of Interest is Deepening

The reason why Britain and the United States have caused opposition in strategy is fundamentally because the two countries act independently for their future interests. America's strategy is based on the ambition to dominate the world, and its aggressive attitude is evident everywhere, taking advantage of the war to seize Britain's interests. The reason why the United States is helping Britain is also for this purpose. To cite an example, Senator Khattala of the United States said last autumn that the United States is helping Britain, and Britain should of course pay a corresponding price. In particular, the United States intends to ensure air routes, and therefore the secret relationship between Britain and the United States on this issue is deepening. According to a recent Washington telegram, the US State Department has proposed to Britain and the Soviet Union to convene an informal meeting to discuss post-war aviation policies. One of the purposes of setting up the Air Force in the United States is to monopolize the air routes of the Chinese mainland in the future. In addition, the United States is eyeing the oil fields in West Asia, planning to lay oil pipelines in Arabia, which has been fiercely opposed by the British, and even American newspapers and oil tycoons have criticized the government's lack of wealth. Moreover, in order to win over financial tycoons, the United States plans to build a Jewish state in Palestine, which has also caused conflicts with Britain. However, in order to seek US assistance in armaments, Britain has to obey the US will, and even adopts a tolerant attitude towards the US development of India, the largest source of wealth for the British Empire. The United States takes advantage of Britain's weakness and uses the Rent-Lease Act to trap Britain. The intention of US Secretary of War Stimson on the US House Foreign Affairs Committee three days ago to request an extension of the Rent-Lease Act is precisely for this purpose.

American Ambitions are Countless

America's various ambitions are endless, and a part of its own troops landed on New Britain Island, advocating for ownership, while Britain currently has no strength to carry out counter-offensive operations in East Asia. When the United States assists in the counter-offensive in the Pacific, it secretly hopes that the US advance speed will be slower, otherwise the merits will be completely seized by the United States. Mountbatten's lack of cooperation in the Burmese counter-offensive is also due to fear of this point. The British and American system is wide. It is heard that the Burmese counter-offensive will put Longzhong on the list. On the Indian side, a large-scale naval force is concentrated to obtain control of the Bay of Bengal, which was also stated by Mountbatten. However, why is this extremely sensible strategy not adopted by the United States? This is probably because the United States is paying a huge price for the Pacific counter-offensive and neglecting the East Asian counter-offensive plan. The most important purpose is to break into Burma and Malaysia. Therefore, it only lends weapons and drives Britain and the Chongqing side to fight, while it stays behind. However, the Japanese navy calmly responds and fights more bravely. The battle situation is as solid as a rock, and the enemy has no real strength to actively attack Burma. Therefore, Japan's war of righteousness will undoubtedly be under control.

### The City Government Planting Trees and Rituals Will Be Grandly Held

The anniversary of the death of the Prime Minister on the 12th of this month is approaching in an instant. The city government will hold a grand commemorative ceremony on that day, and at the same time hold an expanded tree planting ceremony, and has stipulated large-scale tree planting measures, ordering all its subordinate bureaus and offices to participate together at that time.

### Buying and Selling Land and Houses Will Be Taxed

The Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance, in view of the large number of land and house transactions in various cities, in order to open up tax sources, intends to add mold to the income from land and houses in order to enrich tax revenue, and has decided that all those who buy and sell land and houses for profit will be taxed in accordance with the provisions of the first category.

### Jiaotong Bank Negotiates to Invest in Agricultural Loans

Planned to Issue Agricultural Financial Bonds

The Agricultural Economics Department of Jiaotong Bank is recently working to expand agricultural loan services and indirectly promote high production increases. It is secretly planning on the misappropriation of the loan fund. It plans to successfully obtain a RMB 10 million overdraft loan from the Central Reserve Bank, and after the funds are lent out successively, it will immediately study and issue agricultural financial bonds. The funds obtained from the sale of the bonds will be used to assist in the establishment of agricultural warehouses, reclamation, water conservancy, and agricultural cooperative credit unions for fruit-period loans, in order to complete the mission of handling agricultural gold journal services.

In view of the recent abundance of idle funds in the Shanghai market, the legitimate industrial and commercial sectors have not been able to fully accommodate them. Rather than allowing them to engage in hoarding and speculation, it is better to guide them to increase production in rural areas. Based on this point, it has successively conducted earnest consultations with the Shanghai financial community. As a result, those who are willing to cooperate with the bank to invest in agricultural loans include the China Agricultural Salt Storage Bank and the Li Min Bank. The two banks have decided to invest 2 million yuan each, and the bank itself will allocate 3 million yuan each. Other silver and money industry peers who are willing to conduct consultations with the bank include the Songjiang Silver and Money Industry Federation, the Shanghai Zhongxu Bank, and the Nanjing Huinong Bank. Therefore, the bank's future loan business is truly promising.
