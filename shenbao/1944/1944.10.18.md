### Annihilating the Ambition of Britain and America

On the 7th of this month, Mr. Tokutomi Sohō delivered a speech at the Tokyo Hōzan Seinen-dan (Patriotic Young Men's Group), stating that the methods used by Britain and America are only threefold: first, conquest; second, exclusive possession; and third, the extraction of profit. They have no other skills than wielding military force. They are simply unreasonable, so there is no better way to teach them than to fight, fight, fight again. It is not negotiation or compromise that will change their views, but only fighting. These few words fully explain the history of British and American aggression in East Asia, represent the roar of resistance from the entire Greater East Asia nation, express our deep understanding of the enemy, and our final determination for war.

Since the Opium War, China has never been without invasion. The Opium War was to use force to protect the British, to poison the body of the Chinese nation with opium, and to extract the money of the Chinese nation with opium. Since then, they have successively used the name of trade and the guise of investment to achieve their goals of political and economic aggression. In particular, the legal tender policy of Lytton Rosser in 1935 caused all of China's money to be moved to London and then to New York, and from then on, China's fate could not escape the trap of Britain and America. In 1937, Britain and America further provoked conflict between China and Japan, causing East Asian nations to kill each other, with the鹬蚌相争 (snipe and clam fighting) for the benefit of the British and Americans.

The ambition of Britain and America is to turn the entire Asia into Africa, into India. The land is only their colony, and the people are only their slaves. Their goal is to use political, economic, and cultural aggression to prevent us from ever standing up, and there is no second way to go except to surrender and be oppressed. The history of East Asia in the last hundred years is evidence of the aggressive ambitions of Britain and America, especially the Chinese nation living the most difficult and dangerous life under the ambitions of Britain and America.

The Greater East Asia War launched by the allied nation of Japan in the winter of 1941 is the highest awakening of the East Asian nation, making the East Asian nation recognize the enemy, making everyone know that killing each other only benefits the enemy, and making everyone know that mutual unity and attacking the only enemy is the way for the entire nation to survive. For the past three years, we have struck back at those who have struck at us, causing the British and American enemies to receive the greatest and deepest lessons, but to change their views and eliminate their ambitions for conquest, exclusive possession, and the extraction of profits, we still need to continue to work hard. In order to maintain the rights and interests they have gained through aggression over the past century, the enemy will surely use all their strength to oppress us, and we must also use all our strength to resist. As Mr. Tokutomi said: "[Only fight, until they prostrate themselves completely. There is no other thorough and satisfactory way to complete the war]".

Eliminating the ambitions of the British and American enemies means changing the enemy's psychology. To make the enemy abandon their aggressive ambitions, we must first make the enemy know that it is impossible to invade us. There is no other way to create this psychological change except by using the power of war. The Greater East Asia War is about to be three years old, and the enemy's losses are huge, which is self-inflicted and enough for the British and American ambitious politicians to realize. What we feel most ashamed of is that China has been participating in the war for nearly two years, and the cooperation in the war is really insignificant. We cannot fight alongside the allied soldiers at the front, can't we still work harder in the rear? Every time we read the words of the allied people who are determined to kill the enemy, we always feel ashamed of ourselves. I hope that every countryman will encourage themselves deeply.

### The Japanese Imperial Headquarters Continues to Announce War Results of Destroying the Enemy Fleet. The Air Battle in the Eastern Sea of Taiwan Enters the Second Stage.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 17th: Japanese aircraft squadrons encountered and attacked the enemy's newly arrived mobile units in the waters east of Taiwan on the 16th, destroying one or more aircraft carriers and battleships.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – Since the 12th, Japanese forces have encircled the enemy's mobile units in the waters east of Taiwan, giving them a crushing blow. According to the announcement of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 17th, it is very clear that the enemy forces are mobilizing other mobile units to rescue in this area. These newly mobilized enemy mobile units are based on specially equipped aircraft carriers, accompanied by several standard aircraft carriers, battleships, and cruisers. After receiving the news that the enemy's mobile units were attacking, the Japanese Air Force immediately dispatched aircraft squadrons. After surrounding the enemy in the waters east of Taiwan on the 16th, they launched a fierce daytime attack. At 1:45 PM, the Japanese attack squadrons engaged in combat with more than 30 of the enemy's giant carrier-based fighters. After shooting down several of them, they charged into the enemy's airspace, repeatedly bombing an enemy aircraft carrier, a battleship, etc. Before long, one enemy aircraft carrier caught fire after being hit, and one battleship was destroyed and could not navigate. It has been confirmed that one enemy aircraft carrier and one battleship were destroyed. After achieving remarkable results, the Japanese aircraft squadrons returned to their original defenses.

Central News Agency – The brave Japanese fleet recently achieved an unprecedented victory in the waters east of Taiwan. According to informed military sources, the air and sea battle in the waters east of Taiwan has entered the second stage, and the Japanese Combined Fleet is currently searching and pursuing, and will definitely annihilate all the enemy ships remaining in the Pacific. Moreover, the remaining enemy ships have been severely damaged and are inconvenient to navigate, and a part of the Japanese Combined Fleet's surface fleet is now concentrating on the pursuit. Especially the Japanese bases in the South Seas, such as aircraft and fleets, are waiting for the enemy fleet to flee in a panic, and will annihilate them when they pass through the area. Therefore, these remaining enemy ships will definitely not be able to escape and will not be able to take a step beyond the thunder pond. As for the current situation of the enemy Americans, the annihilation of the main elite fleet, the deaths of the navy, and the destruction of aircraft are difficult to remedy, especially the supply of guns, ammunition, and weapons is extremely difficult. Therefore, the enemy Americans are becoming more and more difficult and serious in these two aspects. Looking again at the great war results of the Japanese army, it is because Japan's own production has reached a fully perfect state, which is a factor in achieving great war results. At the same time, these war results are also the good results of the Japanese people's efforts and struggles. After examining that the main elite forces of the enemy's American Pacific Fleet are on the verge of complete annihilation, we must never be proud of this, but should make further efforts to redouble our efforts until the enemy Americans are annihilated. However, although the enemy's main forces in the Pacific have been annihilated, the American air force in Chongqing on the Chinese mainland will inevitably have sinister intentions. As for how the enemy's British fleet in the Indian Ocean will act in the future, Japan has always been paying attention to it. The great war results this time will give the Allied Germany a boost, give the Soviet Union a good impression, and give the national people of the Philippines greater self-confidence.

### The Battle of the Taiwan Sea Lays the Foundation for the Decisive Victory

President Zhou Expresses Congratulations to the Allies

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th – Premier Zhou of the Executive Yuan issued the following statement regarding the Allied victory after the Battle of the Eastern Sea of Taiwan: The Allies have defeated the American Navy in the Eastern Sea of Taiwan, sinking many of its aircraft carriers and capital ships. The American fleet was defeated and routed. The good news has spread, and all levels of our government and people are deeply celebrating. Since the American Navy seized the islands of Saipan and Guam, they were complacent and believed that the Japanese Navy had no combat power. Therefore, they carelessly advanced, repeatedly harassed the islands of Ogasawara, Palau, and the Philippines, and invaded Taiwan. How could they know that the reason why the Japanese main fleet was hiding and not coming out was precisely to foster the arrogance of the American Navy, quietly waiting for a good opportunity to annihilate it in one fell swoop. The highest principle of the Japanese Navy is not to lightly come out unless it is in the waters near Japan. This battle of Taiwan had the advantages of天时 (timely opportunity), 地利 (geographical advantage), and 人和 (harmony of the people). Therefore, it was able to win in one battle. The so-called timely opportunity refers to the maturity of the timing. The so-called geographical advantage refers to being close to the homeland and waiting at ease. The so-called harmony of the people refers to the fact that after the fall of the islands of Saipan and Guam, all the officers and soldiers held the same hatred for the enemy, vowing to avenge the shame of the defeat at Wu. "An army burning with righteous indignation will surely win," the ancient saying is clear. Although this battle cannot yet be regarded as a decisive battle, it can be compared to the Battle of Tsushima in the Russo-Japanese War. The name of the Japanese "invincible navy" has been further established, and after obtaining this great victory, the belief in certain victory has become even firmer, and there is more confidence in the victory of the Greater East Asia War. However, although the American Navy will not dare to attack again for a while after this defeat, it may soon make a comeback. The Allies are of course prepared for this. With the status of an allied nation, in addition to expressing our heartfelt congratulations on this victory and paying our respects to the Allied officers and soldiers, we should also work together to complete the Greater East Asia War with the spirit of sharing life and death, in order to ensure the liberation of East Asia.

### Contents of the US 58th Mobile Task Force Composition

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – The American 58th Mobile Task Force, which was defeated and fled in the waters east of Taiwan, was formed for the Pacific counter-offensive and war, with a strong group of new-style aircraft carriers as its main force, along with capital ships, auxiliary ships, and large supply fleets, commanded by Mitscher. This large mobile task force is assigned to the Fifth Fleet when it operates in the Pacific to cover the Japanese offensive, called the 58th Mobile Task Force of the Fifth Fleet, and to the Third Fleet when it operates in the southwestern Pacific, called the 38th Mobile Task Force of the Third Fleet. This time, due to joint operations with the Third Fleet, the United States calls it the 38th Mobile Task Force. Regarding the composition of this force, the United States Navy Department said on June 23 that the United States Navy announced that the 58th Mobile Task Force, which is currently operating in Saipan, covered the landing operations on the Gilbert Islands last year and the Marshall Islands in February of this year, and cooperated with MacArthur in the landing in the Dutch region, and twice attacked Truk, Palau, Ogasawara, and Iwo Jima. The firepower of this fleet is equivalent to 70 units of the US military's standard artillery, equipped with about 850 various cannons, such as huge coastal batteries. The 58th Fleet is also known as the Fleet Train, which can go from the home country to distant seas for combat, and is called the "Lend-Lease Fleet". This mobile task force can be supplied with fuel, food, and replacement pilots wherever it goes. The total sliding area of the entire fleet is 1.25 million square feet, and it can dispatch 1,000 carrier-based aircraft.

### The US Air Force Stationed in Chongqing Attacked Guangzhou and Hong Kong, a Total of Eleven Aircraft Were Shot Down

Central News Agency, a certain base in China, 17th – The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, composed of about 50 B24 and P51 fighter planes, formed a joint formation to attack Guangzhou in the evening of the 15th. The Japanese fighter squadron immediately intercepted them and launched a fierce air battle over Guangzhou. On the other hand, Japanese aircraft pursued the enemy who was trying to escape to the west and severely damaged them near Sanshui. As of now, the confirmed war results include two B24 aircraft and five P51 aircraft shot down, one B24 aircraft and one P51 aircraft destroyed, totaling nine aircraft. In this battle, four Japanese aircraft also did not return.

Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 17th – The Hong Kong Garrison Headquarters reported on the 16th at 5:00 PM: At 3:30 PM on the 16th, a joint formation of dozens of fighter-bombers from the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing invaded Hong Kong airspace, but they were intercepted by the Japanese army and immediately fled. In this battle, two enemy aircraft were shot down.

### Manila and Kaohsiung Air Raided the Day Before Yesterday

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – After the Mitscher force was defeated in the waters of Taiwan, a powerful new American mobile task force appeared in the Eastern Sea of Taiwan on the 16th to rescue it and collect the remaining ships and boats, and was immediately subjected to the first attack by the Japanese Air Force, as a result, one aircraft carrier and one battleship were destroyed. According to reports, that mobile task force attacked the vicinity of Manila with about 150 carrier-based aircraft on the morning of the 16th, and on the same day in the afternoon, about 25 B29 aircraft from the Chinese mainland bombed the vicinity of Kaohsiung, Taiwan, for about 30 minutes before retreating. The original mission of this mobile task force was to be the rearguard of Mitscher and to serve as the second attack force, but due to the changing war situation, it had to take on the mission of collecting the Mitscher force. The air raids on Manila and Kaohsiung were actions taken to cover its collection work. The results of the air battle are still being determined.

### Mr. Okazaki, Director of the Japanese Public Information Department, Issued a Statement

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – Mr. Okazaki Hiro, Director of the Japanese Public Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, especially spoke today on the impact of the American Navy's disastrous defeat on the Roosevelt administration, and issued a statement as follows: The Japanese army has repeatedly said that when the American army is led to near the land bases, it will be subjected to counter-attacks. Judging from the war in Taiwan, it can be said that its words are not false. The American Navy, overconfident in its own combat power, launched a surprise attack on the presidential election strategy, disregarding strategy, and attacked near the Japanese mainland. As a result, its dreams did not come true, but it suffered a disastrous defeat. When the American army attacked the southwestern islands of Japan, it initially made a big propaganda about its air raids on Okinawa and Taiwan, and broadcast that the damage to the American air force was slight and that there was no damage to the warships. However, as the war situation changed drastically, the propaganda seemed to be silent. As for the announcement of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters this time, it did not refute a word. Its doctrine of concealing what is unfavorable to its own country has been a long-standing skill of the Roosevelt government since the Coral Sea and Solomon Sea battles, and this time it is also facing the presidential election battle, so its anxieties are even more profound. Prohibiting the publication of the Japanese war results or making the minimum possible publication is to deceive the eyes and ears of the people. However, no matter how the American government conceals the eyes and ears of the people, if one pays attention to the situation of the future war against Japan, one can imagine the extent of the damage to Halsey's fleet this time. The American Navy will inevitably stubbornly try to regain the Philippines, but the Japanese army's counter-attack power can be fully seen from this battle. It is to be pitied that the American Navy had to disregard strategy and start actions because of the presidential election strategy. At the same time, considering the loss of 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers in this battle, one cannot help but feel sympathy. They have been sacrificed for the Roosevelt administration's political strategy, and the operation to make the election battle favorable has instead become a factor in Roosevelt's difficult battle, which is worthy of pity.

### The Japanese Army in Peleliu Firmly Defends Its Position

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – A Japanese military base in the central Pacific telegraphed that the Japanese army in Peleliu Island, hearing of the great victory of the Japanese army in the Eastern Sea of Taiwan, has become increasingly motivated. The battles on Mt. Umurbrogol and the western area of the heights continued from the night of the 14th. In addition to defending the heights to the death, the Japanese garrison also infiltrated the enemy's positions with suicide squads, scaring the enemy. The enemy suffered heavy losses in this battle. On the 16th, a new enemy medical ship appeared in the waters of the island.

### Further Discussion on the Chongqing Regime (Part 2)

— Yoshida Toyu

Question: According to you, Chiang Kai-shek has no say in a comprehensive peace. Doesn't that mean that no one in Chongqing can talk about a comprehensive peace?

Answer: You are quite right. At present, there is no individual who can openly come forward to negotiate a comprehensive peace, nor will there be in the future. If many people in Chongqing do not desire a comprehensive peace, Chiang Kai-shek will not say a word on the issue. Even if there are constantly patriots within the Chongqing regime advocating for a comprehensive peace, Chiang Kai-shek will probably be the last one to do so. Therefore, when he speaks, it is the moment when Chongqing's national policy is decided. Previously, the Sino-Japanese political brokers who lingered in Shanghai and Hong Kong all said with an air of importance that Chiang Kai-shek advocated a comprehensive peace. These political brokers spread such lies they heard, hoping to get some scraps or drinking money. However, the more one earnestly studies the essence of the Chongqing regime, the more one realizes that those deceived by such muddled lies are truly extraordinarily muddled. Of course, it is also wrong to say that Chiang Kai-shek has no say in the matter of a comprehensive peace at all. But even if Chiang Kai-shek speaks on this issue, it will only be about the principles of peace. Anyone who spreads optimism and says that Chiang Kai-shek has expressed concrete opinions is not driven by genuine political motives but by the most despicable other motives. Although being misled by such arguments and spending a sum of money out of curiosity does not affect the overall situation, a comprehensive peace itself will never be realized through idle talk in restaurants and teahouses. At the same time, it will also obscure the right path to a comprehensive peace, which is truly heartbreaking. I believe that the key to resolving the Sino-Japanese issue does not lie in China but in Japan. In a word, Japan itself should implement a policy of influencing the powerful figures within the Chongqing regime. As the saying goes, "To shoot a man, first shoot his horse." If you want to win over Chiang Kai-shek, you must first shoot the political horse Chiang rides. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to influence the powerful figures within the Chongqing regime, that is, those around Chiang. But to influence those around Chiang, it is necessary to first influence the lower-level organizations of the Chongqing regime. To influence the lower-level organizations of the Chongqing regime, it is also necessary to influence a group of Chinese intellectuals at the same time. If you want to influence the general Chinese intellectuals

without simultaneously influencing the general Chinese masses, it will only be a waste of effort. If you want to influence the general Chinese masses, you must first influence the masses in Shanghai. Once Chiang Kai-shek understands that the will of the Chinese ruling class is turning in a certain direction and that the political center is shifting in a certain direction, he will immediately turn to the new center, that is, shift to the new balance of power. He is a person with such agile actions. In short, if this attitude and thought of not wanting to solve the problem of comprehensive peace from above but wanting to solve it from below does not originate and spread from Japan to China, then the day for concrete negotiations on a comprehensive peace is still far and uncertain.

Question: You say that the intentions of the Chongqing regime are determined by public opinion. Does that mean that the Chongqing regime has become a true democratic government? However, whether the Chongqing regime respects public opinion is a big question. It can be said that it completely ignores public opinion.

Answer: Generally speaking, you are right. The Chongqing regime cannot yet be said to be a regime based on the people. Instead, it is a regime representing the collective will of a part of the Chinese ruling class. It is a fact that the entire Chinese ruling class does not respect the will of the peasants who attempt to improve land relations. This is because various forms of exploitation of peasants are the basic source of income for maintaining the Chinese ruling class. Therefore, the exploitative relationship in rural areas has not changed at all during the War of Resistance. Edgar Snow in "[Battle for Asia]" reported the following facts about life in the Yangtze River area: "[In a high-tax environment, a wide variety of exorbitant taxes and levies, and plummeting product prices, the oppression of usury and debt have caused some of the best land to be given away for nothing. The price of silk has fallen by more than 60%, forcing farmers to deplete their important final savings, and small landowners and tenant farmers have had to rely increasingly on usury to survive. According to the research in Dr. Fei Hsio-Tung's book, [Peasant Life in China], the gentry in the area (the lower reaches of the Yangtze River) are, in principle, tax collectors appointed by the government and are obliged to pay the amount designated by the local government. Therefore, the tenant farmers (who in fact do not know the amount of taxes levied on them) actually pay not only the rent but also the taxes that the landlords should pay. At the same time, they must also make special contributions to the landlords who are tax collectors. Due to this relationship, tax collectors wield police power and can arrest tenant farmers who cannot pay taxes and rent at any time. Tenant farmers who do not want to go to jail in the winter have to resort to usury. Those who lend money are often in collusion with landlords and tax collectors. The interest rates are often above 30%, and the principal can be recovered more than 7 times a year. Millions of former free peasants have gradually become 'proletarianized.' The reason is none other than the shocking exploitation system directly created by the gentry, landlords, and tax collectors as a trinity:] ([Battle for Asia], p. 136)." The reason why this exploitative mechanism in rural areas was preserved by the Chongqing regime during the War of Resistance is that the aforementioned landlords, gentry, and tax collectors are the main components of the Chongqing regime's local organization. In cultural terms, these people are supporters of regressive "[National Essence]." The Kuomintang is not only composed of these people; there are also enlightened individuals who still want to solve the rural problem during the War of Resistance. However, they worry that if they try to improve this land relationship under the current circumstances, it is very likely that these landlords, gentry, and tax collectors will leave Chongqing politics and join the Nanjing government with their original personnel. Generally speaking, the Chinese ruling class has never wanted to improve this long-standing exploitative organization. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek, who represents the collective will of the ruling class, never respects public opinion on this issue. The examples cited here are all major ones. As for similar phenomena in the war zones, they are too numerous to list. Therefore, what you said about the Chongqing regime not respecting public opinion may be correct. But do not forget that while the Chiang Kai-shek regime can force public opinion on other matters, it cannot but respect public opinion when deciding whether to negotiate peace with Japan or fight to the end. The Chinese masses may be easily deceived on other issues, but on this issue, they have already learned their lesson through eight years of long and arduous warfare, so it is difficult to deceive them.

### New Developments in the War Situation in Southeastern Europe: Street Battles in Belgrade Underway

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency): Huitong News Agency reports that a military spokesman stated yesterday: The purpose of the German army's large-scale withdrawal is to concentrate its forces in large numbers. This action does not mean that a defensive posture has been decided upon, as the German General Staff is well aware that the war cannot be won with a defensive posture. The German army is now abandoning parts of its land or entire countries, which does not mean that it has abandoned the idea of fighting in the area. The Balkan front will change after the German retreat from Greece. The situation there has not yet stabilized and will be decided at a later date. The Allied offensive is only an obstructionist action.

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency): German News Agency reports: Military news, the German garrison in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, destroyed many enemy tanks in fierce street battles yesterday, driving the enemy forces to the southern suburbs of the city.

### Tobukhin Appointed Commander-in-Chief

Geneva, 17th (Central News Agency): German News Agency reports: "[Lausanne Gazette]" wrote on Sunday that London believes that the position of the Supreme Commander of the anti-Axis forces in Southeastern Europe will be filled by Marshal Tobukhin, the commander of the Third Ukrainian Front. If so, future developments there will soon become clear.

### The Frontline Extends 3,000 Kilometers

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency): Huitong News Agency reports: The Soviet army continues its offensive along a 3,000-kilometer-long front, with only the center shifting from time to time. After the German army abandoned Riga, it continued its withdrawal in an orderly manner, and the rear guard units on the banks of the Tevina River have also completed their retreat. The main battle center in the central section of the Eastern Front is still in Serotsk and Ozan. There is also fierce fighting south of the Bug River. Although the German forces in the Nakiff area are strong, the enemy has broken into East Prussia. In the Hungarian war, the Soviet army has strengthened its northern flank forces and intensified its encirclement attempts. The battle in the Eastern Beskids (Bckides) is becoming increasingly fierce. The enemy's goal is to seize the Dukla Pass, east of which the Southern Highway leads to Galicia, so the pass is strategically important. The German-Hungarian garrison has repeatedly repelled the enemy's frontal and flanking offensives in a flexible manner, preventing the enemy from breaking into Slovakia. The large-scale tank battles in Groswardein and Tebresen continue. The war in Serbia is moving south of Belgrade, and the German forces in Nish are continuing to retreat.

### Advisor Yuuki Expresses His Belief in the Inevitable Victory of the Decisive Battle, Hoping to Further Cooperate Towards the Goal

Mr. Yuuki, the economic advisor to the Japanese cabinet, came to Shanghai from Kyoto a few days ago. Yesterday (the 17th) at 11:00 AM, he met with the Chinese newspaper reporters in the city on the ninth floor of the Cathay Hotel to express his impressions of coming to China. He stated: "[I had planned to meet with the newspaper reporters in the capital, but I was unable to do so because I had to go to a town on official business that day. I am very sorry. If it is convenient for you, please convey my regards on my behalf. This is my first time in China. I first went to Nanjing and then came to Shanghai from Kyoto. My understanding of China is still shallow, and I have no particular opinions to express. I plan to visit important figures in your country to listen to their insights before organizing my thoughts. When I was in Japan, I heard that your country has cooperated greatly in strengthening our country's war effort, and I am extremely pleased and grateful. The current war is becoming increasingly fierce and entering a decisive stage. Under this wartime system, I sincerely hope that your country can provide further assistance to expedite the completion of the Greater East Asia War. The Greater East Asia War is a holy war to win the liberation of all East Asian nations. Judging from the purpose of the war and the spirit of our country's army and navy, I am confident that no matter how tortuous the war situation may be in the future, or how the world situation may evolve, the victory of the war is assured for our East Asian nations. I have firm belief in this and sincerely hope that the government and the public in your country can also share this belief, work together with Japan, and move towards a common goal. To achieve the ultimate goal of the war, many problems will inevitably arise in politics and economics. However, I believe that this is not absolutely difficult. If we have the belief that we are fighting for the liberation of East Asian nations, we will surely achieve ultimate victory.]"

### The Economic Bureau Sends a Telegram to the Ministry of Industry, Requesting that Rice Prices Be Stabilized

Urgently Seeking a Way to Stop This to Maintain the People's Food Supply: Recently, rice prices in the city have been rising steadily, greatly threatening the livelihoods of ordinary people. Xu, the director of the Municipal Economic Bureau, is very concerned about this. In addition to ordering the Price Evaluation Committee to convene an emergency meeting immediately to discuss effective measures to balance general prices, he also telegraphed Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, earnestly requesting that he find a way to stop the rise in rice prices to maintain the people's food supply. The full text of the original telegram is extracted as follows: "[To Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing, In the past two weeks, prices have skyrocketed. This bureau is working actively with relevant agencies according to the Ministry's plan to take effective measures. The price of rice is soaring uncontrollably, with great impact. We earnestly request that the Ministry quickly find a way to stop this in order to achieve the effect of balancing prices. We eagerly await your orders. Sincerely, Xu Tianshen Xiao.]"

### Silkworm Cocoon Loan Officially Signed Yesterday

The Silk Industry Trade Association learned that the autumn cocoons in the production areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have already entered the market, and the member silk factories urgently need funds to purchase the autumn cocoons. Therefore, they specifically borrowed a loan of 50 million yuan for purchasing cocoons from the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and other banking groups in the city. After several discussions and confirmations, the loan agreement was signed by both parties at the Douchang Hotel at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 17th). This loan is still conducted in the form of acceptance drafts, and the Central Reserve Bank has agreed to handle the rediscounting. All loan responsibilities are fully guaranteed and managed by the Silk Industry Trade Association. The loan term is stipulated to be three months, with full repayment.

### Broadcasting Association Announces Work Status

In order to announce the work status of the Shanghai Radio Station, the Chinese Broadcasting Association specifically invited the news reporters in the city and Mr. Liang Xiuyu, the director of the Municipal Propaganda Office, to attend the meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 17th). During the meeting, Director Chen Zhengzhang gave a speech and explained the reasons for the increase in listening fees. The reason is that all expenses are huge, and starting in October, the fee will be increased from 30 yuan to 100 yuan. The second reason for the modification of radios is that in the past, designated radio shops were entrusted to handle it, but many did not comply with legal procedures. Therefore, the Association will handle it itself, charging only a modification fee of 300 yuan. When the Association sends personnel to investigate outside, their attitude will be absolutely amiable. Third, the recent work of the Shanghai Radio Station plans to expand entertainment programs.

### Land Certificate Mortgages Should Be Registered with the Land Administration Bureau

The Municipal Land Administration Bureau states that the number of people mortgaging or receiving mortgages on land certificates in the city is increasing day by day. However, the above procedures should be registered with the Bureau in accordance with the regulations beforehand. However, it has been found that most people do not understand the benefits of registration and are indifferent to it, resulting in the mortgagor falsely reporting the loss of the land certificate to the Bureau, applying for a replacement in an attempt to deny the mortgage, or the mortgagee impersonating the mortgagor and secretly selling and transferring the land certificate. The Land Administration Bureau has found this from time to time. Once it becomes a fact, disputes will inevitably arise. Therefore, in order to protect the rights and interests of both parties, they should promptly go to the Land Administration Bureau together for registration.

### Good News of Victory in the Naval Battle of Taiwan Arrives, Making the City's Air Defense Responsibility Even More Important

Talk by Secretary Sun of the Air Defense Headquarters: Regarding the news that the main force of the enemy country's Pacific Fleet has been annihilated, Mr. Sun Lifu, the chief secretary of the Shanghai Special Municipal Citizen Air Defense Headquarters, issued the following statement: "The citizens of Shanghai firmly believe that the Allied Japanese Navy will one day defeat the arrogant US Navy in the Pacific Ocean. Indeed, the Japanese General Headquarters announced the news of the brilliant war results on October 16. Our gratitude for this news is beyond words. The five million people in the city must make every effort to defend Shanghai. The enemy's mobile units, in cooperation with the US Air Force in China, sent a large number of enemy planes to appear in the waters east of Taiwan, attempting to air raid the entire island of Taiwan. From the 12th, they bombed various places for two days. The islanders were able to unite and cooperate with military officers and civilians to complete the civil air defense tasks. This could not have been achieved without thorough training. The air defense responsibility of the citizens of Shanghai is becoming increasingly heavy. We hope that the public will thoroughly understand this and make efforts to prepare for self-defense."

### City-Wide Factory Electricity Consumption Survey Conducted in Groups

The Committee Will Review and Increase Electricity Allocation: The Municipal Economic Bureau conducted a registration for the electricity consumption and production volume of factories throughout the city last month. After investigating and reviewing the manufacturers related to daily necessities and military production, it appropriately increased the electricity allocation. The application for registration was closed at the end of last month. In total, about 3,000 major manufacturers in the city registered. The Bureau has already sent an official letter to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and the Central China Water and Electricity Company, selecting specialized technical personnel to form a city-wide factory production volume and electricity consumption investigation team to conduct detailed investigations and provide guidance on electricity consumption and production in factories, in order to achieve the most economical electricity consumption and generate the greatest efficiency. The team is divided into three groups, with three people in each group: the first group includes Ma Pu'en (Economic Bureau), Wu Zuquan (Public Utilities Bureau), and Qu Xilian (Central China Water and Electricity Company); the second group includes Zhao Ruhuang (Economic Bureau), Gui Yimin (Public Utilities Bureau), and Shi Meizhang (Central China Water and Electricity Company); the third group includes Wang Hao (Economic Bureau), Huang Xiangtao (Public Utilities Bureau), and Li Shanyuan (Central China Water and Electricity Company). They began to investigate the factories throughout the city in groups on the 11th of this month. They are currently investigating various factories such as machinery and metal repair. Any errors found in factories that have not applied for registration or have improper electricity usage methods will be corrected immediately. Once the team completes the investigation, the committee organized by the authorities will review the results and increase the electricity allocation accordingly.

### Fish Markets in Various Places Are Under the Management of the Fisheries Bureau

The Ministry of Industry's Fisheries Administration Bureau, because the standard division of duties between the Fisheries Administration Bureau and the provincial and municipal grain bureaus regarding aquatic matters, as stipulated by the former Ministry of Food, transferred the Bureau's power to supervise fish markets in various places to the provincial and municipal grain bureaus. Now, in order to adapt to the wartime environment and strengthen administrative efficiency, the central government has abolished the provincial and municipal grain bureaus. The Bureau will submit a request to the Ministry of Industry to forward it to the Executive Yuan to abolish the aforementioned standard, so that the right to supervise fish markets in various places will be restored to the Bureau. The Executive Yuan has approved the request in its directive of September 25, 1944, and the Ministry of Industry has instructed the Bureau to comply.

### Further Discussion on the Chongqing Regime

(Continued from the First Page)  Question: Isn't Chiang Kai-shek desperately trying to divert public attention from livelihood issues by emphasizing [the inevitable final victory of the War of Resistance]? Answer: There is a strong tendency towards this. Honestly speaking, China's livelihood issues during the War of Resistance are not economic problems, but political problems. This is the main political battlefield in the struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party for the leadership of China. Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, Yan'an has said: [To win the War of Resistance, it is necessary to first solve the domestic livelihood problems]. In contrast, Chongqing, based on the slogan of [Resistance War above all else], argues that emphasizing domestic livelihood issues at this time, and stimulating class struggle, would hinder the favorable progress of the war. Of course, the intention of the Chinese Communist Party is to win the faith of the people by solving democratic problems; by mobilizing the people to engage in economic pressure, to gradually abandon dictatorship and embark on a democratic path, at the very least, it can be said that they want to make China a united front country. Chongqing knows very well about this plan of the Chinese Communist Party, so Chongqing is deeply secretive about the two major issues of livelihood and democracy, only pretending to make a [democratic gesture] to deceive the public when absolutely necessary. Therefore, livelihood problems in the war zone are not simply economic problems, but an important form of political struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Until recently, on this political battlefield, the Chinese Communist Party has gained an extremely favorable position for two reasons. First, the United States hopes that the Chongqing regime will be democratized. Of course, the United States does not want the Chongqing regime to be as democratized as the CCP demands. Because the United States believes that would pave the way for communism. But the United States is also afraid that the Chongqing regime will be dominated by the group of people surrounding Chiang Kai-shek, and there is always the possibility of compromise with Japan; in addition, the United States also considers the pro-American Song Ziwen and Zhu Meiling to be very pitiful. In addition, if the Chongqing regime gradually becomes sectarian and the party is completely dominated by special agencies, dissatisfaction with the current government will continue to arise within the Kuomintang itself. Thus, it also affects the power of resistance. If the current Chongqing resistance force is weak and cannot withstand the wind, then the US air base in China will lose its guarantee; if China does not have a strong US air base, then the end of the Anti-Japanese War will always be far away. Therefore, at present, the autocratic regime of the national essence faction within the Chongqing regime must be broken down, and the Anglo-American faction must preside over the major affairs. This is the true motive of the United States in demanding the democratization of the Chongqing regime. Second, the People's Political Council demands the democratization of the Chongqing regime. Today, no one in China admits that the National Political Council is a democratized public opinion organ, but the National Political Council is always carrying a sign with the word [National], so it has to talk about something similar to the demands of the people. At the same time, some of them know exactly what the essence of the National Political Council is, but they insist on using this path to do their best to fight for the demands of the people. In addition, there are also people who, because they cannot be used by Chiang's cabinet, deliberately raise the national demands that Chiang Kai-shek cannot meet, nitpicking and making things difficult. Based on these various motives, it cannot be denied that the National Political Council represents [public opinion] to a certain extent. However, [crows are all black under the sky], so recently Chongqing is no exception, and is completely shrouded in the storm of wartime inflation. The lives of salaried workers, low-level civil servants, teachers, and cultural workers are all ravaged by it and are struggling to survive. They are willing to sacrifice everything for [the final victory of the War of Resistance], but seeing with their own eyes that there are people in the same anti-Japanese camp who are making a fortune from the national crisis, such as Kong Xiangxi and Song Ziwen, it is really unbearable. Therefore, the people of Chongqing are flooding with indignation towards those who make a fortune from the national crisis like wildfire. To a certain extent, this People's Political Council, which represents this kind of public dissatisfaction, has criticized the government quite vigorously and actively. Chiang Kai-shek had to do something to perfunctorily deal with this point. Therefore, in his speech at the National Political Council on September 16, he said that the treatment of the soldiers at the front should be raised to the level of the general public at the very least, but he did not issue public bonds for this, but hoped to use 20 to 30 million stones of rice to offset it. This can be said to be a [groan] squeezed out by public opinion. The Communist Party took advantage of this objective situation, and its attitude became more and more tough, demanding that the Chongqing regime and the country should cooperate between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, then the internal democratization of the Chongqing regime should be carried out first. At this time, the United States also pressured and accused them, why the Kuomintang and the Communist Party did not quickly cooperate together in the same boat. The Japanese army did not care about anything, but just attacked like a broken bamboo. As a result, Chiang Kai-shek encountered a major political problem. Question: But if this continues, what will be the end result of the Chongqing regime? Answer: As long as there are no political changes in Japan, during this period of high-pitched calls for the livelihoodization of the Chongqing regime, Chiang Kai-shek will not bravely come forward and negotiate a comprehensive peace, and at the same time, it cannot be hoped that a comprehensive peace will fall from the sky if it is allowed to develop naturally. Since the above two are impossible, the Chongqing regime will naturally fully cooperate with the CCP regime and carry out [democratization]. Question: You seemed to have said before that there was hope for a comprehensive peace in the national essence faction's tendency of the Chongqing regime, but why do you say that there is no such hope this time? Your words are really elusive. Answer: From your youth to your adulthood, have you ever experienced the feeling of hating the number of women in society, but having no feeling of love? At that time, it was not that there were no women in society who could be your lover, but because you were still young and did not know how to approach women. At the same time, even if you know how to approach them, maybe you don't have the courage to put it into practice. In addition, there is another reason, that is, in your eyes, you have not found a truly worthy object of your love. When you grow up and are able to attract the attention of women, even if you don't want to pay attention to women, women will also attract your attention. The relationship between Japan and Chongqing is the same. Chongqing longs for a comprehensive peace just like a seventeen- or eighteen-year-old girl wants a husband. But Japan, like a young man who has not yet opened his heart, does not know how to approach women, even if he knows, he has no courage to implement it, and at the same time, he has not obtained the qualifications worthy of being admired in the eyes of women, Japan does not know how to approach the Chongqing regime, even if he knows, he has no courage to implement it, and the policy has not yet reached the level of attracting the attention of the Chongqing regime, so the hope of a comprehensive peace is very small. Based on this point, I think that if Mr. Ugaki, a person who understands the problem very well, thoroughly observes the actual situation in China, and then returns to Japan to advance Japanese politics to a certain extent, it will be possible. If so, then a comprehensive peace will never be impossible. In short, what I cannot help but say is that the key to solving the Sino-Japanese problem lies not in China, but in Japan. It is good for many people to come to China for inspection and find a hole in the key to solving the Sino-Japanese problem, but it is an unforgivable mistake to think that the key is in China. At the same time, even after returning to Japan, it is not necessarily possible to find a ready-made suitable key. We Japanese must mobilize the whole country and make such a suitable key as early as possible. A gentleman devotes himself to the fundamentals. When the fundamentals are established, the Way arises.
