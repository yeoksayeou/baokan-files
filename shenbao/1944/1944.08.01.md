### Establishing a Shanghai Political Model Zone — Commemorating the First Restoration Day —

This day last year was a glorious day in the history of the Chinese nation. Fortunately, with the assistance of our ally Japan, we took over the concessions in this city, lifting the shackles of unequal treaties that had lasted for a century, and unifying the administrative sovereignty of the entire city of Shanghai. The National Government also clearly stipulated that this day would be Restoration Day. Today marks the first anniversary of this commemoration. Standing in the position of the citizens of Shanghai, we are willing to review our past expectations with an honest attitude, learn from the past to understand the present, and express our ardent desire to welcome this festival.

In the past year, expecting the reform and construction of Shanghai can be said to be the consistent advocacy of this newspaper. Our argument particularly focuses on establishing a political model zone and establishing a model zone for Sino-Japanese cooperation.

On March 13th, 15th, and 17th of this year, the editorial of this newspaper advocated for the third establishment of a representative public body. In terms of economy, Shanghai's economic malaise has reached a serious point. The economic crisis can never be saved by economic forces alone. We must first reform politics, and then adopt a two-pronged approach of political economy to achieve results. First, economic institutions must be unified, whether they are economic administrative institutions, control institutions, or price institutions. Second, the economic system must choose what is suitable for China's situation, especially the special environment of Shanghai. Third, the leaders of economic institutions must be experts, and the staff must be carefully selected. Only after the unification of the organic institutions and the integrity of personnel can we talk about ruling the economy and suppressing prices. Only by reforming Shanghai's economic ills and exerting a leading role in guiding the national economy towards normality can we promote genuine Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, and only then can we truly cooperate with our allies to win the Greater East Asia War.

On April 7th, this newspaper's editorial "Establishing a Strong Political Force" stated: "Our first requirement is that Shanghai must have a strong political force as the center, concentrating economic, cultural, and other forces to generate an overall great force. To promote a strong political force: First, the highest administrative organ, the Municipal Government, must improve personnel. Second, each department of the Municipal Government is responsible. It is not enough to passively ensure that individuals do not do bad things and their reputations are not damaged. They must have the courage and determination to actively overcome all difficulties and reform all ills that should not exist in wartime. Furthermore, relying only on the strength of a few people in the government is certainly not enough, and the full cooperation of the people must be added. The people must have the opportunity to participate in politics, and all policies and decrees must first be widely understood by the people. Therefore, a genuine representative public body is urgently needed. In this way, Shanghai can be made a model zone of Chinese politics, a model zone for contributing to the war effort, and further a model zone for Sino-Japanese cooperation... Establishing a strong political force as the center, coordinating with economic forces, Sino-Japanese cooperation, making Shanghai a model zone of Chinese politics, a model zone of Sino-Japanese cooperation."

On July 28th, this newspaper's editorial "Promoting the Model Zone of Seven Counties in Shanghai" proposed four points, hoping that the authorities would be determined to implement them. First, the administrative systems of each county should be immediately established with a complete system based on the gains and losses of the past and with reference to the special circumstances of the local area. Second, improve the personnel of the county administration, first carefully appoint county magistrates, and the criteria for selection should be based on those with administrative experience, lofty aspirations, a spirit of hard work, and integrity. County administration assistants and Baojia personnel must also be strictly selected and conform to the principle of talent. Third, the financial revenue and expenditure of each county should be reorganized, and excessive and miscellaneous taxes should be abolished to relieve the people's suffering. Proper taxes such as land taxes may be raised appropriately based on the amount of income. In principle, what is taken from the local area should be used for the local area. Fourth, establish local security. The military and police should take protecting the people as their mission. Not only must they themselves absolutely not disturb the people, but they must also eliminate any evil forces that could disturb the people... Only after the seven counties in Shanghai are all model counties can the bad environment in the suburbs of Shanghai be changed, and only then can the tranquility of the entire Shanghai be protected.

We reiterate our past proposals to illustrate our ardent desire for Shanghai to establish a political model zone. For the past hundred years, we have expressed our anger and dissatisfaction with the enslavement of our people by the British and American rule in Shanghai. However, now that Shanghai has returned to our control, only by thoroughly reforming people and then actively building and establishing a political model can we reflect the darkness of the British and American rule era, refute the sins of the British and Americans enslaving us, and at the same time, prove our spirit of self-reliance and prove our ability to reform and build.

Finally, we would like to add that today this newspaper's fourth edition is dedicated to a "Special Issue for the Chinese Restoration Day." The content, in addition to Mayor Chen's article "Changes in the Municipal Administrative System in the Past Year," mainly publishes public drafts and suggestions on municipal administration and reform, which also reflect some of the citizens' opinions. We believe that such a commemoration of Restoration Day is not without significance!

### Minister Matsudaira Talks About the Polish Issue British and Soviet Countries Conspire to Contain Each Other

The Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy in China held a press conference as usual at 2:30 pm yesterday (31st) at the 8th floor of the Huasu Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road. Minister of Information Matsudaira of the embassy and Deputy Consul Fukuma attended. During the meeting, Minister Matsudaira spoke in detail about the international situation, especially the Polish issue. It is indeed noteworthy that two organizations have appeared in the same anti-Axis front. The details are recorded as follows:

Two Polish Governments

Poland is in a difficult situation under the current situation. In the anti-Axis camp, there are even two organizations being instigated. The former is the government-in-exile aided by the United Kingdom, and the latter is the Polish National Liberation Committee supported by the Soviet Union today. The future trend of the two Polish organizations is indeed worthy of attention. After the outbreak of the Second European War, the government-in-exile fled to London with the assistance of the United Kingdom. The Second European War. Today, the Soviet Union has established a new government, named the Polish National Liberation Committee, which was recognized three months ago and denied the government-in-exile. The future trend is attracting much attention. It is firmly believed that in the end, the United Kingdom will not hesitate to give in and will definitely change its original attitude.

British-Soviet Conspiracy It has been more than 300 years since the destruction of Poland. Since the first European War, the United Kingdom and the United States, in order to expand their power in Western Europe and prevent the Soviet Union's red policy, deliberately used Poland as a barrier to contain the Soviet Union. "Reborn" Poland, because it has been destroyed for too long, is still difficult to strengthen in everything. At the beginning, the United Kingdom and the United States advocated incorporating Danzig into Poland in order to strengthen Poland. After the opposition of other countries, Danzig was changed to a free city after repeated negotiations. The establishment of New Poland under this situation is no less than a half-dead state. However, the purpose of the United Kingdom and the United States in establishing Poland is entirely to deal with the Soviet Union's red policy. The current intention of the United Kingdom is also to prevent the Soviet Union's red policy, while the Soviet Union is breaking through the Poland "barrier" built by the United States. However, judging from the current situation and the current situation, the Soviet Union should do its best to oppose the United Kingdom's proposition, so the United Kingdom should be pursued step by step.

### Japanese Air Force Bombs Myitkyina Airport Construction of Ledo Road Has Stalled

A Certain Base in Burma, 31st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Air Force in Burma bombed the enemy airfield in Myitkyina on the 29th and launched an air battle with the enemy aircraft group on alert. In this battle, four enemy P47 aircraft and one P61 aircraft were shot down, and all the Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.

Japanese Army Front Line in Burma, 31st (Central News Agency) – The Americans and British started building the Ledo Road for Lunfang in October last year. More than nine months have passed since then. It was originally scheduled to be completed before the rainy season, but it has stalled due to the Japanese army's resolute attacks. At present, the Japanese army continues to launch fierce annihilation battles in the rainy season, inflicting great damage on the united earthquake in the US and the UK. According to a certain general of the Indian Yu army who was recently captured, since the counter-offensive in the autumn of last year, until the end of last month, the number of Lun army soldiers killed in battle was only the newly compiled 38th Division, which was more than 4,500. Among them, one brigade, except for the commander of the alliance, only 50 soldiers were left. The total number of soldiers killed in battle from other divisions and directly subordinate units was more than 8,500. In addition, the number of injured and sick from each division and the number of people missing reached more than 50,000. The construction of the Ledo Road cannot continue due to the Japanese army's attack group. From this, it can be seen that the British and Americans' appointments are full of hypocrisy and fraud. They are very disgusted with the tyrannical British and American troops and the Chiang regime that is willing to be a running dog for the British and Americans. At the same time, they are amazed at the Japanese army's defense of the Nujiang River. They believe that it is impossible to cross the Nujiang River to build the Burmese-Luan Road.

Nanjing, 31st (Central News Agency) – August 1st is the anniversary of Burmese independence. National Government Acting Chairman Chen will make a commemorative broadcast on the evening of the day. The original wording is as follows: "Today, we are celebrating the anniversary of Burmese independence, and my heartfelt joy is beyond words. Burma is an important link in the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, has a long history, and has deep cultural ties with our country. However, after the imperialists invaded the East, Bundian was oppressed by their violence. After the failure of the First Burmese-English War in 1826, it officially became a British colony in 1886 and was directly administered by the British Colonial Department. However, although Burma was oppressed by the central imperialism, the spirit of its people did not decline because of this. People with lofty ideals continued to resist the British, pressing forward wave upon wave, unyielding, in order to restore their original freedom. Until this day last year, with the assistance of Japan, it formally declared its independence, making the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere another independent country. Time flies, and today is the anniversary. Looking back on the past year, under the leadership of Chief Ba Maw, Burma has made continuous efforts and has now laid the foundation for a modern national system. The domestic political and economic aspects have made considerable progress, and its construction of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere has also gained a strong foundation. We are here, for the anniversary of Burmese independence. We express our extreme excitement and sympathy. The lacquer is now in the final decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War. All countries and nationalities within our Co-prosperity Sphere should work together, concentrate human and material resources, and do our best to strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War."

### The New Emerging Country of Burma: A Year of Progress, General Mobilization System Gradually Being Established

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) Since Burma's independence on August 1st of last year, it has become a powerful part of constructing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. For centuries, the Burmese people, under British oppression, had continuously resisted to seek their East Asian ethnic traditions and glory. During this Greater East Asia War, they finally fulfilled their long-cherished wish for glorious independence, declaring war on Britain and the United States, and signing a treaty of alliance with Japan. With the status of a powerful independent nation in East Asia, they are bravely advancing towards the common goal of achieving the Greater East Asia War and building a new order in Greater East Asia.

Regarding military construction, the Burmese government is engaged in promoting war policies and developing a general mobilization system, achieving considerable results. Burma feels that it gained independence amidst war, and to ensure this complete independence, it still needs the ultimate victory of the war. Therefore, its greatest mission after independence is to cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War. Over the past year, the Burmese people have strived for construction, sparing no effort. In both spirit and material aspects, they are gradually developing a general mobilization system, further promoted from the side by the followers of the Dobama Sinyetha Party. This aspect has achieved considerable brilliance, especially in labor mobilization, which has been most effective. The cooperative construction of the Thailand-Burma Railway is a clear example. Currently, the authorities have designated the 23rd of each month as National Labor Service Day, on which all Burmese people engage in social service work. Therefore, Burma's labor mobilization is quite successful, with great achievements in cooperating with the war. From this perspective, it can be seen that the future of the newly emerging country of Burma is truly immeasurable.

Consul-General Usami Delivers Congratulatory Speech

Today is our country's first August 1st Restoration Festival. All sectors of the country are enthusiastically celebrating. Consul-General Usami of the Shanghai Office of the allied nation Japan's Embassy has specially issued the following congratulatory speech:

"The former French and International Concessions in Shanghai held transfer ceremonies on July [blank] and August 1st of last year, respectively. The completion of China's sovereignty, integrity, independence, and century-old aspirations has now been achieved. The National Government designated that day as 'August 1st Restoration Festival' to mark the celebration. Today, I respectfully attend the first Restoration Festival. I believe that the Restoration Festival is the most meaningful commemorative day in the new China and will always be worth celebrating. The independence and integrity of China's sovereignty were desired and promoted by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and all the martyrs and people of China. After the Chinese participated in the war, China and Japan concluded the 'Sino-Japanese Agreement on the Return of Concessions and the Abolition of Extraterritorial Rights' on January 9th of last year. The first fact of this agreement was the return of concessions in Shanghai and other places, and a part of extraterritorial rights were also abolished. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's long-cherished wish for China's sovereign independence and integrity was thus achieved. This is the realization of the war's purpose of building a new order based on fundamental ideals, and it is also the clear protection of the construction work carried out by the Japanese Empire in the course of the war. I believe that the former Shanghai Concession area, which has been used by Britain and the United States as a base for aggression in East Asia for the past century, will make great contributions to the restoration of China and the construction of East Asia in the future. It has the meaning of the Liu era in Chinese history. From the construction of Greater Shanghai, the face has gradually been renewed due to the efforts of the Chinese side over the past year. However, the situation in the Greater East Asia War is becoming increasingly fierce. In order to achieve our ideals, we must intensify our efforts in the future. On this Restoration Festival, in addition to expressing my sincere congratulations, I deeply look forward to the construction work of the decisive battle in Greater Shanghai being promoted more actively."

Feelings of the Standing Committee Members of the Advisory Committee

Today is the anniversary of the Restoration Festival, and it is also the anniversary of the implementation of the unified structure of the Municipal Administration. All parties are enthusiastically celebrating and holding [blank] which is of great significance. The Central News Agency, in order to solicit opinions and contribute to the war situation, and in order to conduct propaganda, specially sent reporters to interview the Municipal Political Advisory Committee to ask for their feelings and opinions. Committee members Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinxiang, Kang Yuan, Chen Ribing, and Yi Bin received them and jointly issued the following statement: (1) Thoughts on the former concessions on the Restoration Festival: 1. In the past, the existence of the concessions meant that the people were scattered and disorganized, social order was chaotic, and robberies occurred frequently. Since the recovery of the concessions and the establishment of the Baojia system, public security has become increasingly consolidated, and social order has become increasingly good. 2. In the past, the existence of the concessions was filled with deformed phenomena of extravagance and waste, to the point where the morals of the people deteriorated day by day. Now that the concessions have been abolished for a year, the social atmosphere is gradually trending towards thrift. 3. In the past, people took the concessions as a refuge, forming a psychology of relying on foreigners, which was actually a source of crime. With the unification of the Municipal Administration and the consistency of government orders, this bad situation is gradually disappearing. After the return of the concessions, [blank] Municipal Political Advisory Committee makes it possible for the situation above to be communicated below.

(2) [Blank] on the unification of the Municipal Administration: 1. I hope that Shanghai will quickly become a model political zone for the whole country. 2. I hope that a real public opinion organization will be realized as soon as possible. 3. I hope to accelerate the promotion of production and improve the people's livelihood. As for specific opinions, they have been summarized and suggested to the municipal authorities, and it is requested that they be adopted for implementation.

Joint Declaration of the Masses

On August 1st, the 32nd year of the Republic of China, our government, with the assistance of allied nations, recovered the concessions, restoring national sovereignty and integrity. This is truly a great event in modern Chinese history and a new development in the National Revolution of the era. The National Government designated this day as the Restoration Festival of the Republic of China, and its meaning is appropriate and profound. Today, August 1st of this year, [blank]. We are celebrating this first Restoration Festival. All Chinese nationals, especially the citizens of Shanghai, at this time [blank] the future of the country, and their hearts are filled with boiling blood. Although our country broke away from the status of a semi-colony on August 1st of last year and jumped into the path of restoration, the task is heavy and the road is long. Moreover, overall peace has not yet been realized, and the Greater East Asia War is pouring its full effort into winning the final victory. At this critical moment, all the people of the country should be encouraged to strive for self-improvement and move towards the correct goal. First, we must work hard to produce and enrich the materials of the Greater East Asia War. Modern warfare is a total war, and material resources are paramount. The spiritual strength of our fighters in the front has already [blank] the enemy. If there is more [blank] of material strength, the final victory will be more assured. Second, we should save all material resources and dedicate them to the country. At this moment of life and death, the life of each person should be reduced to the minimum. Now, most of the people are already struggling in poverty, but some of the urban people are still living in extravagance and dissipation. If this phenomenon is not corrected, it will have a very bad impact on the war in terms of spirit, and it will cause even greater losses to the war in terms of material. Third, we must [blank] corrupt forces to stabilize the people's livelihood. Officials are public servants of the people, and it is their duty to abide by the law and work hard. However, unscrupulous people [blank] the law to exploit the people as their ability. Therefore, the country has more corrupt officials, and the people have more exploitation. If the officials and the people hate each other, the country will be destroyed and the family will perish, and what hope can be restored. As for the communist bandits, they do not want the Chinese society, and they must [blank] the poor people [blank] under the iron hooves of the Red bandits in order to gain the favor of the Soviet Union. This is a heinous act that deserves to die. We will resolutely unite and [blank] them. Fourth, we should obey the leadership, concentrate our strength, and accelerate the completion of the restoration work. Individual liberalism has long been fulfilled in politics [blank], and it can be said that he remembers the famous words in political history. We dare to believe that the British and American imperialists, who are popular with individual freedom Fang Yi, may not play this tune again after this world war. Our country is suffering from hundreds of holes, and at the same time, it still needs to concentrate its strength to eliminate the communist bandits who are destroying the country. If we cannot concentrate our strength under the command of a leader, it will not be easy to overcome this difficulty. The above four points are what we think are urgently needed and provided to our compatriots across the country. Our Shanghai people dare not fall behind, but we hope that our compatriots across the country will rise up together so that we can complete the mission of restoring China and defending East Asia as soon as possible.

Today's Celebration Broadcast Program

In order to celebrate the Chinese Restoration Festival, the Shanghai Radio Station has specially installed loudspeakers on the main thoroughfares of the New World and the Great World today (the 1st) to broadcast various celebratory programs. The main programs are as follows: From 12:10 PM to 12:30 PM, Mr. Kiyoshi Ueno, Director of the Secretariat of the China Central Industrial Prosperity Joint Association, will give a speech ("Practical Matters for August and September").

From 10:15 PM to 10:50 PM, the movie stars' singing concert will feature wonderful programs for all sectors to listen to.

In order to commemorate the recovery of the Shanghai Concessions, the National Government clearly designated August 1st as the Restoration Festival. The Municipal Government of this city has a major change in municipal affairs, so it must have some records, historical antecedents, and precedents to show the people of the country. [blank] decided to set up a stone monument on the Huangpu Bund Road, directly opposite the Nanjing Road, to preserve the memory and use the pavilion tax [blank] to protect it for a long time. The design of this commemorative pavilion has been finalized. It is an octagonal style, with a platform diameter of about 50 feet, surrounded by Beijing-style stone [blank] dry, pavilion diameter of about 20 feet, pavilion business of about 40 feet, roof [blank] with glazed tiles, pavilion column [blank] lacquer vermilion, solid beam [blank] beautiful, covered in a completely Beijing-style typical England also. The city has always been proud of its European and American architecture, and this time, the authorities have adopted this pure Oriental-style architecture to promote China's inherent art, which should be a refreshing experience for the people of the city, and [blank] the groundbreaking ceremony for the commemorative pavilion has been scheduled for 10:30 AM on the morning of the first Restoration Festival on August 1st, with completion expected in the shortest possible time.

### Electricity Consumption to be Reduced Again Starting Today. Statement by the Japanese Embassy.

Regarding the revision of electricity consumption, the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai issued a statement stating: "The importance of electricity at this time is self-evident. With the progress of the war, one watt of electricity is now as valuable as a drop of blood. Therefore, starting from the 1st of this month, electricity consumption will be further reduced beyond the originally stipulated amounts. The authorities have announced a ban on electricity consumption for certain purposes, especially for electric fans and elevators (except for those above the fourth floor). Those who violate this will be severely punished with immediate suspension of electricity supply. This measure is expected to have a significant impact on various aspects. Anyone who understands the actual situation of electricity consumption in the area knows that electricity is still quite precious. Therefore, we should reduce consumption as much as possible at this time, so that we can achieve the greatest effect with the least amount of electricity. At the same time, we hope that all parties will pay full attention to the prohibited electricity consumption and avoid consuming electricity in order to avoid penalties such as power outages. Regarding implementation, we will consider it carefully and strive for a certain degree of flexibility. In addition, we will also take all possible measures to ensure the amount of coal used for power generation in the future, so there is no need to worry. However, with regard to electricity for households and offices, because it has a direct relationship with the war effort, we sincerely hope that it can be saved even more fully."

### Short Commentary: Morbidity and Crisis

The Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange suspended the market yesterday, reportedly because some brokers shorted too much, with insufficient security. But the price shoutings were outrageous, and the fluctuations even more irregular. Originally, the stock market had been in a state of decline for the past few months, in a persistent slump. In a matter of three or several days, it suddenly skyrocketed, with some even exceeding the previous highest price. As a result, the stock market returned to a fervent and crazy state. Such extremely opposite phenomena can only occur in Shanghai, and can only be created by a portion of the people of Shanghai, which is truly sigh-worthy.

The slump in stocks is not normal, taking advantage of the masses and benefiting a few. The sharp rise and skyrocketing of stocks is also not normal. The masses who suffered losses in the past watch it rise with their eyes wide open, and in the end, it again benefits a few. However, these few people will also suffer losses when it plummets, and they will make even more money when it soars. It is said that this surge was based on rumors, so these few people may be the ones who create the rumors, the speculators who seek exorbitant profits.

Why is there no way for society to sanction these stock speculators who stir up trouble, and why is there no way for the government to ban them? If this cannot be answered, then that is the morbidity of Shanghai's economy, and that is Shanghai's hidden crisis.

### One Year of Changes in the Municipal Administrative System

— Chen Gongbo

Today is the first Restoration Day of the Republic of China, and also marks the first anniversary of the recovery of the two concessions in Shanghai. It is also the first day of the true unification of the administrative system of Greater Shanghai Municipality. I would like to take this memorable day to give the citizens a brief report on the changes in the municipal administrative system over the past year.

When the French Concession was recovered on July 30th last year, and the Public Concession was recovered on August 1st, the Municipal Government changed the Public Concession to the First District and the French Concession to the Eighth District. The Public Concession's police station was changed to the First Police Bureau, and the French Concession's police station was changed to the Third Police Bureau. This arrangement at that time was to prepare for the true unification of the administrative system of Greater Shanghai today. At that time, I also knew that some citizens were skeptical, thinking that once the concessions were recovered, the Municipal Government should immediately merge. Why go through these twists and turns? Wouldn't that be wasting time? Or at least unnecessary. However, even though the citizens were just skeptical and critical, I still insisted on my own opinion, because based on my experience and observation, I felt that governing should be practical, and haste makes waste. Therefore, I would rather be doubted and criticized, even to the point of being misunderstood personally, thinking that I was either stubbornly self-willed or too prejudiced. There were indeed some misunderstandings at that time, and there were such private discussions, but I resolutely ignored them. Why? On the day the concessions were recovered, I discovered two kinds of difficulties, external and internal. Without first establishing the credibility of the Municipal Government, it would be impossible to easily talk about reform, let alone unification.

External Difficulties

The so-called external difficulties, I found several kinds: First, many people believed that under the jurisdiction of foreigners, the administrative efficiency of the two concessions was not bad. Once directly under the Municipal Government and handled by the Chinese themselves, the results would certainly not be good. Second, the revenue of the two concessions was considerable, while the Municipal Government's own revenue was negligible. If the two concessions were merged into the Municipal Government, the result would inevitably be that the expenses of the two concessions would be used for other purposes, not to mention wastefulness, which has long been criticized in China. I was afraid that if the two concessions were merged into the Municipal Government, the local undertakings of the two former concessions would also be completely halted. Third, the organizations of the municipal councils and the Works Department of the two concessions have been established for nearly a hundred years or decades. Although they do not conform to the Chinese system, at least in Shanghai, they have been operating smoothly. There was a deep fear that after the merger, once reforms were made, there would inevitably be a period of confusion and disorder, which would not only affect administrative efficiency, but also hinder local security. Given these various external difficulties, to seek immediate unification when the concessions were recovered last year would not only be impossible, but also not allowed.

Internal Difficulties

The so-called internal difficulties, I also found several kinds. In addition to the fact that the Municipal Government's own system was very different from the two concessions, the two concessions themselves were also very different. First, the focus of the Public Concession was on the Council, and the Works Department was only an executive organ. The Council in the French Concession was merely like an advisory body, with the real focus on the French Consul-General. Furthermore, the police of the Public Concession belonged to a department of the Works Department, while the police of the French Concession were directly under the control of the French Consulate-General. Although these two different systems could be forced to be the same with a single order, the habits and minds of the staff could not be changed immediately with a single order. To take hasty action would inevitably hinder efficiency. Second, the local taxes of the two concessions not only had different tax rates, but also different types. One option would be to immediately increase the burden on the citizens of one district, while allowing it to remain natural would create the disadvantage of uneven burden on citizens within the same district. Third, employee benefits, in addition to different salaries, also had different regulations for retirement benefits and annual salaries. When the two concessions existed side by side, these differences did not cause problems, but if they were suddenly unified under the Municipal Government while still being different, there would be no justification. Therefore, rather than taking hasty action and inviting criticism, it would be better to improve gradually and seek practical results.

At the same time, I had another idea that after the Incident, the seven counties including Nanhui were changed to special districts under the jurisdiction of Shanghai. The reason for taking them at that time was that the municipal expenses were insufficient, so the counties were ceded to the city as a adjustment, or to expand the urban area for security reasons to facilitate control. However, after careful consideration of this reform, Shanghai has a feeling of being neither a province nor a city. If Shanghai is said to be a province, the jurisdiction is still too small. If Shanghai is said to be a city, the jurisdiction seems too broad. In my opinion, in order to make Shanghai's administration truly unified, it is necessary to clarify the boundaries of the urban area first, so that it can gradually move forward on the right track. Since the administrative natures of the city and the county are different, it is not appropriate to mix them up, which hinders efficiency.

Ideals and Policies

Therefore, when the two concessions in Shanghai were recovered, I immediately set a policy: the first step was to allow the two concessions to exist separately temporarily, to be reorganized once, and then to be initially merged. At the same time, the same policy was adopted for the police in the two concessions. The second step was to wait until a suitable time to re-divide the city's boundaries reasonably, using the future development of industry and commerce as the standard for dividing districts, and the jurisdiction would be equivalent to the New Shanghai Plan before the Incident. The third step was to restore county governance in each special district and establish a system of supervisory commissioners to guide each county and make it a model of true county governance, and then return them to Jiangsu or carve out a new province in response to the times. This was the ideal and policy at that time, which has been gradually implemented over the past year.

Preparation for Unification

Therefore, since last month, the Public Concession, the French Concession, and the city center area, the Hubei District, the Huxi District, the urban area, the Pudongbei District, and the Pudongnan District, have been divided into several districts by number, which is to prepare for the division of urban and suburban areas today. Nanhui, Fengxian, Chuansha, Beiqiao (today's Shenjiang County), Chongming, Jiading, and Binshan are still divided into special districts by place name, which is to prepare for the restoration of county governance today. Furthermore, the Public Concession's police station was changed to the First Police Bureau, the French Concession's police station was changed to the Third Police Bureau, and the original Municipal Government's police station was renamed the Second Police Bureau, which is to prepare for the great unification today.

Why was the French Concession changed to the Eighth District, and the French Concession's police changed to the Third Police Bureau? Because placing it at the end of the numbering sequence makes it easy to cancel when merging, without having to re-number it. Furthermore, at that time, Nanshi was changed to the Seventh District, also with the intention of merging the Seventh and Eighth Districts, and then canceling the Nanshi District to make it a urban area. I also stated at the beginning of the recovery of the concessions that the First and Third Police Bureaus would be merged within three months, and the First and Eighth Districts would be merged within six months. This has already been implemented, and there is no need to repeat it.

I personally feel happy that since the establishment of the First and Eighth Districts, external difficulties have been reduced and eliminated very quickly. The first manifestation was the sharp increase in the revenue of the Eighth District, and the Chinese and Japanese employees were able to cooperate sincerely. Therefore, the speculation that the Chinese would not handle affairs well has gradually lost its basis. The fear that the Municipal Government would waste the expenses of the former concessions has also been reduced. After one year, the two districts have been able to adopt methods to bring them into compliance with Chinese laws and regulations without feeling inconvenient. In addition, with the efforts of the staff, internal difficulties have also been smoothly resolved. Although the past year has not been long, the effect has been remarkable. This is where I can boast to myself, where the Municipal Government can report without fear, and where the citizens can also benefit.

This time, the Shanghai area has been re-divided, and the administrative system of Greater Shanghai has been rapidly unified. Although it is our ideal and our plan, it can be implemented within one year and on the first Restoration Day. Its speed and smoothness were beyond my expectations. Here, I cannot but thank the Japanese side for their warm assistance, and I cannot but thank the citizens for their support.

Today, I should declare and express my thanks that from today onwards, Shanghai's municipal administration is truly unified, our ideals have been realized, and the citizens' expectations have been met. From today onwards, Shanghai is no longer a diplomatic issue, but a domestic issue. Whether Shanghai's revival can be rapid and whether Shanghai's municipal administration can advance completely depends on whether civil servants can fulfill their duties and whether citizens can innovate.

Security and Economy

I also know that the biggest problems in Shanghai today are security and economy. However, these two problems are not unique to Shanghai, but are part of the whole problem. For example, in terms of security, in order to have good security in Shanghai, we must first establish the security of the surrounding areas. All the counties in the suburbs, as well as the areas near Shanghai in Jiangnan, and even Qidong in Subei and Yuyao in Zhejiang, are related. I personally always try my best to seek a fundamental solution. For example, in terms of economic issues, in addition to increasing production, which requires the cooperation of China and foreign countries, and does not need to be explained, let's take food as an example. Nanjing and Shanghai are both metropolises, only six hours away by train. I really don't understand why the price of rice in Nanjing is about 3,000 yuan, while it reaches 10,000 yuan in Shanghai. I think it's more than just human negligence, it's simply human conspiracy that makes it negligent. Thinking of this, I earnestly hope that citizens and the government will cooperate closely so that general economic problems can be reasonably resolved.

Today, I am only giving a report on the changes in the administrative system over the past year. Other issues will be discussed with the citizens on another day for implementation. I hope that Chinese and foreign citizens will work together to ensure that even if we cannot make Shanghai prosperous, we should try to stabilize Shanghai. Only in this way can we live up to the epoch-making cause of recovering the concessions and the great significance of the Restoration Day.

### Winning the People's Hearts First

— Zeng Zhe

Mencius once said: "The reason why Jie and Zhou lost the empire was because they lost the people; the reason why they lost the people was because they lost their hearts. There is a way to gain the empire: to gain the people, one gains the empire; there is a way to please the people: to gain their hearts, one pleases the people; there is a way to gain their hearts: to give them what they desire and not impose on them what they dislike." Although these words are already "antiques," they provide politicians with a fundamental principle for the success or failure of their political career. In other words, if a politician wants to achieve his great political career, winning the hearts of the people and gaining the masses is his first task, because the direction of the people's hearts is the basis for the success or failure of politics. Based on this principle, reviewing the gains and losses of Shanghai's municipal administration in the past and the direction in which Shanghai's municipal administration should move forward in the future, it seems that there is a simple and clear standard and marker.

What are the gains and losses of Shanghai's municipal administration? We can get a factual answer from the past year, from the recovery of the concessions on August 1st last year to the present. The achievements cannot be denied, and the mistakes cannot be concealed either. Mencius also said: "To save the dying for fear of not being in time, how can one have time to govern the state?" Therefore, the review of Shanghai's municipal administration can focus on the issue of the people's livelihood. Everything else is a minor issue.

In fact, since the recovery of the concessions, the severity of the people's livelihood problem has only increased day by day. The household rice rationing set up by the government authorities to maintain their own interests has been reduced from two sheng per person per week to two sheng per person every ten days; then from two sheng per person every ten days to one sheng per person every ten days, and now it has been completely stopped. On the part of the authorities, there are unavoidable difficulties, but on the part of the people, the impression of the government is that it has failed to reach the point of "giving them what they desire." After the household rice rationing was stopped, the price of rice soared; after the implementation of the "Temporary Measures for Rice and Grain," the price of rice rose again; and since the establishment of the Rice Control Association to collect military grain, the price of rice has risen like an arrow from a strong bow. Under this situation, the citizens are like living in deep water and burning fire. This fact, which departs from the realm of "not imposing on them what they dislike," which a clear-minded politician needs to adopt to win the hearts of the people, goes in the opposite direction. This fact shows that the government authorities have failed to alleviate the people's difficulties.

Secondly, due to the inability to maintain the people's livelihood, all prices have been stimulated and risen, thus creating an unprecedented surge in the cost of living. Under the pressure of high prices, the citizens have tried every means to seek improper profits from opportunistic shortcuts to supplement their living needs. The officials in the government agencies at all levels, from the heads of the food departments to the servants of the "Rice and Grain Import and Export Permit Offices," not only fail to stop the illegal activities of lawless merchants, but also collude with them for personal gain. Even if a rumor spreads, they openly plunder and do not regard it as different. Furthermore, when the citizens use their "Citizen Certificates" to exchange for "Residence Certificates," in addition to the "handling fee" of five yuan that should be paid according to regulations, they even need to pay an additional fifty yuan or one hundred yuan of additional expenses. This additional expense is not receipted to the payers, nor is it remitted to the authorities. This is obviously a kind of "black market" extortion, and the authorities turn a blind eye to it and turn a deaf ear to it. Therefore, bribery cases among civil servants are not only explicitly protected, but are also regarded as behavior that is not strange. This fact shows that the government authorities have failed to eliminate corruption.

"Alleviating the people's difficulties" is "what the people desire." Corrupt officials and bureaucrats are "what the people dislike." Whether the Shanghai municipal authorities have been able to do "giving them what they desire and not imposing on them what they dislike" in the past, millions of Shanghai citizens have already had a clear understanding that cannot be deceived by clever propaganda slogans in the practical life of "practicing in person." Wei Zheng once said in his "Ten Thoughts to Emperor Taizong": "If you govern them with strict punishments and shake them with anger, they will eventually avoid punishment but not cherish benevolence, and be outwardly respectful but not inwardly convinced." Under the heavy pressure of 10,000-odd yuan per shi of rice, millions of Shanghai citizens, although still "obedient," and even "singing praises," are actually harboring a terrible crisis behind their backs. Once the crisis erupts, the phenomenon described by Duke Mu of Zou more than a thousand years ago, "Thirty-three of my officers died, and the people died, but it is impossible to punish them all; if we do not punish them, they will hate the death of their superiors and not save them," will be replayed today.

Therefore, the facilities that Shanghai's municipal administration should promote in the future may be numerous, but the fundamental goal is to win the hearts of the people through implementation, and the primary task of winning the hearts of the people is "alleviating the people's difficulties" and "eliminating corruption." In fact, there is also a sequential relationship between these two issues. The more difficulties the people have, the more corrupt officials there will be. The more corrupt officials there are, the more pain the people will suffer. The "integrity politics" strongly advocated by Mayor Chen Gongbo is not a prescription for this disease. Unfortunately, in the current Shanghai, it is really impossible to see any trace of it. As the saying goes, "If civil officials do not want money and military officials are not afraid of death, then the world will be governed." If Shanghai's municipal administration can achieve this, millions of citizens will naturally dedicate their hearts and bodies to the country and loyally assist the government.

Therefore, Shanghai's municipal administration in the future should take "winning the hearts of the people" as the first goal!

### Shanghai Municipal Administration

— Zhu Yanling

Since Shanghai recovered the concessions on this day last year, the Eighth District Police Bureau was subsequently merged into the Second District Police Bureau, and the Huxi First District was merged into the First District. The Eighth District was also merged into the First Bureau, and now the Second Bureau Police Bureau has also been merged into the Second District Police Bureau to form one bureau, generally named the Shanghai Special Municipal Police Bureau. In this way, the administrative system of the entire city has gradually become more unified, which is no longer comparable to the previous four-part division. Although Shanghai is only a small piece of land, it was previously divided into several parts, with the administrative powers standing side by side - one Chinese, one public, one French - like three kingdoms, each not seeking each other. Now that the power has been unified, it seems that the Chang Bureau should be able to make great achievements and thoroughly renovate it, so as to open up a strange situation unprecedented in history and wash away the great humiliation of a hundred years of partial peace. But now, after examining the reality, there are still many things that have not been able to fully satisfy people's wishes. Although it is in this extraordinary period and the environment is special, it is not possible to seek perfection, but there are still things that can be done within its capacity. Now, let me briefly list a few things below.

Nanshi and Zhabei both belong to the urban area. Although they are outside the First District, they are all closely connected with the First District. How can they be regarded as detached? However, these two districts have been devastated by soldiers and bandits, and have been desolate for many years. Now that the First and Second Police Bureaus have been merged again, it may be a precursor to the merger of these two districts into the entire district. In the future, Nanshi and Zhabei districts should be regarded as the same as the First District and developed uniformly, without discrimination, so as to allow those who survived the disaster to have a new life. The first step in development is to restore the tram to facilitate transportation. Although recently, in order to save electricity, the trams in the First District are still reducing routes and reducing the number of heavy vehicles, and it seems that there is no surplus power to operate this service again. However, there is only one tram line in Nanshi, which does not cost much. If the First District reduces the number of trams a little, it can offset the cost of one line in Nanshi with a surplus. And the one line in Nanshi is enough to offset the use of more than ten lines of electricity in the First District. How can it be ignored? As for Zhabei, which originally had no tram, but only public automobiles, it is now possible to find ways to restore a public automobile line to travel back and forth, which will certainly be of some help to revive the market. These can be immediately discussed with the military authorities and implemented as soon as possible. At the same time, encourage citizens to move to the two districts, renovate the city appearance, clean up the rubble, and clear the weeds. Although today's materials are tight and scarce and wages are high, it is impossible to rebuild houses in large quantities. However, it is not useless to organize and renovate the existing ones. Moreover, the population of the First District is crowded and houses are in short supply. If Nanshi and Zhabei are restored and revitalized and transportation is convenient, then a large number of households will move there automatically without being encouraged, and those who live and work in peace will be happy. This is also one way to disperse the population.

In recent years, assassination and kidnapping cases have completely disappeared, and robbery cases are also rare. The security of the urban area has improved compared to before, and the order is ensured, which is commendable. However, this is not due to the diligence of the police, but due to the wartime system. As for the police, they still follow the old traditions of the previous concessions, and their quality is inherently poor. As a result, not only do they extort money from porters and vendors everywhere, reaching out for money as if it were natural and no one else was around, but they even take advantage of the darkness to search travelers who get off the train at the railway station in the name of checking citizen certificates and residence certificates. They do not protect the people, but instead harm the people, which is extremely negligent. Although their salaries are low and insufficient to support their families, how can they take debts from this? Now it is imperative to choose the best and punish them severely, gradually eliminate them, recruit new ones, train them strictly, and fill the vacancies, so as to reform them. This is also the first priority after the merger of the First and Second Police Bureaus today.

The price of goods in Shanghai today is not only the highest in the country, but also the highest in the world. There are also many other countries that are at war, but the price of goods has never been so expensive. Although the unified control of goods has its own agencies, which seems to have nothing to do with the municipal administration, the police officers who extort money from the vendors along the way are all under the jurisdiction of the municipal government. If travelers carry a little something in their hands, they will be asked for money every five steps, and every ten steps. If they are not satisfied, they will not be allowed to pass. Therefore, the price of goods in the countryside and Shanghai, which are only dozens of miles away from each other, is several times higher. This is because the vendors add the small expenses they spend at the checkpoints to the price of goods to compensate for their losses. Recently, the inspectors at the checkpoints have even used the excuse that the price of goods has risen again to double the extortion, thinking that since the price of goods has risen, the vendors have made even greater profits, so the checkpoints' expenses cannot remain the same. Therefore, the inspectors at the checkpoints everywhere should be abolished, so that travelers will be free, transportation will be smooth, the price of goods will naturally be cheap, and the common people will benefit a lot, and they will all applaud and praise it. Although there are special agencies for suppressing prices today, the Economic Bureau and the Economic Office are all agencies under the jurisdiction of the municipal government. Now that the people are suffering and their lives are hanging by a thread, how can the authorities stand by and watch indifferently? Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the police officers who inspect at the checkpoints are all dispatched by the municipal police bureau. Moreover, it is also a matter of raising a hand to seek improvement.

Corruption in politics has become the number one disease in the entire political arena of China today, and it is even worse in Shanghai. Rumor has it that every time goods are allocated or public utilities apply for price increases, a huge bribe must be paid at the same time. Although there is no real evidence, rumors are not groundless, and it is inevitable that the common people will be suspicious and fearful. For example, the tax collection agencies under the Finance Department must collect festival taxes from taxpayers during festivals; the investigators extort money without limit. Newspapers have repeatedly reported on this, and the evidence is clear. Therefore, a large number of people have been fired from the certificate offices, and the director personally issued a life-saving theory before the Dragon Boat Festival, strictly prohibiting the extortion of festival gifts. However, those who are prohibited and those who extort go their own ways and do not interfere with each other. Especially those who used to work in the former Public Works Department were recommended by senior personnel in the department for their relatives and old friends, and were arbitrarily filled up. They lacked integrity and were only greedy for food, and there was no legal or moral way to restrain them. Now that the comprador system has been completely eradicated, these people should also be thoroughly liquidated to purify the municipal administration and correct the officials' evil ways. How can one family laugh while the rest of the road cries?

The low-lying areas in Huxi become flooded whenever it rains. In the past, the Public Works Department built several large underground drains to facilitate drainage, but it did not complete the task. Now, I have not heard of any continued construction. As a result, whenever there is a heavy rain, the entire area becomes a sea of water, making it impossible to cross, which is extremely inconvenient. In addition, the areas where people from Jiangbei live are dirty, with filth everywhere, and garbage and sewage are dumped along the road. I have not heard of the health authorities taking any action to crack down on this. Moreover, the roads in slightly remote areas are in disrepair everywhere. In the past, the Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau used to repair them from time to time, but it was still not enough. Now, I have not seen the Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau start any repairs. Last year, the First District Government's Finance Department had a surplus of 98 million yuan for road repairs, so there is no need to worry about funds. Why has it not started any construction? This is also a major task of the municipal administration, which should be improved as soon as possible.

We citizens should not have excessive expectations for Shanghai's municipal administration, especially in wartime, and we should not make too many suggestions. However, the above-mentioned matters are only the most important ones, which are all within the power of the municipal government. We hope that they will be held and carried out as soon as possible, or reformed and renovated, which will be a blessing for the citizens, and is it only a blessing for the citizens?

### Suggestions for the Economic Revival of Shanghai 李思遂

On the surface, the economic revival of Shanghai seems unrelated to municipal construction, but in reality, it is not. The current decline in Shanghai's industry production, soaring price indices, stagnation of finance and other industries, and the shortage of civilian financial power, all constitute a situation where people can barely make a living. If this continues, is it possible that it will severely impact Shanghai's security and local government revenue? This is a hidden danger for the future of the city. Consider the remarks of Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the newly appointed economic advisor to the National Government, who believes that Shanghai's economic position is very important. Therefore, reviving Shanghai's economy is a pressing matter. This shows the importance of economic revival in Shanghai's administrative construction.

The current economic crisis in Shanghai is manifested in two aspects: continuously rising prices and shrinking industrial production. The main driver of rising prices is actually the rise in black market rice prices. Last December, the price of rice rose, and all other goods followed suit. In February and June of this year, the black market rice price rose again and again, stimulating other prices. This shows that rice is the focus of the price problem. On the other hand, since the electricity restrictions in December of last year, Shanghai's industrial production has been threatened. In February of this year, the productivity of various industries in Shanghai was only about 60% of the monthly average of last year, with wool spinning and knitting industries even less than 40%. As for the percentage of electricity needed for monthly electricity restrictions compared to normal operation, the average is about 50%, while the paper industry is at 30%. In addition, the allocation of gas and raw coal is also decreasing. Therefore, the shortage of coal limits the supply of power and directly affects the current industrial production of Shanghai.

The fundamental solution to Shanghai's rice and coal problems relies on increased rice production and the transportation of coal from the north to the south. However, the solution to these problems requires the National Government to make comprehensive plans and implement them, which is beyond the capacity of the Shanghai authorities alone. However, this does not mean that the Shanghai authorities cannot implement stopgap measures, such as unblocking rice sources, strengthening control, adjusting electricity usage, and concentrating production, to rescue the current economic crisis. Reviving Shanghai's economy is still a pressing matter for the Shanghai administrative authorities. I, in my limited wisdom, dare to offer my humble suggestions on the direction of emergency measures for the economic revival of Shanghai, hoping to spark further discussion.

Strengthening the Function of the Rice Control Committee At this critical moment of administration, there is no time to talk about prosperity or decline; we should gather our strength to reform and improve the severity of the current rice shortage.

(A) Adjustment of the Organization and Personnel of the Rice Control Committee:

I. The lower-level procurement mechanism must change the past shortcomings of the Rice Control Committee's orders not reaching local offices. Strengthen the cooperation between the lower-level agencies and local administrative organs to prevent rice merchants from dominating the market in rice distribution centers, and establish direct contact with farmers to eliminate all intermediary exploitation.

II. Purify the bad elements in the administration and cultivate clean and virtuous staff. Reward those who have meritorious service and punish those who have done wrong. There is no doubt that the latter is a positive method to strengthen the Rice Control Committee's lower-level organization. Distinguish clearly between rewards and punishments, use people based on their abilities, and avoid the bad habit of appointing people based on personal relationships. (B) Improving the Procurement Methods:

I. In addition to fixed procurement prices, adopt a high-price policy that is timely, localized, and flexible. When purchasing, payment must be made in full, to avoid individual buyers taking advantage of the situation.

II. The procurement process should be carefully planned in advance so that speculators have no way to use it. The execution should be swift to prevent the black market price of rice from being higher than the procurement price, increasing the difficulty of the procurement work. Secondly, the distribution of funds should also be timely to avoid the mistakes in previous procurements.

III. Strengthen the implementation of the barter trade policy, so that farmers can obtain low-priced industrial daily necessities to compensate for their shortcomings.

IV. Strengthen transportation efficiency and organize inland river vessels in a planned manner to facilitate transportation. In addition, the assistance of the China Railway is also not to be underestimated.

Compensating for the Electricity Shortage It is very difficult to increase the coal source, so we can only use passive methods to compensate for the electricity supply shortage. (A) Centralization and Readjustment of Electricity.

I. Stop or reduce the supply of non-essential electricity. Germany and Japan have stopped supplying all entertainment-related electricity since February of this year, and the number of movie screenings is also limited to education and propaganda films. Other venues such as theaters are all closed. However, Shanghai seems to be too lenient in this regard.

II. Various industries should be reassessed and redistributed the electricity according to their role in the war effort and the importance to the people's needs. This measure may cause damage to individual industries, but for the sake of the entire economic future of Shanghai, we have to do so. (B) Improving Electricity Use.

### Suggestions for Organizing the Shanghai Municipal Council

Shanghai is a metropolis with a population of five million, which is second to none in China and occupies a considerable position in the international community. How can Shanghai, as a city, establish a national model internally and renew international concepts externally? Of course, it is a shared responsibility of the Shanghai Municipal Government and its citizens. Under this premise, there must first be a cooperative municipal council organization between the Municipal Government and the citizens. On the one hand, it represents the citizens to supervise and make suggestions; on the other hand, it represents the government to promote its will. In this way, the lower-level situation will not be ignored by the higher-ups, and the higher-ups' intentions will not be lost to the lower-levels. All government orders can be smoothly promoted, and any reforms can be identified and implemented. The following is a general description of the ideal municipal council.

In terms of economics, Shanghai can be said to be China's economic capital. Leaders from all walks of life gather in this city. Therefore, in terms of electing municipal councilors, special emphasis should be placed on figures in the economic sector. Let them promote their own suffering, and the reforms in politics can also be adapted to the needs of the economy. Under this premise, it is best to adopt a professional representative system for the election of municipal councilors, based on the proportion of each industry in the economy to determine the number of seats. Other sectors, such as the press, education, and freelancers, should also be allocated a certain number of seats, so that the Shanghai Municipal Council can fully represent the opinions of various professions and classes in Shanghai. The way to elect municipal councilors is, of course, the most ideal way is by direct election by citizens. However, the general knowledge of the citizens is uneven, and the quality of the voters is not consistent. In the near future, it seems appropriate to temporarily have various existing civil organizations elect their own representatives. The number of people should be selected carefully rather than carelessly, and a total of about fifty people is sufficient, with an average of one municipal councilor representing every 100,000 citizens.

Shanghai is not only China's economic capital, but also in politics, education, culture, and other aspects, it is also in an important position. Everything that happens in Shanghai has a great impact on various parts of China. If Shanghai can innovate, it will influence and promote China's innovation. Since the municipal council is in a position to supervise and advise the government, it should be given great power to assume the responsibility of comprehensively reforming Shanghai. All local events in Shanghai, except for national events such as diplomacy and military affairs, should be included in the municipal council's discussions. At the same time, the municipal government should be required to fulfill the obligations of implementing the municipal council's resolutions, to avoid the drawbacks of discussion without resolution, or resolution without implementation.

Whether the personnel in municipal administration are sound is directly related to the quality of municipal administration. The mayor is the leader of the city, and whether his character, knowledge, and ability are competent and pleasant are related to the well-being of the entire city. The heads of various bureaus, who assist the mayor and lead their subordinates, are also in the position of cadres. The most ideal way is to have the mayor elected by the citizens or by the citizens' representatives. But under the current environment, there are practical difficulties. At a minimum, the municipal council should have the special power to impeach the mayor and his officials. The central government should refer the impeachment case to the mayor and his officials for disciplinary action.

Finance is the lifeblood of all administration. A city's finances must be taken from the people and used for the people. It is of course natural for the municipal council to review and approve the preliminary budget and review the final accounts afterwards. The municipal council should also be given the power to approve or reject the creation of local taxes, the increase or decrease of tax rates, and the change of uses. Among the mayor's officials, the director of finance is the most important. If we hope that the municipal finance is independent, it is best that the director of the Finance Bureau does not advance or retreat with the mayor, and is elected by the municipal councilors, directly responsible to the municipal council, so as to avoid the mayor's restriction on financial administration, and the director of the Finance Bureau can also carry out financial plans based on the welfare of the entire city.

The responsibility of the municipal councilors is to communicate the opinions of the government and the citizens. Therefore, instead of having the municipal councilors as full-time positions, it is better to allow them to hold other positions so that they can maintain contact with all aspects of society. By understanding the hardships of the people's lives, they can make more accurate views when speaking and discussing matters in the municipal council. At the same time, in any organization, the role of renewal is extremely important. The advanced elements of the previous year may have fallen behind now, so the term of office of municipal councilors should not be too long, with a term of two years being appropriate. However, in order to allow outstanding people to be familiar with their work, it is advisable to stipulate that they can be re-elected.

The above are the major points. In short, if Shanghai wants to be revived, the government and the citizens must be integrated as one and strive forward. The organization of the municipal council is the starting point for the integration of the government and the citizens. Shanghai's cultural level is higher than the rest of the country, and the objective conditions for organizing a municipal council are already in place. If officials and the people can cooperate, the future will surely be very bright. — Wang —
