### National Unity

The war has reached a decisive stage. The national strength accumulated in peacetime requires substantial replenishment due to the extensive consumption over a long period. The people of the entire nation are the source of replenishing and revitalizing the country's strength. The degree of national cooperation determines the amount of increase in national power, and whether the government's guidance of the people is sound is the deciding factor on whether the people can cooperate.

After returning from Japan, Information Minister Matsudaira gave a speech, stating that the thorough implementation of the "national diligence" spirit in Japan has solidified the total national power, creating a great and precious achievement in this era. He cited an example of a place in Japan where, on a barren field of reeds, the people worked tirelessly, day and night, clearing the land and eventually creating a dockyard, building over eighty wooden ships. This demonstrates the spirit of human determination prevailing over nature, and represents national cooperation.

Why are the Japanese people able to cooperate so well in national affairs? First, it is the self-awareness of the people themselves; second, it is the effective leadership of the government. Elder Tokutomi Sohō's four major demands on the government are: to trust the people, to respect the people, to listen to the voices of the people, and to implement politics based on the people. When promoting national cooperation, it is important to highlight its importance. Only with a government that works for the people above can there be people who work for the nation below. If the government belongs to the people and cares for the people, then the people will naturally obey and care for the government. This is the natural principle of populism, and "the people are the foundation of the nation, and a strong foundation ensures national peace" is a famous maxim from Chinese dynasties.

Looking at the efforts of the Allies, everyone should have a profound realization. During this decisive period, the government must do its best to utilize the strength of the people. The government can also punish citizens who do not contribute. The question is how the government should act. Mencius said, "If rulers use people with ease, though they labor, they do not complain; if they put people to death when they might live, though they die, they do not hate those who put them to death." This is such an ideal scene. When Zhuge Liang governed with penalties, he was sincere, impartial, strict in regulations, fair in rewards and punishments, punished all evils, promoted all good, did not tolerate corruption, and encouraged self-improvement. Therefore, he maintained internal peace among the populace and defended against external aggression. This is the best way to govern and use the people. His seven captures of Meng Huo and six expeditions to Qishan were national wars executed with the cooperation of the entire nation.

Governing a country with the people's well-being as the top priority is a universal principle, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. This principle allows people to work for national construction in peacetime with peace of mind and sacrifice for the country willingly in times of war. The severity of modern warfare cannot be compared to ancient times, so modern nations need the strength of their people even more than ancient nations. To make the people work without complaint and die without resentment, the government needs to make even more efforts for the people. There is no other way. This is the essence of people-based politics, and its effectiveness can be seen clearly in the Allied nations.

China has been at war for nearly two years. We, the people, are ashamed that we cannot contribute more, and our government should reflect on why it cannot lead the people to contribute. In this decisive period, every Chinese citizen should contribute their strength. However, in a situation where the people have the strength but no way to exert it, and the government wants to lead but cannot find a way, everyone must look to history, the current situation in various countries around the world, and all the national and people-oriented measures of our ally Japan, to seek a lesson and find a way out. National cooperation is urgently needed. How the people can cooperate and how the government can lead the people to cooperate are even more pressing issues.

### Japanese Navy Will Exert Maximum Power in the Pacific, Soviet Military Expert Discusses Difficulties of US Attack on Philippines

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - Soviet military expert Xiang Ermashiv recently published an article in the naval journal "The Fleet," titled "The Philippine Operation." The gist of the article is as follows: The purpose of the American landing on Peleliu Island is to control the Palau Islands as a base for attacking the Philippines. However, the American operation in the Philippines still faces many difficulties. The important American base on the west coast of the United States is far from both Hawaii and Australia. Therefore, the American military intends to build a large supply base in the Palau Islands. Moreover, the Japanese army not only has a large number of troops in the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies, but also has very abundant reserves. Therefore, the operation in the Philippines is more difficult than any previous operation. At the end of September, the U.S. Wartime Information Bureau listed the advantages of the anti-Axis forces in the war against Japan and detailed the advantages of the Japanese army, stating that Japan has the ability to increase the production of various military supplies, and has a large stockpile of food, weapons, manufactured goods, and raw materials. The Japanese navy can still exert its maximum power.

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a New York dispatch, the Current Affairs Debate Conference hosted by the U.S. Weekly magazine began on the 16th. At the conference, Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz broadcast a speech from Pearl Harbor, stating: The path to victory in the war against Japan is still long and there are many dangers. We must realize that the war in the Pacific will take a long time. This is a conclusion based on facts, based on geography, topography, and the facts of the ships that can be used, and the facts of army and navy strategy. The progress of the war will require great efforts in the future, which is what is required of the entire nation.

### German Navy Commander-in-Chief Sends Telegram to Congratulate Japanese Navy Minister on Great Victory, Germans Excited

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - Haito News Agency: German Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Dönitz sent a telegram to the Japanese Navy Minister to congratulate him. The full text reads: "On behalf of the German military, I would like to congratulate Your Excellency on the great victory of the Imperial Navy over the enemy fleet in Taiwan. This victory, in our common war against the illegal demands of Britain and America, undoubtedly inflicts a major blow to the American fleet. The German Navy is overjoyed at the news. This victory is nothing less than a stimulant for us."

### German Newspapers Report on Japanese Military Achievements

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - German newspapers on the 17th continuously reported on the great war results of the Japanese Navy in the waters east of Taiwan. The Berlin Evening News published an article stating that Roosevelt should recognize Japan's determination and strength. When Nimitz repeatedly reported to the country that the US Navy had not been defeated in Taiwan, it had already suffered a severe blow from the Japanese army. This fact may have made it difficult for him to speak. Nimitz once sang that it is still difficult to win the war against Japan, and ending the war as soon as possible is a wrong idea. The American offensive in the Pacific is the opposite of what Roosevelt and others expected.

### Manchukuo Prime Minister Zhang Issues Statement

Xinjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army achieved a great victory in the waters east of Taiwan, Prime Minister Zhang issued a statement expressing Manchukuo's determination to complete the war. He said that the Japanese army and navy, who had been patiently waiting for an opportunity, counterattacked the enemy forces with swift force and achieved great victories. The Japanese General Headquarters has already announced this. The good strategy and brave battles of the Japanese army and navy will certainly be deeply appreciated by the nations of East Asia. However, the decisive battle begins today. Starting with this victory, the counterattack is an excellent opportunity to prevent the enemy from having any opportunity to attack. Therefore, we must concentrate all the power of the nation on strengthening our war capabilities in order to thoroughly supply the front lines. Now, we are in the midst of a bountiful autumn and will begin "purchasing." Also, the production of coal, iron, and aircraft is being greatly increased through the efforts of production personnel. We are truly grateful for this.

### Japan Is Making Continued Efforts Throughout The Country

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - Information Officer Yoko of the Japanese Cabinet Information Bureau, when meeting with the Chinese Journalists Corps stationed in Japan on the 18th, gave a special statement on the naval battle off Taiwan. The gist of his remarks was as follows: Roosevelt, in order to make the fourth election favorable, disregarded strategy and attacked Taiwan, attempting to show a force militarily, in order to promote national concern. As a result, the attempt failed and suffered a disastrous defeat. As a result, the main force of the 58th Mobile Task Force was almost wiped out by the Japanese army, resulting in a significant impact. On the contrary, the Japanese Navy, which had been enduring and self-respecting, had almost exhausted itself, and public opinion had already shown that the opportunity to seize the opportunity, launch a large-scale counter-offensive, and harvest unprecedented and glorious war results in the history of warfare, was extremely rare. The Japanese traditional naval spirit has been completely revealed in this naval battle. As a result of this war result, domestic morale has suddenly become clear. After Prime Minister Koiso of Japan came to power, the goal of clear and open-minded people's sentiment has been completely achieved in the military. However, the Japanese people all know that this war result is by no means the final victory, so the whole country, taking the last victory as a turning point, is making continued efforts to achieve the second and third victories.

### Enemy U.S. Mobile Task Force Attack On Taiwan Purpose

Japanese Naval Experts Disclose

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Ito Masanori, a well-known Japanese naval military expert, recently gave a statement on the strategic intentions of the US Fifth Eighth Mobile Task Force's air raid on Taiwan, as follows: The fact that the enemy's large-scale air raid on Taiwan this time was more than worth the loss has been recognized by the world. The purpose of the enemy's air raid on Taiwan was, first, to detect the strength of the Japanese army's

### Homeland Defense

The truth or falsity of money, secondly, in an attempt to destroy the aviation base facilities on Taiwan Island. In other words, the purpose of the enemy army is to detect the strength of the Japanese army and destroy the Japanese army's air power. The most important part of the enemy's naval strategy is to attempt to destroy the Japanese combined team in the south, which is exactly the same as the Japanese army's hope to destroy the US Navy. However, its current combat method is to induce the Japanese army to a sea battle hundreds of kilometers to thousands of kilometers away, at a time before and after the large-scale landing operations in the Philippines or the Ogasawara Islands. There is no doubt that one of the major obstacles to its combat is that Taiwan is the accumulation point of base air power. If the Japanese army ensures great combat power here, the enemy's southern operations will have to be vigilant. The power of Taiwan cannot be detected by spies. Only

### Absolute Strength

Can reveal its inside story, which is the point of operational value. Therefore, the attack on October 12 can be said to be a natural act. After the end of the first day, the attack was continued on the 13th. If they had retreated early, it would have been clever, but in the end they were too greedy and were severely hit by the Japanese army. The main force of the enemy's important mobile task force has suffered a fatal blow. The enemy knows that when the Japanese and US forces launch a naval battle in the south, the Japanese army will effectively use the base air force, so the enemy's second purpose had to launch this offensive. However, as a result, the loss of the Japanese army was completely different from what the enemy had expected. At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the sinking of the Prince of Wales by the Japanese army was of course also due to the base air power. Therefore, the US military of course planned to prevent

### Japanese Army Sinks

Its fleet aircraft carrier-centered air raid forces and bases. In the battle between the Air Force and the Air Force, even if the forces are not significantly different, the land side is absolutely advantageous to the sea. The advantage is that it is easy to make a surprise attack, and at the same time, it can exert the characteristics of maneuverability, that is, it is easy to get away after the air raid. If you want to attack two or three times, you will expose the weakness of the naval force. Moreover, the Japanese elite is secretly waiting for orders. Taiwan is the largest air base. Japan has already formed a base here and has also prepared a support system. In other words, if the enemy attacks Taiwan, the Japanese army will take a siege formation within a considerable period of time. Therefore, no matter which base the enemy attempts to air raid, it will suffer a major blow. This victory is believed to be

### This Great War

The victory, we must prepare considerable forces to wait for the enemy to replenish and then invade again. After this great victory, we must raise the fighting spirit of the generals and soldiers. At the same time, we must gather considerable forces, at the right time and place, to launch a great battle in one fell swoop. For this, we need an increase in the production of excellent aircraft and the cooperation of the army and navy commanders. That is, Japan must win tactically and strategically. Japan must always grasp the above conditions. In short, Japan must prepare to crush the enemy's repeated air raids at any time in the future, give them heavy blows on time, and advance the war based on this belief.

### Japanese Troops on Peleliu Island Launch Night Attack on Enemy Positions

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese base in the Central Pacific, the Japanese troops on Peleliu Island, since the 12th, have been increasingly invigorated by the great victory of the Japanese Navy on the sea off Taiwan. They still hold the central highlands, and every night they break into enemy positions and kill many enemy troops. Due to the continuous attacks of the Japanese troops, the first-line enemy soldiers are extremely exhausted and have to be replaced by reinforcements. The Japanese troops took the opportunity to attack. On the afternoon of the 16th, there was a small-scale battle on the side of Mount Suifu, and there was little change in other areas.

### Envoy Kusumoto's Speech

Beiping, 18th (Central News Agency) - The new Japanese envoy to Beiping, Lieutenant General Kusumoto Sanetaka, said in Xinjing a few days ago that he had worked in Shanghai before the China Incident, and then, as the head of the unit, he had fought in various parts of Central China. This is his first time being appointed to North China. North China, which is on the path of construction, has various important problems at present, whether in terms of security or economy. However, the most important thing is to win the war. All policies must be focused on this point, and we must not be bound by trivial matters. He is determined to work with China to fulfill the common goal and do his best. In addition, the envoy is scheduled to leave Manchuria around the 20th, return to his country, and then take office.

### US Air Force Stationed In Chongqing Suffers Major Blow

Raid on Guangzhou U.S. Aircraft Foiled

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The integrated main force of the enemy's Pacific Fleet has been annihilated since the 12th due to the Japanese army's continuous launch of naval and air operations. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing came to attack Taiwan in order to respond to the main force of the enemy's Pacific Fleet. The enemy's Pacific Fleet came to attack, which is noteworthy in this operation. About 1,100 enemy aircraft attacked various parts of Taiwan on the 12th, a small part of which were B24 aircraft of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. About 100 enemy aircraft attacked Taiwan on the 14th, which were B29 aircraft. However, the enemy B24 aircraft formation that attacked on the 12th only carried out unsystematic indiscriminate bombing with a small number of enemy aircraft. However, although 100 B29 aircraft came to attack on the 14th, they fled after a while and did not drop any bombs. From this point of view, the reason why the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing's attempt failed was mainly due to the continuous launch of great operations by the Japanese China Expeditionary Army, which caused the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing to retreat far into the interior. As for the enemy's B29 aircraft, which the enemy boasted to be a super-fortified fortress, its fragility was exposed after being hit by the Japanese new fighter jets during the second attack on Kyushu. That is, 100 enemy B29 aircraft that attacked Taiwan on the 14th finally collapsed and did not gain anything. The reason is probably because the enemy is afraid of Japanese new fighter jets. In short, in this naval and air battle, the enemy's US Air Force's cooperation with the enemy's mobile task force can be said to be a joint operation in operation, but it is meaningless, but only a completely unsystematic independent action with minimal effect has come, and by this time the enemy's mobile task force has been annihilated, and its ability to respond to the cooperative US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has also been lost here. A certain base on the front line of the Japanese army, 18th (Central News Agency) - On the afternoon of the 17th, around 3:15, the Chongqing US Air Force used a mixed formation of about 16 bombers B24 and B25, and about 20 fighters P51 and P40, totaling about 40 aircraft, to air raid the Guangzhou area. After being intercepted by Japanese air defense artillery and fighter groups, three P51s were shot down and one P55 was destroyed. The rest fled in panic along the West River towards Zhaoqing. The Japanese side suffered no losses in this battle. Guangzhou, 18th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese military base reported that three P40 aircraft of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing attacked Danzhu around 12:30 on the afternoon of the 17th and were intercepted by Japanese troops, and one of them was shot down.

### Recent War Results of Japanese Army in Guangzhou

A certain base of the Japanese Army in mainland China, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Army's interception of incoming enemy reinforcements in southern China has recently resulted in even greater war results. It is estimated that in the air battle over Guangzhou on the afternoon of the 15th, nine enemy fighter-bombers were destroyed, and four Japanese aircraft did not return, but the pilots of two of them survived. In addition to the above-mentioned war results, it is said that one P51 aircraft was also shot down. Also, on the 16th, when enemy aircraft attacked Gaotuan, two B24 aircraft were shot down (one of which was not confirmed), and several other enemy aircraft were destroyed.

### Enemy-US Fuzhou Plot Fails

Mainland Base, 18th (Central News Agency) - The rumor of enemy-US unrest in the Fuzhou area once became popular in the past. After the Japanese army occupied Fuzhou, it was judged that the US military intended to set up a submarine base in that area, and began to send about 50 surveying technicians to the Fuzhou area to conduct investigations. Most of the surveying and investigation documents have been discovered and confiscated by the Japanese army. In addition, wireless radios and letters used by British and Americans to collect information with Fuzhou as a base were also found, which further proves the correctness of the incident.

### US Third Fleet Composition Personnel

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - Washington Electric, the U.S. Navy Department announced on the 17th that the composition personnel of the Halsey Third Fleet headquarters that was defeated in the Taiwan Sea were as follows: Commander-in-Chief Admiral Halsey, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General Lee, Commander-in-Chief of the 58th Mobile Task Force Lieutenant General Raiska, Commander-in-Chief of Aircraft Carriers Lieutenant General Markin, Battle Force Commander Major General Sherman.

### Aircraft Carrier Current Situation

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - At the time of the start of the war, the current situation of American aircraft carriers was that the US Navy had two ships of the Saratoga class of 33,000 tons, three ships of the Enderbolais class of 19,900 tons, seven ships of the Royal class of 14,500 tons, and seven ships of the Wasupu class of 14,200 tons.

Then there are the Shangleyla of 27,500 tons and the Pebton of 27,000 tons. In addition, there are 20 formal aircraft carriers being built according to the 1942 shipbuilding plan and three ultra-large aircraft carriers of the 45,000-ton class planned in 1943 that can take off and land four heavy bombers. When all of them are completed, there will be more than 40 formal aircraft carriers. Cruiser-modified aircraft carrier. In order to make up for the losses, 10 cruisers of the 10,000-ton class have been specially modified into aircraft carriers, each carrying 50 aircraft, with a speed of 33 knots. Specially made aircraft carriers are modified from high-speed ships. In order to escort the convoys traveling across the Atlantic, a large number of them are specially built. Recently, they have been dispatched with mobile units to the operating sea. They can carry 30 aircraft and their main task is to transport aircraft and guard against submarines. At present, the United States has about 50 to 60 such aircraft carriers.

Enemy Conspiracy Foiled

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency: A German foreign ministry spokesman stated that German political leaders were aware of the events brewing in Hungary and the interactions between Hungarian and Soviet personnel, but because Hungarian nationalists held key positions, Germany had no need to interfere. The spokesman also stated that there was no riot in Hungary, only a change in the national structure. Today, the political situation in Hungary can be described as absolutely stable, not only politically, but also militarily. Therefore, the German and Hungarian armies have no worries and can safely go to the front. When Hungarian Regent Horthy could no longer fulfill his national responsibilities, political power was transferred to younger people with greater abilities. The Hungarian coup that Churchill and Stalin had hoped for did not materialize, which cannot but disappoint them.

### New Hungarian Prime Minister's Letter to Soldiers

Hungarian Capital, 18th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency: The new Hungarian Prime Minister Szálasi issued a letter to the soldiers, discussing that selfish people in Hungary have formed a small group that only seeks private gain, regardless of harming the life of the country, and even Regent Horthy was blinded by them and corrupted. He then discussed the need to contribute to the war, saying that no matter who, they must do their best to participate in the war against the enemy. The army demands that the people of the country unite, and the people demand that the army be loyal and serve the country. In short, the freedom and independence of Hungary is our goal, and I firmly believe that we will advance with Germany and other Axis countries towards final victory.

### Stalin and Churchill Meet Again

Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to Moscow sources: Stalin and Churchill met again yesterday. On the same day, British Foreign Secretary Eden had a long conversation with Polish Prime Minister-in-Exile Mikolajczyk. This was Eden's seventh meeting with the Polish Prime Minister since arriving in the Soviet Union. British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kerr and Polish Foreign Minister Romer also participated.

### Britain and Soviet Union Divide Spheres of Influence

Geneva, 18th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency: British writer Wells commented on the Moscow talks in the Observer, saying that Britain and the Soviet Union seem to have agreed to divide Europe into two spheres of influence. One is Eastern Europe, which belongs to the Soviet sphere of influence, including Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and part of Yugoslavia. The second is the Western European group under British control, which includes all of Western Europe, the Mediterranean, Greece, and West Asia. The Polish issue does not seem to have been resolved, but it is not enough to hinder the relationship between the Western anti-Axis countries and the Soviet Union.

### Soviet Forces Launch Offensive on East Prussian Border

The Situation in the Baltic Region Changes

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency: After a bombardment, Soviet forces on the northern front of the Eastern Front launched an offensive along both sides of the Kaunas-Gumbinnen railway towards the East Prussian border, in order to relieve the Soviet forces on the northern flank and cut off the German forces there. The enemy's attack covers a width of 40 kilometers, but has not yet broken into German territory. Soviet forces in the Warsaw area are fewer, but the pressure in the Rozan area has not diminished, indicating that the enemy is determined to break into East Prussia. German forces in the Tvenna area continue to retreat. The front-line situation in the Baltic Sea region has changed due to the offensive of the Soviet forces in the Wilkowischen area.

### Situation in the Balkans

German forces in the southern Balkan region and the Aegean Sea are moving and concentrating. Soviet forces are trying to stop them, and fierce battles are taking place with the German rearguard. The tank battle in the Groswardein-Debrecen area continues unabated. This is a typical mobile war on the Hungarian plains, with both sides trying to break into each other's flanks. The Soviet attempt to break through to the north was blocked, so the center of the war has shifted south. Soviet tanks from the Tisza River area have also been transferred to Hungary as reinforcements, so the battle in the Tisza River area has become localized. The battles south of Belgrade and Niš are closely related to the aforementioned actions to prevent the concentration of German forces. In Eastern Beskids and Carpathian Rosnia, the Soviet offensive has slowed slightly. Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency: Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, has become completely calm. There are no traces of Soviet forces in the mountains south of the city.

### Serbian Government Moves Away from Belgrade

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency: A German foreign ministry spokesman said that after Soviet forces invaded the south of Belgrade, the Serbian government led by Prime Minister Nedić has moved away from the city. However, the spokesman did not reveal its destination.

### Visiting Mr. Wang Rujing, President of the United Reserve Bank

— Wu Gong

The first thing that strikes you when you come to North China is the United Reserve Bank notes used between Bengbu and Xuzhou. Why are two currencies used in one country? This is probably the question that every Chinese person asks when they come to the north! However, regardless, the United Reserve Bank has become the national bank of North China today, and it is undoubtedly a [bank of banks]. When it was first established, it was originally concurrently headed by Wang Kemin, Chairman of the Provisional Government's Administrative Committee. After the National Government returned to the capital and the Provisional Government dissolved, Wang retired, and Wang Rujing, who was then responsible for North China's finances, was appointed President. Later, when Mr. Wang Kemin made a comeback and became Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee, Wang Rujing remained as President of the United Reserve Bank. However, from that time on, Wang relinquished financial power and specialized in financial and economic matters, so he is now also serving as the Director-General of the Economic Affairs Department.

### A Magnificent Residence and an Aesthetic Owner

One autumn afternoon, I was scheduled to speak with President Wang at his residence at 4:30 PM. Although Wang has now relinquished the financial power of North China, he is still an important figure in the financial world here, so I had to talk to him. This president of the United Reserve Bank has a very high reputation in Beijing. Everyone knows that he is a wealthy man, and even when you mention that you are going to see President Wang in Beibingmasi Hutong, the rickshaw pullers will be in awe. From this, we can also see the power of money today! Wang's residence is in the north of Beijing, originally the residence of Xiao Zhenlu, a popular figure in the former Northwest Army. Of course, after Wang's renovation, it looks even more magnificent. When I entered Beibingmasi Hutong, I saw several policemen patrolling. It turned out that his official residence was at the head of the hutong. After being reported by the guard, I was led into a guest room, which was fully equipped with all the modern conveniences. The hot water radiators, which are not easy to see in Shanghai today, were still standing there. Although the outside of his residence has the original ancient charm of the old capital, the interior decoration is extremely magnificent, especially the harmony of the lines can be called unique. It is said that President Wang is originally a person who loves beauty, so even the outside of the house is painted in emerald green, which shows a clean flavor that is not easy to see in Beijing. After a short while, the President of the United Reserve Bank, known as the [God of Wealth of the North], came out. He gave me a very satisfactory impression. Whether from his demeanor or conversation, he proved to be a very good banker. It would be ideal to have a businessman lead the finances of the North. Unfortunately, Wang's ears are not very convenient, so when we started talking, he asked me to sit closer and often held his hand on one ear that could hear better.

### The Trend of Linking Production and Currency

We reviewed the detailed situation of the United Reserve Bank repeatedly for half an hour, and I was very satisfied. However, I am very sorry that it is not easy for the reporter to tell the readers everything. But one thing is worth mentioning, that is, today's United Reserve Bank seems to be gradually moving towards a situation of linking production and currency lending. If the policy of administrative purchase of materials implemented since last year can really achieve practical success, the character of currency lending based on production is not difficult to achieve. However, commodity prices in the North have been rising sharply recently, and there are different views on economic control, so it is still doubtful whether their efforts will succeed. At the same time, the management of food is under the jurisdiction of the Agricultural Affairs Department, so the Economic Affairs Department does not manage the entire controlled economy. There are not as many private banks in the North as there are in Shanghai, and it seems that the inspection of finance is stricter. Now they stipulate that private individuals opening banks must increase the number of deposits to one million or two million yuan, depending on the number of deposits. All private banks must report all deposits and loans to the United Reserve Bank, especially loans must be approved by the United Reserve Bank. The current policy of the United Reserve Bank is to move towards a close link between production and currency lending, so it particularly encourages loans to production enterprises. According to President Wang, the North China Industrial Bank, which was established at the end of last month, wants to start the construction of North China's light industry from this. Regarding this attempt to link production and currency lending, I think the central government can at least use it as a reference.

### The Most Meritorious Figure in the North China Financial World

Finally, I also asked about President Wang's past experience. Originally, Wang was from Jingde, Anhui, and grew up in Nanjing. At first, he graduated from the Nanjing Army Primary School, and later came to Beijing to study at the then Army Quartermaster School, and then went to Japan to graduate from the Tokyo Army Management School. According to him, he liked to study economics and finance from that time on, so after returning to China, he entered the banking industry. When he first entered the banking industry, Wang was only a bank clerk. When he was working at the Bank of China in Hankou, he had a very good relationship with Tang Shengzhi in 1927. Tang failed, and Wang went to Harbin in the northeast at that time, and served as the manager of the Bank of China in Harbin. Soon after, he was transferred to Fengtian. During his time at the Bank of China, he was known to Wang, the current chairman of North China, so he was invited to head the finances and prepare for the establishment of the China United Reserve Bank when the Provisional Government was established. Looking at it this way, although Wang is now the president of the United Reserve Bank, succeeding Chairman Wang, he is indeed the most meritorious figure in the North China financial world, and a new financial manager!

### Mayor Chen Orders the Materials Allocation Office to Distribute Rice as Scheduled; This Term's Registered Rice Will Be Available for Sale Within Days

Recently, the price of rice in the city has been rising daily, which has stimulated other prices to rise across the board. This not only severely threatens the livelihoods of ordinary people, but also has a huge impact on the stability of the rear economy and the supply of military needs during the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War. Mayor Chen is extremely concerned about this. In addition to ordering the city's Price Review Committee to convene an emergency meeting immediately to discuss effective measures, he also ordered the Materials Allocation Office to find ways to distribute rice on schedule in order to stabilize the people's livelihood and benefit military needs. The city's registered rice will continue to be processed by the City Materials Allocation Office. The designated rice retail outlets throughout the city have been processing rice sales since the 16th, and will be widely available for sale within days with the 23rd Comprehensive Joint Ticket, with each person still receiving two shi sheng.

### Decision on the Transportation of Vietnamese Rice Submitted to the Executive Yuan

The City Chamber of Commerce decided at its first joint meeting of standing directors and supervisors to request that the Rice Control Association quickly assist in transporting Saigon rice from Annam using sailboats, following the example of transporting Taiwanese sugar, in order to alleviate the people's difficulties. The association submitted the case to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for verification and implementation by the Rice and Grain Control Association. Recently, a notice was received from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, according to the Rice Control Association's official letter No. 429, which stated: [This association's control work has always focused on domestic rice. Now, the City Chamber of Commerce suggests transporting Vietnamese rice to relieve people's food difficulties. However, since this matter involves the entire control policy, we have sent a letter to the Ministry of Commerce for submission to the Executive Yuan for approval. We will comply accordingly.]

### Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association Expands Membership

Fundraising to Purchase Coarse Grains for Affordable Retail Sales

The Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association, in order to promote its work, elected Li Sihao as Vice Chairman at the 13th Board of Directors meeting. The original Vice Chairman Lin Kanghou was changed to Secretary-General, and Xiang Kangyuan and Gu Nanqun were added as Deputy Secretaries-General. On the afternoon of the 17th, the 14th Board of Directors meeting was held, attended by Wen Lanting, Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Fei Yunqing, Chen Shaowei, Wang Boyuan, Xu Guanqun, Xiang Kangyuan, Gu Nanqun, Chen Binhe, etc., chaired by Chairman Wen Lanting. In order to strengthen its forces and strengthen its organization, the association decided to expand the number of members, soliciting new members, and raising funds of 5 million yuan to increase staff and improve work efficiency. The association also, in view of the panic over food in the city, intends to raise funds of 50 million yuan to purchase coarse grains from producing areas for affordable retail sales in order to relieve ordinary people. It was decided to publicly elect three directors, Xu Guanqun, Xiang Kangyuan, and Gu Nanqun, to plan fundraising methods. The association also plans to contact the Prevention Division of the City Police Bureau to accept citizens' complaints and mediate disputes on their behalf. It is also heard that the association will hold a general membership meeting in the near future.

### Police Bureau Emphasizes Bicycle Thieves

Recently, there has been a trend of bicycle thefts in the city. Each police branch reports an average of at least a dozen bicycle theft cases every day, which is truly alarming. The thieves' skills are very skillful. Each thief must carry a sharp chisel. Although the owner uses two iron chains to lock the bicycle, it is ineffective. The thief can still cut the chain. The authorities are currently preparing countermeasures and conducting secret investigations. After stealing the bicycles, these thieves will scrape off the hard prints on the bicycles, disassemble them into several parts, secretly transport the parts to the secondhand dealers west of the Shanghai-West Railway, and then resell them several times, transport them to other ports, combine the parts into a complete bicycle, and sell them repeatedly.

### Director Chen Convenes a Police Talk Yesterday

Then, the current police administration issues and countermeasures were discussed thoroughly until about 12:00 noon.

### Factory Electricity Consumption Investigation Team Does Not Interfere in External Affairs

The City Economic Bureau, together with the Central China Water and Electricity Company and the City Public Works Bureau, organized a factory production electricity consumption investigation team, divided into three groups, each with three members. They began their investigation on the 11th of this month to investigate the production volume and electricity consumption of various factories, report the facts to the competent authorities, and await their disposition. This is the mission entrusted to the investigators. As for matters outside the scope of the investigation, it is not appropriate for the members of the groups to interfere, and the factories should not have any contact with them. This matter concerns the vital interests of manufacturers, and it is hoped that all manufacturers in the city will pay attention.

### Minister Idebuchi Discusses the Inevitable Victory of East Asia; Nimitz's Attempt to Be Completely Crushed

Minister Idebuchi of the Press Department of the Allied Japan Shanghai Army Department met with Chinese news reporters in the city at 3:00 PM yesterday (18th) to discuss the great victory in the Taiwan East Sea on the Pacific Front and the advancement of the war on the Chinese mainland, and made the following remarks:

### Torpedo Squadron Participates in Decisive Battle

In the unprecedented victory of the Japanese army in the eastern waters of Taiwan and the eastern waters of the Philippines, the enemy's main Pacific Fifth-Eighth Mobile Force was destroyed. The Japanese General Headquarters has successively released six war reports since the 13th of this month, reporting a total of 42 enemy aircraft carriers and battleships sunk and destroyed. The enemy's main force is on the verge of complete annihilation. Therefore, in the Pacific operations from now on, the enemy has suffered a serious blow. According to the announcement by the General Headquarters, the enemy has been defeated and is fleeing. Therefore, the battle there is still ongoing. Moreover, the enemy attempted to rescue the defeated troops and even mobilized the so-called separate force to cover their retreat. The Japanese army will establish even greater war results in the future. This battle result is unprecedented since Pearl Harbor. The battle in the Taiwan East Sea and the Philippine East Sea also involved the participation of the Japanese Army Torpedo Squadron in the decisive battle. This was the first time on this battlefield. They received relatively short training. Today, with the cooperation of both the army and the navy, they have achieved world-shaking war results, which is deeply noteworthy. On the 16th of this month, Prime Minister Koiso specifically made a statement on the facts of the Torpedo Squadron, saying that it is worthy of a big book in the history of the Greater East Asia War, and he is confident that the Army Torpedo Squadron will make even greater contributions in future operations.

### Japanese Army Advances Rapidly on Mainland Front

Looking at the current situation on the mainland front, the elite troops of the Japanese army stationed in China, after sweeping through the Hunan-Henan battlefields, are now transferring to Guangxi Province, traversing various battlefields, and attacking Guilin and Liuzhou, two major thoroughfares, from two directions. Guilin and Liuzhou are the largest key points in southwestern China and one of the advanced bases of the US Air Force in Chongqing. This attack has major implications militarily. The Japanese army is now not far from Guilin and Liuzhou. Since the recent close cooperation between the Japanese army and navy, after occupying Fuzhou, they have gradually advanced, expanded the results of the war, and crushed the plans of the enemy US Commander-in-Chief Nimitz. Nimitz's claim was to covet the coastal areas of Fujian Province, claiming that landing on the Chinese mainland must first be landed on the coast of Fujian. Therefore, in order to defeat the enemy US plans, the Japanese army took preemptive action and occupied the coastal areas of Fuzhou in advance, so the enemy US plans have been completely crushed. As the advancement of the mainland front has been so rapid, the [resistance method] of Chongqing has changed accordingly. At the last session of the National Political Council held in Chongqing, there were arguments for democratization and the second East Asian front, which were very fierce. This is because the Japanese army is rapidly advancing on the current mainland front, and Chongqing has enemies who are shifting their goals. Therefore, some people in Chongqing deeply believe that the mainland front is the decisive battlefield of the Greater East Asia War.

### Laying the Foundation for Inevitable Victory in East Asia

If the Chongqing side admits that it cannot defeat the Japanese army on the mainland, the prospect of striving for victory will be arduous. Thus, the British and American sides are taking this opportunity to make demands, exposing the ambition of unifying the Chongqing side internally, and urging the Chongqing regime to make meaningless sacrifices and wage meaningless warfare against Japan. Under these circumstances, the Chongqing side will inevitably exert pressure on Britain and America, especially on the United States, demanding strengthened assistance. Therefore, the United States does not hesitate to launch a landing operation on the Chinese coast. At a time when the Japanese army has achieved a great victory on the sea east of Taiwan, the Japanese army should take advantage of this frequent news of victory and shift its offensive, launching a more significant blow against the Chongqing army. The great victory in Taiwan and the advance on mainland China indeed have profound and far-reaching implications. However, the so-called East Asian Second Front is very fragile, and the Chongqing army could collapse without a major battle. Now, the enemy's landing operation in the Kochi area clearly shows no hope. On the other hand, the dictatorial Chiang regime is facing unfavorable circumstances under the demand for democratization from various parties in Chongqing, and is in a state of collapse, its future precarious. In particular, the internal and external situation surrounding the Chongqing regime is extremely profound. Roosevelt, in order to run for the next presidential election and conceal the inside story of defeats, does not hesitate to use the navy in this cooperation. The unprecedented victory east of Taiwan has laid the foundation for inevitable victory in the future. In terms of defending East Asia, it has built a copper wall and iron barrier. If the enemy makes a foolish move to attempt a resurgence, the Japanese army will certainly launch a brave and fierce attack, so there is no doubt that the enemy will fail. We are now observing the coordination and progress of victory on the Chinese mainland front and the Pacific front, and deeply note the significance of the impact on the Chongqing side [resisting Japan].

### Security Command Arrests Large Numbers of Unlawful Soldiers, Shops Harassed Can Report for Investigation

It has been found that in the central area of this city, major hotels, restaurants, wine shops, and entertainment venues have recently been frequented by unscrupulous soldiers and stragglers who are using pretexts to cause disturbances and provoke quarrels, even gathering large groups to intimidate, extort, and blackmail with weapons. These acts are blatant and unbridled, causing unspeakable suffering to the victimized merchants and residents. The detective team of the city's Security Command learned of this matter and immediately dispatched personnel to search and arrest suspects in various locations on the Double Ten Festival. They have successively detained seventeen individuals claiming to be officers and soldiers of the Suppression of Bandits Army of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui: Zhang Zhanyuan, Zhang Hengyi, Geng Yitang, Mao Tiemei, Wang Yang, Shen Yi, Wang Zhonglie, Su Xingbei, Xu Yinshun, Lü Jingfang, Lin Jinf, Sun Zhengfu, Tang Maotou, Zhou Guoliang, Tang Xiangchun, Wang Shoulun, and Jin Wenbiao. They confiscated one Mauser pistol, six rounds of ammunition, and one Italian-made pistol (5966), four rounds of ammunition, which have been submitted to the Legal Department of the Command for interrogation.

Personnel will be dispatched immediately to arrest and investigate. Please note this information to all sectors.

### Shanghai West Fire Refugees Petition the Authorities

In the afternoon of the 12th of this month, a fire broke out at the Jin Situ Temple in Tangjiaqiao, Shanghai West, spreading to the Dadeliyigongli city-owned houses, and also burning down cloth factories such as Xieda Xinshengji, etc. The victims include 56 households of residents in Dadelili and 17 households of old and young residents in Yigongli, who are without clothing or food, and their situation is quite miserable. The victims believe that the cause of the fire was due to the carelessness of the newly installed chimney of the adjacent China Condensed Milk Factory. They have hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the court according to law. Recently, victim representatives Zhao Bingnan, Yuan Zizuo, Cheng Suzhen, and more than 50 others submitted a petition to the municipal government, which was received by Zhang Zhuofang, the director of the fourth section, who promised to investigate thoroughly. At 11:00 a.m. yesterday, they went to the Social Welfare Bureau again to appeal for relief, where they were received by Chief Secretary Hu Shouqi, who inquired about the details of the fire. He then gave instructions on how to handle the aftermath and promised to submit the matter to the municipal government for relief.

Tongren took a 10-0 lead at the beginning, and also led by one point with a score of 31 to 30 in the first half. In the second half, Lu Dazhen was fouled out, and the overall situation deteriorated.

### Germany Under Decisive Battle Posture

What exactly is Germany like at this critical juncture, facing a life-or-death situation? During the First World War, although the front lines were strong, defeat was caused by the division in the rear. The German Jewish financial tycoons who manipulated the state apparatus earned war profits and then stabbed the German people in the back with seven daggers. This time, before launching the war, Germany completely eliminated dissidents at home, so the crisis of division that the enemy had longed for all along failed to materialize even once. The government constantly promotes the idea that "the rear should not hinder the front," so the people are all willing to abide by the law. Like Japan, under the whole sky, there are families whose fathers, brothers, or sons have died in battle. Wives and daughters, with one hand grasping the terrible news of the death of their loved ones and the other hand wiping away tears, go to the factories. The old men working in the offices feel no less than the soldiers on the front lines. Everyone's heart only has one idea that they cannot lose again, and this idea is eliminating all difficulties and forming a strong pillar, supporting the morale of the rear. This is the power that enables 12 million foreign workers to work in a country without young men. At the same time, it is also the driving force for picking out corrupt elements from the spiral disc of national activities.

### Enemy Propaganda Fails

At first, the enemy's propaganda offensive invariably focused on sowing discord between the Party and the people and between the Party and the army, but since last year, they have abandoned this propaganda policy and started to tell the truth by threatening to crush the Nazi Party and the entire people regardless of any differences. This is due to encountering the barrier of the German people's will to fight. We have always thought that Germany's fate will definitely be determined by foreign battles, but this has not been the case. Even if Eisenhower uses leaflets or radio to instruct the attitude of the residents of the Rhine and Ruhr areas, even with threats and inducements, it doesn't seem to work. In the final analysis, it is still necessary to directly attack Berlin with force. The enemy who decided this is planning to slowly approach. As a result of the Second Quebec Conference and the intentions of the Soviet Union, the principles for resolving the German issue may be announced soon, but in any case, the hostility and resistance shown by the residents of the Rhine area make the enemy feel more and more intense as they go deeper. The resilience created by five years of war training and bombing is gradually showing itself outwardly, but the emotions of "cannot lose" and "cannot die" are stronger than the emotions of "must win." The German people have this kind of emotion in their determination to carry out a scorched earth tactic.

### Domestic Front Unified

The assassination attempt on Hitler on July 20 has been cleared of a small number of rebels, and the domestic front is unified. The fighting spirit of the soldiers at the front has never waned. The belief in Hitler remains unwavering. Even from the recent fact that the garrisons of Cherbourg, Saint-Malo, and Brest insisted on fighting until the last bullet, sending telegrams of respect to Hitler, it can be seen that the soldiers support Hitler. In particular, the White Tiger team, composed of 17-year-old boys, established immortal feats on the Normandy front, and this time, on the German-Dutch border, they bravely fought with the enemy's airborne troops.

### Psychology of Shared Hatred Against the Enemy

Looking at the National Guard Corps mobilized with all their strength, in terms of the psychology of shared hatred against the enemy, there have been great changes in the past year. When the war was launched, the German people were unwilling to consider the English and Americans as enemies because they had close ties in culture, politics, and economics. The opposite was true for the Soviet Union. On the one hand, the Soviet Union has always adopted a policy of isolation, not interacting with the outside world. On the other hand, the Nazi Party's anti-communist ideology and anti-communist policies instilled anti-Soviet ideas in the German people, such as "[Russia is an oriental beast]" and "[Siberia is a living hell]". Therefore, in the hearts of the people, the wildfire of the idea that "[the Soviet Union is a public enemy of the people]" is burning fiercely. Therefore, the Soviet army's victorious advance has generated a kind of power from the extreme hatred psychology of Germany, vowing to block the Soviet Red Army to the death. But Germany's feelings towards Britain and the United States have also become worse recently. This is due to the inhumane air raids by Britain and the United States. If the air raids target factories, this is understandable because they are military facilities, but the air raids have become more and more intense, and they have targeted civilian houses, hospitals, schools, monuments, and cultural institutions. Even recently, they have used machine guns to strafe churches and farmers cultivating in the fields. Therefore, the German people are furious at this inhumane behavior. The enemy thought that air raids could destroy the German people's will to fight, but the opposite is true. Instead, they have created an unprecedented anti-British and American sentiment among the German people. Today, the German people not only hate the Bolsheviks of the East, but also want to tear the flesh and eat the skin of the democratic countries of the West, Britain and the United States. Of course, those who hinder Hitler's dream of a Greater Third Reich are the enemies of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. This belief has gradually become the belief of every German through painful reality. Therefore, the young Germans are more and more indignant in order to restore the unparalleled Greater Third Reich. Rosenberg recently said: [Young people understand German history and tradition through the world view of National Socialism, and at the same time, they realize that they are fighting for the happiness of the next generation of German people. Their fighting spirit is the fateful fighting spirit that understands the need to preserve history, tradition, and land, and remains unwavering.] We also often encounter their superhumanly strong beliefs, which amaze people. The whole of Germany is now standing on the last line of defense that cannot be retreated from. This war is a tragedy that no German people ever wanted. Perhaps the result will be the same as in the First World War, but in terms of the clear-mindedness of the German people, it is absolutely different from the First World War. The German Third Reich refers to the Nazi revival of Germany. The Nazis referred to the Holy Roman Empire built by Emperor Otto the Great in the tenth century as the First Reich, called the Germany of the Bismarck era later on as the Second Reich, and now they want to eliminate the shortcomings of the First and Second Reichs and build a purely German nation as the highest ideal. This is Hitler's Third Reich. (Translated by An from the September 27th Mainichi Shimbun)

### Yongnian Tai Chi Class Invites Director Peng for Lecture

The Yongnian Tai Chi class organized by this office has had more than 100 young people from all walks of life participating in practice since its opening. At 7:00 a.m. the previous morning, they gathered at the empty space of the Chinese Education Morality Society on Nantong Road and invited Peng Shou, Director of the Central National Arts Center, to give a lecture. He briefly stated that in the past, China placed too much emphasis on literature and neglected martial arts, which resulted in unhealthy physiques and a weakening national strength. Now, this kind of corrupt idea should be broken as soon as possible. Martial artists must study literature, and literary people should also practice martial arts. The combination of literary and martial arts can make them healthy citizens. This newspaper's promotion of national martial arts is of profound significance, and it is especially admirable that it is free of charge to popularize it. I hope that everyone will uphold the spirit of the Three Educations and move forward bravely, in order to make the country strong and the people rich, and not disappoint the efforts of this newspaper. I am fortunate. In addition, Mr. Wei Yanfang was invited to give a lecture. He briefly said that I am a layman to Tai Chi, but I deeply know the mystery of Tai Chi, which is truly unbelievable. Many friends had weak constitutions, yellow skin and thin faces, but after practicing Tai Chi, they all changed from weak to strong, which shows that the effect of Tai Chi cannot be ignored. It is especially rare that Mr. Chuan Zhongwen is serving as a volunteer professor this time. I hope that you will follow Mr. Chuan's careful practice, so as not to disappoint the enthusiastic promotion of the Shen Bao, the Chinese Education Morality Society, and Mr. Chuan. ○ English Pronunciation Class: Started on October 15, using the phonetics training professor James of London University's record training, graduated in four weeks, class every Thursday afternoon, tuition 400 yuan.

### Recent Youths (5)

The spring of 1942 came running in like a shower. At the end of March, the cherry blossoms in the courtyard of the Ministry of the Navy were in full bloom. One morning, Longfu felt very refreshed. As he walked through the flower business, he suddenly saw Lieutenant Colonel Feitian. [Hey, the joint naval burial date for the martyrs has been decided. The memorial service will be held on April 8 at Hibiya Park. The funeral director is the Minister of the Navy. This is an unprecedented grand event since Lieutenant Colonel Guangbin.] Lieutenant Colonel Feitian regarded it as his own business, and his face was beaming with joy. [Oh, that's really glorious!] Longfu's face was also as bright and cheerful as the cherry blossoms in full bloom. [Since you are a close friend of Major Gu, you can shamelessly list yourself in the family seat of Major Gu.] [Yes, thank you!] Longfu agreed in writing. (It's really a grand event to hold a naval burial in Hibiya!) Longfu's heart was jumping as he thought of the solemnity of the ceremony. It is truly a great honor for a real person to receive such a price. At the same time, I also thought of the real person's promotion by two ranks. At the same time, the real person's apple face appeared on Longfu's heart plate, waving his hand and saying: [Oh, this is really torturing me, I really can't afford it.] (Yes, real people don't like others to flatter him.) However, I really hope that these bright cherry blossoms will continue to bloom until the day of the naval burial. The cherry blossom, which is both the national flower of Japan and the naval flower, should continue to bloom to commemorate the nine martyrs. But on April 1, the flowers began to fall like snow. Longfu was very sad. Looking at the scattered flowers on the ground, when he thought of the words [scattered cherry blossoms] in the eulogy of the martyrs, he felt that his request was useless. On April 8, tender buds had already grown on the tips of the cherry trees, and the remaining flowers remained on the trees like white butterflies. On this morning, Longfu washed his body with cold water and put on the formal dress sent by his father. When the landlady opened the door when he put on the memorial meeting badge on his left arm, she said: [Muta Koujun, there are guests.] [Huh? It's you?] Longfu shouted loudly. His sister's face appeared in the corridor. She was standing there wearing a spring coat and carrying a briefcase. (152)

### Donating to the Old People's Home is a Human Obligation

Goal: 5,000,000 yuan Period: October 10th to November 10th Collection Place: Social Service Department of this newspaper Publication Date: Every Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday The nuns of the Shanghai Old People's Home, who are dedicated to serving the elderly, were deeply saddened when they talked about the issue of food and clothing. They said that although the current diet has reached the point of mixing miscellaneous grains, they can barely make ends meet, and they are worried that it will not be as bad as it is now. However, if prices continue to rise without end, and there is no source of daily expenses, at that time, they will inevitably be unable to continue to eat, and the pots and pans will be empty frequently, then hundreds of declining old people will not end up in the gutters, which is truly worrying. Confucius said: [Let the old be at peace, the friends be trusted, and the young be cherished.] Therefore, taking care of the old and cherishing the young are both obligations that human beings should fulfill, and we should give them deep sympathy. We respectfully ask people from all walks of life to have great compassion, provide convenience, donate generously, and contribute enthusiastically. The nuns will only pray day and night, so that families who accumulate good deeds will receive a hundred blessings from heaven.
