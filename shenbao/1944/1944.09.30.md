### Emphasize Reality

What is reality? It is [the actual state of affairs before one's eyes]. The evolution of reality inevitably has its objective factors. If one does not emphasize reality, if one does not emphasize the objective factors in the evolution of the state of affairs, then handling the state of affairs easily becomes fantasy. Fantasy is different from ideals. Ideals have their objective theories. However, ideals that disregard reality, ideals that do not approach reality, are already not easy to realize. How much more so fantasy that neither considers reality nor has a theoretical basis?

The policies of the government, especially the decisions of government orders, if they cannot take into account reality, do not value the demands of the people, and do not value the sufferings of the people, then they become empty talk, which is equivalent to fantasy. It can even harm the people in the opposite way. Therefore, if the government decides on policies and orders without going through deliberation and research by representative bodies, it is not easy to obtain the widespread understanding and support of the people, forming a phenomenon where the government is for the government, and the people are for the people. Let's take an example.

In the political aspect, improving administrative efficiency and establishing a clean government are the responsibilities of the government anytime, anywhere. However, if the treatment of civil servants is not taken into account, then all plans to improve administrative efficiency and establish a clean government are empty talk. Secondly, establishing security is even more necessary during wartime. However, if the treatment of the military and police is not taken into account and they cannot be made to work for their duties with peace of mind, then the expectation of establishing security is not easy to achieve in practice. If local security cannot be established and administrative efficiency cannot be improved, local politics cannot get on track, and central politics will have no power. If central politics has no power, local politics will of course be unable to advance. Therefore, the fact that the current salaries of civil servants and military and police cannot maintain their livelihoods is reality. If this reality is not valued, even if there are various handling methods, the result is inevitably fantasy.

In the economic aspect, increasing production has become a unanimous demand without question. However, if realistic problems that hinder increased production, and even lead to reduced production, are not resolved first, simply putting forward attractive slogans will ultimately not help the facts. What are the realistic problems? Such as insufficient funds, insufficient raw materials, inconvenient transportation, too much red tape, etc. Secondly, stabilizing people's livelihoods is even more a matter of course. However, the biggest problem in people's livelihoods, the price of goods, has always been high, especially the price of rice, which is the most important, has recently been skyrocketing. The insufficient allocation of household rice is already one factor in the high prices on the black market, and the recent ban by the Rice Control Committee on the transportation of rice over eight kilograms is an even greater factor stimulating rice prices. Therefore, within three to five days of the announcement of the ban on transportation, the black market price of rice rose by another 30%. Only measures that stimulate the rise in rice prices can be announced, but measures that suppress the decline in rice prices cannot be announced. For example, we have repeatedly pointed out in the past that such methods that disregard reality should be decided solemnly. All handling that does not value reality and only relies on subjective arbitrary decisions will ultimately become fantasy. After it becomes fantasy, the authorities are of course unaware and insensitive, while the general public cries out in misery. How can one not be careful?

We have repeatedly advocated promoting Shanghai as a model political area. If we do not emphasize reality and start with establishing security and improving people's livelihoods, then it will also become fantasy. When we say emphasize reality, of course we do not mean excessively accommodating reality. If we say that reality is an illegal act, of course we cannot recognize the illegal act because it is reality. However, we must know the reality behind the formation of illegal acts, and then correct them in order to be truly effective.

### Account of the Fierce Battle of the Japanese Army in the Longling Area of Yunnan Province

Yunnan Front, 29th (Central News Agency) – The main points of the fierce battle of the Japanese garrison in the Longling area under the heavy encirclement of the Chongqing army for more than 60 days are as follows: When the 6th Division of the 11th Group Army of Chongqing, equipped with American weapons, came to attack Longling in late May, the Chongqing army planned to capture Longling City in one fell swoop. Therefore, on July 14, it sent 60,000 troops to occupy Dongshan, north of Longling. Subsequently, artillery fire was gradually increased. At the same time, with Dongshan as the center, Longling was surrounded. As a result, the surrounding positions of Longling gradually fell into its hands. Finally, direct assault began. The transportation team and scattered soldiers of the Japanese army position in western Longling were completely destroyed. The Japanese soldiers had to expose their entire bodies to fight fiercely. Because the Chongqing army had too many troops, the Japanese defenders had no choice but to reorganize their battle lines and gather about 200 remaining soldiers to resist with all their might. On August 24, the Japanese army in Longling City was almost unable to move during the day under the heavy encirclement of the Chongqing army. Because the Chongqing army's sniping and bombing were particularly fierce, the Japanese army could only eat once every two or three days. Later, because the food supply was cut off, they had to fill their stomachs with wild grass. The houses in the city were either bombed or destroyed, and the flame throwers were burned. The seriously wounded Japanese soldiers also rose up to fight in this predicament, either transforming artillery shells into hand grenades or digging deep trenches to replace houses. Their miserable plight was almost indescribable. However, although the Chongqing army suffered heavy casualties, it was still continuously adding new troops. In addition, the Chongqing army's artillery fire became more intense, so the Japanese army's casualties in the city gradually increased. A certain garrison commander also decided to burn important documents and equipment. On the same day, a quick report was received that Japanese scouts had appeared far outside the city. At that time, the morale of the Japanese defenders was greatly boosted. Early on August 28, the reinforcement team of Miyazono broke into the city, and the Japanese defenders of Longling were able to rest.

### Japanese Army Occupies Baoqing City in Central China, Takes Danzhu Airfield in South China

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Headquarters announced at 4:00 p.m. on the 29th: ○ Japanese troops in central China, after occupying Quanxian and Daoxian, continue their advance. At the same time, they launched an attack on Baoqing, an important stronghold of the remaining Chongqing army in Hunan, at dawn on September 27 and completely occupied it that evening. ○ Japanese troops in South China, after occupying Rongxian and Wuzhou, continue their advance. On the evening of September 28, they occupied the Danzhu airfield, a base of the Chongqing-American air force.

Japanese Army Front Line, 29th (Central News Agency) – On the 27th, after the Japanese army launched a general offensive against Baoqing, which was guarded by the 100th Army of the Chongqing army, it eliminated the Chongqing army's side defense heavy weapons and mortar positions, and captured the south wall of the city at 8:00 a.m. The Japanese army, which was attacking fiercely from the east, also captured the city at noon, taking the main position of Baoqing into their hands and cutting off the lifeline of the 57th Division, which was defending Baoqing City. After that, the Japanese troops rushed into the city and engaged in a fierce street battle. At 2:00 p.m., Baoqing City was completely occupied, and the city was cleared at 5:00 p.m.

Japanese Army Front Base, 29th (Central News Agency) – A unit of the Japanese army that went north from Rongxian crossed the West River near Doutouxu (25 kilometers northwest of Danzhu) and completely occupied Pingnan, a strategic point on the opposite bank of the West River, at 7:30 a.m. on the 28th.

### Japanese Aircraft Bomb Chengdu Airfield

Japanese Army Base in China Front Line, 29th (Central News Agency) On the night of the 26th, a Japanese bomber squadron took advantage of the moonlight to launch a surprise attack on the Chengdu airfield in Sichuan Province. They dropped bombs on the runway and surrounding areas, destroying seven B29 aircraft of the Chongqing-American Air Force parked on the ground and causing three explosions at the airfield facilities. As a result, the base of the Chongqing-American Air Force B29 aircraft has been completely destroyed. That night, the Japanese squadron further raided Chengdu. One of the Chongqing fighter aircraft took off to intercept after learning of the Japanese aircraft's arrival, but still failed to prevent the Japanese squadron from attacking Chengdu. However, when the Japanese squadron arrived in Chengdu, the weather gradually deteriorated. Suddenly, it rained heavily in the sky over Chengdu, making the view very blurry. One Japanese command aircraft immediately attacked the Chongqing airfield in the heavy rain. At that time, the heavy rain suddenly stopped over the Chongqing airfield, and the bright moon illuminated the north-south runway and its surrounding large guide roads, making them shine brightly. However, the Chongqing anti-aircraft artillery fire did not show any activity. This situation is truly a miracle. After the Japanese aircraft dropped bombs on the northeast side of the runway, the second batch of Japanese aircraft dropped huge bombs on the southwest and west sides of the airfield, causing red and black flames to erupt at two eastern guide road facilities and two western guide road facilities, which are believed to have been caused by the destruction of aircraft by bombing. At that time, the fourth and fifth batches of Japanese aircraft directly aimed at the flames of the airfield and continued to advance east along the runway. After a while, at a height of 500 meters under the wings, they found large four-engine aircraft and B29 aircraft lined up in the shelters of the eastern guide road. After the Japanese aircraft dropped bombs on them, they quickly ascended. At that time, two Chongqing airfield facilities had already caught fire, and three other facilities were rising with smoke from the explosions. Other Japanese aircraft also successively descended rapidly to bomb. After the Japanese bomber squadron successfully bombed Chengdu, they all leisurely flew back to their original defenses.

### Ten Enemy Aircraft Shot Down Over Wuzhou

Central News Agency dispatch from a Japanese base, 29th: Chungking-U.S. air forces, feeling the threat of the Japanese military, in order to implement a counteroffensive and reverse the declining situation, specially used a joint formation of twenty B24-type aircraft and more than thirty P51-type fighter-bombers on the 28th to launch a large-scale attack on the Japanese front lines in the South China area, bombing areas near Sanshui (40 kilometers west of Guangzhou). The Japanese fighter squadrons immediately engaged them, and by a little after 2:00 PM, they had shot down five P51-type aircraft and one B24-type aircraft near Wuzhou. The total result was the shooting down or destruction of ten enemy aircraft, and the remaining enemy aircraft fled in disarray. In this battle, one Japanese aircraft also gloriously self-detonated.

### Japanese Aircraft Attack Liuzhou Airfield

Central News Agency dispatch from the Japanese front lines, 29th: Japanese bomber squadrons carried out a night air raid on Liuzhou airfield on the 28th, braving intense anti-aircraft fire from the ground to launch a fierce attack, destroying two enemy large aircraft and three small aircraft, as well as damaging another small aircraft, completely destroying its taxiway. The entire squadron then safely returned to base. Central News Agency dispatch from a certain Japanese base, 29th: Japanese bomber squadrons launched a surprise attack on Liuzhou airfield on the night of the 27th, bombing Chungking-U.S. aircraft parked on the field. The results of the battle were as follows: nine small aircraft were bombed, and one large aircraft and four small aircraft were destroyed, totaling fourteen aircraft. All Japanese aircraft returned safely. Central News Agency dispatch from a certain Japanese base, 29th: Japanese dive bomber squadrons have been dispatched continuously in recent days to launch surprise attacks on the Chungking-U.S. Air Force's front-line base groups in Jiangxi Province, as well as the northeastern Guangxi region, a crucial communication point for Liuzhou, cutting off the Chungking military's retreat routes on the eastern Chinese coastal area. On the 26th, a unit of Japanese dive bomber squadrons braved the rain to launch a surprise attack on Hexian, about 100 li north of Wuzhou, shattering a warehouse. On the morning of the 28th, they attacked the Babu goods accumulation point, 20 kilometers west of Jiaxian, hitting it with bombs and causing a fire. This area is the only rear communication and supply route for the Suichuan-Ganzhou base groups. Due to the fierce bombing by the Japanese military, the enemy's retreat route is, in fact, under threat.

### Western Front War Enters Stalemate; German Border Defenses Show Their Power

Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 28th: The German military finally achieved a decisive victory in the fierce fighting in the northern part of the Western Front. The British First Airborne Division was completely annihilated on the 26th, and the anti-Axis forces' attempt to break through the Siegfried Line from the Netherlands and continue into the Ruhr industrial area was completely crushed. The German military continues to exert its maximum power in the border defense war in western Germany. Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 29th: The situation on the Western Front has now reached a slight stalemate. Fierce fighting continues in the areas of the Luxembourg border, Nancy in eastern France, and Luneville. Currently, more than 2.5 million troops from both sides are concentrated along the entire line from the Netherlands in the north to northern France and the Swiss border, and the overall situation is likely to change greatly. Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 29th: German News Agency: On Wednesday, the scale of the fighting between southern Holland and the Bougen-gate was smaller than in the previous few days. The American command is making every effort to send reinforcements to the front line and strengthen its extended supply lines. The focus of the American offensive is roughly Aachen-anti-Metz, where powerful mechanized and tank units of the enemy have been concentrated. The American command has apparently abandoned its attempt to open the Bougen-gate from the north.

### Anti-Axis Forces in Northern Italy Adopt Pincer Offensive

Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 29th: DNB News Agency: The focus of the anti-Axis forces' offensive on the Italian front is in the areas of Rimini, Sant'Arcangelo, and Firenzuola. The right wing of the British Eighth Army is attempting to advance northwest through the narrow strip of land between the Apennine Mountains and Lake Massaciuccoli. The left wing of the British Eighth Army and the right wing of the American Fifth Army are jointly advancing northeast, attempting to join forces in the Imola-Faenza area. Under favorable circumstances, the anti-Axis forces are adopting a pincer offensive, which may encircle the left wing of General Kesselring's troops. In order to avoid encirclement, the German military must retreat from the isthmus of mountainous and lagoon areas to the Bologna-Argenta line. However, although the anti-Axis forces have enormous troop strength and ample war equipment, they can only make the German military retreat gradually. The anti-Axis forces have only achieved local victories in places such as the Futa Pass and the vicinity of Monte Beni.

### Focus of Eastern Front War Shifts to Hungarian-Romanian Border; German Troops Continue Withdrawal in the North

Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 29th: DNB News Agency: The resistance of the German military on the Eastern Front has strengthened, and the Soviet authorities' planned attack on Riga and the coastal area, as well as the encirclement of the German forces on the Northern Front, has not been realized. A large number of Soviet troops are concentrated there, along with 1,000 tanks. The extrication movement of the German military in the Baltic region is continuing under the cover of rear guard troops, and the Soviet military is closely pursuing them. The Soviet military is also intensifying its attacks on East Prussia, but without any success to speak of. The situation in the central sector is slightly relaxed. The claim by Polish rebel leader Bor that he has controlled all the suburbs of Warsaw does not correspond to the facts, because the troops in the southern suburb of Norgatov have already surrendered. After losing twenty infantry divisions and four tank regiments, the Soviet military has not yet transferred reserves to replenish them. It is expected that the Soviet military will transfer troops from the interior or other battlefields to invade Slovakia, in order to carry out a pincer movement against Hungary. The Soviet military is now shifting the focus of its war to the Hungarian-Romanian border.

### Churchill Reports on War Situation in the House of Commons

Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, 29th: German News Agency, according to London sources: Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech in the House of Commons yesterday, reviewing the current war situation, stating that the Normandy campaign was one of the greatest campaigns in the entire war. The number of British and American troops currently in France is between one million and three million. After 120 days of fighting, the ratio of British troops to American troops in France is four British divisions to five and a half American divisions. More than 90,000 British troops have been killed, wounded, or gone missing, while the American military's losses are more than 145,000.

### European War Likely to Be Prolonged

The Prime Minister continued, "We should not expect the immediate cessation of the war. In his opinion, the end of the war is still several months away." Regarding foreign policy issues, Churchill strongly emphasized that the British-American-Soviet alliance is closer than before. In the event of territorial changes occurring on the Polish border, Britain will provide assistance to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's demand for a secure border and [friendly countries] next to its western border is reasonable. Regarding this issue, Mikolajczyk and his colleagues in the Polish government-in-exile will soon reopen negotiations in Moscow.

### Three-Headed Conference to Be Held at Year's End

Regarding the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, a satisfactory agreement has not yet been reached. He strongly emphasized the necessity of a [Three-Headed Conference], but this conference must be held after the American presidential election. The time of the conference will be in December, and the location has not yet been decided. Churchill declared after completing his speech that he would discuss with President Roosevelt many issues regarding the conduct of the war, as well as what steps should be taken to enable Stalin to join the triangular conference as soon as the military situation permits.

-- Wu Gong

As a member of the cultural world, coming to the old capital inevitably involves contact with the cultural figures here. I have become acquainted with several of them in the past two years through meetings related to news and propaganda, but most of them I have never met face to face. A few days ago, when I went to visit Mr. Liu Longguang at the Wude Newspaper Office, he expressed his hope that I could attend their Decisive Battle Literary Scholars' Congress. Sure enough, on September 23rd, they sent an invitation card inviting me to go, and naturally, the next morning, I could not avoid visiting it.

### Decisive Battle Literary Scholars' Congress

The so-called Decisive Battle Literary Scholars' Congress was actually organized by the North China Writers Association, and its purpose was to promote the awareness of decisive battle literature and advance the national literature movement, in order to fulfill the mission of cultural figures under the decisive battle. In addition to the entire membership of the North China Writers Association, consisting of more than 200 people, there were local Chinese and Japanese reporting authorities, as well as representatives from the cultural world. The congress began at around 10:00 AM, chaired by Qian Daosun, the recently resigned president of Peking University. After passing a resolution to complete the victory of the decisive battle, the Writers Association presented the North China Literary Awards. This year's winners included Ma Li's [The Lament of Taiping], Yang Bao's [The Return to Life], Lei Yan's [Good Fields], Xiao Ai's [Collection of Duckweeds], Mu Yimang's [Nightingale's Song], and Wang Luo's [May You Live a Long Life]. Only Ma Li won the first prize, receiving a prize of 1,000 yuan, while the rest received prizes of 200 yuan. On that day, speeches were delivered at the venue by Guan Yixian of the Information Bureau and Chen Zaiping, Director of the Propaganda Bureau of the Xinmin Association, followed by speeches by guest representatives. In addition to Sun Runyu, chairman of the film company, as a guest representative, Mr. Liu Longguang temporarily requested a journalist to speak once. Then, Director Takeda of the Reporting Department gave a lecture on the current situation, explaining the trends of the decisive battle in great detail. After lunch, Dr. Fujisawa Chikawo, Director of the Fujisawa Research Institute, gave a lecture, the main point of which was to explain how to use Chinese Taoism to remedy today's Western utilitarian concepts. After Fujisawa's lecture, the third membership meeting of the Writers Association continued.

### Reorganization of the Writers Association

This membership meeting of the North China Writers Association was quite important, because they were at this time establishing new association affairs, so their organization also underwent some changes. According to the revised articles of association, the North China Writers Association will henceforth be changed to an executive committee system, with eleven to thirteen members. It will have a chief committee member (elected by Chen Mian) and a full-time committee member (elected by Liu Longguang). The committee members include Chuan Yunyu, Shen Qiwu, Liang Shanding, Zhang Tiesheng, Chen Xinjia, Yu Bailin, Zhao Yintang, Yang Bingchen, Chen Lufeng, Chen Shaoqiu, and Wang Jieren. The supervisory committee member is Xu Yubing (elected). In addition, they have also established a council and an administrative department. The position of head of the administrative department has now been selected to be Chen Lufeng. The administrative department is divided into three groups: general affairs, business, and editorial review. At the same time, for the convenience of research, they have established seven departmental committees: fiction, criticism, essays, poetry, drama, classical literature, and foreign literature. Currently, the North China Writers Association not only publishes North China Literature and Art, but also publishes the [Chinese Literature] monthly magazine. On the day they held the Decisive Battle Literary Scholars' Congress, their [China Weekly] newspaper, which they founded, was also launched, so most of the people who attended that day had a copy in hand. Broadly speaking, China Weekly is a more promising North China publication, and the articles are very exquisite. The solidarity of the writers in North China is truly admirable, especially their ability to serve the cultural world with their own strength as writers, which may be a necessity that we should adopt.

### Visiting Beijing Municipal Ninth Middle School

I had already heard from Mr. Liu Yushu, the Mayor of Beijing Special Municipality and Director of the Education Bureau, that there was a municipal middle school here that was very unique, which aroused my desire to visit it. This is Beijing Municipal Ninth Middle School, which before the Greater East Asia War was originally a missionary school run by the American Methodist Episcopal Church—Huaiwen Middle School. In the past, Huaiwen Middle School was very famous in North China, but most of the students lived a life of pampered ease. Since the arrival of the new principal, Mr. Kuai Chao, although only a year and a half has passed, it has been organized in a well-ordered manner, worthy of being a rising educator after the Incident. It is said that when the school changed principals last spring, the Methodist Episcopal Church's bishop in Beijing at the time was pessimistic about the future of Huaiwen. He did not expect that after Kuai took over as principal, not only has the school's assets increased a lot, but the academic performance of the average student has also exceeded that of all other middle schools in Beijing. Today, when Beijing Ninth Middle School is mentioned, everyone acknowledges it as the leading school, and even the Beijing Normal University Affiliated Middle School, which had always been at the top of Beijing's middle schools before the Incident, is somewhat falling behind! Of course, during my stay in Beijing, I could not miss this opportunity, so I immediately left the municipal government and took a car to No. 1 Chuanban Hutong. My first impression was very good, because the campus of Municipal Ninth Middle School was spacious and the trees were pleasingly verdant. When the reporter arrived, Principal Kuai was still teaching. Only when the bell rang at twelve did a man in his forties push open the door and enter. This turned out to be Principal Kuai. He was wearing only a black uniform, and his legs were wrapped in puttees, giving him the appearance of a soldier. As soon as he arrived, he invited me to watch the group training. It turned out that they stipulated that every Saturday from 12:00 to 12:40 was the time for all students to gather on the large playground to conduct group training. The so-called group training is the military training of the citizens, so their faculty and students all wear uniforms, and the faculty even wear puttees, giving it a very militarized atmosphere. On the school's large playground stood more than a thousand young students, completely listening to the orders of the commander. Any movement had to be done together, and everyone's head was as still as an ancient tree, not even moving. According to Kuai, this is some small achievement after he has been principal for a year and a half. After the group training, there was a flag lowering ceremony, because they had a holiday on Saturday afternoons. They hold a flag raising ceremony every morning at 8:00 AM, and after the flag raising ceremony, they do morning exercises. They hold group training every evening before school is dismissed, and after the group training, they continue with the flag lowering ceremony. The group training focuses on military movements, discipline, and obedience, so it is different from ordinary gymnastics. On the day the flag lowering ceremony was held, the reporter personally saw those more than a thousand future pillars of China saluting the shining national flag in the sound of bugles. That moment of adorable scene directly made me feel extremely moved. According to Principal Kuai, the focus of their schooling is to first emphasize physical education, and then to focus on moral and intellectual education, and their method of education starts with this kind of group training. Since they implemented group training, the atmosphere of the entire school has changed, and the pampered airs of the former wealthy young men have completely disappeared. In particular, the general students' concepts of discipline and obedience owe much to group training.

### Equal Emphasis on Physical and Intellectual Education

Today's Ninth Middle School, although it pays special attention to physical education, is even more advanced in terms of the original rigorous spirit of the curriculum. Kuai's coming to head this school this time did not change any of the original faculty members. Except for a few who resigned voluntarily, they are almost the same as in the past. However, Kuai's care for students' studies is also worth mentioning. For example, he usually pays attention to monthly exams and oral exams, and anyone who cheats is expelled. Moreover, every classroom has cross-shaped gaps left in the door so that Principal Kuai can inspect during class. So, of all the middle school principals, I can believe that none are busier than Kuai. Although he only teaches two or three hours a week, he handles everything personally, no matter how big or small. Not only does he need to inspect the teaching situation in each class every day, but he also needs to go to the infirmary to inspect the doctor's examination of sick students. In the evening, he goes to inspect the boarding house every day, and sometimes he personally covers the students who sleep nude. According to Kuai, the entire faculty and students of the school recently underwent physical examinations, and all students with lung disease were ordered to drop out, and staff members were also forced to take a break, but their original salaries were paid as usual, and workers with lung disease were also given a compassionate dismissal order. So, so far, they say that this school is the most suitable for hygiene conditions.

### General Situation of Schools in Beijing Recently

Finally, I learned a little about the general situation of schools in Beijing recently from Kuai's mouth, which is specially attached below: There are about 20,000 to 30,000 elementary schools in Beijing today, and the best are the Affiliated Elementary School of Beijing Normal University and the Affiliated Elementary School of Beijing Normal University. There are 21 municipal middle schools, including 10 male middle schools, 6 female middle schools, 1 normal school, and 4 vocational schools. There are more than 30 private schools. Among the male middle schools, Pingmin Middle School is the most famous, and among the female middle schools, Guanghua Girls' Middle School is the most famous. Today, there are only four universities: Peking University, Beijing Normal University, China University, and Fu Jen Catholic University. Peking University has about 6,000 students, divided into six colleges: liberal arts, science, law, engineering, science, and agriculture. Beijing Normal University has more than 2,000 students. China University is divided into three colleges: liberal arts, science, and law. It is private, with He Qigong as the head of the school, and has about 3,000 students. Fu Jen Catholic University is run by the Catholic Church and has about 2,000 students.

### New Federation Celebrates National Day; Arranges Grand Program; Ticket Proceeds Subsidize Charity and Public Welfare

In order to celebrate Double Ten Day, the Shanghai News Federation has specially arranged a grand celebratory program. At the same time, in order to subsidize social charity, public welfare, and scholarship funds, the admission tickets for the celebration fair are being sold at a price, but all expenses are borne by the federation, and all ticket proceeds will be used for charitable and public welfare expenses. Preparations have been completed. The charitable performance program is as follows: From 12:00 noon to 6:00 PM on October 9th, a Peking opera charity performance will be held at the Tianchan Stage. At 8:00 PM on the 10th, a lecture and film conference will be held at the Grand Cathay, and Mr. Li Sihao, Chairman of the China News Association, will be invited to speak. At 8:00 PM on the 11th, a drama charity performance will be held at the Lyceum Theatre. Among them, the Peking opera program is extremely grand, with Mr. Zhou Xinmang leading all of Shanghai's leading Qipai opera stars in a full performance of "The Pursuit of Han Xin," as well as Chen Yongling et al. of Tianchan Stage performing "The Great Cui Ping Mountain," and all of Shanghai's famous martial artists jointly performing the three-part "Iron Rooster." The program is wonderful and unprecedented. All of the Tianchan Stage's seat tickets, except for those on the third floor, which are sold by the stage's ticket office, have been fully subscribed by the eight member newspapers of the federation. On that day, the charitable seats at the Grand Cathay will be sold for 300 yuan, and the public welfare seats will be sold for 200 yuan, all sold by the theater's ticket office.

### Purchasers of Old Land Deeds Ordered to Make Provisional Registration

Recently, land prices in the special district of this city have been rising, and speculation has been rampant. In order to rectify the situation, the Municipal Land Administration Bureau previously issued a notice prohibiting the sale and purchase of land with old deeds. However, investigations have revealed that some landowners are still reselling land in secret, leading to situations of double sales of land and original owners requesting supplementary certificates after the land has already been sold, as well as various other disputes. Moreover, the deeds often have flaws, and whether the land corresponds to the deed cannot be determined without the Land Administration Bureau's detailed examination of the maps and records. It is understood that the bureau, in order to prevent property disputes, is still prohibiting the sale and purchase of land with old deeds. In order to thoroughly rectify land administration, landowners who have already completed transactions of land with old deeds are ordered to bring their evidence of ownership and the original contract to the bureau's central district office before the end of this year to apply for provisional registration in advance, in order to facilitate collection and sorting. In addition, the bureau has issued a notice that those who intend to enter into agreements for the sale and purchase of land with old deeds in the future should jointly apply to the bureau for a certificate change and complete the transfer registration after signing and confirming the maps.

### Health Check-ups for University Students

Gu Nanqun, Director of Nanyang Hospital, wrote: [University students are the elite of academic institutions, and in the blink of an eye, they become the backbone of the nation and leaders of society. Their health is a matter of great importance and profound significance for their own careers and the future of the nation and society. Furthermore, to shoulder the heavy responsibilities of this great era and the future reconstruction, good health is particularly important. Considering my role as a physician serving society, I previously organized free health check-ups for primary school students from a medical perspective, which has been ongoing for over a month and is still continuing. Now, I am organizing free health check-ups for university students receiving student aid. Starting on October 11th, ten students will be examined each day from 2:30 PM to 5:00 PM, excluding Sundays and public holidays. Those undergoing the examination should first obtain a form from your newspaper's student aid office, fill out the required sections, register at the social services department of our hospital according to the scheduled date and time, and the department will send them to various departments for examination. If any illnesses are found, we will arrange treatment to ensure their health. I am sending the form for your review and printing for use.] We are deeply grateful to Director Gu of Nanyang Hospital for his kindness in organizing free health check-ups for university students. We hope that this year's student aid recipients will register at the office starting October 4th with their registration certificates in order to be assigned a number and scheduled date for examination.

### Heavy Losses for the Enemy on Peleliu Island: Minister Matsushima Discusses the Pacific War Situation

Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet Press Department in China met with Chinese journalists yesterday (29th) afternoon at 2:30 PM, as usual, to discuss the latest Pacific War situation and the collusion between Chongqing and the United States. The following is a record of his remarks:

### Major Defeat for Enemy Forces on Peleliu Island

Regarding the battle on Peleliu Island in the Palau Islands, fierce fighting is still ongoing. The US military has suffered very heavy losses. As of the 22nd of this month, the enemy's casualties totaled 12,400. These figures represent the losses suffered by the enemy within 270 meters (300 yards) south of Peleliu Island. Compared to the enemy's losses on Saipan Island, the losses are even more significant. On Saipan Island, the enemy's casualties were 56 per square kilometer, while on Palau, the casualties were 413 per square kilometer. This enormous number poses a major threat to the enemy. The US military has dispatched 10,000-ton transport ships twice to accommodate these casualties, which demonstrates the severity of the enemy's losses. (During the battle of Saipan, almost the entire US First and Seventh Marine Divisions were destroyed. The enemy called this a great achievement, but Major General LeGendre, known as a fierce marine commander, was greatly disappointed by this).

### Extreme Difficulties in Operations Against Japan

According to a Europe Meloni telegram from the 26th, Lieutenant General Tom Holcomb, commander of the Third Division of the US Southwestern Pacific Allied Forces, broadcast that to defeat Japan, first, the highest level of combat power is required. He also said that there are still over 90,000 Japanese troops on the flanks of the advance on New Guinea, and these troops must be defeated before complete recovery is possible. However, the Japanese troops there are fighting to the death, which makes it clear that the enemy generals are experiencing extreme difficulties in operations.

### Chongqing Remains Obstinately Unenlightened

Regarding Nelson, the US representative who recently visited Chongqing, he has returned to Washington, D.C. by express plane. The contents of the conditions document approved by Chiang Kai-shek that Nelson brought back from Chongqing are not detailed, but it is assumed that the area under the jurisdiction of the Chongqing government will be designated as an industrial zone for the manufacture of weapons for the war against Japan. If this is realized, China will inevitably become an even more brutal battlefield, and the Chinese people will suffer the greatest pain. However, the Chongqing government remains unenlightened and adheres to its consistent ideal of "resisting aggression and building the nation." It is feared that there will be a day of "resisting aggression and destroying the nation."

### Writers Blame Britain and the United States for Miscalculations

The United States, in seeking its own security, has resulted in the entire country becoming a battlefield, and the people are suffering greatly. Japan, in building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, aims to give the Chinese people hope and happiness, while the enemy United States gives the Chinese people death. According to a London telegram from the 24th, the American writer Stillwell wrote an article in an American weekly magazine last week, blaming the failure of the British and American [mainland] strategy against Japan on the weakness of Chongqing's power. However, on the other hand, he advocated supplying Chongqing with weapons. We can see his intention, not only to supply weapons to Chongqing but also to fulfill his conspiracy to turn Chongqing into a factory for manufacturing weapons. Furthermore, Chiang Kai-shek recently said at the [National Political Council] that "the decisive stage of the war in China has now begun." This statement will turn China into an even more brutal battlefield, but whether the 450 million Chinese people share this view is worth considering. The US military made exaggerated claims about the operations in the Philippines, saying that the battle in the Philippines caused significant damage to the Japanese fleet and aircraft. This statement is delusional. Previously, when the enemy bombed Manila, the Chinese overseas suffered great losses. And the previous bombing of Nanjing also caused damage only to the Chinese people, with no damage to Japan. However, the enemy United States has never made any announcements about this.

### French Tram Concession Granted Fare Increase by the Municipal Government: Public Utilities Bureau Announces Reasons for Approval

Regarding the matter of the French tram fare increase, because the company had not obtained approval from the authorities and increased fares without authorization, it was strictly prohibited by order of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and criticized by the press. In less than a week, it was restored to the original price. Now, it is understood that the case has been transferred by the Public Utilities Bureau and approved by the Municipal Government, and the fare increase has been approved, and the company has been notified to comply. The Public Utilities Bureau has issued the following explanation of the process: The French tram concession's reasons for applying for a fare increase, according to its submission, stated: In August of the 30th year [1941], the company had discussed with the former French Municipal Council the income-expenditure ratio sufficient to maintain a balance of income and expenditure, and the result was that the average income per passenger was 0.15 yuan (i.e., 15 cents) and the cost per kilometer of operation was 1.30 yuan (i.e., 1 yuan 30 cents). It is now estimated that the cost per kilometer of operation in September of this year has increased to 74 yuan, which is 57 times higher than in August of the 30th year, while the current fare revenue is only 24 times that of August of the 30th year. According to the previous ratio, the fare must be increased by 2.4 times the current price to balance income and expenditure. Based on these figures, the company's calculations over time are credible. Regarding the comparison between the company and the Shanghai tram, because the Shanghai Tram Company does not include depreciation in its costs, and most of the replacement materials used are allocated by the Military Management Office at very low prices, even if they need to be purchased, they can be purchased at official prices. The electricity is also supplied by the Shanghai Electric Power Company, and the company must pay 5% of its business tax to the Municipal Government every month. The treatment of employees is increased according to the cost of living index, which is also higher than that of the Shanghai Electric Power Company's employees. After the Shanghai Tram Company switched to a segmented system, it is necessary to change cars twice and purchase tickets three times from Jing'an Temple to Yangshupu. The French tram has not yet changed to a segmented system, and you can reach your destination in one trip. Therefore, although the company's fare is relatively high, in actual comparison, the difference is very small, and the expenditure is far greater than that of the Shanghai Tram Company, which is a fact. The Bureau believes that the above reasons are realistic, so the company's submitted fare increase table was reviewed and reduced according to the actual situation. The highest first-class fare is 16 yuan, the lowest is 6 yuan, the highest third-class fare is 10 yuan, and the lowest is 4 yuan, which has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and notification.

### Japanese Advisor to the Ministry of Justice Visits the Court Yesterday

Jiu Li Tian Yixi, advisor to the Judicial Administration Department, accompanied by Secretary Meiwei of the Japanese Embassy, visited the Shanghai Local Court at 10:00 AM yesterday. They were received by President Ji Yangzhou and toured the court's various courtrooms for about an hour before departing.

### Defective Siren Causes False Alarm Yesterday

According to the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters, the air raid siren that sounded at 4:30 PM yesterday (29th) was a false alarm due to a defective siren.

### Reduced Remittance Fees in Shaoxing

Due to the extreme difficulty in supplying funds to the Shaoxing Post Office in the past, the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau increased the remittance fee to 51 yuan per thousand yuan to regulate the situation. Now that funds have been secured for the Shaoxing Bureau, the remittance fee has been reduced to 26 yuan per thousand yuan starting from the 25th of this month. Both telegraphic and postal remittances can be quickly cashed, which is extremely convenient.

### Shen Bao Cup Basketball League B Team Registration Procedures to be Completed This Afternoon

### Russia Wins Sino-Russian Volleyball Match

The Sino-Russian volleyball match was held for the third time yesterday afternoon at the Qing Fitness Room of the Ba Xian Overseas Chinese Middle School. Adopting the American system, Qing did not adapt well to this style of play, and the game lacked excitement. Chen Xuechong was also absent.

### Difficulties in Paying Tuition Fees: Requesting Authorities to Withdraw Order

— A Teacher

The news published in the newspapers on September 24th stated that Director Jian of the Municipal Bureau of Education, noting the eagerness of the teaching staff of various schools for the early disbursement of September funds due to the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival, had repeatedly consulted with the Municipal Government and the Bureau of Finance and decided to distribute them by district starting on the 25th. Every staff member of the schools was naturally extremely grateful. But what is the reality? For the so-called September funds, the salary item is still 730 yuan per teacher. Just imagine, a primary school teacher who has received at least a secondary education and has diligently fulfilled a month's teaching responsibilities, the reward they receive is not enough to buy ten ordinary mooncakes. Compared to the mooncakes bought by wealthy families in companies, it is probably not enough to pay for the special tax on one or two large mooncakes. Furthermore, it is said that when receiving this pitiful salary of 730 yuan, 75% of the tuition fees designated for improving the treatment of education workers this semester must first be handed over to the bureau, and only 25% can be "temporarily allowed to be stored in the school for temporary use due to the difficult living conditions of the staff of each school" before the salary can be claimed. And this 75% handed over to the bureau must be "[after all schools have reported and the distribution plan has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval, each school should be informed of the exact amount to be distributed]." Salary increases are not in sight, special rice allocations are still being processed, and tuition fees that have been collected have to be handed over. How useful is this 730 yuan? But we cannot go to the classroom hungry, clutching books and forgetting our families. So, at the beginning of the semester, we repeatedly asked the principal for a loan, not a small amount, to settle our families, and also asked the principal to purchase enough firewood and rice for the colleagues to use for the semester. The principal is sympathetic to us and has agreed to each request. In addition to gratitude, we can only work hard in our own duties to thank his sincerity. Now that the Bureau of Education is urging the handover of tuition fees, seeing the principal's worried expression, everyone is worried that when the principal is so anxious that he can't think of a way, will he sell the stored firewood and rice to comply with the order? If this is really the case, how will we live in the future? Therefore, we ask Mayor Chen to have compassion on our difficult living conditions and heavy workload, and withdraw the order to hand over tuition fees to the government, so as to avoid a major panic in our lives when the school sells rice to hand over the funds. At the same time, please instruct Director Dai to quickly investigate the exact amount of fees collected by each school, formulate a distribution method, and announce and implement it as soon as possible, and announce the salary increase method as soon as possible, to reassure the hearts of teachers, workers, and servants. We must not repeat the same mistake as last semester's acceptance of student parents' living subsidies - after each school handed them over to the bureau, they were not distributed until several weeks later, and some say that there has been no news about the commission part so far? Prices are constantly rising, and the meager salaries of the staff really cannot withstand the storm.

### Thunderstorm (8)

[I thought if I told you, you wouldn't be able to draw, so I deliberately didn't tell you.] Lieutenant Colonel Tobita said sorrowfully when he returned to the reporting department room. Ryuo felt his throat filling with hot tears faster than his eyes, and he couldn't say a word. [Tani is a great soldier! … A great death… Great…] Lieutenant Colonel Tobita's slow speech suddenly became incoherent, and he lowered his head. Uncontrollably, Ryuo burst into tears. Like a child, the sobbing never stopped. [What's wrong with you?] A colleague T, a clerk, ran to Ryuo's side. Lieutenant Colonel Tobita gestured to him, and T hugged Ryuo and dragged him to his cramped office. [Ah, so you are Major Tani's confidant!] Other clerks also ran to Ryuo's room to comfort him, and he lay on the chaotic table, his back moving in jerks. It wasn't just sadness at the death of a real person that made him cry. He admired that gentle real person, who had established immortal martial achievements, and regretted that he didn't know that the real person was such a great man and hadn't been closer to him. At the same time, he felt very happy to have such a great friend - it was a mixture of emotions that made him cry so bitterly. His crying was too painful, so the two clerks in the same room had no choice but to leave. Left alone, he continued to cry to his heart's content. (It was probably the real person's last remembrance of me that made Lieutenant Colonel Tobita introduce me to the reporting department to take up a position.) Thinking of this, it added a new spring of tears. Then, the face of the real person at the parting in Wuzhen was reflected on his heart. Finally, he thought of his sister. When the news of the real person's death was announced to the whole country by radio, it was not difficult to imagine what kind of mental blow his sister would suffer. (My sister's hope is gone forever. However, this is a very small matter.) He thought this while wiping away tears. When his mind calmed down, he immediately jumped out of his room and ran to the Black Tide Society office. The photographic plate was already finished. Ryuo stared at the night raid drawing he had drawn. Before long, he let out a startling sound. The officer sticking half his body out of the submarine was the image of the real person. However, this posture was exactly the impression when the real person was sticking out of the No. 6 boat at the submarine school. Unconsciously, Ryuo had drawn the image of the real person. (146)

### Mooncake Charity Sale Continues

The Guanshengyuan Food Company has donated 200,000 yuan from this charity sale of mooncakes to the Shen Xin two newspapers to help students and relieve poverty. Due to the enthusiastic promotion of charitable people from all walks of life, they have all been sold out. Yesterday, we learned that a Mr. Anonymous had independently ordered ten "Peaceful Years" mooncakes, totaling 100,000 yuan, and the Xin Yi Enterprise Company had ordered one "Three Pools Mirroring the Moon" mooncake, totaling 6,000 yuan. In order to encourage the charity act, the company, although it had been completely sold out, did not want to disappoint them, so it rushed to produce them overnight so that they could be delivered before the festival. The enthusiasm of the two gentlemen for charity is commendable, and the original target of 200,000 yuan has exceeded more than half, which is especially gratifying. The day before yesterday, Mr. Chai Xinfu also purchased a "Three Pools Mirroring the Moon" mooncake for 6,000 yuan. The money has been handed over to our office by the company, bringing the total to 100,000 yuan. Thank you.
