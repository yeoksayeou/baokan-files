### The Essence of the Greater East Asia War

As we prepare to commemorate the first anniversary of our participation in the war, we feel it necessary to re-examine the essence of the Greater East Asia War.

The Greater East Asia War is, in reality, a war of liberation for the billion oppressed people of Asia. In the past, India and Burma were first exploited by the piratical British, who used strategies to alienate the various states, classes, and religions of India, causing them to fight among themselves and live as slaves, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people each year. Following this, the British and Dutch conquered indigenous peoples of Java, Sumatra, Borneo, etc., seizing the world's largest resources, and using these vast resources to invade the independent nations of China and Japan in Greater East Asia. The United States, under the guise of humanitarianism, practiced imperialism, traversed the Pacific Ocean, seized the Philippines, reduced the islands' inherent culture to ashes, and further colluded with Britain to indulge their ambitions within China.

Under the aggression of Britain and the United States, we have been poisoned for over a century. Not only is the inherent culture of East Asia, spanning four thousand years, in imminent danger, but even the lives of the peoples of Greater East Asia are threatened.

The Greater East Asia War is a war of self-defense for the peoples of Greater East Asia to break free from the iron heels of Britain and the United States and seek survival. We must not only completely expel the forces of Britain and the United States from East Asia, but also fundamentally shatter the residual Anglo-American ideologies of racial inequality.

Over the past two years, the Greater East Asia War, thanks to the valiant fighting of the Japanese army, has already laid the foundation for a certain victory, and has given rise to newly independent nations such as Burma and the Philippines. At the same time, representatives from the seven nations of Greater East Asia have agreed on the five construction principles for Greater East Asia: Coexistence and co-prosperity; independence and amity; cultural flourishing; economic prosperity; and contributing to world progress. With these five principles as the ideal for building Greater East Asia and achieving victory in the Greater East Asia War, what should we do? First, intensify the collaboration between China and Japan to establish a posture of cooperative decisive battle among the nations of Greater East Asia. Second, fully mobilize all levels and sectors of the nation to concentrate efforts on increasing production in order to achieve victory in the long war.

In short, this war is a common war for all the nations and countries of Greater East Asia. It has been a year since we joined the war, but we have not directly undertaken frontline tasks. In terms of the obligation to participate in the war and the obligation to jointly build Greater East Asia, we absolutely cannot shirk our due responsibilities. If the frontline battles are solely shouldered by the brave soldiers of allied nations, then we have an unshirkable duty to provide supplies from the rear. Therefore, how to complete the work of the rear supply base, to continuously supply the frontline soldiers, and to persist in long-term warfare, is the direction that our entire nation, from top to bottom, should strive towards together. In simple terms, the government should promptly complete the wartime system and implement the outline of wartime economic policies, especially increasing production and stabilizing prices. The people, on the one hand, should do their best to increase production in accordance with government instructions, and on the other hand, save and accumulate wealth to prepare for rear supplies.

The Greater East Asia War can be said to be a war of awakening for the Asian peoples. However, in terms of striving for certain victory, awakening alone is not enough. The Asian peoples must have a firm belief in victory. Even with a firm belief, it is still not enough; there must be practical action, that is, the fulfillment of all the tasks of war. Awakening produces belief, and practice complements belief; only then will this awakening have bright results.

### Sikh Demonstrations in India Against the British, Fierce Clashes Occur

Rangoon, 7th (Central News Agency) - Anti-British riots have repeatedly occurred in India, and they have now spread to the Sikhs. The situation has deteriorated on the 2nd, which was the birthday of the tenth Sikh Guru. It is learned that clashes between Sikhs and British officials have occurred several times in the Punjab, Northwest Frontier Province, and United Provinces. Among them, residents of cities and villages in the Punjab, the so-called homeland of the Sikhs, have resisted the orders of the Governor and staged anti-British demonstrations by Sikhs, resulting in fierce clashes between the two sides. At the same time, British officials opened fire on the demonstrating crowds, resulting in many casualties among the crowds. Among them, the clash between the Sikhs and British officials in Haripura was the most intense, with women participating. At the same time, Sikh patriotic figures wrote anti-British slogans in large characters and held demonstrations and parades with anti-British flags. Therefore, British officials immediately opened fire and attacked, and the two sides fought fiercely for several hours. This high-pressure tactic by the central government has further intensified the anti-British sentiment of all Sikhs, and the situation between the two sides has become increasingly worse. Currently, British officials are paying close attention to the movements in various cities and implementing security measures. It is learned that the governors of the British-Indian Northwest provinces, alarmed by the seriousness of the situation in Haripura, have arrived there to inspect the situation in order to investigate the facts.

### Minister of Information Matsushima Discusses Outlook on World War Situation, Enemy's Counterattack Anxious Beyond Measure

Central News Agency Dispatch - Minister Matsushima of the Fleet Information Department, at the Joint Press Conference in Shanghai yesterday (7th), gave his view on the future of the world war.

Enemy Losses

Regarding the situation of the Pacific War, such as the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, fierce battles are raging in four locations, including the Marshall Islands and Bougainville. The enemy's losses have been severe, with a total of nine flagships, twenty-four aircraft carriers, twenty-two cruisers, twelve cruiser destroyers, ten destroyers, eleven transport ships, and countless other small vessels. The enemy is extremely anxious to counterattack. We can see this clearly in the Moscow Conference and the Tehran Conference.

Production Comparison

Continuing to compare the production capacity of Japan and the United States, such as rubber, tin, aluminum, steel, coal, petroleum, etc., Japan's production capacity is already equal to that of the United States. Since Japan actively started production, it has now become the second largest in the world. Currently, the United States' aircraft, in addition to its own urgent needs, are also supplied to Britain, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing. With such enormous consumption, it will be advantageous for Japan in the future. When comparing aircraft losses, the ratio is five for the US to one for Japan. With the second phase of increased production operations in this year, the gains and losses of one city are not related to the overall situation. The most important thing is to maximize domestic production. In addition, although enemy submarines are quite active in the waters between the South Seas and Japan, Japan's strict defense is like an iron wall, and they cannot succeed.

Bluffing

Next, regarding the situation on the mainland, the enemy's destruction in central and southern China and the obstruction of traffic in the Yangtze River basin and the south, after Japan's strict defense techniques everywhere, the losses are quite small. As for the situation in Burma, the enemy's counterattack, after the Japanese army's attack, caused the enemy a great deal of losses. At present, Japan is working hard on production, and its rapid progress is promising. In the future, there will be amazing progress in production. Furthermore, regarding the European war, the Italian front seems to be at a standstill. There has been no major development in the German-Soviet war for the time being. On the anti-Axis side, since the Tehran Conference, the second phase of the war situation, in terms of the strategic situation in Libya and the Balkan Peninsula, is quite difficult for Europe and the United States. It is only a bluff, and it is entering a spiral state. Finally, I hope that the Chinese people, during this period, will have the spirit of living and dying together, have strong faith, cooperate with Japan, and complete the final victory.

### The German Defenses Along the Entire Mediterranean Coast are Strong, Comparable to the "Atlantic Wall"

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency learned from military sources that the defenses along the Mediterranean coast have been strengthened, making them comparable to the Atlantic Wall of Northern and Western Europe. A German engineering regiment has laid more than 100,000 mines along the Mediterranean coast. The minefields of each base are connected end-to-end, making them sufficient to resist enemy tank armies and landing forces. At the same time, various obstacles and fire-throwing devices have been built along the Mediterranean coast, which are not only sufficient to protect tank trenches, but also sufficient to protect the first line of defense. The Anglo-American invading forces will encounter extremely large fortresses in Western and Southeastern Europe. The entire front line stretches from Norway, through Denmark, along the North Sea coast, the English Channel coast, and the Atlantic coast to Spain, a total length of 5,000 kilometers. The entire line has fortresses, obstacles, and battle positions, and thousands of artillery pieces of various calibers.

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - It is reported that a new type of coastal artillery is being tested here. This artillery uses a new type of shell that can not only strike targets in the sea, but also hit bombers in dense formations flying at high altitudes from a long distance. In this way, enemy planes will no longer dare to fly in dense formations, and German fighters will have the opportunity to attack when they approach enemy planes. Up to now, fighters and destroyers have had to attack an entire team of enemy planes. This new method can be used to deal with individually flying bombers.

### Rommel Inspects Defenses, German Army on High Alert

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - "German authorities announced on the 6th regarding Marshal Rommel's inspection of defenses on the Atlantic front: Marshal Rommel previously inspected the German army's defense situation in the Netherlands with his staff. After a detailed inspection of the coastal defense facilities, he went to inspect the occupied areas of Western Europe, and reviewed the various mechanized divisions, mechanized grenadier divisions, and various technical divisions, confirming that all units can exert their combat power without regret. Furthermore, the German leader's headquarters announced regarding the German army's preparations to counter the anti-Axis army's landing operation that Anglo-American newspapers frequently promoted the anti-Axis army's landing operation, and made various speculations about the landing location. However, the German army had already made preparations for an ambush. When the anti-Axis army attempts to land, they will know how strong the German defenses are.

### Britain and the United States Put Pressure on Spain and Portugal in an Attempt to Open a Second Front

Zurich, 7th (Central News Agency) - Domei News Agency correspondent Holly Gong Qi's dispatch: Since the Tehran Conference, the pressure of Britain and the United States on Spain and Portugal has been increasing day by day. Therefore, the anti-Axis has the possibility of invading the Iberian Peninsula. In this way, they can fulfill their promise to open a second front. Landing on the Iberian Peninsula can save Britain and the United States from the difficulty of directly attacking the steel wall west of the English Channel. According to the opinion of British military commentator Hurd, attacking the French coast is not a suitable action, because before a decisive attack, it is necessary to destroy the German army's defensive balance first, which is more effective. After controlling the northern Spanish air bases, operations in the Bay of Biscay will be more convenient, because land forces can easily establish a large and secure bridgehead. Moreover, if the Iberian landing is a major defeat, it will not directly affect Britain as much as a failed landing in the English Channel.

### Spanish Army Professes Loyalty to the Leader

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Madrid: Spanish Army Chief Acesio recently expressed to Generalissimo Franco the determination of the entire army to loyally support the leader. Franco then gave a speech to encourage national unity and to support Spain's freedom and independence. The gist of it was that five years of war have left the people impoverished. All parties are painfully aware that the Spanish army has the strength to protect the survival of our people and to defend our freedom and independence: we should have absolute trust in Spain's mission and unite to overcome the war.

Bern and Capital, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch from London: After the Soviet Union announced that the Spanish division was still fighting on the Eastern Front, the British official news agency revealed yesterday that the British government was dissatisfied with the Spanish garrison division still fighting on the Eastern Front and had informed the Spanish government of this.

### Turkish Cabinet Holds Meeting

Ankara, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a public announcement here: the Turkish cabinet held a meeting yesterday, presided over by Prime Minister Longla Zhuogelu.

Istanbul, 7th (Central News Agency) - Turkish parliamentarian Yarchi wrote an article stating that the Cairo Conference has clarified the situation in Turkey. Even if Britain and the United States supply military weapons, Turkey's military strength still cannot compete with an army with modern armaments.

### Anti-Axis Invasion of Europe Headquarters Established in London, Franklin Appointed Commander-in-Chief of British Defense Forces

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from London, the Standard Evening News reported that General Eisenhower's so-called "Invasion of Europe Headquarters" will be established in London.

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch, London announced in the official gazette yesterday that General Franklin has now been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the British National Defense Forces.

### Churchill's Illness Has Other Implications, Many Believe it is a Pretense

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch: A Cairo observer believes that British Prime Minister Churchill's illness is a pretense, the purpose of which is to delay the implementation of promises made to Stalin, and even attempt to cancel them. It is unknown whether this important promise is related to the invasion of Europe, but the observer believes that it must be related to the invasion. This can be confirmed by the fact that Roosevelt is concerned about Churchill's illness rather than Stalin's. Recall that on December 14th, British Foreign Secretary Eden said that Churchill felt slightly tired, but his health was still good, but 48 hours later, Deputy Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons that Churchill had pneumonia in his left lung and had to stay in bed for several days, but only two days later, the inflammation in Churchill's lung had subsided.

### Germans Endure Air Raids, National Spirit Rises, Vowing to Fight the Enemy on the Battlefield

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels wrote in the latest issue of "National Weekly" that the people who have suffered the most from air raids are also the most hopeful for final victory, because the people know that the property that has been lost can only be recovered after the final victory. The atrocities of the Anglo-American air raids not only manifested themselves in the results of the destruction, but also strengthened the will of the German people. Therefore, the overall national spirit has not only not been depressed, but is becoming more and more united. This development is beyond the enemy's expectations. When Germany launches retaliatory measures against British islands in the future, the hearts of the entire German people will be greatly rejoiced, and there will be no sympathy to speak of. Regarding the anti-Axis invasion of Western Europe, Goebbels continued that if the Anglo-American army launches this war, they will discover the psychological impact of the air raids on the German people. German soldiers from the raided cities will fight the enemies who actively launched the air raids on the battlefield. Goebbels finally commented on Germany's urban recovery plan, saying that plans for the construction of the newest style of housing are already underway.

### Anglo-American Planes Attack Germany, Losing Nearly a Hundred

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - German Leader's Headquarters announced: Anti-Axis air squadrons recently attacked Kiel, and several locations in western Germany and the occupied territories in the west. It has now been determined that the German army shot down a total of 81 anti-Axis planes in air combat, including 63 heavy bombers. The British Air Force raided Stettin in northern Germany on the night of the 5th, carrying out terror bombings. According to temporary reports, 16 enemy four-engine bombers were shot down. The anti-Axis air force has lost a total of 97 planes in the past 24 hours, including 79 four-engine bombers. The German army only lost 20 fighters.

### Rome Has Lost Its Military Value; German Army's Successful Operations

Rome, 7th (Central News Agency) – Since last autumn, September, the Anglo-American forces have only advanced 120 kilometers in the eastern sector and 140 kilometers in the western sector, suffering heavy damage. Meanwhile, the German army has strengthened its forward bases in the north and south. The central objective of the southern front is the defense line of Rome, but in the enemy's view, political and psychological elements are more important than military ones. From an administrative standpoint, Rome has now lost its significance as a capital, but it remains a great spiritual center for the Italian people. The German army maintains the southern front to contain the enemy's forces at this point, making future operations difficult for the enemy. Therefore, the German army has indeed achieved success in its operations in Italy. However, from another perspective, war relies entirely on iron and numbers. The Axis forces continuously bombard with heavy artillery, wasting resources alarmingly. Although their actions are extremely slow, they have ultimately advanced. The German army considers Rome to have no military value and may retreat if possible. It is generally believed that the German army will launch an offensive as soon as the opportunity arises.

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the Hai Tong News Agency: The American forces have intensified their offensive on the western front of Italy since the 4th of this month, but the entire U.S. Fifth Army has not yet participated in the battle. They are only attacking German positions north of Mignano and Cassino. The objective of the American offensive is likely to break into the Liri River valley, preventing the German army from hindering the American forces advancing towards the confluence of the Liri and Garigliano Rivers. As of the night before last, fierce fighting was still ongoing in that area. On the eastern front, the British army is being held back on both sides of the Forlì River, and the situation has become less intense. The reason for this may be the change of command of the British Eighth Army, which is unknown. The British generals are not good at adapting to changes. General Leese may continue Montgomery's strategy and attempt to attack Pescara.

### Soviet Army Disregards Sacrifices, Launches New Offensive; German Army Retreats from Berdichev

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) – According to a statement from the German military authorities: The German army has withdrawn from the strategically important city of Berdichev, south of Zhytomyr.

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: The Soviet army has deployed nine rifle divisions, several mechanized units, and approximately 250 tanks, launching a large-scale offensive in the bend of the Hnylyi Tikych River and southeast and northwest of Kirovohrad. After a powerful and urgent artillery barrage, large Soviet tank groups simultaneously attacked the German lines at several points, but the German army held its ground everywhere and prevented the enemy from breaking through. Fighting is currently ongoing in the area. In the Kiev-Zhytomyr area, the original site of the winter battles, the Soviet army launched another fierce offensive near Bila Tserkva. The German defense line here has been shortened and strengthened. On Wednesday, the Soviet army's main pressure was directed at the Berdichev area and the northwest and southwest of Zhytomyr. The Soviet army repeatedly attempted to break into the German positions, leading to extremely intense fighting. The German high-ground positions southeast and southwest of Berdichev vigorously resisted the Soviet army's large-scale offensive, enabling the German forces defending the western part of Berdichev to gradually retreat to pre-arranged positions west of the town.

Soviet Strategy

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) – Hai Tong News Agency reports: The Soviet winter offensive is intensifying, with the main offensive focus on the southern route under the command of General Vatutin, but General Konev's troops have also launched a new offensive. Vatutin's right flank is currently stalled west of the line from Olevsk to Novohrad-Volynskyi, while his central route is attempting to cross the Berdichev-Koziatyn line and advance towards the upper reaches of the Southern Buh River. The Soviet vanguard units are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the German army in that area. The German army is adopting a flexible strategy, launching counterattacks from time to time. Vatutin's left flank is now exerting pressure on the Bila Tserkva area, where the German army originally coordinated operations with the German forces in the Putilo-Aibedryanskyi District of Ukraine and the Great Dnieper Bend, but is now threatened from two sides: threatened by Vatutin's vanguard from the west and threatened by Soviet forces breaking through from Cherkasy from the east. The enemy is clearly trying to use this war to determine the situation in the region of the Great Hnylyi Tikych River. General Konev's offensive is intended to contain the German forces east of Kirovohrad and north of Kryvyi Rih, with rumors that Vatutin may push his southern flank units to threaten the western flank of the German army or even the rear. In the central sector of the Eastern Front, the Soviet army launched an offensive from Propoisk towards the German Dnieper bridgehead between Mogilev and Krychev, but it was not a major offensive. In the Vitebsk area, the enemy forces attacked the German positions northwest of the city, but were repelled by a counterattack.

### German Scouts Use Masks

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the Hai Tong News Agency: The German army is now using masks to adapt to the specific environment of certain war zones. These masks are exclusively used by reconnaissance units.

### New York Holds Large-Scale Air Defense Drill

Amsterdam, 7th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports, New York: Last night, air raid sirens wailed in New York City, which was "about to be endangered," anti-aircraft guns fired, and bombs exploded. The city's entire air defense equipment and population were mobilized. The mayor and many citizens ascended skyscrapers to observe the city's first large-scale air defense drill.

### Conscription Ages of Various Warring Nations

England

After the outbreak of World War II and Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration of war against Germany, the United Kingdom unanimously passed the "National Service Act" on September 3, 1939, which was promulgated on the same day, imposing conscription obligations on those aged 18 to under 41. Conscription was implemented gradually for each age group. By the following year, the number of mobilized personnel reached 4.55 million. However, this was only temporary. On January 25, 1941, a conscription order was issued for those aged 18 years and 6 months to 40 years, and in November of the same year, the compulsory military service age was extended to those aged 18 to 51. By January of this year, all those aged 46 had completed registration.

Initially, the minimum age for students was 20, but it was gradually lowered to 19 and then 18 and a half. After the end of 1941, those who reached 18 were immediately conscripted. However, students majoring in science and engineering who were born in 1925 were allowed to extend their studies until completion. Medical and dental students were exempted from military service, and those under 19 were not allowed to be assigned overseas. The wartime system of Great Britain was established on August 24, 1939, due to the "Emergency Defence Act," amidst the perilous atmosphere of World War II. However, due to the provisions for compulsory conscription and compulsory labor being unsuited to the national conditions, the UK hastily enacted compulsory conscription for men aged 18 and over on September 3, after the outbreak of the war. However, in the United Kingdom, which was suffering from a shortage of human resources, the reduction of the conscription age had a significant impact on productivity, leading to increasingly profound distress. In 1940, after witnessing the disastrous defeat of the Allied forces in Belgium, the Netherlands, and northern France, the Churchill Cabinet formulated the aforementioned "Law to Expand the Effectiveness of the Emergency Defence Act," deciding that "the labor and property of all citizens may be used for national purposes," granting the government the power to requisition citizens.

Therefore, due to the National Registration Act (September 5, 1939) and the Industry Registration Order (August 7, 1940), skilled workers aged 21 to 65 were obligated to register. Subsequently, in November 1941, the scope of registration was extended to men aged 18 to 51 and women aged 18 to 40. The government resolutely enforced compulsory conscription of women aged 21 to 31. Later, in October 1941, the registration age for women was extended to 45, and on July 29 of this year, Foreign Secretary Eden announced that the age for mobilizing male and female labor would be lowered to 18 for men and raised to 50 for women. This demonstrates the difficulty the United Kingdom faced in terms of human resources, which pales in comparison to Japan's ample resources.

According to the Military Service Law promulgated on September 1, 1939, men of conscription age (from January 1 to December 31), those who reached 19 years of age, and those who graduated from secondary school and reached 18 years of age, were conscripted into active service, with the term of military service ending at the age of 50. In addition, it was stipulated that doctors and women with special skills, registered with the army and navy and aged 19 to 50, would be incorporated into the second reserve. Since then, no further information regarding the Military Service Law has been publicly announced. According to recent information, due to the intense demands of the war situation, the term of military service has been extremely expanded, with men aged 17 to 55 engaged in direct war affairs.

According to the Labor Law, the age limit for conscription of men is from 16 to 59 and for women from 16 to 54. In order to cope with the recent increase in food production, labor in rural areas has been conscripted from the age of 14, and even girls and boys as young as 12 are being used for auxiliary labor.

Germany

According to the Military Service Law promulgated on March 16, 1935, Germany could conscript men aged 18 to 45. Since then, no amendments to the Military Service Law have been published, but in practice, military training has been implemented for those aged 17 since about last year. The main regulations concerning German labor mobilization are as follows: According to the First Enforcement Order of the Emergency Labor Service Order of September 15, 1939, those aged 16 to 79 were subject to conscription. According to the Student Deployment Order of September 22 of the same month, male and female students aged 16 and over were subject to mobilization during the busy farming season (from May to October). Since the promulgation of the Wartime Labor Application Order of January 27 of this year, German men aged 16 to 65 and German women aged 17 to 45 have been obligated to apply to their respective labor bureaus. Furthermore, according to the order promulgated on January 19 and 30 and implemented on February 5 of this year, the operation of all commercial entertainment venues, hotels, and other luxury goods sales outlets (as well as a portion of furniture, tobacco, and other retail stores) that are not absolutely necessary for national life under wartime conditions has been closed.

### Minister Hirota Talks about the First Anniversary of China's Participation in the War

(Central News Agency) Mr. Hirota, Information Minister of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, gave a speech at the joint press conference of the Army and Navy yesterday (the 7th) on the occasion of the first anniversary of China's participation in the war. According to the report, the 9th of this month is the first anniversary of China's participation in the war. Japan has been fully cooperating with China during this year, and China's declaration of war against Britain and the United States is a valuable expression of China's determination to strike at Anglo-American aggression and to lay the foundation for building a new China. The purpose of the Chinese Revolution is to ensure freedom and independence and to build a new China as a modern nation. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to eliminate Anglo-American forces. Therefore, China's declaration of war against Britain and the United States is to achieve the purpose of the revolution. In this sense, China's declaration of war against Britain and the United States represents a special effort in the war, establishes China's wartime system, and strives to build China and complete the revolution. The current war is not only China's participation but also a war for Japan and the various nations of Greater East Asia. It can also be said to be a war for the various nations of Greater East Asia. If any one of the nations of East Asia, such as Japan, China, Java, the Philippines, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, and India, is subjected to Anglo-American aggression, the countries of East Asia will not be able to exist and should rise up together to defeat them. This was also mentioned in the Great Asianism written by China's Premier Sun Yat-sen. In addition, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration of December 6 last year also clearly announced that the future of China and the destiny of the various nations of Asia should be closely linked. Therefore, China's declaration of war against Britain and the United States can also be said to be a joint war against Britain and the United States by ten billion people of various Asian nations. Since President Wang of the Chinese National Government showed the Chinese people that they would share weal and woe and live and die together with Japan, I have the utmost respect. In the first year of China's declaration of war, the effect was relatively small due to various reasons in preparation. In the second year, I hope that China's efforts in the war will be even more profound. I firmly believe that the current war will determine the world situation of the coming century. The world after the war will be completely different from the world before the war. Therefore, we deeply hope that those who share in the construction of the new world will strive for victory in this war before undertaking the construction of the new world. This year, 1944, is the decisive year for the world war, which has been clearly stated by both the Axis and Anti-Axis powers. On the occasion of the first anniversary of China's participation in the war, I cannot help but look forward to a great development of the war situation this year.

### New Federation to Hold Commemoration Speech Meeting Tonight; Minister of Justice Zhang to be the Speaker

(Central News Agency) Since the Allied Japan launched a war to destroy Britain and the United States, the National Government also declared war on January 9 last year, cooperating with each other and fighting together. The power of the common enemies, Britain and the United States, in Asia has gradually diminished, and the liberation of the nations of Greater East Asia is at hand. On the occasion of the first anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war, both the government and the people are commemorating it. The Shanghai News Federation has specifically scheduled a "Commemoration and Film Convention Celebrating the First Anniversary of the National Government's Participation in the War" at the Majestic Theatre on Gordon Road at 7:30 PM today (the 8th). The newly appointed Minister of Judicial Administration, Mr. Zhang Yipeng, will be invited to be the speaker. The presidium will consist of Yoichi Osako, Xu Liqun, Chen Binhe, Jin Weibai, Huang Jingqi, Yuan Shu, Kyo Moriyama, and Wu Yunzhai. The General Manager of the Convention is Ren Yunpeng. After the speech, the latest Japanese on-the-spot filming of the famous film "Navy" (Chinese name "Angry Seas and Thundering Mines") will be screened to add to the enjoyment.

### Large Quantities of Coal Dust Transported from North China

In this city, the supply of coal briquettes has been affected in recent sentences. Due to the decrease in the source of coal dust, there is a shortage of fuel for people's livelihood, and panic is becoming increasingly serious. The black market prices in the city have soared, and unscrupulous merchants have hoarded goods, making the citizens even more anxious. In order to maintain the security of people's livelihood, the city is implementing coal saving measures, restricting electricity, and implementing coal briquette rationing, and is also making great efforts to dredge up sources with relevant parties. Regarding the coal briquette household rationing issue, it has been decided to ration 7 kilograms (14 city pounds) per person per month. The tenth phase of this month will begin on the 12th of this month, so the wood citizens' fuel can be temporarily remedied. It is reported that recently, relevant authorities have made great efforts to purchase coal from the production areas, and have already reached a certain number of achievements. In recent days, a large batch of coal layers have been transported from North China. The Da Zhong Lian Coal Company will transport the coal dust and distribute it to 19 coal briquette factories in the city to manufacture coal briquettes.

Short comment

### Understanding the Pain of Travel

Mr. Zheng Hongnian, the newly appointed President of China Central Railway Company, hosted various sectors yesterday for greetings after assuming office.

In recent years, transportation issues have been met with considerable dissatisfaction, stemming from poor management, disorder, and the viewing of travel as a painful ordeal. While the China Central Railway Company may strive to cater to public sentiment and seek improvement, these partial remedies offer no benefit to the overall situation and remain far from ideal. The recent re-election of Mr. Hongnian to the presidency is presumably a step towards improvement.

We recognize Mr. Zheng Hongnian as a veteran in the transportation sector, undoubtedly aware of how to manage railways effectively. However, it is crucial that he thoroughly understands the pain and inconvenience faced by ordinary travelers. Improving current transportation problems requires more than just accumulated experience; it demands adaptive methods that closely align with the present situation. To this end, we offer the following three points for Mr. Zheng Hongnian's consideration:

A business-oriented mindset is essential. One must approach railway management with the dedication of running a business to gradually achieve improvements.

You must have the courage of an English actor. After deciding how to improve management methods, you must be resolute and persevere with unwavering courage to succeed.

You must treat the symptoms accordingly. Investigate the actual pain points experienced by travelers, explore the reasons, and implement appropriate countermeasures. Building behind closed doors and partial solutions will never be effective.

Finally, we are aware that the management of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways was optimal and most convenient for travelers 26 years ago, serving as a model for other lines. Naturally, we now hope to see a swift restoration of those conditions.

Economic Commentary

### Official-Civilian Cooperation

Mayor Chen's response to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiries regarding the city government's measures on the price issue can be described as stern and serious, and the phrase "The wartime price problem is not simple. If we want to thoroughly suppress it, it will be difficult to succeed without official-civilian cooperation" is particularly meaningful. Mayor Chen believes that raising prices not only agitates people's minds and affects society, but is simply an act that harms people's livelihoods and disrupts social order. Therefore, the city government has made its greatest determination to effectively suppress the city's prices this time. Alas, we common people, after hearing this news, it is as if we are longing for rain in a great drought!

However, to be fair, the political and legal regulations that govern society are a kind of invisible machine, so we call administrative organizations agencies; the smooth operation of a machine depends on the soundness of the machine itself, and also on something outside the machine itself, like machine oil, to help it. Assuming that the city government and the material control agency are a machine for suppressing prices, then the people's assistance is like machine oil, which makes it easy to turn, without which it is difficult to move. We feel that there should be at least two kinds of machine oil for suppressing prices: one is the moral behavior of merchants, and the other is the thrifty behavior of citizens. The former requires merchants to put the public interest and welfare of society first, not to have the idea of making huge profits, hoarding major commodities, and raising prices without authorization. The latter requires citizens to pay attention to thrift, not to have wasteful habits, and to regard currency as mud and sand, and waste as broken exhibits; it is necessary to have such a double cooperation, then, the price and material control work can be carried out with half the effort and twice the result, so when we talk about suppressing prices, we always need official-civilian cooperation.

### Materials Control Review Committee Investigates the Production of Various Factories and Supplies Fuel to Factories as Much as Possible

Recently, the fuel problem in this city has been a concern to all sectors. Most large and small factories have also gradually reduced their production efficiency due to the fuel problem, which has a significant impact on the future of industry and commerce. The Shanghai Office of the Materials Control Review Committee, in view of this, has recently sent investigators to various important factories to conduct detailed investigations. All factories related to people's livelihoods, such as soap and candles, matches, are included in the investigation. The production quantity, inventory, and required fuel of each factory are all investigated in detail. After statistics are compiled, they will discuss with relevant parties and try their best to help supply them to ensure that the production volume of each factory is not reduced due to fuel shortages.

It is also learned that the Materials Control Review Committee held a cadre meeting at the Hamilton Building yesterday afternoon, and appropriate countermeasures were taken on the issues of cotton disposal and suppressing prices.

The Lunar New Year is Approaching, and the Foundation of Chinese Stocks is Still Stable. A Small Number of Stocks Continue to Rise.

Yesterday, most stocks continued to fall, but the foundation stabilized in the afternoon. Due to the downward trend of the previous day, bargain hunters became active, and the rising trend of a small number of stocks did not wane, so the people's hearts changed from tired to stable. Da Zhonghua Matches is still a target for large investors, seeing a high price of 800 yuan, and then slightly falling back. Tonghui Machinery, which has only been on the market for three days, is favored by  users and has flown up to 12 yuan. The closing price was the highest price of the day; Wuhua Weaving in the textile industry rose by 8 yuan, while Wing On Yarn Factory and department stores fell. The decline in the new pharmaceutical industry and cultural stocks was still slight; although the real estate industry rebounded later, it was difficult to reverse the leading trend; Sanle Industrial was firm, and Jiu'an, etc., saw a small squeeze. Financial stocks were uniformly prosperous, with 17,000 yuan for the mainland, 3,000 yuan for Shanghai, 2,700 yuan for Zhejiang Xing, 1,650 yuan for Jin City, and 1,550 yuan for the salt industry, mostly buying prices. Today's closing table is recorded below.

### Soap, Candles, and Firewood Prices Soar, Authorities Re-register

Since the New Year, the prices of various commodities in the city have soared again, especially daily necessities such as soap and matches. Due to the monopoly and hoarding of illegal merchants, the prices have risen sharply. The price of each box of soap, such as Gu Ben and Scissors, has exceeded the three major levels, and the retail price of each piece has reached more than 20 yuan. The rise in the price of matches is even more fierce. The prices of Phoenix and Beauty brands are approaching six levels, and the retail price of each small box is nearly 10 yuan. As for foreign candles, due to the depletion of inventory and the implementation of electricity saving in various places along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou railway, the prices have risen sharply. It is learned that the authorities in the city, in view of the huge harm to the country and society caused by the soaring prices of daily necessities for the common people, have issued a notice to all soap and candle match retailers and individuals that those who hold inventory should re-register with the competent authority. After this notice was issued, the minds of the general holders softened and they sought to sell. Therefore, yesterday's soap market price turned sharply lower, but the decline in the price of matches and foreign candles was slower.

### Scammed Buying a Woolen Sweater

The other day, while passing through the intersection of the Great World and Stone Road, I walked in front of a certain store, and there was a person with dirty clothes, about thirty years old, who was holding a woolen sweater in his hand and calling out to buy it. Someone asked him if he could buy it for a certain price, and he said no. At that time, I was also next to him, not  , but he looked back at me, and this person asked me if I wanted to buy it. I did not answer, but after his bitter talk, I answered yes. At that time, I watched him wrap it in newspaper, and then said that the price could not be reduced. I said no, and after walking about two or three steps, he shouted loudly whether to buy this thing or not. At this time, I thought that the price that I had already returned could not be not bought, so I handed over the money. Unexpectedly, after a rickshaw puller told me, I pulled open the newspaper and found that it was a package of vegetables. I regretted it too much. The next day, I went to the place again and saw the person cheating others on the sidewalk again.

### Hard Work Troupe Charity Performance to Help Students First Financial Report

The Hard Work Troupe is organized by a small number of drama  comrades with similar aspirations.  It has been giving long-term performances for the Shenbao readers' scholarship, trying to dedicate itself to the stage from the beginning, and fulfilling the long-cherished wish of serving society in practice. Since the  in the Paris Theater, it has been three months. Thanks to the support of enthusiastic people, fortunately, there has been no loss. I am grateful. The charity performance period of our troupe was originally set for half a year, and the profit and loss settlement will also be at the end of the period. Now, due to the business situation, there is a small income, so at this time of the year, we plan to make a preliminary presentation and donate 100,000 yuan in advance to the scholarship,  expressing our excellent sincerity, and briefly presenting the economic situation of the charity performance to the public, and  consider it.

The performance expenses of our troupe were approved by the Shanghai Commercial Savings  Bank, which was requested by the Shenbao Newspaper Office, and another 150,000 yuan was approved. We are also grateful for the bank's special promotion of affection, which only charges the lowest interest rate of 6%. The overdraft has been completely cleared   when "Gentleman on the Beam" was performed.

The purpose of this charity performance of our troupe is to do our best for the scholarship movement. We strive to be thrifty in expenses, and all the income from the performance, except for necessary expenses, is donated to the Shenbao Scholarship. If there is a loss, it will be borne by our troupe, which is also to show the responsibility of the charity performance.
