### Admonition to Those Manipulating Rice Prices on the Black Market

Recently, since the beginning of the month, black market rice prices in this city have been soaring, causing public panic and unease. One of the reasons for the soaring prices is, of course, the delayed allocation of rice, which has led to a sense of panic. However, the formation of the black market is inherently without standards, making it extremely easy for speculators to manipulate, stir up trouble, and add fuel to the fire. In recent years, although there have been various economic factors behind the soaring prices, artificial manipulation, adding fuel to the fire, and the resulting rampant black market have been the biggest reasons for the soaring prices exceeding the scope of economic factors. This is true for rice prices and for commodity prices in general.

Those who manipulate the black market are, in the case of public officials, corrupt and greedy officials. In the case of ordinary people, they are those who pursue extreme profit-seeking. Their intentions are unscrupulous, profit-oriented, disregard the public, and seek only personal gain.

According to intelligence reports, the recent sharp fluctuations in the black market rice prices have been caused by certain unscrupulous elements speculating and manipulating behind the scenes. Given our past experience, we can trust this intelligence. These unscrupulous speculators and manipulators are, of course, pursuers of extreme profit. As the saying goes, "Wildfires cannot burn out, and spring breezes bring them back to life." We painfully feel that the current social environment is too harsh, and there are too many pursuers of extreme profit. Here, we would like to offer two pieces of advice to those pursuing extreme profit once again:

In our editorial on the 12th of this month, we put forward two common sayings: "Don't worry about people not knowing, unless you don't do it." No matter how secret you think something is, unless you don't do it, someone will eventually find out. Therefore, your behind-the-scenes plotting to drive up black market rice prices has already been noticed by keen observers, and people are paying attention to your actions. Be very careful, because when the law takes effect, it will be the time when you are discredited. At that point, can the gold and silver you have obtained from pursuing extreme profit still provide you with enjoyment? Can it redeem your sins? Not to mention distant examples, Gu Shiheng and Zhou Naiwen, Hou Dachun and Hu Zheng, their positions were not low, and their power was not small. You probably look up to them and sigh that you are only small fry! However, Gu and Zhou are prisoners of the emperor, and Hou and Hu are ghosts who have lost their heads. After they were discredited, everyone sneered at them. These lessons should be enough for you to consider! Rein in your horses at the edge of the cliff! Remember!

Secondly, rice is essential to the lives of the masses and cannot be missing for even a day. It is more important than anything else in human life. Shanghai has five million people, and the rice prices in Shanghai are watched by five million men, women, old, and young. If rice prices are manipulated by you, causing the black market to soar, what will be the impression of five million men, women, old, and young towards you? What will they say about you? Although this is invisible, the condemnation of you is more powerful than any tangible sound. This comes from conscience and morality and should be enough to awaken you! Rein in your horses at the edge of the cliff! Remember!

### Ambassador Tani Discusses Increasingly Close Sino-Japanese Relations as New Policies are Gradually Implemented in Tokyo

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) Ambassador Tani, who recently returned to Japan, met with a group of reporters at 4:00 PM on the 17th, and made the following statement regarding the situation after the implementation of the new China policy and future directions: Since China and Japan concluded the alliance treaty last October, the equal and mutually beneficial relationship between the two countries has become closer. At the same time, China has thoroughly understood that Japan has no territorial ambitions. Chongqing, which failed to fully cooperate with Japan, still underestimates Japan's power, which is due to a failure to fully understand Japan's true strength. In addition, the general public, due to the lack of materials and high prices, is concerned with their daily production problems and has not thoroughly understood the relationship between China and Japan. I am confident that this will be resolved soon. In terms of the economy, old and new enemy properties are being returned to China one after another. All state-owned companies are also being actively adjusted. The material problem under long-term warfare is indeed very difficult, especially the issue of material allocation and high prices. This phenomenon is unavoidable during wartime, and insightful people in China understand this very well. In short, the gradual implementation of the new policy will increase the understanding of the Japanese by the National Government and in economic terms. In order to strengthen the relationship between China and Japan, the top leadership of the National Government has reformed the central organs, established a simplified wartime system, and formulated a proposal to reform the provincial and county-level local organs, which is being gradually implemented. At the same time, in order to cope with the price problem, the salaries of civil servants have been increased by five to six times, and measures such as the allocation of cheap rice are being implemented. Politically speaking, China can now be divided into three forces: the National Government forces, the Communist forces, and the Chongqing forces. Because the National Government has concluded an alliance with Japan, it has been working hard to reform political organs, especially the local and police organs, which have been improved to the greatest extent. At the same time, 26 influential figures from the Shanghai financial and intellectual circles have been appointed as consultants to answer government questions and offer suggestions for the implementation of spontaneous policies. It is expected that the implementation of the new policy in one year will achieve the expected results, and it is believed that the relationship between China and Japan will become closer in the future. I will also devote all my efforts to advancing this forward and achieving the desired results.

### Elite Troops of the Japan-India Allied Forces Launch a General Offensive on All Fronts; Enemy Counterattack Near Kohima is Repulsed

Rangoon, 18th (Central News Agency) After receiving new support from the Kuki area, the enemy forces in the Palel area attempted a desperate resistance. The elite troops of the Japan-India Allied Forces, with the cooperation of the Japanese Air Force, launched a general offensive on all fronts at dawn on the 11th. During the battle, large formations of Japanese aircraft heavily bombed Senaam, Andro, Ramkhankuno, and Hill 5815, as well as the enemy's wheeled positions on the south side of the road in that area, inflicting great losses. In particular, the 20th Division's combat headquarters in Senaam was bombarded with heavy bombs like rain, and its barracks and other facilities were hit and caught fire, throwing the enemy's central command apparatus into confusion. Taking advantage of the confusion of the enemy forces, the elite troops of the Japan-India forces immediately began their general offensive. A unit of the Japanese army advanced to the edge of a certain base east of Hill 5185 on the morning of the 12th, pressing the enemy's positions from the south. Meanwhile, the main force of the Japanese army from the Tanknu Bal area heavily bombarded the enemy airfield in Palel, throwing the enemy forces into great confusion. At around 7:00 AM on the 11th, 15 British soldiers, using Gurkha soldiers as a vanguard, attempted to escape, but they were discovered by the Japanese army and completely annihilated.

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from a certain base of the Japanese army on the Indian front, the enemy forces, in an attempt to recapture Kohima, launched an offensive with more than ten medium tanks under the cover of the air force on the morning of the 12th, approaching the Japanese army's strong positions on the Kohima Heights. After being intercepted by the Japanese army, four of the tanks were destroyed. Meanwhile, the Japanese army concentrated its fire, achieving considerable results in attacking the enemy forces on the north side of Kohima (Hill 512) on the 12th and 13th. It is estimated that the enemy forces left behind 210 bodies. The Japanese army captured one enemy heavy mortar and six tanks. On the 12th, more than a hundred British and Gurkha soldiers attempted to infiltrate the vicinity of Narelma and Keseinama, east of Narelma, but they were raided by the Japanese garrison unit on the evening of the same day and routed. On the other hand, 200 enemy soldiers infiltrated the vicinity of Kisuma on the 12th, where they built positions, plotting to advance north to Kohima, but after being strongly attacked by the Japanese garrison unit, they suffered heavy blows and the enemy forces fled to the north. The Japanese army stationed there is now pursuing these fleeing enemy forces and is still encircling them north of Narelma. In addition, the enemy forces that invaded the Bakzumi and Ziguzmi areas are now gathering the remnants of the defeated army in the vicinity, hastily plotting to launch an offensive, and attempting to advance westward with aerial resupply and mortar cover. After being intercepted by various units of the Japanese army, these enemy forces have been doomed to annihilation.

Rangoon, 18th (Central News Agency) The enemy forces' counterattack on Kohima from the Indian side is becoming increasingly fierce, with reinforcements being continuously sent from Dimapur. Three brigades and one battalion are deployed near Hill 7522 near Taosu Ma, and a combined mechanized division and independent tank squadron are concentrated north of Zupsa, launching counterattacks against the Japanese army's positions every day. The counterattack on the 460-mile-high target height was the most fierce. At the dawn of the 11th, after a two-hour artillery bombardment, the enemy forces attacked with more than 20 tanks and armored vehicles. The Japanese army responded with anti-tank guns, destroying nine armored vehicles, repelling the main force of the enemy forces, and then attacking the remaining enemy forces in their southwestern positions.

### Mr. Ba Heng Announces the Mission of the Investigation Team

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) Mr. Ba Heng, the head of the Burmese investigation team, paid his respects to the Japanese Emperor at 10:30 AM on the 18th. At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, he met with a group of reporters and stated the following: When I visited the palace, I was honored to be received by the Emperor and to have a glimpse of his holy appearance. I felt extremely honored. At the same time, I was asked about various issues in Burma, and I am deeply grateful for the Emperor's genuine concern for Burma. The mission of our investigation team is to investigate the facilities for defending the country and the various situations of reconstruction and construction in the countries of Greater East Asia. Currently, Burma is located at the forefront of the Greater East Asia War, and is constantly subjected to enemy air raids. Japan has provided military assistance in this regard. At the same time, Burma has selected promising young people to send to Japan to study, hoping that they will become the backbone officers of the national army. Regarding civilian defense, the Japanese neighborhood association system is being emulated, with ten households forming a unit, and one household as the leader, responsible for firefighting and the rescue of the wounded. Currently, Burma is just embarking on the path of recovery, so it is expected that the advanced countries of Greater East Asia will provide guidance to strengthen national power. This is not only true for the army, but also for the active construction of the navy. At the same time, post-war recovery and construction are also important issues. Therefore, in order to solve the above problems, we have come to Japan to conduct an investigation. The most important thing is to investigate various facilities for completing the Greater East Asia War, so that we can learn from it and form a direction for building a strong country.

### Ministry of Education Announces Two Important Tasks; Receives Chinese and Foreign Reporters Yesterday

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) The Ministry of Education received Chinese and foreign reporters on the 18th, and Wang Yifang, Director of the Social Education Department, explained two important tasks of the ministry: Actively focusing on national health education, it has issued an order to hold sports meets in various provinces and cities. Jiangsu, Shanghai, and North China have already held them, and other provinces and cities are actively preparing. The second meeting of the Physical Education Committee was held on March 15 this year, and the results were satisfactory. For this year's Children's Day, it has been decided to promote the work of children's health and sports centers and has been ordered to comply with it. Currently, children's health competitions are being held across the country. The Ministry of Education has established a Medical Education Committee, which held its first meeting in Nanjing on April 24 this year, resolving to cultivate medical talents. Medical colleges and independent colleges focus on the fundamental issues of quality education. Nationally designated textbooks have already been published, and high school textbooks are being compiled. The printing of textbooks for the fall semester this year has been planned. The seventh edition of junior high school textbooks and the ninth edition of elementary school textbooks are being printed by the China United Publishing Company, which will be completed in three months. Regarding the school system curriculum, a research committee on school system curriculum standards has been organized, which has been approved by the Executive Yuan.

### Communist Representative Lin Zuhan Arrives in Chongqing

Central News Agency dispatches, according to Chongqing news arriving here, reporters from Chongqing and foreign reporters flew to the Red capital Yan'an on the 17th. It is also reported that before the reporters set off, Chiang Kai-shek expressed his hope that they would stay in Yan'an for at least two months to conduct a detailed investigation report on the various criticisms made by foreigners recently on the issue of Chongqing-Communists. The reason is that the United Kingdom and the United States have repeatedly stated to Chongqing that in order for the United Kingdom and the United States to strengthen their aid to Chongqing, the prerequisite must be that Chongqing unifies the domestic battle line and requires the Chongqing Communists to compromise. Therefore, the purpose of this trip of the reporters is actually related to this. Since the beginning of this year, the United Kingdom and the United States have repeatedly requested to send a group of reporters to Yan'an for inspection, but Chiang was afraid that comparing Chongqing under the Kuomintang dictatorship with Yan'an, which has largely formed a political system, would expose his own weaknesses. Therefore, he has not yet agreed. But in the end, it has attracted fierce criticism from the United Kingdom and the United States on Chongqing's dictatorship. Chiang was forced to appoint Wang Shijie as his representative on May 2 to discuss with Lin Zuhan, chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government, the communist representative, in Xi'an to discuss specific measures for foreign reporters to inspect Yan'an, and general issues of adjusting Chongqing-Communist relations. Although the adjustment of Chongqing-Communist relations is still difficult, the fact that foreign reporters can make the trip this time, even if it is said that Chongqing has made concessions, at least means that Chongqing and the Communists have begun to approach each other. Furthermore, after the completion of the talks in Xi'an, Lin Zuhan arrived in Chongqing on the 17th and is scheduled to meet with Chiang in the coming days.

### Economic Bureau Orders All Industries to Register Before the End of the Month

The Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau issued a notice to the industry associations in the city, stating: Since the Bureau began handling industrial and commercial registration, many companies, factories, and firms have complied with the regulations and applied to the Bureau for registration and certification. However, there are quite a few who are waiting and neglecting to do so, which hinders the government's economic policies. All members who have not yet registered for industrial and commercial affairs are required to apply to the Bureau for registration in accordance with the regulations before the 31st of this month. Failure to do so will result in penalties in accordance with the regulations.

### Cotton Product Businesses Should Comply with Regulations for Buying and Selling

The China-Japan Cotton Product Business Federation previously agreed on a draft of the regulations for sellers of cotton products, which must be followed by all members of the industry associations or cooperatives affiliated with the Federation. The main points of the regulations are as follows:

The buying and selling of cotton products is limited to members of the industry and registered goods, and all transactions must be cash transactions with clear delivery on the same day. Futures transactions are not allowed. The nature of buying and selling is divided into two types: genuine needs and false needs. The former refers to those who directly use and consume its substance, and buying and selling should be based on a permit, not exceeding the approved quantity. The latter is to adjust the funds of the industry, which is only a transfer of registration or processing into other cotton products, and does not reduce its substance, and the quantity is not limited. The prices of buying and selling are subject to appropriate restrictions by the association/cooperative, and violators will be suspended from trading.

### Madame Ding Pan's Birthday Celebrations Aid Social Welfare Undertakings

Mr. Ding Mocun, Minister of Social Welfare, has been in charge of social administration for many years, and his merits are well-known. He has devoted much effort to various welfare undertakings. The 24th of this month is the 70th birthday of his virtuous mother, Madame Pan. Upon hearing this, all circles intended to offer their congratulations, but Madame Pan insisted on practicing frugality during this extraordinary period and did not want to make a show of it, so she firmly declined. It is now reported that colleagues in Nanjing and Shanghai have initiated a move to donate the money for the birthday celebrations to the Central Relief Institute, the Capital Nursery, the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund, the News Paper Loan Scholarship Fund, the Vagrant Labor Camp, the Shanghai Relief Institute, the Displaced People's Labor Training Center, the Women and Children Relief Association, and other welfare undertakings as a commemoration, a celebration, and to provide some assistance to social welfare. Cash donations are welcome from all sectors. The collection points in Shanghai are Shen Bao Newspaper Office, News Paper Office, Jin Cheng Bank, and Da Lu Bank.

### US Secretary of the Navy's Remarks Not Worth a Scholar's Smile: Minister Matsushima Discusses the Pacific War Situation

US Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, who met with reporters on the 17th, said when referring to the Pacific war situation: "In the northern, central, and southern parts of the Pacific, US air forces are constantly attacking the Japanese defense line from the Kuril Islands to the Marshall Islands to the Bismarck Islands at any time and place. It has now become nominal. The US Air Force and fleet are currently conducting vigorous operations within this outer line of 1,500 miles. Therefore, the remaining Japanese bases on Truk Island, Ponape Island, and the Marshall Islands urgently need the support of friendly forces from the south." This statement only provides a superficial overview of the current situation of the Pacific War and lacks any new understanding. However, the new Secretary of the Navy made this statement in order to gain public trust, so as to give the impression that the US military is actively engaged in combat. However, from the Japanese perspective, this statement is not worth a scholar's smile. Colonel Matsushima Keizo, Chief of the Press Department of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, made the following criticism when he met with reporters yesterday regarding the US Secretary of the Navy's explanation.

Few Gains for Major Sacrifices

Since the start of the counteroffensive operation in the Solomon Islands in August 1942, in these twenty-one months, the area gained by the US military at any cost is only the outer circle of our defense of East Asia. The US military is now using these bases as a foothold, eyeing the opportunity to break into the Japanese defense line, but this is certainly not easy. Although the US military has seized land, it must deploy strong forces to make the bases functional. The enemy has not yet deployed sufficient forces today, so their position is by no means solid. If the Japanese army rises up once, it will be effortless to regain these places. The enemy frequently launches attacks relying on its material superiority, but the Japanese army remains calm and intercepts them.

Enemy's Weakness is Difficulty in Supply

US Army Lieutenant Colonel Canon Mo has also said that war cannot be won solely by relying on resources. Although the United States boasts of its strong productivity, it still feels that its human resources are insufficient. The recent mobilization of 2 million women in the United States can further serve as proof of this. Conversely, Japan still has ample human resources. Secondly, the more the enemy expands the battle line, the longer the supply line of the logistics station becomes, which causes the greatest weakness. Even if there is a supply base like Australia, it cannot take care of the overall situation of the Pacific War by relying solely on that place. Japan's supply line is shorter than the enemy's, which is a real advantage. The damage caused by enemy submarines to Japanese maritime transportation routes has also been significantly reduced due to the appropriate countermeasures taken by the Japanese Navy.

Confident in the Future of the War Situation

Third, from a military demand perspective, modern warfare is a total war of the nation, and the amount of military production can control the war situation. However, due to the efforts of the entire Japan, the production of aircraft, ships, fuel, etc. is progressing daily, especially aircraft production, so Japan has no anxiety in this regard. When we think in this way, we can understand that Japan has confidence in the future of the Pacific War. The Japanese garrison troops in Truk, Ponape, the Marshall Islands, and other places are still safe and sound. The current lull in the war in that area is due to Japan's careful reorganization of the entire line. Now that the enemy will still launch a desperate counteroffensive, but once the Japanese army is ready, the enemy will suffer a major blow.

### Cotton Control Office Temporarily Still Managed by the Bureau of Commercial Affairs

The Cotton Control Association held a China-Japan committee meeting yesterday to discuss the case of accepting the Cotton Industry Management Office of the Bureau of Commercial Affairs. It is reported that the doubts have ended, and it was decided that the Bureau of Commercial Affairs will temporarily continue to manage it.

### Economic Commentary: The Real Enemy of the Securities Market

Who is the real enemy of the securities market? In a word, it is the speculators in the securities market who "use all means, disregard the public, harm others and benefit themselves, and only seek personal gain." The departure from normality of the Shanghai Chinese Securities Market - the crazy rise and fall of securities prices - can be said to have been entirely caused by these people. They will do everything possible to push up prices when the securities market is booming, regardless of causing chaos, and they will do everything possible to suppress prices when the securities market is shrinking, regardless of harming others. Although the means they take are completely opposite, their goals are the same: to use the sweat and blood of the public to provide for their games and enable them to obtain huge profits.

During the period when Chinese securities prices rose wildly and endlessly last year, we also pointed out the dangers caused by securities speculation. In the current miserable environment where the Chinese securities market has slumped, we must of course also point out the dangers caused by securities speculation. What is the danger this time? It is that the vast majority of well-meaning retail investors in society, who usually rely on securities investment to protect or supplement their lives, have suffered unnecessary losses (because the prices of several stocks have been suppressed by short sellers to less than one-fifth of their asset value) due to the rampant and widespread short selling in the Shanghai stock market, and their lives have been seriously affected. What is particularly noteworthy is that some financial institutions are using stocks mortgaged by others to participate in short selling speculation. This trend should not be allowed to continue, otherwise the entire financial market will perish together. It is hoped that the authorities will severely crack down on it!

### The Shenbao Weekly - The Firm and Unyielding Inner South Seas Fortress of the Japanese Army

Since the US military's invasion of the Marshall Islands at the end of January, the powerful mobile units have appeared in Truk in mid-February, and then attempted actions in the Mariana Islands at the end of the same month. By the end of March, they had even penetrated deeper into the Western Caroline Islands. Their intentions are self-evident. Although they have suffered repeated blows and setbacks, they continue to deploy powerful forces in all directions. Their tenacious ambition and vigorous fighting spirit are certainly not to be underestimated. But what have they ultimately gained from these offensives?

The Japanese army has not been misled by these mobile tactics, but correctly grasps the true nature of the current stage of the Pacific War. It neither overestimates nor undervalues the effects of the US military offensives. Each Japanese base in the Pacific stands resolutely, awaiting the air raids of the US military and its aircraft.

Ocean Fortress - The main force of the US military in the Central Pacific is, of course, mobile units centered on aircraft carriers. Their advantage lies in their ability to move quickly across the vast Pacific Ocean, acting as mobile air bases, and thus being able to temporarily concentrate a significant number of air forces to launch aerial offensives. However, the nature of aircraft carriers ultimately limits them in time. For maintenance reasons, they must return to base after a certain number of days. The US military, attempting to break through the central part of the Japanese Pacific defense line through mobile warfare, must advance their fleet bases and supply bases for the reasons mentioned above. In this regard, the various Japanese bases in the Inner South Seas and Central Pacific, which stand as obstacles to US ambition, are in fact ocean fortresses and are extremely important.

Air Force Fierce Battle - The US military's primary objective in its offensive is to eliminate the Japanese bases' air power. However, due to the inherent limitations of their own base air power, they have had to rely solely on mobile air power. For the Truk Islands, which are within the bombing range of large aircraft, they use base air power for containment bombing. For the distant Mariana Islands and Western Caroline Islands, they repeatedly deploy mobile air power in an attempt to destroy the Japanese base network. In the South Pacific, the US military's mobile air power, which was originally an assistant to base air power, is now taking the lead, challenging the Japanese positions. Thus, the war situation presents a picture of fierce battles between US mobile air power and Japanese base air power.

Fireworks Air Raids - Although air raids carried out by mobile units can concentrate a considerable amount of air power at one time, the results are also temporary and lack continuity. Like fireworks, they explode and disappear in an instant. In the Central Pacific, although the US military has repeatedly carried out mobile air raids, the actual damage they have inflicted on Japanese bases is minimal. Even continuous heavy bombing of Rabaul by the enemy has not been able to stop the functions of the Japanese forward base. Moreover, Japanese transport planes, with thin armament, are able to overcome extraordinary difficulties and take off and land quite frequently. The effectiveness of mobile air raids can be imagined. The fireworks air raids of the US military at most leave some holes on the ground that can be filled.

Digging Their Own Graves - On the contrary, these offensives by the US military are an excellent opportunity for the Japanese army to smash the US "aircraft carrier fleet." The Japanese army's clever tactic of luring the enemy deep inflicts heavy blows on the US mobile units each time. When US aircraft drop bombs with little effect and blindly fire machine guns, their home, where they must return, becomes an easy target for Japanese torpedo bombers. They are, in effect, digging their own graves. Therefore, Japanese bases welcome air raids. This precisely illustrates that Japanese bases are by no means defensive bases, but offensive attack bases.

An air base has the superiority of being an unsinkable aircraft carrier. The enemy's air raid effect is extremely small, and actions such as mobile attacks that do not go hand in hand with conquest are like providing an opportunity for self-destruction. However, whether the Japanese base air power can fully exert its superiority and seize the opportunity to crush the enemy depends on the number of aircraft, the整備of the airfield - base network, and the supply ships that maintain these conditions. It would be a great pity to miss the opportunity to annihilate the enemy due to a lack of aircraft. It is essential to have a complete search plane to capture the enemy fleet's trace in the vast ocean. It is essential to strengthen the attack plane that sinks the enemy fleet with a single stroke. As for the fighter plane that intercepts the enemy plane or guards the attack team, if it only has excellent performance and outstanding skills, it will not be at a disadvantage when dealing with several enemy planes and will not be shot down in air combat. However, it will be difficult if ammunition runs out while shooting down two, three, or four enemy planes. The number of enemy planes that one aircraft can handle has its limit. There is nothing more difficult than fighting a desperate battle with the few against the many in air combat.

Strengthening Bases - The activity of aircraft depends on the整備of the airfield. If one or two airfields cannot be used temporarily due to enemy bombing, it is not a problem if there is a nearby airfield. Furthermore, the number of aircraft that an airfield can accommodate has a certain limit, similar to an aircraft carrier. Of course, the current Japanese bases have not wavered, and are waiting in readiness to strike the powerful mobile units of the US military. However, in order to make Japanese aircraft more effective and to expand the scale of the air force, no matter how many aircraft there are, there will not be too many. The整備of airfields and base groups. For the enemy forces that are mobile in the vast Pacific Ocean, these bases, like a network of organically organized meshes, must be further strengthened. This must be done quickly, and the mechanization of its construction must be promoted. It goes without saying that the vital path of base air power relies on the continuous arrival of supply ships.

Vigorous Fighting Spirit - The US military, which has seriously engaged in the decisive battle on the Pacific front, will certainly repeatedly launch offensives, even if it suffers wounds, and its speed will also accelerate. Therefore, the speed of base combat power enhancement must be faster than that. Leaving aside the actual application of super-large aircraft such as the B29, the advancing US mobile units may attempt to air raid Japan itself. They are also considering various tactics. However, the damage from air raids is minimal with a prepared soul. For the Japanese mainland, which is a large air base, the US military's fireworks-style mobile air raids are an excellent opportunity to uproot and annihilate the enemy. The defense of the mainland lies in maximizing the function of the production base and even the large offensive base. The structure for dealing with air raids is not defensive, but persistently offensive. If this can be done, a vigorous fighting spirit to welcome air raids will naturally emerge.

### The US Military's Troubles in a Protracted War: Sacrifice and Fear of Losing Time

Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 18th

According to a dispatch from a Japanese base on the South Pacific front, the United States is currently struggling in the dilemma of a protracted war, weighing the hope of a short-term conclusion against the terror of large-scale sacrifices. In order to achieve a quick end, they must concentrate their forces, but concentrating forces requires sacrificing personnel. Although the United States is striving to replace the loss of personnel with material resources, when the substitution exceeds a certain limit, the disintegration and imbalance of combat power will follow. Is it to gain time or avoid losses? The two cannot be reconciled, frustrating the politicians in the White House. Therefore, they believe that the most brilliant guiding operational policy that should be adopted at present is to conduct a trial sniper attack in the Central Pacific in mid-March. Nimitz is strategizing in the Northern Pacific, and MacArthur is coordinating in the Southern Pacific, both showing a clear intention to act in unison. Thus, they have repeatedly attacked Japanese fortresses in the Central Pacific, and launched counter-offensive operations in New Guinea and the South Pacific. In late March, they boasted that landing a small number of troops on a small island north of New Britain Island was quite an achievement. MacArthur then announced that "the Bismarck Archipelago operation is completely over." This kind of propaganda is an attempt to cover up the United States' greatest weakness, the extreme fear of depleting personnel, which goes without saying. The San Francisco radio station broadcast that "it is impossible to attack Rabaul from the front sea surface because the human losses are too great." This inadvertently exposed the inside story of MacArthur's statement. Until now, the US military's usual tactics are still like the Solomon Islands, specializing in setting up landing bases in places with few or even no garrison troops. This is just to avoid human losses to a certain extent. The US military is deeply aware that this tactic will not work when approaching the Japanese army's important front line. Therefore, the enemy has had to compete for time with the massive consumption of personnel. The closer they get to the Japanese front line, the more urgently the enemy competes for time to get closer to the Japanese mainland. Their contradiction of fearing both losing time and hurting people is becoming increasingly profound. Although the enemy's leaders are striving to control war-weariness, and even send wounded soldiers from the Solomon Islands and New Guinea front lines to Australia for treatment only, daring not send them elsewhere, various tragic facts, such as US troops panicking and wailing when encountering Japanese attacks, firing automatic rifles randomly, and many US soldiers' lower limbs completely rotting in the dense forests and wetlands, have been transmitted to the United States from various sources, creating an aversion to war among the American people. In the near future, if the enemy attacks the strong Japanese inner defense lines with great force, causing heavy casualties, the world will deeply understand the kind of significant confusion that the direct action of "hurting people" and "competing for time" has brought to the US military's guiding war policy.

### European Fortress in Strict Readiness

The large triangle of 4,000 kilometers in Western Europe, 2,000 kilometers in Eastern Europe, and 3,000 kilometers in Southern Europe - the "European Fortress" - is filled with an atmosphere of "the mountain rain is about to come and the wind fills the tower." The Soviet army's major counter-offensive, which peaked with the Battle of Crimea starting on April 8, has come to an end since mid-April, and it seems to be focused on preparing for future offensives. The Anglo-American air force's aerial offensive is also intensifying in coordination. Its targets are in various parts of northern France and the suburbs of Paris, as well as various parts of Belgium, especially the transportation hub centered on Brussels. Not only are there German rocket-type long-range artillery positions in that area, but US military commentator George Elliott also stated that its main purpose is to make the German army retreat from its forward positions.

A Glimpse of Military Strength - According to observations by relevant personnel, the enemy's invading forces total 30 divisions, with 28 to 30 US divisions, 5 divisions of the Canadian army, Polish exile army, and other refugee armies, totaling 62 to 65 divisions, including 5 airborne divisions.

The details of the German army's interception preparations are unknown. According to British newspaper speculation, there are 150 to 170 divisions. These include 10 divisions in Norway, 15 divisions in Denmark and Poland, 10 divisions in northern Germany, 50 divisions in the French, Belgian, and Dutch areas, 10 divisions in Italy, 10 divisions in the Balkans, and 45 divisions of reserve forces waiting in the homeland.

Fortress Arrangement - The arrangement of the so-called "Atlantic Defense Line" stretches from the North Cape at the northern tip of Norway to the Pyrenees Mountains in the south. Along the 4,000-kilometer coastline, there are 7,700 heavy guns (including long-range guns), 3,000 anti-tank guns, and millions of mines laid at sea. More than ten fortress positions have been built on important coasts, all of which are cement and steel structures, 6 to 10 kilometers long. Between these main fortresses are countless small fortresses, artillery positions, machine gun emplacements, special fire nets, etc. Heavy guns and railway guns can be moved to any location immediately along the railway. Hundreds of thousands of workers sweated for three years to build a solid defense wall 170 kilometers south of the Strait of Dover. The fortress line in Southern Europe connects the Pyrenees, Alps, and Balkan Mountains, extending directly to the Dodecanese Islands.

In addition, Germany has manufactured a large number of new sharp aircraft groups, waiting in underground airports. No matter which side the enemy begins its offensive from - Southern France, Northern Italy, the Balkans, or Northern Europe - the German army is in strict readiness. Opening the second front for Britain and the United States is a great opportunity to seize the initiative of the offensive from the enemy.

### Scattered Memories Like Morning Stars

— Fan Zhenjia

If people cause their parents to grieve, this is truly an unforgivable sin! Whenever I can't sleep at night, I remember my father and mother. I remember when I was a very young child, my mother missed my father who was far away. She would rest her cheek on my head, hold my hands, and gently call me:

"Little Shibao! Good baby! Mother wants to see you when she's lonely. Don't leave your mom!"

But for the sake of life, I left her when I was twelve years old. Sometimes, I imagine her leaning against the window, looking at the moon in her hometown, missing her beloved son who is drifting far away. I also seem to hear her sigh, tears streaming down her face. I also imagine on desolate autumn wind and rain nights, she lights the lamp alone and sits quietly. Whenever I am sick and lying in bed, my head is very dizzy, and I also seem to hear my mother's voice, coming from all directions, gently and lovingly calling me: "Little baby! Good baby!… Little baby! Good baby!..." ×…×…×…×…×…

I also remember my father. He was a thoughtful person. He had deep thoughts and deep eyes.

My hometown is the place where I grew up, and it is always filled with my memories. The small river flowing in front of the door, when spring comes, the spring water rises, carrying green duckweed, flowing, flowing to the endless distance, and the realm where it merges with the sky. In the light moonlight of autumn, it is truly a river of the soul! On early summer mornings, sunlight fills the countryside. The wide fields are covered with purple alfalfa. In the place with many trees, lives Yi Hong, the little girl who was my little lover at that time. Crossing the small stream in her house is the famous Xin Stream. On summer nights, fireflies fly over the river and back, resting on the reeds by the river. How they used to attract me and her!

My father didn't allow me to go see her. We made an appointment to take a walk in the woods, but I secretly ran to give her bird eggs and wild fruits. We sang and walked. One day, my father found out and became furiously angry. He grabbed me and beat me with a wooden stick, regardless of my head, hands, or body. His rude appearance made my mother cry.

"You're hurting him! You're going to beat him to death!…" my mother cried, but my father continued to beat me at will, and said:

"Who taught you these things? Who taught you these things?" My father locked me in a low, old, dirty room for firewood. He himself paced outside, heavily coming; heavily going. But I was sadly crying inside:

"Father!… You beat me!… Father! You beat me mercilessly when you were angry!…"

My father sighed outside the door. Finally, he came and opened the door. He pinched my ear and dragged me to the back of the house, caressing the places where his stick had injured me. They were swollen with red and green. He took his clothes and wiped away my tears, returning to the same loving demeanor as before, perhaps even more amiable. He comforted me and whispered

"Child! Do you hate me?" Hate your dad?" He looked at me like he was begging for forgiveness.

"I don't hate Dad!" I said, crying.

"Silly child! Do you think Yi Hong is beautiful? Are you very fond of her? You're wrong! What makes her beautiful is the money in her family! Her father stripped the poor people of their clothes, and took away their bowls and chopsticks. He himself has become very rich, and his daughter has become beautiful… But, my child, you have things to do. You have to strive, your future, child!… Child!…" I raised my head and looked at my dad. Dad was sitting on a rock. He hugged my head and neck. My face was against Dad's face. My hands were around Dad's chest. My heart and Dad's heart beat together. Then he slowly asked me again:

"Child! Do you still hate Dad?"

"No!" I said: "Dad: Let's hug like this forever." Later, my father left his hometown. The whip of life lashed at him, driving him to a place of hardship. There, his coffin was quietly transported back. His grave was soon chosen by rabbits, and they made holes in it.

I also remember my old maid in my childhood, I called her Grandma Hao. She supported her decrepit, hunched body, working under the stove in the kitchen. She was my grandmother's maid and had been in service for a long time and was aging.

"Grandma Hao!" I said: "Where are your sons? Your daughters? Won't they take you back and give you blessings to enjoy?"

Words like mine were the most upsetting for her. She was such an old woman, desolate and lonely in her old age! Now I realize why the words "son" and "daughter" together form the word "good". But there are also people in the world who cause their parents to grieve.

"After Grandma Hao dies, will you remember Grandma Hao?" she asked me, her heart envying the elderly who had good children.

"Yes! Of course!" I answered casually. This made her smile bitterly, perhaps a sincere smile, the wrinkles on her face becoming even more wrinkled. Later, she fell ill and lay in bed. My mother told me to go to my aunt's house. When I came back, the door of the room where she slept had been tightly closed. I never saw her again. I secretly peeked through the cracks. The room was filled with emptiness, loneliness, and an indescribable terror.

These scenes have been lingering in my heart. I thought: If I don't struggle, don't strive, and die naturally, what will happen to my mother? She will also go to someone's house to be a maid, and then grow old and die with endless secret regrets!

When disease struck, I lay in bed, seemingly seeing the hand of death reaching out to me in the darkness, just like it reaches out to other people, like it reached out to my dad, especially smiling, enticingly saying:

"Come on, come on, give me your pain and other misfortunes!" But then, I heard my mother's voice, and I saw my father's deep eyes.

People! Think about it, when everyone rejects you, curses you, do your parents accept you, comfort you with a renewed expression of energy? When others sneer at you, do your father and mother still love you, using their tears to wash away your misdeeds, their hearts carrying more sorrow than yours?

I am alive, I am striving, I want to comfort my lonely mother, I want to comfort my lonely mother!

Each time, on nights with good moonlight, I think more about the sound of frogs in my hometown. They are croaking in the distance or nearby, and my lonely soul is humming:

"The spring breeze has turned the grass green again south of the Yangtze River, when will the bright moon shine on my return?"

### One Step Further

— Hua Hua

"In all things under heaven, without struggle, there is no success.

In this human world, with a harbor ahead, there is light."

Don't fear setbacks, don't fear difficulties

You should take a step forward and strive hard;

You shouldn't take a step back and hesitate.

Standing on the bright and broad road

are the bitter fighters who opened up the thorns; Living in a world full of happiness

is the result of breaking through the darkness and gloom!

You cannot cower; you cannot be hesitant

### Desert Journey

— Cheng Qi

I am traveling in the desert:

The wind rings the camel bells,

The rain soaks my clothes,

How uncomfortable and frightened I am;

But I have to rush towards my future. I am traveling in the desert. I see no old friends around, nor water, green grass. How lonely and desolate I am! But I still have to rush towards my future. I have driven for so many miles on the endless Gobi Desert and still see no stream. I am dying of thirst! My feet cannot stop, I faint. A drizzle wakes me up. I immediately forget my fatigue and rush towards my path again.

Ah, ahead is a life-saving spring;

I got the nectar, met my savior,

I went mad!

I am traveling in the desert;

Ignoring dust and wind and rain; Regardless of gloomy weather and depression,

I cannot stop, I have to finish my journey!

Discussion of the Story

This is a Manchukuo detective film about a anti-smuggling squad cracking down on a smuggling ring dealing with opium.

The story is intertwined with suspense and twists, but it still maintains a degree of realism. There is a beautiful young woman who, addicted to smoking, has no choice but to fall into a trap, risking her life to obtain a few taels of opium; there are cunning and ruthless criminals who slaughter each other for their own interests; there is a fallen hero who repents, but the day he turns from evil to good is the day he dies; there is a vigilant police officer, Da Gemen, on the grasslands; and a touch of light romance is woven in. Some of the plot points are quite imitative of American martial arts films.

To use a trendy saying, releasing a film with such content during a time when gambling, dancing, and drugs are being strictly prohibited is quite appealing. That's what I thought at first. But after seeing the ending of the story, I couldn't help but feel a sense of absurdity; it turns out that the ultimate purpose of the final showdown, which even left the young anti-smuggling officer Yang Guobao seriously injured, was to rescue a train carrying "government-purchased opium"! The conclusion is truly worth reconsidering. Having clearly explained the dangers of opium at the beginning (in a speech in the film), which must be strictly hunted down, why is there still "government-purchased opium"? Is providing "government-purchased opium" the only way to save those gentlemen who have had their private opium smuggling routes cut off? Then, what exactly does "drug prohibition" mean? Is it prohibiting "smoking opium" or prohibiting "private opium smuggling"? It is easy for people to have such [questions].

Perhaps the screenwriter was limited by the conventions of formulaic stories, and had to use the contrast between "private" destruction and "public" to emphasize that the criminals deserved to die, and to lure them into a trap. But this still cannot conceal the fact that the "government-purchased opium" plot, in addition to inciting anger, does no good; and that they are about to escape abroad, but are willing to escape a little slower in order to vent their resentment, which leads to their being pursued by the police, is extremely unworthy. Even if it is necessary to have the villains caught, it would be acceptable to embolden the smugglers a little, not to escape, or to destroy any other public undertaking (although such a conclusion would not be good either), but why specifically with "government-purchased opium"? What do the experts think? Artistic Achievement

This is the first time I have watched a film from Manchukuo. Although there have been a few that have come to Shanghai before, I am ashamed to say that I have never had the chance to appreciate them. But this first impression is the clever application of many new techniques that are not often seen in Chinese films. This is something that our beloved Shanghai directors should study.

"Counterpoint music," which was already being used in Europe eleven years ago, is still quite a novel thing in China today. When someone is speaking or giving a speech, the camera does not have to be limited to the speaker or the assembly, but can be moved at any time to another place that suits the mood? Clever symbolism, such as blooming flowers (unfortunately, it is not clear what kind of flowers they are) representing love, and wringing a handkerchief displaying inner distress, and falling flowers representing the passing of a pure soul; especially several scenes of description and narration, are simply prose; the many beautiful images accompanying the scenes are adjectives - but they are also as difficult to understand as prose, and almost all require the audience to use their thinking.

The plot is very concise, without the drawbacks of being dragging and repetitive. Especially the ending technique has a lingering sound and charm. But because it is too concise, the adjectival scenery almost all flashes by in an instant, making it difficult for people to understand. Shanghai audiences, who are not used to bringing their thinking brains to the cinema, find it even more difficult to understand. Therefore, it is natural that it is not popular.

As for the dubbing, it is not flattering. It commits the same mistake as most Chinese films, which is inaccurate dubbing, thus creating a dual nature of sub-voice, becoming a soundless movie with pressure, which is really uncomfortable to watch.

I hope other Manchukuo films will give me a better impression.

### Shanghai Open Women's Basketball Championship: The Green Team Has Complete Talent; All Teams Participating in the League Have Improved

This year's Shanghai Open Basketball Tournament included a women's competition, allowing eager warriors to fulfill their long-cherished wish. As a result, as many as five teams participated. After more than two months of competition, the Dahua [大華] team was able to maintain an undefeated record, and the final was held this Monday (the 15th) at the YMCA gymnasium. The Green team lived up to expectations and ultimately won the championship with success in all aspects, with Dahua finishing as runner-up. First, I will describe the final game and comment on the success and failure of the two teams, and then make some post-war feelings.

The Arena is Unprecedentedly Lively and the Battle is Extremely Tense

There was only one final item this evening, and the audience reached more than a thousand people, which is enough to show that women's basketball has been popularized in all circles. It is by no means accidental that it has achieved this result. Both sides had cheering squads to help, with beautiful women yelling, and the lively situation can be called unprecedented. The competition went smoothly, and its spirit is worthy of praise. In the game, Dahua started strong and then declined. They initially had an absolute advantage of seven to one, but the Green team gradually caught up. In the end, they lost due to slightly less experience. The Green team won the championship with a score of twenty-two to fourteen, and became the female champion of this year. But the enemy also cost a lot of effort

The Green Team Has Outstanding Talent, Fierce Attack, and Strict Defense

The Green team's talent is made up of famous generals, and their individual skills are indeed above those of other teams. Moreover, they have the leadership of Xue Chunsheng and the guidance of Qian Xucang and Xie Yiqin, so their strategies in each game are quite handy and easy to maneuver. Talking about their offense, they mainly use blocking methods, use triangular passing to create gaps. Huang Mingyuan's fierce follow-up and Rong Shujian's fierce ball interception, and their short stature, enable them to make low passes. Its X-style attack is indeed powerful. When necessary, they can also use mid-range shooting, which can be said to be perfect. The only thing is that in the final game, they were too eager to win, and they were a little timid. Their signature move, the rapid breakthrough when serving, was not applied properly. It was also due to the importance of winning or losing the Er Biao [爾標] and lead to. As for their defense, they adopted man-to-man and rotating defense methods. The Green team's three guards, Wang Weizhen, Liu Zhenbao, and Wang Yin Guan, were energetic, and their positions and angles were also well applied. Therefore, the results of the series of battles can be called Huaru Ruyi. Unfortunately, in the final game, they were too careful in the first half, which resulted in fewer good constructions and created a dull situation. In the second half, after the guidance, they were able to resume their activity, intercepting the ball and rushing to the front to transport it to the front, which was the main reason for the victory. Finally, the reporter observed that the most commendable thing about the Green team was the use of secret signals, which were extremely pure, effective, and the forwards and guards were able to complete their task. The only shortcoming is that the rotating defense method has not yet entered the hall, and there are a few loopholes.

Green Team's Complete Record Wins Three Provinces 37-16

Wins Overseas Chinese 34-14

Wins Kang'ai 55-11

Wins Liuhua 22-14

Dahua is a Rising Force, but It is a Pity That It Lacks Experience

The Green Dahua team is an emerging team, but with the enthusiasm of the organizer Yang Shuding and the guidance of Yu Juguang and Lu Zhongen, their progress has been rapid, showing high-speed development results, which is not an easy task. I believe that if you give it a considerable amount of time, the Green team may find it difficult to frustrate its edge. I encourage the Dahua soldiers! To discuss the way of offense and defense, it seems that there are many changes in its various battles, but in the final battle, it absolutely adopted the blocking method. Dao deeply knows that the Green team's guard is using man-to-man, and the man-to-man guard is most afraid of the blocking method. In the beginning, it was quite effective, and there was a way to attack. Unfortunately, it was a flash in the pan. Later, because they only knew the blocking method, and the other party had changed their strategy, they still stuck to their original intention and failed to make a sudden change in the battle. This is the lack of experience. It is a pity that it failed in the end, isn't it a pity? Dahua's defense is a three-person joint defense, which is to save physical strength and wait for work, and stop the enemy's front from rushing into the bottom line. The success of applying this method is that the Green team could not maneuver freely in the first half of this battle. It is a pity that it has always been like this, without any change, so it lost the right to win the ball invisibly, which also reduced its own offensive. San Dongque milk used its tall stature to prevent the Green team's sharp attack. However, the fierce breakthroughs of Huang Mingyuan and Rong Shujian were indeed powerful, which led to frequent fouls. In fact, it is impossible to take care of both, it is not a crime of war. Therefore, Dahua's defense has achieved the point of three-eight joint defense, but it is a pity that there is no change at all. Moreover, it is quite felt that the team should know how to overdo it and try long shots in the last quarter, which may be able to revive it. However, its consistent style is a mistake in quality. Finally, the team has a very obvious shortcoming, that is, the forward and the guard lack a point of contact, and the guard has a lack of clear understanding of the position (center line limit).

The League Ended Successfully and I Had Four Thoughts

This year's women's league has ended, and I can't help but have thoughts every time I participate in the viewing.

The participants in this event were the Green Team, Da Gehua Overseas Chinese Three Provinces Kang'ai Five Teams. In the process of the competition, each team has made great progress in each game, and the fun seems to be increasing. It can be seen that women's basketball can obviously have a vigorous atmosphere. Therefore, I think the authorities can try to hold a separate women's competition in the near future. The enthusiasm of the participants and the excitement of the players will surely exceed expectations. It is not necessary to wait silently for this day next year, which will allow the athletes to have fewer opportunities to learn from each other.

The five teams that participated in this event have good guidance, do their best to train during normal times, encourage and teach strategies before the game, and allocate the battle. This should be the best phenomenon in the game. The participants in this event all understand that the game is not necessarily a war of players, but it is indeed a war of guidance. Therefore, I hope that all the teams in Shanghai should have good guidance, then the level will definitely be improved.

The rules adopted for this women's competition are American rules, with the center line crossing the boundary restriction, which is based on women's physiological relationship and should not be too intense. However, considering that there is no restriction on women's rules in the world, and looking at the style of the women's army in this competition, I really agree that it is possible to try the men's rules, so as to have the power to exert its influence without restriction. Moreover, it is found that there is no distinction between men's and women's rules in North China and South China, and there has been more progress in the art of playing. Therefore, I think it is possible to try it in Shanghai. What do you think of the predecessors of the physical education?

In the final game, when the two teams tried to throw the ball, the Green team adopted a cross-shaped pass, which was beautiful and practical. Dahua also applied the basic front-guard try-throw, which is more preferable than the ordinary casual try-throw. In this kind of secret, all the abilities to come out of the box and win are the most effective way to improve the level, which is worthy of praise and emulation.
