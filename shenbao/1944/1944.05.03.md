### Enhancing Scientific Education

Tokyo Dispatch: Based on previous decisions regarding school reorganization guidelines, the Japanese Ministry of Education will complete the reorganization of government-run schools. Furthermore, it is preparing to reorganize private universities and higher vocational schools nationwide to establish a wartime structure. This includes reducing enrollment quotas in liberal arts programs and strengthening science and engineering programs to meet the needs of scientific warfare. Additionally, on the Emperor's Birthday, the Japanese Emperor awarded cultural medals to six university professors, four of whom had achieved exceptional results in natural science research. The Japanese government's attention to science, simultaneously training future talent and rewarding pioneers, is creating a national atmosphere that values scientific talent and believes in scientific knowledge, which is truly admirable. Japan's promotion of modern science did not begin earlier than China's, but due to the unified attention from both the government and the public and the widespread promotion of education, in just over seventy years from the Meiji Restoration (1868) to the present, significant scientific achievements have been made, and the nation has embarked on the path of modernization as a result. These are all practical and clear lessons for those of us who talk about "catching up."

Scientific talents need to be cultivated and protected. The place where scientific talents are cultivated and protected is scientific education institutions. How to enhance scientific education institutions is therefore the most important issue at present. Our only suggestion is very simple: establish more independent colleges. We do not want to see many "all-encompassing" and "hugely organized" universities during this wartime state. We only hope to have many specialized colleges with "simple organizations." We also hope that our ally, Japan, will provide us with more assistance in terms of equipment and faculty.

This proposal hopes that the government will make every effort to utilize existing production facilities or enemy-owned production facilities that have been taken over to establish colleges. On the other hand, we hope that industrialists and entrepreneurs will voluntarily request the cooperation of university professors and students, formulate plans according to the nature of their own businesses, and assist in the advancement of a certain subject or a certain part of it. For example, in the case of the textile industry, although production is not easy to increase under the current difficulties of raw materials and power, the enemy-owned yarn factories managed by the Enemy Property Committee of the Ministry of Finance and the yarn factories run by the Chinese themselves are at least the foundation of the textile industry. These foundations must bear at least two responsibilities: one is the production of materials, and the other is the cultivation of talent. Utilizing this equipment can at least set up a textile college. Professors can use this college to do advanced research and train new talents. Material difficulties are temporary; the existence of the nation is permanent. The wartime state will surely end. When everything returns to normal, if the country wants to revive and rebuild but cannot find talent, that would truly be a national disgrace. Moreover, even during the war, the establishment of research institutions can concentrate scientific research talents and engage in solving all the material problems caused by the war. Allied nations like Japan and Germany have made astonishing achievements in scientific research. When there is no gasoline, they invent oil extraction from coal; when there is a shortage of nitrogen raw materials, they invent nitrogen extraction from the air. Everything, everything, can only be solved through scientific research. Countless industrial and commercial enterprises in China can cooperate to create this long-term plan for cultivating talents.

The cultivation of scientific talent is the most urgent matter for China at present. If China wants to become a modern country in the future, if China wants to stand alongside advanced countries in the future, there is no other way but to embrace science. To make China scientific, we must first have talent. Therefore, the foundation of China's nation-building in the future lies in how to advance China's scientific education.

### Great War Results Obtained by Japanese Forces in Southern Sea Area of Caroline Islands; Three Enemy Ships Sunk and Twenty-Three Aircraft Destroyed

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 2nd: On the night of April 27th, Japanese air units launched an offensive against an enemy task force off the western coast of Hollandia, sinking one enemy cruiser and destroying one large warship (believed to be an aircraft carrier). On April 30th, an enemy task force appeared in the southern sea area of the Caroline Islands and attacked Truk Island on the 30th and May 1st, shelling Torok Island on May 1st. As a result of the counterattack by the local Japanese air units and ground defense forces, one enemy aircraft carrier was destroyed and 23 enemy aircraft were shot down.

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The enemy US forces are aggressively attempting to attack the Japanese strategic location in the central Pacific, the Caroline Islands, repeatedly bombing Truk and other islands almost daily. On the one hand, they are assembling a task force in the Marshall Islands area, waiting for an opportunity to invade. Until the 21st of last month, they once again dispatched more than ten aircraft carriers and battleships, attempting a risky attack on the Caroline Islands. On the 30th of last month and the 1st of this month, they used naval aircraft to bomb Truk Island, and on the 1st, they also shelled Torok Island with naval guns. The Japanese army, navy, and air force units in that area have established a strong defensive posture to prepare for an enemy attack. At this time, they received information that an enemy task force had appeared and immediately launched an attack, immediately destroying one enemy aircraft carrier and shooting down more than thirty enemy aircraft. After the Japanese forces' courageous and fierce attack, the enemy task force eventually collapsed and retreated.

### Landing Enemy Troops Suffer Blows

Furthermore, on the morning of the 22nd of last month, an enemy force of approximately one division landed near Hollandia and Aitape in New Guinea. Later, they gradually increased their forces, a message that has already been released by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters. In order to coordinate operations, the enemy task force has been attempting to invade the New Guinea area since the 22nd of last month. On the night of the 27th, Japanese air units ambushed the enemy forces, sinking one enemy cruiser and sinking one large aircraft carrier with a torpedo. Since the enemy troops began landing on the 22nd, the Japanese forces in that area have been receiving information about the enemy's presence, but because of the bad weather, the attacks have been difficult, so they have been waiting for an opportunity. On the 27th, the weather cleared, and as the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced, the Japanese air units bravely took off, achieving great war results on the western coast of Hollandia that night.

### Retreating Enemy Forces at Palel Attacked by Japanese and Indian Forces; Imphal Overwhelmed with Casualties

In addition, Japanese heavy artillery and infantry units cooperated to launch a fierce artillery attack on the enemy's Palel barracks and airfield northwest of Palel. As a result, the barracks and airfield caught fire on the 29th. At the same time, another unit emerged on the eastern side of the road from Palel to Imphal, seven kilometers northeast of Palel, and launched a fierce artillery attack on the enemy forces retreating north, causing confusion. The enemy forces in Imphal have been cut off from external support since March 28th, when the Japanese forces cut off the Kohima-Imphal highway near Mithub, relying solely on air supply to prolong their survival. They are currently anxiously struggling under the north-south pincer attack of Japanese and Indian forces. Since the attack began on March 8th, the enemy's Fourth Corps has suffered more than 30,000 casualties, and the streets of Imphal are now filled with casualties.

### A Perspective on the Constitutional Issue in Chongqing

— Jiangnan Hermit

Chongqing's allowance for the Chinese people to establish a constitutional government within one year after the end of the war, broadcast on April 29th, was heavily promoted throughout the country, along with reactions to it. The broadcast first mentioned the news reported by the Central News Agency, then summarized various responses to the draft constitution. The gist was: "From the beginning of this year to today, in these past few months, we have collected reactions from all over the country regarding the draft constitution. The replies received from various locations number no less than two hundred."

The broadcast stated that these replies indicated that the people were extremely concerned about national restoration during the war, and therefore elicited much praise. Finally, it summarized the people's attitude in the following three points: The Three Principles of the People should be the foundation of the constitution; the basic idea of the constitution should be for the welfare of the people and the nation; and respect for the constitution should deeply permeate the people and become a habit.

We do not want to criticize the jokes made in Chongqing's broadcast when analyzing current events, but there are several points that are worth noting by those concerned about this issue.

Results of Seeking Public Opinion

The Chongqing broadcast said that it sought opinions from all over the country; it also said that their replies showed that the people were extremely enthusiastic about this and fully understood their true intentions. But in fact, only two hundred replies were received from a population of over four hundred million, which does not seem to be very satisfactory!

Another peculiar thing about this report is that the deadline for replies was May 2nd. However, Chongqing's broadcast, without waiting for the deadline, analyzed and reported on the contents of these reply letters three days in advance.

It would naturally be very good if Chongqing's broadcast could, as they say, collect opinions from all over the country. But frankly speaking, our impression is quite the opposite - that the reaction did not come from the whole country, and that Chongqing officials were playing tricks there.

The Issue of Constitution-Making

Further logical research leads us to another fact: although the issue of constitution-making in China has been discussed for several years, and although a constitutional government has been promised time and time again, it is still just a blank check.

In 1931, China entered the period of political tutelage, and she began to prepare to establish a government in accordance with the national constitution. By the following year (1932), the National Government allowed the organization of a National Assembly three years later (1935) and the establishment of a constitutional government. This was in fact a ridiculous move, because given the national conditions of China, how many people had received early training in constitutional politics? However, the people deeply believed this promise. Then, in 1939, a similar thing happened again. The Sixth National Political Council held its Fifth Plenary Session, raising the issue again, and decided that "on November 12, 1940, a People's Assembly would be organized, the constitution would be promulgated, and a constitutional government would be officially established."

At that time, this issue - the central issue of Chinese politics! - sparked an even greater discussion, with the fiercest debate between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. But despite all the discussion, in 1940, it was announced that it would be postponed indefinitely.

At last year's Eleventh People's Political Council, the issue was raised again, and it was decided that "a constitutional government would be established within one year after the end of the war." And from this year onwards, Chongqing mobilized every propaganda machine under its command - newspapers, magazines, radio - to heavily promote and let the people know what kind of treatment they would receive when the constitutional government was finally established.

The Background of Constitutionalism

What we want to study here is the political background of Chongqing's allowance for the formal establishment of a constitutional government in China. Because in fact, China's domestic situation and the political training of the people have not progressed to the point where they can implement this step.

Let us briefly review China's recent history to explain. From 1932 to 1935, the Kuomintang encountered several dangerous situations in its struggle with the Communist Party. In February 1934, Commander-in-Chief Chiang went to Nanchang to direct the Kuomintang's slogan of "70% Politics."

Around that time, the issue of a constitutional government was revived. In a sense, it was a strategy to reverse a failing fate. In other words, the Kuomintang leaders recognized that the Communist Party was expanding its influence by using a policy of open politics.

In 1939, the Chongqing regime felt that it had to make the same promise again. They felt that they had to strengthen their economic management, concentrate their political power, and increase their weakening resistance. To do this effectively, they had to mobilize the people of the whole country. But the masses were already tired and expressed an attitude of stubbornness, so the Chongqing leaders raised the banner of a democratic government, planning to mobilize the people to engage in a long-term war.

Today, we see the recurrence of past history. Chongqing is promising a constitutional government again - this time one year after the end of the war - but this time the end of the war is still far away - not to mention that the people's spirit has already turned away from Chongqing.

The more time and space Chongqing spends on the constitutional issue, the deeper Chongqing's domestic disputes are. Knowing this situation makes one even more interested in Chongqing's repeated analysis of the constitutional issue.

### First District Economic Office Adopts Comprehensive Rationing System; City Food Bureau to Gradually Implement as Well

In order to suit the wartime system and conserve manpower and resources, the Economic Office of the First District Public Office of this city has adjusted its original material rationing methods and adopted a comprehensive rationing system, which will be implemented starting this month, in order to streamline the rationing of materials and ensure the thoroughness of the organization. At the same time, the City Food Bureau will also gradually implement this comprehensive rationing system. The details are as follows: The First District Public Office's Economic Office currently handles the rationing of seven items: rice, flour, sugar, cooking oil, soap, matches, and coal briquettes, all of which are essential daily necessities for citizens. In the past, the allocation of items was categorized,

Adopting a New System to Conserve Resources

and issued based on household tax tickets and household registration at designated issuance points. However, with so many categories and different forms, the issuance process became cumbersome, and citizens found it easy to lose the tickets. There was a need for a new adjustment. Therefore, the Economic Office, in order to conserve manpower, resources, and time, has repeatedly discussed and decided to implement a comprehensive rationing system starting this month.

New Permits are Extremely Convenient to Use

The comprehensive rationing system involves issuing a single consolidated permit for the seven major rationed items managed by the Economic Office, replacing the previous individual permits. Each full sheet contains 30 tickets, numbered from 1 to 30, without specifying the item to be rationed. After receiving this permit, citizens only need to refer to the district office's announcement to find out which numbered ticket can be used to purchase which item. They can then take the appropriate numbered ticket to the designated retail outlet to purchase the rationed item. For example, ticket number 1 is for rice, number 2 for cooking oil, number 3 for sugar, number 4 for soap, number 5 for flour, number 6 for matches, and number 7 for coal briquettes, and so on. This is done without prior specification, making it extremely convenient and easy for citizens to use and store. It also eliminates the cumbersome process of issuing permits frequently. A full sheet of permits can be used 30 times, saving manpower, resources, and time.

Re-Registering Retail Shops

In order to implement this comprehensive rationing system, the Economic Office has re-adjusted the registered numbers of all designated retail outlets, including rice shops, tobacco shops, dried goods stores, and coal briquette shops. The retail outlet numbers for each type of store are completely identical within the same district. Therefore, the retail outlet numbers marked on the comprehensive rationing permit are also pre-assigned. Citizens can purchase rationed items with their permits. For example, if ticket number 1 is for rice and the retail outlet number on the ticket is 100, then they can purchase rice from rice shop number 100. For ticket number 2 for cooking oil, they can purchase cooking oil from oil shop number 100, and so on for coal briquettes, soap, matches, etc. All of these retail stores have been adjusted to be in neighboring areas, so citizens do not have to worry about traveling long distances.

New System Implemented This Month

This sound, streamlined, and comprehensive rationing system will be implemented by the First District Public Office Economic Office starting this month and will be distributed to citizens for use. However, all previously issued item-specific rationing permits will remain valid until they are completely used up. The comprehensive rationing permits do not specify the item, so all original rationing permits for rice, flour, oil, sugar, coal briquettes, matches, and soap will be used up first before the new permits are used. Citizens must not misunderstand this, lest they suffer unexpected losses. The City Food Bureau will also adopt a gradual implementation of this comprehensive rationing system for the four items it rations: rice, flour, oil, and sugar. However, the bureau has already printed a large number of permits for oil, sugar, rice, and flour. If the new system is implemented immediately, these permits would inevitably be wasted, resulting in a significant waste of resources, which would defeat the purpose of conserving resources. Therefore, a gradual implementation system has been adopted.

### Allied Powers' Extraterritorial Rights to be Abolished This Year; Justice Minister Zhang Announces

Minister of Judicial Administration Zhang Yipeng met with reporters from various newspapers in the city at the ministry's Shanghai office at 10:30 AM yesterday (the 2nd) and expressed his confidence and thoughts since taking office, as follows: "I have been in office for three and a half months. Today, I am expressing my confidence and thoughts since taking office and welcome your criticism and corrections. When I took office, I stated that I would serve for six months. Half of that time has now passed. Recently, I have not been able to sleep well due to difficulties in my work, resulting in right-brain pain and swelling in my cheeks. For health reasons, I may retire before June, but I have not yet decided. Before leaving office, I will not slacken in my duties this year. Therefore, I am confident that I can report the following points regarding the work I have done in the past three and a half months:

Prisoner Food Rationing

Regarding the prisoner food rationing issue, I have contacted the Rice and Food Control authorities several times. As a result, I have received four months of rationed rice and food from January to April. The prisoner food rations for November and December of last year and January and February of this year were not received and had to be purchased on the black market to maintain prisoner food supplies. Therefore, the four months of rationed rice and food received can be carried over to the next two months. As a result, there are no issues with prisoner food supplies during my term. Regarding the personnel issues of the courts and prosecutor's offices, the personnel adjustment plans for the three provinces and one city of Shanghai, the capital, and Jiangsu are nearly complete. Hereafter, I will pay close attention to the handling of cases by judges and prosecutors in the three provinces and one city, reviewing case files at any time and personally examining whether there are any errors in the handling of cases.

Rectifying Prisons

Regarding the rectification of prisons and detention centers, prisons and detention centers can be divided into two types: new and old. The new ones have been undergoing rectification, while the old ones in various counties cannot be rectified. The facilities of the Shanghai Prison are fairly complete. For example, the position of head of the prison security section has been abolished. The abuses in detention centers are greater than in prisons, especially the high mortality rate among sick inmates. For example, 40 to 50 people died in February, and 30-odd people died in March. On the one hand, medical expenses are being subsidized by donations from the community, and efforts are being made to increase the number of doctors. The mortality rate has already been reduced significantly. Sick inmates suffer from malnutrition and lack of exercise, so they are prone to death after becoming ill. Arrangements have now been finalized with the Guangci Hospital to provide over a hundred beds for the treatment of sick inmates, which should benefit them. I have personally reviewed serious cases to see if there are any improprieties in the cases handled by the courts. Former Minister Luo responded to the request of the Allied Powers and established a laws and regulations revision committee and a consultancy, hiring Allied personnel as consultants. Mr. Kureta Masuki, recommended by the Japanese Embassy, ​​is a consultant, and I have asked him to revise the "Wartime Rent Special Law" and the "Wartime Civil and Criminal Special Laws."

Inspect North China

Recently, I will take a plane to inspect judicial administration in North China to prepare for the unification of judicial administration in North China. A judicial agreement was previously signed with North China, which is scheduled to be officially implemented in October this year. The Allied governments and embassies have stated that they have decided to abolish extraterritorial rights in the second half of this year. Civil and criminal cases involving Japanese residents will be handled by our courts. However, according to international private law, national law will still apply to inheritance law and family law. Therefore, judges have been assigned to specialize in the study of these laws to establish specialized judges to handle civil and criminal cases involving Japanese residents. Preparations are currently being made. Reporters from various newspapers then raised various questions, which Minister Zhang answered satisfactorily, and he left at 11:30 am.

### Methods for Supplying Household Rice Should be Improved; Answers to Questions at Reporters' Regular Meeting

The City Propaganda Office held its 13th regular press conference at the City Hall yesterday. The answers to the questions raised by reporters from various newspapers are recorded below:

Household Rice Delivery Delay

The Zhonghua Daily asked: The 67th installment of household rice in the first district began to be sold on April 21st. However, the announcement from the authorities was ambiguous, stipulating that either white rice, brown rice, or glutinous rice could be purchased. The general public had no way of knowing what kind of rice the rice shops received. As a result, the rice shops distributed brown rice to the citizens. If they wanted to exchange it for white rice, they had to exchange it at a 70% discount. The illegal profit was considerable. This move was tantamount to the authorities giving rice merchants the opportunity to engage in corruption. I remember that the Business and Trade Association made a suggestion a month ago to distribute white rice for household rice. Even if there was brown rice among the purchased rice, if it had to be used for distribution, it could be distributed at the same time after a full installment, and the announcement should state this to prevent malfeasance. Yuan Ludeng, chairman of the Rice Control Association, also expressed his approval and sent a letter to the responsible authorities to urge them to improve the situation. The words are still ringing in my ears, but now the situation is the same again, which is really puzzling. Please have the relevant authorities respond to this. At the same time, the announcement said that the installment of household rice would be sold on the 21st, but so far, all the rice shops have said that they have not received it. Please also provide a clear answer as to whether there are any other circumstances in this matter, in order to emphasize official regulations and reassure the people.

The Economic Office of the First District Public Office answered: The household rice distributed by this office is purchased from the Huazhong Rice Distribution Combination on a general voucher, and then a distribution voucher is issued to each rice retail outlet. In other words, this office only handles the vouchers, and the goods do not pass through it. Therefore, this office has no way of knowing in advance whether the rice is white rice or brown rice, as there is no detailed note on the general voucher. It will not be known whether it is white rice or brown rice until each retail outlet receives the rice. If the Rice Control Association can specify in detail whether the civilian rice supplied to the Huazhong Rice Distribution Combination is white rice or brown rice, then this office can report to the public based on the information; otherwise, this office has no way to change it. It is regrettable that some rice shops are illegally profiting by exchanging brown rice for white rice at a 70% discount. We hope that all sectors will work together to report this to this office, and we will investigate and deal with it according to the law to eliminate malfeasance. At the same time, this office will also order all rice shops to post a notice in front of their stores stating the quality of the rice in order to avoid ambiguity and fraud. The reason for the delay in the distribution of the 67th installment of rice was due to the delayed delivery of goods by the Huazhong Rice Distribution Combination, and its vouchers were submitted to this office in batches, so the distribution vouchers issued by this office had to be delayed accordingly. In the future, if the Rice Control Association can pay attention to improving the supply methods, especially the quantity of rations, and can supply them fully as scheduled, then this phenomenon can be avoided.

Nightclubs Operating Past Hours

The Shanghai branch of the Central News Agency asked: Nightclubs in western Shanghai continue to operate beyond the time stipulated by the authorities, and although they have been repeatedly fined, they remain stubborn. I wonder how the authorities will crack down on them to maintain the authority of the law?

The First Police Bureau replied: The police bureau has four measures to deal with nightclubs that operate beyond the stipulated hours: 1. A written warning for first-time offenders; 2. A fine of up to 5,000 yuan for repeat offenders; 3. A suspension of business for up to ten days for third-time offenders; 4. Revocation of the business license and forced closure for fourth-time offenders. Nightclubs in western Shanghai, such as the Faluns, Ivantage, etc., have been repeat offenders, so they were recently suspended for ten days. There are also two other establishments that have exceeded the stipulated operating hours for the fourth time, and we are preparing to close them down according to the regulations.

Rationed Items Also Rising in Price

The Pingbao Daily asked: Prices are rising wildly and endlessly. The authorities are trying to suppress prices to alleviate the suffering of the people. Why have the prices of rationed items recently increased instead, such as the price of oil rising from 20-odd yuan to 50-odd yuan, the price of matches rising from 1 yuan to 3 yuan, and the price of price-controlled cigarettes tripling? What is the reason for the price increase of these rationed items?

The Economic Bureau replied: The price of matches this time has risen from 1 yuan to 3 yuan per small box entirely due to cost factors and was determined by the relevant authorities after consultation. The distribution of oil and cigarettes is not handled by this bureau.

### Kureta, Consultant to the Laws and Regulations Revision Committee, Arrives in Shanghai

Dr. Kureta Masuki, consultant to the Laws and Regulations Revision Committee of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, arrived in Beijing from Japan at the end of last month to take office. In order to handle official business, he took a plane from Beijing to Shanghai at 2:30 PM yesterday.

### Economic Office Reaffirms Previous Order; Goods Must Be Priced

In order to stabilize prices, the relevant authorities of this city have stipulated that all retail stores must mark the price of each item displayed in the store. These labels must be placed in a prominent location and must not be marked with hidden codes. However, as time has passed, some have become lax. In order to maintain the stability of the prices of all goods, the Economic Office of the First District Public Office has reaffirmed its previous order that all businesses must mark the price of each item, each dozen, or each unit for all goods sold. These labels must be written in Chinese or Arabic numerals. The Economic Office has instructed the trade associations of each industry to inform their members accordingly.
