### Certain Victory Politics

— Tokutomi Sohō

What the people desire most is peace of mind. Peace of mind means trusting the authorities. Just as Confucius said, solving the food problem and the military problem to gain the trust of the people, maintaining peace and order under any serious circumstances, and serving with peace of mind—if these three are not in place, existence is impossible. This is the most appropriate motto for today.

Lord Takeda Shingen was a great statesman who gained peace of mind from the people. This was because people believed, "Working under Lord Shingen is absolutely reassuring. There is no worry about robbery or enemy soldiers, and it is possible to live well and safely." Lord Shingen's greatness as a statesman lies in this point, and not because he implemented rent reduction and tax exemption policies. His slogan was: "People are the castle, people are the wall." Other warlords built castles, but he made ships and did not build castles. But this is not an easy thing to do. House rent, corvée labor, annual tributes, etc., were certainly quite harsh, but the people did not see it as a hardship. Everyone regarded him as the general manager or director of a company, and were very at ease. When a politician reaches this point, they can graduate. I hope that today's politicians can experience a little of his political psychology.

Today's politicians are making a big mistake if they do not investigate what the people want. Politicians who grasp the needs of flowers and trees will water them when they should be watered, fertilize them when they should be fertilized, prune them when they should be pruned, and weed them when they should be weeded; and just as doctors understand the needs of patients, they can then understand the true meaning of politics. There is a definite rule in politics: one must thoroughly investigate the psychology of the people, and one must act according to the rules. If one does not know the psychology of flowers and trees and still waters them on rainy days, then the flowers and trees will be in danger of being waterlogged. (But there are times when flowers and trees are watered on rainy days.) This is because one has not thought about the relationship of politics. Whether it is for the country on a large scale, or for a town or village on a small scale, it is all necessary.

Lord Shingen was a very studious person. After each war, he would always gather his family for self-reflection, just like a post-exercise critique. This is what made him extraordinary. Marshal Tōgō was also such a person. The reason why Japan won every battle was because it studied the gains from the previous Battle of the Yellow Sea. Initially, he wanted to use parallel tactics, but he completely changed and implemented T-shaped tactics. People generally say that this may have been the opinion of his staff, but Tōgō once told me, "I came up with it myself."

Although it is said that grasping the hearts of the people is very important, it is sometimes impossible in a world where materialism is all-powerful. When work stops, the gold-almighty method is used to win people's hearts with money, but this is not without limits. Let me give an example: in the Philadelphia factory, a strike occurred due to wage issues, and a large number of troops were dispatched to intervene. In Lloyd George's book "War Memoirs," their weaknesses are described. What truly makes people act is not money. Shingen's family member, Yamagata Saburōhyōe, was a very loyal person, but he did not hope for wealth or glory. When he heard that family members of the same rank in neighboring countries had three or four times more stipends, he was not moved at all. "Saburō's Diary" also mentions that Ōkubo Hikozaemon's stipend was only 3,000 koku. In stark contrast, Tachibana Hida-no-kami betrayed his master during the Battle of Sekigahara, but after returning, he received a stipend of 100,000 koku. Ōkubo Hikozaemon certainly said many dissatisfied words about his master, but he never betrayed him. This is because his master, Ieyasu, constantly praised him for his "hard work and great merit," and he was satisfied spiritually.

In recent years, people often talk about "eating one's fill." Originally, people cannot work on an empty stomach. If one is hungry but does not feel it, it is only temporary. Once or twice is not a problem, but if this continues, one cannot go to war. But there are two kinds of "eating one's fill": one is filling the stomach, and the other is filling the spirit. Akechi Mitsuhide went over to Nobunaga's side, only gorging himself, not stopping until he was bloated. He held castles and fiefs in places like Sakamoto, and people generally thought that he would wholeheartedly maintain his loyalty. Even Nobunaga thought that he had become a parvenu who would not rebel even if he was beaten and scolded. However, due to spiritual dissatisfaction, he finally turned around and bit his master. Lord Shingen knew this very clearly, so he allowed people to eat their fill in terms of stomach and in terms of spirit, and achieved unity from top to bottom, which is what is meant by "people are the castle, people are the wall."

The government often says that it is enough to make the people eat their fill, but if this is true, then the children of wealthy gentlemen should all become outstanding sages. Looking back at the facts, haven't many great men come from poor families? This fact completely refutes the idea that everything will be fine as long as you eat your fill. It is the result of spiritual effort that makes people great. Just as there is a Chinese saying, "A hungry belly produces strange plans," but if the hunger has passed, then the strange plans will not necessarily turn into bad plans, so it is still good to eat just enough.

It is a big mistake to think that we should use a lot of resources to deal with the enemy because they use a lot of resources to deal with us. Why did Japan achieve such great victories at the beginning of the war? It was because they had long ago arbitrarily assumed that they had abundant resources, but Japan's resources were not large. If Britain and the United States jointly made a threatening gesture, then Japan would definitely submit. That is to say, they believed too much in resources and looked down on spirit. However, Japan neglected resources, rose up in anger, and achieved great victories at Pearl Harbor and off the coast of Malaya. Of course, we cannot say that resources are not needed, but what we rely on is exploiting the enemy's erroneous strategy. They believed that Japan could not win even if it fought for a hundred years. As people generally say, essence and spirit are one. Filling both the stomach and the spirit is necessary in any situation. Of course, resources must also be sufficient. If there is a shortage of resources, then it is absolutely necessary to supplement them with spirit.

Once the will is determined, it doesn't matter whether you fight outside the door, at the door, or even inside the house. The point is that as long as you beat them to a pulp, that's fine. Japan doesn't have to particularly climb mountains and wade through water. It is such a blessing from heaven to be able to wait at ease for the enemy to tire themselves out. Therefore, our current task as Japanese people is to uphold our belief in certain victory and to strike blows. The longer we fight, the stronger we become. They are a paper tiger, and they will be finished as soon as it rains. Therefore, they are attacking with all their might during the period when it is not raining. They are not human beings, but animals. They believe that if they don't strike quickly, they will be trembling with fear inside. Whether victory or defeat is determined by a long-term war or a short-term war depends entirely on the extent of the Japanese people's perseverance.

The main thing is to unite matter and spirit, to consider the satisfaction of both spirit and resources, and to move forward. When the spirit is exhausted, replenish it. It is enough to replenish it to the point where the enemy cannot take advantage of it. Japan's greatest weapon is not airplanes or tanks, but endurance, the replenishment of spirit. If we can endure, then even if the enemy can force their way forward, the closer the enemy gets by an inch, the closer our Japanese victory gets by an inch. So there is no need to panic, but to be calm, and only to strike the enemy. I hope that everyone will be determined to have this spirit.

### German Army Group on the Border - Preparing for a Decisive Battle - Anti-Axis Powers Strengthen Diplomatic Encirclement

Berlin, Central News Agency Dispatch, 26th. The armistice treaty concluded by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union with Romania has been signed. Since the 23rd, the Romanian army on the Iasi front has ceased resistance. The Soviet army advanced 150 kilometers southeast in one day on the 23rd, and its mechanized units have broken into a corner of the new border of Outer Transylvania, as defined in the Vienna Award. It appears that they intend to cut off the retreat route of the German army east of Iasi. Therefore, the German army in that area is now in danger of encirclement. However, this unit has strong combat power, and with the cooperation of the German army from the Hungarian side, it is not difficult to break through the Soviet encirclement. The Romanian coup regime is said to have recognized the border line of the Vienna Award, and it is possible that the Romanian army will occupy Outer Transylvania, Hungarian territory according to the Vienna Award. The Hungarian government also has this prediction and is concentrating its main forces to strengthen diplomatic encirclement, aiming to end the European war in a short period of time. As this trend gradually becomes apparent, the diplomatic situation is extremely urgent. After Romania's defection, the bases for bombing Germany are closer than those in Italy and France, which is actually unfavorable to Germany. However, the German High Command had long incorporated this attempt by the Anti-Axis forces into its plans and transferred large forces into German territory, determined to continue resisting. Therefore, the various situations mentioned above do not have any major impact on the fundamental strategy of the German army's operations.

### Chongqing Attempts to Conceal Continuing Defeats

Central Shanghai News. The fall of Hengyang was a severe blow to Chongqing. The Chongqing authorities are still concealing the fact that the military commander and others surrendered. This can be clearly seen from the memorial services for the fallen soldiers of Hengyang held in various places. Recently, in order to reverse the decline in public morale and the psychological fatigue of the war, they have been heavily promoting the operations to recover Hengyang and the counter-offensive operations in Hubei. They also claimed that after the Japanese army withdrew from Myitkyina, the Chongqing army would soon advance on the Burma front.

Lisbon, Central News Agency Dispatch, 26th. According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing military authorities announced on the 25th that a part of the Chongqing army had recently launched a counter-offensive in the Yichang area, with the aim of easing the pressure from the Japanese army in Hunan.

### Balkan States' Trends - Turkey

Beijing, Central News Agency Dispatch, Huitong Agency Report, News from Istanbul: The Turkish Cabinet held a meeting yesterday morning. Prime Minister Laçoglu… Central News Agency Dispatch, According to Ankara: The Turkish government has decided to recall its ambassador to the Vichy government, Mr. Yerien.

### Bulgaria

Berlin, Central News Agency Dispatch. According to Sofia: Bulgarian Prime Minister General Bagryanov, Foreign Minister Draganov, and Army Chief Lieutenant General Luyev held an important meeting the other day.

Sofia, Central News Agency Dispatch, 26th. After the severance of relations between Germany and Turkey, the Soviet army immediately attacked Romania. At the same time, the Bulgarian Prime Minister also issued an important statement. The military and political situation in the Balkans seems to be undergoing great upheaval. In short, Bulgaria maintains an alliance with Germany on the one hand, declares war on the United Kingdom and the United States on the other hand, and also has increasing conflicts with the Soviet Union due to its Slavic heritage. The direct cause of this evolution is the change in the war situation between the Axis and Anti-Axis powers. Bulgaria's current situation is like a candle in the wind, and its only hope is that the German army can reverse the war situation.

### To Rescue the Critically Endangered Nation - Engage in Labor Service - Leader's Address at the Graduation Ceremony of the Life Camp

Nanjing, Central News Agency Dispatch, 26th. The New National Movement Youth Summer Labor and Life Camp held its graduation ceremony on the afternoon of the 26th. Acting Chairman Chen attended and presided over the event. The original text of the leader's address is recorded below:

### Mental Labor and Physical Labor Are No Different

"At the graduation ceremony of the second session of the New National Movement Youth Summer Labor and Life Camp, all the students braved the hot weather and came from all over to the life camp to receive rigorous training, and every day they have to go to the farm to do labor service. This spirit is truly commendable.

There used to be a saying that 'those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their bodies are governed by others,' dividing mental labor and physical labor into two classes, 'one above and one below. This is really a feudal-era concept. There are many reasons for our country's weakness, but this point cannot be said to be one of the reasons. It must be known that although the departments of intelligence and physical strength are different, the gains of labor and the gains of the mind are no different in their contribution to the nation and the people. Moreover, without a labor consciousness, no matter how one labors with their mind, it is impossible to survive in today's world. What's more, since the war, our country's production has been devastated. If the whole country does not invigorate its spirit and catch up quickly, the future of the nation will be even more unthinkable.

### Unite and Advance to Liberate East Asia

The holding of the New National Movement Youth Summer Labor and Life Camp is aimed at the above-mentioned phenomenon, with labor service as the training center, aiming to cultivate the students' habits of labor service life and take on the important mission of increasing production. Therefore, in addition to ideological training and military training, we should also emphasize skills training. I have already said this at the graduation ceremony of the last session, but all the students should always remember that the main purpose of our current labor service is to rescue our critically endangered nation. Therefore, we are engaged in labor service not for personal gain, but for the welfare of the nation, for the liberation of East Asia. It is not something that can be accomplished by individuals doing it piecemeal. We must unite and advance with one mind, in order to rescue the nation from this extremely difficult situation and liberate East Asia. This labor and life camp selects outstanding youths from all over to live together, live the same life, do the same labor, abide by the same discipline, and establish the same central idea. This is precisely to concentrate our will, enrich our strength, and combine the wisdom of all to seek the survival of all.

### Increase Production Through Labor to Protect the Nation

Our country was originally an agricultural country. Before the war, our country's food supply was insufficient. The rice and wheat imported through customs every year accounted for a large proportion. After the war, the fields were deserted, and bandits roamed rampant, further reducing production. Therefore, people's livelihoods were difficult and could not be addressed. At present, we cannot delay the work of increasing production, and modern warfare is total war. In order to cooperate with the Greater East Asia War, it is even more necessary to increase production. Practicing labor service to protect the nation is not an empty slogan. When we are engaged in labor service, we must recognize that increasing production, enriching national strength, and developing national power are the main goals. Only by enriching national strength and developing national power can we complete the mission of restoring China and share the responsibility of defending East Asia.

The urgently needed training at present is a key point of the New National Movement work this year. During the summer vacation, there are similar organizations in the central government and in various places, which are naturally very necessary. Due to various reasons such as transportation and equipment in the central government, the total number of students in the first and second sessions is only over 200. There are still many youths across the country who hope to receive this kind of training but have no opportunity to come to the central government for training. We hope that starting with you comrades, after leaving the camp, you comrades will spread this spirit to various places, creating a trend so that the youth of the whole country, the people of the whole country, can conscientiously engage in labor service and take on the work of enriching national strength and developing national power. I think if we can achieve this goal, China will definitely be able to be restored, and East Asia will definitely be able to be liberated. You comrades have received training for three weeks. Although the time is short, the responsibility is extremely great. The day of graduation is the time when work begins. I hope you will be brave and vigorous, diligent and hardworking, and unite with the youth of the whole country to shoulder the mission of the times for the restoration of China and the defense of East Asia."

### The Teigor Tank Division Enters Paris, Fierce Battles on the Banks of the Seine

Central News Agency, Berlin, 26th - Huitong News: In the past 24 hours, fierce battles have erupted between the American tank vanguard and German troops in the central area of Paris, including the Luxembourg Palace and the Arc de Triomphe. Armed civilians are also assisting the American troops. After fierce battles with the German army, the anti-Axis armored forces broke into the Paris urban area via Versailles and Cergy in the west, and via Étampes and the Paris highway in the south, resulting in intense street fighting. The anti-Axis forces are supplying weapons to civilians to resist the German army.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 26th - German News: The battle for Paris has begun. The Teigor Tank Division, using American equipment, invaded the city on the night of the 24th, causing fires in several places. Thus, the French capital, which had been protected by the German army for four years without damage, is about to be destroyed by the French themselves. Before the enemy troops invaded, thugs under the instigation of the British and Americans had already caused significant damage to the urban area. The German defense forces have established positions in the city center, and the German commander, Trierte, has refused to accept the enemy's request to surrender. The great battle in the Normandy region northwest of Paris is still ongoing, and the German army is still fighting fiercely with the enemy according to plan to seek a way out. Southeast of Paris, the enemy has established a bridgehead in the Melun area on the opposite bank of the Seine. At least six American divisions are attempting to occupy the army knot area between the Han River and the Yonne River. There is still war on the Brittany Peninsula in Brest, Saint-Nazaire, and Lorient. Fierce street fighting has occurred in Marseille and Toulon. The purpose of the joint attack on these two ports is to cut off the retreat on the circuitous front.

### Police Bureau Cracks Down on Two Opium Dens in Nanshi, Continues to Eliminate Opium and Drugs in Nanshi

The Judicial Department of the Municipal Police Bureau, guided by the National Government's anti-drug order, established a narcotics investigation section to specialize in the investigation and crackdown on opium and drugs in the urban area. Recently, it was found that there were still secret opium dens in the Nanshi area, providing opium and drugs for customers to smoke. The relevant branch bureaus were ordered to warn them to close down. However, some unscrupulous people took the opportunity to falsely use the name of the section to solicit protection fees from opium dens, claiming to bribe the authorities. The authorities were very angry when they learned about the situation and immediately sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation. It was learned that the owners of the Hongyuan Opium Den, Du Chao, and the Fuxing Opium Den, Bian Zucai (alias Bian Zhongli), were responsible. At 6 pm on the 25th, the head of the narcotics investigation section was ordered to lead detectives to search the Hongyuan Opium Den at 123 Luxiangyuan Road, Nanshi, and the Fuxing Opium Den at 38 Luxiangyuan Road. The Hongyuan Opium Den was large in scale, with more than a dozen rooms. Thirty-eight opium smokers, including Chen Guoshi, were arrested on the spot, along with 23 opium pipes, 18 opium bowls, 17 opium mouthpieces, two large boxes of opium tubes, and a large number of opium paraphernalia. The Fuxing Opium Den had three rooms, and 28 opium smokers, including Xia Chenshi, were arrested, along with six opium pipes, eight opium bowls, and other paraphernalia. All the people and paraphernalia were taken to the bureau for interrogation. However, Du and Bian were not arrested because they were not present. The section has issued an order to all branch bureaus to investigate and arrest them. After the investigation of the arrested opium offenders is completed, they will be handed over to the district prosecutor's office for investigation and prosecution.

### Firewood Prices Soar, Unified Purchase and Sale Imminent

Recently, firewood prices in the city have suddenly soared. Although there are many reasons for this, the main reason is speculation and hoarding by unscrupulous merchants. Taking firewood as an example, its price has exceeded the evaluation price by 20%. The authorities, in view of this phenomenon, cannot allow it to persist and have decided on a unified management method to curb firewood prices. The implementation will involve centralized purchase and sale of firewood. First, all businesses will be ordered to register the quantity of firewood they purchase, designate wharves for loading, and the Central Market will send personnel to supervise and manage the purchase and sale in a unified manner. The prices will also be determined by the evaluation office to prevent manipulation by unscrupulous merchants. It is reported that this method has been submitted to the Standing Committee of the Municipal Government and will be implemented in the short term. Also, according to the Central Market's evaluation of firewood prices for the second half of this month, which was announced as follows: Chestnut firewood 800 yuan, poplar firewood 640 yuan, pine firewood 750 yuan, rice firewood 450 yuan, bean chaff 700 yuan, elm firewood 720 yuan, mulberry firewood 640 yuan, miscellaneous firewood 700 yuan, flower chaff firewood 640 yuan, wheat firewood 360 yuan.

### Shanghai Anti-Smoking Hospital Begins to Admit People Who Want to Quit Smoking

The Shanghai Anti-Smoking Hospital of the Health Department was officially established on the 21st of this month and has now begun to admit people who want to quit smoking. Anyone who voluntarily wants to quit smoking can directly contact the registration office of the hospital at 190 Chezhan Road, Nanshi, to go through the admission procedures. In order to reduce the burden on those who want to quit smoking, the hospital only charges 300 yuan per day for food, and all other medical and pharmaceutical fees are completely waived. If someone is extremely poor, they can further reduce or waive the food fee with proof from the local Baojia. It is reported that the hospital will soon admit people aged 20 to 30 who are sent by the Anti-Smoking General Bureau of the Ministry of Interior. The number of beds reserved is limited, so smokers in this city are encouraged to voluntarily go to the hospital to quit smoking as soon as possible and not to delay and wait.

### New Registered Bicycles, Vehicle Licenses Can Be Issued Next Week

Citizens who have newly purchased bicycles and have not yet been issued licenses by the Vehicle Registration Office of the Public Works Bureau, according to the person in charge of the Public Works Bureau, "The bureau has run out of the original bicycle licenses and needs to add new licenses for use. However, the manufacturer has not completed the production due to a shortage of raw materials, which has delayed the registration of vehicle owners. This is true. After strict negotiations with the manufacturer, the licenses can be delivered by Saturday this week. From the 28th of this month (Monday), they can definitely be issued. New purchasers must bring their invoices (or other proof documents) and fill out an application form at the vehicle registration office under their jurisdiction to register and issue the license."

It is also reported that if this measure achieves good results, it will be adopted at any time in the future.

### Domestic Urgent Parcels, Will Be Accepted and Sent Next Month

The Shanghai Postal Administration recently issued an order from the Shanghai Office of the Postal General Bureau that domestic "urgent parcels" will be opened on September 1st of this year. The regulations are as follows: Any items that can be sent as parcels according to the Postal Regulations can be sent as "urgent parcels." When sending domestic "urgent parcels," the sender should indicate "urgent parcel" on the parcel cover and related details form and may add two black lines to distinguish them. Domestic "urgent parcels" should be charged double the fee for domestic "ordinary parcels." (The handling fee does not need to be doubled and is the same as domestic "ordinary parcels"). When transferring and handling domestic "urgent parcels," all post offices, whether at the sending, transferring, or receiving bureau, should give priority to them over all other ordinary parcels. The handling of domestic "urgent parcels" is temporarily limited to the lines operated by the China Central Railway Company. (The railways between Shanghai and Nanjing, Nanjing and Wuhu, Pukou and Xuzhou, and Shanghai and Hangzhou) and post offices of all levels along the railway from Xuzhou to Lianyungang (agencies will postpone handling them). Domestic "urgent parcels" cannot be sent to bureaus that do not handle this business. All chapters and regulations in the Postal Law and Postal Regulations regarding domestic parcels apply to domestic "urgent parcels." The unified control of money will still be handled according to the original regulations.

### Flour Less Than One Bag, Can Be Moved Freely, Outside the Control Line, the Original Rules Still Apply

The Shanghai District Flour and Noodle Distribution Office, ordered to draft the Shanghai District Flour and Noodle Movement Handling Rules, because Article 2 stipulates that Grade A movement certificates are required for more than 10 catties of flour (applicable to household flour), which has caused inconvenience for most citizens to purchase and receive household flour. It is now learned that in order to facilitate the purchase and transportation of household flour, the office has consulted with the relevant authorities and modified the flour movement method. Anyone moving less than one bag (44 catties) within the control line does not need to apply for a certificate and can pass freely. If it is moved in from outside the control line, in order to prevent the occurrence of the black market, the original regulations will still apply.

### Important Information About Air Raid Defense

Preparation Under Alarm

Some people think that it is enough to engage in the work of alarm at the time of the issuance of the alert alarm, and at this time do not have the thought that the air raid alarm will continue to be issued, that is, once the air raid alarm is issued, they will start to engage in air raid measures, which must take a considerable amount of time, so when the alert medical report is issued, thinking that there is still considerable time before the air raid alarm is issued is a very wrong concept that should be corrected. Also, it should be noted that sometimes after the issuance of the alert alarm and the air raid alarm, a sudden air raid is encountered, and an air raid alarm is issued in an instant, sometimes it can immediately become an air raid alarm posture, and an air raid posture, so it should also be prepared in advance.

Implementation of Lighting Control

Lighting control must still be actively implemented in the future. Even a slight leakage of light can guide enemy aircraft, so it should be properly shielded. In addition to checking family members, neighbors should also share responsibility and check for light leaks to avoid unexpected misfortunes. Because a very small amount of light leaking due to carelessness will not only cause damage to oneself, but if the enemy drops incendiary bombs, it will inevitably cause a fire and obtain materials for judgment, so lighting control should be strictly observed. The outline of implementing lighting control: At the time of the issuance of the alert alarm, some residual lights can still be left, but at the time of the air raid alarm, the lights should be turned off immediately. However, when the residual lights are dimmed, the responsible persons of the neighbors, members of the fire prevention group, members of the Baojia group, etc., should be responsible. Of course, during an air raid alarm, if the lights can be completely hidden, even if the lights are not turned off, it is acceptable, but this should be thoroughly and strictly implemented. If the lights are completely hidden, but there is still light leaking, it is necessary to thoroughly inspect the lighting control materials at this time. At the same time, for the sake of complete safety, except for necessary lights, all other lights should be turned off.

Completion of Shelters

During an air raid, in addition to being directly hit by a bomb, if you can hide in a trench about ten meters away from where the bomb lands, you can avoid being injured. From this point of view, it is necessary to set up a complete shelter, which should be set up underground in principle. 1. When setting up outside, if there is a place where collapsing objects may fall, such as near the 着前, and there is no cover, it is dangerous. If there is no way, it should be covered with 被等. In this way, when bricks and tiles fall, some damage can be avoided. 2. When setting up indoors, an exit must be built, and if possible, there should be a device in the trench that can break through and come out from below when the house collapses. 3. When building an air raid shelter, pay full attention and select a suitable location. It is impossible to dig a trench underground, so it can also be on the ground. However, at this time, use soil or a wooden frame filled with soil as a cover, which is necessary because when an air raid encounters a landmine bomb, it can stir up a lot of soil and sand, and to prevent the falling of fragments of anti-aircraft artillery shells. Cover with two or three inches of rough wood on both sides of the hole, each about a foot high, and place wooden boards or soil on top of it. When hiding in an uncovered shelter, you must cover your body with quilts, etc. When building a shelter, try to limit it to one that can accommodate a small number of people so that the damage can be minimized when directly hit by a bomb. Also, the distance of building a shelter should be as far apart as possible. This trench should not only be used by family members, but also by passersby

Prevent the Spread of Rumors

When enemy aircraft attack, in order to prevent espionage, the following points must be paid special attention to: It is extremely dangerous to reveal careless words with half-knowledge and ignorance of the truth, so it should be strictly avoided. Writing about the damage caused by air raids in letters is enough to cause the spread of rumors, so you should pay full attention, trust the announcements of the authorities, do not lightly believe in unfounded rumors, and strive to eliminate the spread of rumors. When air control has become a reality, we should move away from formal basic training and adopt training that adapts to actual combat so that we can exert the greatest effectiveness in an emergency (end). Don't underestimate the meaning of unity and collectivity

### Reader Scholarship News, Children Sympathize with Children, Don't Underestimate the Meaning of Unity and Collectivity

The occurrence of human sympathy is, after all, the most natural instinct. We have more clearly confirmed this from the flourishing scholarship movement. There are many examples, too numerous to mention. Yesterday, we received a letter from all the fifth-grade students of Runhua Elementary School, initiating a one-day saving of candy money to raise 1,000 yuan to donate to the scholarship fund. The original two said: "Dear Sir: We are all fifth-grade students of Runhua Elementary School. The first lesson in this year's textbook is "A Girl Who Can't Read." After reading it, we all deeply feel that it is very painful not to be able to read. At the same time, we also feel that we are very happy. During this summer vacation, we also have the opportunity to take remedial classes, which makes us sympathize with many good students who have dropped out of school. Therefore, we initiated a one-day saving of candy money, and everyone gathered to donate to your newspaper as a scholarship fund. Although it is only a small 1,000 yuan, we think that if every school in Shanghai, every grade has 1,000 yuan to donate as a scholarship fund, it must be a considerable amount! Gentlemen, you are serving the ancient students, we wish you good health here. The fifth-grade students of Runhua Elementary School together." Although the amount of the subsidy is not large, the sympathy of the children is very valuable. Moreover, it is especially rare that the children can jointly initiate savings for scholarships and the meaning of unity and collectivity. If this meaning can be expanded and enlarged, the future of education will be promising, and the future of the country is even more expected. Don't underestimate it!

### Various Schools Set Up Free Enrollment Quotas

Nanyang Hospital is responsible for the health rubber check for the students of the elementary school group of this newspaper who receive assistance. The schedule has been arranged by this newspaper, and the checks will be carried out daily from yesterday (the 25th). Please make sure that the students go on the scheduled date. Also, for the sake of seriousness, it is best for parents to accompany them, because the knowledge of elementary school students is still childish. If there are parents nearby, the hospital will be more likely to understand when explaining or guiding health, which will be of great benefit. In order to avoid crowding, the hospital has slightly advanced the check-up time. It can start at 1:30 pm every day. Please pay attention. Yesterday's Scholarship Received

### Steel-like Air Defense Factories

The enemy, having occupied Saipan, is now attempting to invade Guam. One hundred million people, conserving their energy, are holding back their breath, suppressing the raging fire in their hearts, and desperately producing weapons for revenge. But the arrogant enemy, attempting to destroy our Japanese "revenge blades," has begun bombing Japanese factories. Although Japan is being subjected to air raids, there is absolutely no question of stopping production. However, if the factory's air defense equipment is not complete, there can be no hope of increasing production. ... Not long ago, the police department issued to all factories under its jurisdiction "Essential Points for Emergency Improvement and Strengthening of Factory Air Defense Capabilities." Of course, without waiting for government urging, they are being reorganized into air defense positions like copper-iron battleships that are not at all afraid of air raids. "Let the enemy come if they want!" But production will never be hindered by this. Three factories that express this strong determination: Japan Optical Manufacturing, Hitachi Precision Machinery Factory, and Nakajima Aircraft Factory. Now, let's temporarily examine them. Below is how to learn about the production air defense methods of air defense factories.

### Japan Optical Manufacturing

It has been a long time since the slogan "Air raids are inevitable" was loudly proclaimed. This Japan Optical Manufacturing is the first to be completed. As for the air defense equipment of this factory being so complete, it must be said that it is due to the enthusiasm of the fifth-generation factory director, Mr. Godai. Mr. Godai walks around the factory, and whatever he deems necessary for air defense equipment, he instructs to be implemented. The birth of the protection team was also after the start of the Greater East Asia War. The protection team acts according to the director's intentions, and now it has achieved good results.

The first thing that catches the eye is that the factory is fully equipped with light-shielding facilities everywhere, so that there is no obstacle to working under air raids. Now it is closed from the side, but it will be further modified to be completely　　 from top to bottom. In addition, the shelters are underground rooms fifty meters long and three meters wide, which can accommodate two hundred and fifty people. There are also sixty covered shelters that can accommodate from one person to ten people, and shelters made of sandbags are built in each workshop. In addition, there are twenty simple indoor shelters in workshops for those who remain in the workshop to carry out fire prevention and firefighting. Among them, what the manufacturing plant emphasizes is bulletproof equipment. In each workshop of the factory, in order to protect important machinery and various equipment, the earthen walls and sluice gates are packaged with wooden boards and iron plates to form bulletproof equipment. If there is "have something to rely on and not be afraid" bulletproof equipment, you will feel the safety of production under real air raids. In addition, the headquarters of the protection group and the air defense surveillance station are firmly protected by thick bulletproof walls. When implementing this air defense facility, how was the material and labor that were lacking dealt with? This most serious problem is inevitably encountered by any factory. The materials from old buildings that were evacuated nearby are used. As for labor, it is provided by all personnel within the manufacturing plant—especially those in administrative positions. Thirty to forty people per day form a labor service team, desperately building bulletproof walls and digging shelters.

Due to the resourcefulness of materials, the self-sufficiency of labor, and the expertise of factory executives, these three promote each other, and two air defense facilities have been completed. This is an example of how to clarify that there is no reason why air defense facilities cannot be completed.

### Nakajima Aircraft Factory

The director of Nakajima Aircraft Factory, Mr. Ando, ​​has made a final decision and resolutely reorganized air defense facilities. According to the labor and materials provided by factory employees, this facility must be prepared no matter what. All employees who responded to the director's enthusiasm carried shovels and began digging air-raid shelters. Although the director is an old man of sixty-one years old, he also set an example and desperately dug air-raid shelters. In addition, female employees each brought cloth from their homes, and in a flash, they sewed several sandbags. Then they removed non-essential items such as the ceiling of the cafeteria and the wall panels of the corridor, and the bulletproof equipment project was completed immediately. It started on July 13, but thanks to day and night labor enthusiasm, hundreds of shelters and bulletproof facilities to accommodate all employees were completed in just two days. Thus, overcoming the shortage of materials and labor, a great accomplishment was achieved in factory air defense facilities.

### Hitachi Precision Machinery Factory

Hitachi Precision Machinery Factory officially prepared for factory air defense since July 1942. At that time, experts were hired from the castle construction headquarters, and they completely obeyed their orders, instructions, and intentions. From February to March 1943, using the materials on hand, facilities such as bulletproofing, fire fighting, lighting control, shelters, poison prevention, and outlook were built. However, the special feature is lighting control. If a warning alarm is issued, the bells of each factory ring together, and in less than 0 minutes, this huge factory with a circumference of 0 kilometers completely disappears into the shadows in an instant. In order to achieve this result, the factory erected several standard-type roof vertical parts, that is, on the glass part of the skylight, about two-thirds of the outside is 　in black, and the inside is 　in white, and the remaining one-third is hung with a black　, with a large wooden frame placed on it. Usually and during the day, it is lifted, but when an alarm is issued, all the windows in the factory close at the same time. But these countless windows. It has already been stipulated who is responsible for shading　. On all the windows there is a wooden sign with a person's name, writing the black curtain and shading work. If you pay a little attention, you will know the thoughtfulness.

In addition, all the electric lights in the factory are surrounded by a two-foot black cylindrical air defense cover. In the past, 300-candlepower light bulbs were all changed to 100-candlepower light bulbs, which is also sufficient. At the entrances and exits, in order to illuminate the partial lighting, all are covered with a metal object. (Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun on July 26)

### Equatorial Scenery - Life in Sumatra

— Kanezo Yano

Because I heard that going to the tropics requires good health maintenance, before I set off, I asked people who had lived there and read some books about tropical life. It is said that you should not eat sashimi (raw fish) in the south, you should not drink alcohol, and you should not drink cold water. In short, you should pay attention to your diet. However, later I did not follow any of these three prohibitions.

The sashimi in Padang is very delicious. I drink it with Indian Ocean sea bream and pomfret every night. The Indian Ocean coast has warm currents and sandy soil, and fish breed very abundantly, and the meat is also very fresh and delicious, but the fish tastes a little worse along the coast of Malacca because there is a lot of muddy ground. In addition, the eels and catfish produced there have scales or look scary. Even if they taste good, seeing their "fish appearance" makes me, who is the most fond of sashimi, lose my appetite. After arriving in Sumatra, on the Indian Ocean coast, from Sibolga to Padang, the products are fresh and fat. So I let go of my stomach and ate and ate.

As for water, there is a very good well in Padang, and everyone drinks it　嘟　嘟. It seems that no one boils it and cools it before drinking it in a hygienic way.

In short, life in the South is comparable to that of royalty. The food is rich and delicious, and I'm just afraid you don't have an appetite. However, one thing is very regrettable, that is, there is no home, which is too lonely and boring! Of course, you might as well take a book to relieve boredom in the evening or in your spare time, but you can't overcome the feeling of loneliness in this way.

Secret to health

Although the above three precepts are completely broken, I　also pay attention to the way of health, so as to remedy the carelessness in diet. The first item is to ride a horse every morning　. At dawn　wearing attire, facing the morning breeze of the Indian Ocean, walking slowly and galloping on the streets is really too pleasant. Sometimes when I met local children, I took them riding with me. Therefore, the children of Padang became very fond of me, and later became acquainted with their adults. This time they knew that I was going to return to China, and waited on the road early in the morning, giving me flowers and repeatedly inviting me to drink coffee. This went on for several days, which really made me happy and tired.

At that time, I did all the good health methods. Tennis and swimming, there was nothing I didn't do. I opened a pool in the official residence that was 40 meters wide and 20 meters wide, and introduced river water into it. I went swimming twice a week, and as a result, my face was tanned black.

Therefore, during my two years in office, I have never suffered from malaria or any tropical diseases, and I have never even had the appearance of being sick. You must be positive about everything, and you must be in awe of the disease demon.

What you must not do is binge drinking and overeating and staying up late—especially playing cards and chess all night. I hope that those who go to the South in the future will keep this in mind.

One of the things that I felt very moved by in my place of office was the situation of recruiting volunteers. On the day of the recruitment, more than ten times the quota of local people gathered in the square in front of the Padang government office, which was really surprising and delightful.

In particular, the Minangkabau people, who live in central Sumatra with Padang as their center, are the most intelligent ethnic group in Indonesia. They are very resentful of the former Dutch oppression and are very willing to cooperate with Japan. This is now in the midst of a dramatic war. There are few materials and many difficulties, but it is important to cooperate in combat at this time. In this way, the nation will develop in the future, so they are very enthusiastic. For example, when people who are eliminated due to poor physical strength always repeatedly ask, "Isn't the commander also wearing glasses?" "Aren't there also people wearing glasses among the Japanese soldiers?" There was also an applicant who was rejected because he was short. Because he was not convinced, he shouted, "What does it matter if I'm short? I'm very strong!" One of the examiners was a military member of the judo early stage. Hearing him say this, he stood up and threw him a somersault. After he got up, although he was a little ashamed, he still insisted on saying, "I am the representative of the village and cannot go back like this. Please give me a certificate!" He refused to go home empty-handed. Just from these points, you can know how full of enthusiasm their grand men's examination was.

Students teaching

The proficiency in Japanese is also surprising. What is interesting is that the lower the grade in middle school, the better the Japanese. Especially the first-year students in middle school have the best Japanese. Japanese is also taught in elementary schools. Since the Japanese army entered, teachers and students have started learning Japanese together. As a result, some teachers have to ask students to do translations. This is probably because children can concentrate on learning better than adults

Two years after I took office as the administrative governor of Sumatra, the medical letters sent to me by local people were sandwiched with Chinese characters, and they were written very well. This really surprised me. I boldly used Malay to deal with him, but he still answered in Japanese. The senior officials heard this and couldn't help but rejoice: "Hahaha, that's great! The popularity of Japanese to this extent is really amazing. In addition, this is the first time I have met someone like Governor Yano who can speak Malay. However, the Governor's Malay is not as good as the locals' Japanese. Haha." (Translated from the Asahi Weekly on July 23)

### Map of the French War Zone

Fierce battles are currently taking place throughout France. The German and anti-Axis forces participating in the battle total about two million people. In the northern region, after fierce battles between anti-Axis armored units and German forces, they broke into the Paris city area from the west via Versailles and Cer, and from the south via Étampes and the Paris highway, and fierce street fighting broke out. In the southern region, the two ports of Toulon and Marseille continue to engage in fierce battles. The German army is containing a large number of enemy troops and is gradually carrying out a disengagement battle towards Lyon. Since the enemy forces landed in the Bay of Biscay, the German army's avoidance actions have been smooth.

### Reunion

— Yifan

On a quiet road, I happened to meet my classmate 〇, whom I hadn't seen for more than a year.

He still had that melancholy face, and his body seemed even taller and thinner. He had a stack of notebooks under his arm, and I knew with joy and a slight sense of loss that he was a primary school teacher.

When you meet a friend who you once had fun with in a life of sorrow, will everyone exchange a sad smile in silence? But what about when you meet a friend who you once sighed with? I did not feel a deeper sorrow, I only chewed on our past again, and everything in the past seemed sweeter. In the past, we were not the most congenial friends, but we were close enough to be confidants, and this friendship was quite beautiful. Now, after a period of estrangement, we meet again on the poor road of displacement and suffering. Although I can't help but have tears in my eyes, my mood is happy and warm!

On this lonely road shrouded in dusk, we walked side by side, talking as the twilight sank around us.

He was always　silent, but this time he spoke a lot. His enthusiasm made me grateful.

"Children, lovely children"; he said excitedly, "They are so pure and innocent! Being with them, I only feel ashamed of myself, because my heart is at least no longer pure white. I can get great comfort from them, which far exceeds the hard work they give me. ... I love them with all my heart and kindness at all times, so none of them are close to me. Especially when I am a little sick, the children come to see me in groups of three or five, some say interesting words to comfort me, and some buy some food to send me. Ah, it makes me unspeakably happy to see this. ... Hey, it's really interesting." "Then you are very satisfied with your current life?" I asked, looking at his contemplative face.

"Yes, it's still good here, because our school has no branch principals or teachers, it's completely run by a few friends with the same interests, so there is no phenomenon of principals exploiting teachers. However, in order to make up for the meager income, I will have to give up teaching and go into business next semester. Alas, the business world, you see, what a filthy place? How can I climb down? ... The city, this sinful city, alas, I have long wanted to leave it, but because I can't bear to abandon this group of lovely children and this pure school, I have lingered. But now it is impossible to even stay here! Do you think I can not worry?"

"Yes, you have always hated this city, so you returned to your hometown once two years ago, but why did you finally come to Shanghai again?" I took the opportunity to rudely but enthusiastically rebuke him as a pastoral idealist.

"Alas, there's nothing I can do about it, because my family hopes that I will "develop" outside. They say that there is no future in the countryside; and what they call a future is to get promoted and make a fortune! Alas, I really don't understand why the minds of most young people's parents are so stubborn and corrupt. If this idea is not eradicated, China will not be saved for a day!" After he finished speaking indignantly, he shook his head repeatedly and sighed.

I also sighed sympathetically, but I could not agree with his consciousness of cherishing the countryside.

"What you said is right, but if we want to contribute a little to society, it is not necessarily limited to the countryside. In the city, the city and the countryside both have social ties and both need us to reform. We should not confine ourselves to small places, but should observe and understand at any time and place and start our new business."

"No, it's not that. People in the city are much more sinister than people in the countryside. People in the countryside are honest, earnest, and simple. Being close to them makes people feel comfortable. I love them, so I miss the countryside. ... If I have the opportunity to get out of the business world, I will go back immediately. My biggest ideal is to run a small school in the countryside. The children in the countryside are especially lovely. Do you think it would be so interesting to read and play with this group of children in that tile-roofed, white-walled, pastoral-painted environment? In addition to this, we can also organize rural cooperatives and improve agriculture, such as buying machines to rent to farmers. I believe that if we continue like this, it will not be long before education can be popularized in our hometown, farmers will be prosperous, industries will be developed, and it will become a model area. Then, if we promote it, we can go from the hometown to the county, from the county to the province, and to the whole country." After Mr. 〇 finished speaking, his eyes flashed with light. From those eyes, I saw his though naive but sincere enthusiasm for rural improvement.

I couldn't bear to use words to dispel his enthusiasm and make him fall out of the ideal circle: at the same time, I was a little aroused by his memories of my hometown: so I was silent.

In silence, I saw the people of my hometown whom I had not seen for seven years: wild grass grew in the destroyed garden, and the tomb of the unfortunate old man who died in the disaster was only consoled by the wind of the wilderness! The fields were barren but the rent was increased. In the silent struggle, poor farmers died with grief. Happiness and warmth are just beautiful dreams for them forever. ... Unforgettable memories, have given me heavy pressure for a long time!

In silence, I looked up. I couldn't help but deny and said: "It's not that easy. One place can never be reformed separately from other places; when the entire rural area is bankrupt, can you improve people's lives by organizing cooperatives in one rural area? As for you saying that you want farmers to rent machines to facilitate farming, it won't do them any good. However, in fact, these are just ideals. ... Under the oppression of a difficult life, people in the countryside will be even more indifferent to the education of their children, but in this respect, your starting a school in the countryside is indeed worth the effort." Finally, an uneasy feeling forced me to say these words, and I thought it would still be meaningful even if it disappointed him a little more.

He didn't say anything more. I knew that he was doubting his ideals again. He had always been like this: when he was not sure of his words, he would think hard, and contradictions would attack him, so he could not solve anything.

I patted his forehead and comforted him: "A person who has firm confidence in something can do amazing things. I believe that you will definitely be able to educate a group of promising young people in the countryside soon, and make practical improvements to the countryside."

He smiled. His sparkling eyes, full of hope, said: "Yes, the worst people in the countryside now are those old stubborns. They do evil and do not allow all new infusions; but as long as I work hard, when the old stubborns die in twenty years, the new generation will grow up, and I can see my own not small

As dusk deepened, the sycamore leaves flowed with dark green, and sparse stars shone with pale light in the clear sky, just like the ones that shone in my heart.

"We may not cooperate, but we will always be good friends!" He suddenly spoke casually, with a sad consolation on his face. This surprised me at first, but after a while I understood its meaning.

"Yes, we will always be good friends." I said sincerely.

At a vast crossroads, we parted ways.

I walked towards home. Looking at a dark darkness in front of me, a few yellow fires glowed, - the city's air defense night!

"The city is like this, but what about the countryside?" I muttered to myself, and a sense of loneliness as a wandering wanderer rose in my heart.

### Work

— Wave

Let me work every day,

In the fields and forests, beside the table and machine,

In the noisy market, the quiet room;

If wandering fantasy makes me confused,

Let me say in my heart,

"This is my work; my happiness, not my misfortune;

Among human beings, I am also one

Can do the work accurately."

〇〇〇〇

Then I will be the price of my work,

Suitable for my spirit and proving my ability;

So I will gladly bless the time of work,

When the shadow appears in the dusk, I will play, love, and rest because I know that work is most beneficial to me. ——Patent Vanderke

### Zuan Zuan

— Chen Shicong

In my consulting room, I often hear the cries, screams, and noises of sick children, which make my heart restless and feel very annoyed, so I don't have much affection for children.

It was the season when cassia blossoms were fragrant last year that my eldest daughter - Zuan Zuan was born. She cries and screams like other children, but I don't feel annoyed or resentful at all. On the contrary, I compare her cries and screams to pleasant jazz songs, and I also try my best to coax her in various ways, and sometimes I even pretend to be a dog or a cat. I have such good patience with Zuan Zuan, but it is different from my attitude towards other children.

Since I was a child, my　appearance has been very bad, and it is common for me to drop the quilt under the bed. Because I love her so much, I often like to hug her and fall asleep together, but I have never dropped her or hurt her. Sometimes when one of my hands is about to press on her body, I will wake up very sensitively.

I have forgotten or even rejected the instructions of my parents and the entrustments of my friends, but I don't ask about Zuan Zuan. I once ran all over Xingsheng Street to buy a pound of red wool, and as a result, I still had to ask a friend to find it on the black market at a high price. To buy a rubber nipple, I also asked more than a dozen pharmacies and walked through the department store. In the display window, I paid special attention to children's products. Once, I saw a red children's dress, the style was very novel and beautiful, but it was for six or seven-year-old children to wear, and Zuan Zuan would have to wait four or five years to wear it, and I would actually buy it. I sincerely want to serve Zuan Zuan, and I don't want any reward. I just hope she grows up, is healthy, beautiful, and lively.

However, things do not always go as one wishes. On May 17, Zuan Zuan left me. She was only suffering from pinkeye when she was sick. I only gave her a little treatment and didn't care much about it. The condition deteriorated rapidly in one or two days, which caught me off guard and I couldn't treat it. Watching her breathe her last breath, I cried, I regretted, my heart was shattered into pieces. I am a doctor who is in charge of life, but I cannot save my beloved baby. I doubt my medical skills, and I think I will not practice medicine in the future, but I know that this is too negative. I am still young, I must do more actively, I must study my medical skills carefully, save the dying sick children, and not create pain for their parents, which can also be used to comfort my heart that has been wounded.

The sick children in the consulting room, relying on the same cries, screams, now, my heart does not feel annoyed and restless at all. On the contrary, I feel very relaxed and very patient with my diagnosis.

"Love my own child and extend it to other people's children" is indeed an unalterable scripture. You really have to have your own children to know how to love other people's children!

### Sports The Vigor of Mini-Football

This summer, tennis and swimming, which are suitable for the season, are extremely deserted, while mini-football, which is usually not noticed by fans, is unexpectedly vigorous. This is because tennis is too expensive, and swimming is limited by the lack of swimming pools, which has hindered its rapid development. Mini-football, on the other hand, is easy to play, leading to a shift from the former to the latter. There are six or seven mini-football cup competitions being held, and the number of teams participating in each cup exceeds expectations, making it a popular event and adding to the summer scenery of Shanghai's sports scene.

### Today's Showdown of the Top Four

The inaugural Mini-Football League, organized by the Shanghai Mini-Football Association, has been progressing smoothly since its opening on the 8th of last month, thanks to the enthusiastic service of Tan Xi, Shen Chun, Deng Xiaoliang, and Huang Renyi, and has now reached the final stage. The final matches of each group will begin today, with two championship matches in the A group featuring the top teams in mini-football, promising to be a sensation.

The reporter will analyze and predict the strengths of the four A-group teams. To maintain order today, and because the Mini-Football Association is not selling tickets for this competition and is using the Youth Friendship Association's venue for free, a fee will now be charged. However, after each competition, there has been a lot of damage. Therefore, tickets will be sold for 50 yuan and 100 yuan to compensate the association for the cost of repairing the field. First, the order of today's A-group final matches is as follows:

Friendship Association vs. Whirlwind (A-Group Part 1 Final) 5:00 PM

Huatong vs. Hequn (A-Group Overall Final) 6:00 PM

### Friendship Association's Players are Experienced

Friendship Association and Whirlwind have the same score in the first division, so they will compete today for the top spot. The two teams have met once before, with Whirlwind defeating Friendship Association. However, after unfortunately losing to the French Concession, a rematch was set. The Friendship Association will seize this chance for revenge. Looking at the strength of the two teams, Friendship Association is similar to the style of football, making use of their robust physique to perform boldly. The team includes first-class players such as Liu Xianhan, Li Tiansheng, Song Lingsheng, Zheng Yingquan, and Xu Wenkui, all of whom are well-known to Shanghai fans. Furthermore, defenders Yan Shican and Feng Jian have returned from Hong Kong. Therefore, the team is impeccable. Whirlwind is extremely active in the mini-football scene and performs very skillfully recently, being light, delicate, and seamless, which is wonderful. In particular, Luo Shoufu and Mai Ersen make use of their agility to dodge and weave, and their attention to detail is noteworthy. Therefore, in terms of performance, Whirlwind is more enjoyable to watch than Friendship Association. However, the outcome of the match requires the impetus of all aspects, and the Friendship Association's players have rich experience and are resourceful in battle. As they will be seeking revenge this time, they will surely work together to achieve victory. Therefore, the outcome of today's match is difficult to predict.

### Huatong and Hequn are Evenly Matched

Huatong is the champion of the second division of Group A, and Hequn is the leader of the third division. This year, Huatong has been enthusiastic about mini-football and has achieved good results. They specifically invited Fa Fanxiao as their coach to provide guidance. As a result, the team has made significant progress, and the team's cooperation is seamless. The players have also made remarkable improvements in their skills. Zhou Qilin and Meng Yiliang have regained their full vigor, which is encouraging. Hequn's players are all outstanding talents from the football training class established by Dai Linjing. This time, Ah Dai has personally led his students, and Dong Jincai, a mini-football goalkeeper from Jiaxing, has joined the team, adding to their strength. Their operational factors are passed down from one team, so there are few loopholes. Knowing the enemy and knowing yourself will bring good skills. They are evenly matched with Huatong and will definitely have a brilliant and exciting performance.

In summary, today's two major battles will feature mini-football masters who are also famous in the football scene. Mini-football has its own unique appeal. All fans, come and join us! Furthermore, the Youth Friendship Association's football field has a beautiful environment, so it is also possible to take a few friends as a holiday park for recreation.

### Today's Softball Tournament Panda vs. Portuguese Team Victory for Overseas Filipinos with a Hit from Liang Yousheng

The softball league, which was dominated by Westerners, has seen the Chinese team Pandas win every game since they joined this summer. In last Sunday's game against the Overseas Filipinos (F.M.U. Knights), the Pandas displayed their power to the fullest. After an extremely tense and hard-fought game, Liang Yousheng's hit gave them a one-point victory over the Overseas Filipinos. Thousands of fans at the scene cheered and jumped with joy. As such, the Pandas' hopes of winning the championship have become increasingly strong.

### Today

(27th) Pandas will play against Lusitano Reds today. Lusitano Reds were the champions of the previous season, and they will fight to the death to determine the winner. At the same time, our Chinese team will also do its best to compete and prepare rigorously in order to win glory for the Chinese and seize the championship. Fans can go to Jiaozhou Park (free admission) at 9:45 AM to watch the game. At the same time, they can cheer for our Chinese team.

### Pandas

The most important thing to note about today's game is that the Portuguese team will use short bunts to get on base. Because they already know that the Chinese team's outfield cannot be easily fooled. In the game against the Overseas Filipinos, the Chinese team only won by a score of 2-1. It can be seen that both sides had done their best to defend. In particular, the Pandas' outfielders were all very agile. The Filipino team had powerful hits from Basha, Taishan, and Tang Qiaosi. The most dangerous moments were in the fourth and seventh innings. In the fourth inning, the Chinese team's outfielders connected to the Filipino team's high balls twice. One was a brilliant catch by Tang Weiye, and the other was a tricky ball hit by Basha and caught by Lao Zhaosen. Also, in the seventh inning, when the Chinese team was leading by one point, Tang Qiaosi came up to bat, and another outfield ball was carefully caught by Tang Weiye. Otherwise, it would have been a home run, and the game would have been tied. Therefore, one way to deal with the Portuguese team's short bunts today is that if the Portuguese team's short bunt is along the first base line, the pitcher can pretend to chase the ball and walk in front of the runner, while the first baseman can rush forward to grab the ball and throw it to first base, and the second baseman can fill the space and catch it. In this way, the ball will definitely arrive at the base first. Because the runner will panic and slow down after the pitcher walks in front of him. (The pitcher does not commit a foul by walking in front of the runner, as long as he does not bump into him or deliberately obstruct him, so it is not blocking.) At the same time, the first baseman can throw to first base with ease. The Chinese team may wish to adopt this method to restrain the Portuguese team. At the same time, in the game against the Overseas Filipinos, the catcher Wang Qingrui lacked calmness. For example, in the fifth inning, he mistakenly threw to second base, allowing the Filipino player on third base to take the opportunity to return to the base, which was caused by panic. Today, the opposing team is good at running the bases, so it is important to be cautious. In addition, only Lu Zhaosen, Liang Yousheng, Wang Xiushan, and Wen Ruixiong are slightly better at hitting the ball. In last week's game, Fu Jun's two brilliant hits and Liang Yousheng's clever short bunt in the fourth inning brought Lu Zhaosen and Wang Qingrui (mistakenly written as Huang Yingrui) back from second and third base, which was particularly commendable. However, Wen Ruixiong seems to be declining recently, and he missed two hit balls in last week's game. On the other hand, first baseman Wang Nianzu seems to be improving, and he is not as slow and messy as before.

### Shanghai Sports Association Tennis Tournament Cai Guoji Defeats H. Kelasha

The handicap tennis tournament organized by the Shanghai Sports Association (formerly the Racecourse) opened in July. Because it is a friendly tournament for members, very few outsiders know about it. Recently (25th), there was a tense singles match, and I was happy to go and watch it at the invitation of Qu Zhaohong. The players were Cai Guoji, a rising star of the Chinese team, and H. Kelasha, a veteran. Because the two players belong to the same A-level, there was no handicap. Kelasha is known as a "sticky rubber," capable of both attacking and defending, and has rich experience, while Cai has been improving rapidly recently and has skills in both long rallies and net play. Although Kelasha was cunning, he was defeated, which is gratifying. It can be considered a small addition to the otherwise newsless summer tennis season. Attached is Cai's score against Ke. (Jie) Cai Guoji 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 H. Kelasha
