Weekly Review

### Written After the Naval Battle of Taiwan and the Philippines

— Ji Ren

Question: It is a well-known fact that the enemy Americans suffered unprecedented damage in the two naval battles of Taiwan and the Philippines. However, recently, the number of American troops landing on Leyte Island has gradually increased; at the same time, in terms of the navy, there are also mobile units cruising the sea, showing a tendency to move restlessly. May I ask what impact this action will have on the future of the war?

Answer: In the naval battles of Taiwan and the Philippines, the enemy Americans' main mobile forces suffered fatal blows, and more than half of the Nimitz fleet was annihilated, which can be said to be the biggest loss since the start of the war. However, before the naval battle, the United States had already made a determination to sacrifice, so it did not hesitate to mobilize its powerful naval forces to challenge Japan. The strategic objective of the enemy Americans' navy is, on the one hand, to prepare to lure the main Allied fleet to fight a decisive battle, and on the other hand, to hope to use the landing in the central Philippines as a base in the central Pacific in order to cut off the connection between Japan and the South Pacific. The reason why the US naval mobile force did not hesitate to make such reckless moves at a great sacrifice was precisely for this purpose. However, while the strategy of the United States is like this, Japan's is not. Japan's strategy is to figure out how to consume the US Navy, how to annihilate the US Navy, and thereby seize the best opportunity for a decisive battle. Therefore, Japan can ignore the actions of the US Army, and its main goal is still the Navy. The heroic sacrifices of the past in Omiya, Saipan, and other islands are not because Japan underestimated the gains and losses of these islands, but because the gains and losses of these islands did not affect the overall situation of the war, and the fundamental reason was that the time to annihilate the main force of the US Navy had not yet arrived. Now, the US Army units landing on Leyte Island have increased to as many as seven divisions. The United States believes that this is beneficial to the war and that the future is promising. In fact, the more the US Army is strengthened, the more disadvantageous it is to the US Navy, and the more opportunities it has to be annihilated. After the landing force on Leyte Island is strengthened to seven divisions, a large amount of ammunition, weapons, food, medicine, and other supplies must be continuously replenished. At this time, the number of transport ships required will increase even more. Now, assuming that the ships required to supply one division of troops are 300,000 tons, then the ships required to supply seven divisions of troops will be at least 2 million tons or more. A transport fleet of 2 million tons must have a large number of cruisers and destroyers to protect it, but cruisers and destroyers lack combat power, so main battleships and aircraft carriers must be added to enhance combat power. At this time, the appearance of a large number of naval forces in the vicinity of the Philippines is a great danger to the United States. At the same time, the closer the US Navy is to the Philippine mainland, the more opportunities it has to encounter attacks from the Japanese Navy and Air Force, and the greater the danger. The last disastrous defeat of the US Navy was also due to this reason; future naval battles will continue to occur, and in the near future, we will see the misfortune of the US fleet again.

Question: However, the US military also has strong productivity behind it. Although the US fleet has suffered heavy blows, it can still use its strong production capacity to continue fighting Japan. What do you think?

Answer: The overall productivity of the United States cannot be underestimated. However, today's war is not only a war of materials, nor is it only a war of numbers. There is also the most important and indispensable main driving force, which is the spiritual element. The people of the enemy Americans are nurtured in an environment of freedom and enjoyment, and they pay special attention to their personal interests. Therefore, on the battlefield, they often only consume large amounts of weapons and ammunition, and regard their own lives as heavy as Mount Tai; while the Japanese people have always been known for their hard work and endurance. Only because they can endure hardship can they despise their personal lives, and only because they can endure hardship can they shoulder the important task of the rise and fall of the country. In the naval battles of Taiwan and the Philippines, the Japanese Air Force Special Attack Force was able to use the earth-shattering and soul-stirring heroic "meat bomb" tactics to perish together with the US fleet, and ultimately achieve huge war results and establish an absolutely invincible situation. The reason should be entirely attributed to the Japanese people's spirit of "sacrificing oneself for the country." Therefore, I say: spirit comes first, and matter comes second.

Question: However, the future is long, how will the future of the war develop? Will the trend of the war necessarily be beneficial to Japan?

Answer: Great undertakings cannot be achieved in a single day. Similarly, the final glory must be sought in the midst of all kinds of hardships. Only the spirit of perseverance and indomitable spirit is the only element of success. In the course of a long war, victory is not enough to be proud of, and defeat is not necessarily discouraging. Only in the last decisive battle can victory or defeat be clear. We can predict that the US fleet will come again. In the future, whether in the Philippines, Taiwan, or other seas, there will inevitably be naval battles of a larger scale and more intense than this naval battle. However, the farther the enemy American fleet is from its base, the more unfavorable it is in combat, which is more favorable to Japan. Although future Japanese-US naval battles will not occur in the Tsushima Strait, we can be sure that the enemy American fleet will suffer the same tragic fate as the Baltic Fleet.

### Japanese Army Occupies Key Points in Guangxi, Shrinking the Encirclement

South China Front, 18th (Central News Agency Dispatch) After losing Guilin and Liuzhou, the Chongqing army has collapsed and is retreating southwest. Part of the Japanese army is still pursuing the Chongqing army, launching encirclement and annihilation battles everywhere. Since the Japanese army advanced into the area between Laibin and Qianjiang, it eliminated the stubborn resistance of the 156th Division of the Chongqing army on the north bank of the Wu River, and braved the air raids of the Chongqing-American air force, and forcibly crossed the Wu River on the 11th, and continued to advance north from near Xun'anwei on the opposite bank. On the morning of the 13th, they occupied the key point of Baijian Village and wiped out the over-military forces nearby. In addition, another part of the Japanese army occupying Qianjiang also continued to advance north, cutting off the retreat of the Chongqing army, and is currently shrinking the encirclement.

### Fierce Land Battles on Leyte, Japanese Army Secures Various Heights, Launching Strong Attacks on Enemy Convoys and Airfields Day After Day

Manila, 18th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The attacks of the Japanese Army on Leyte Island are becoming more and more fierce. The Japanese army, with Tagami in the central mountain range of Leyte Island as its back, launched a surprise attack on the main force of the enemy's 96th Division, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy and causing them to fall into great chaos. The various heights are still being secured by the Japanese army.

Philippine Base, 18th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Japanese Air Force is still launching strong attacks on enemy convoys and enemy airfields in Leyte Bay day after day. At dawn on the 15th and 16th, they bombed enemy transport convoys in Leyte Bay and enemy land facilities and airfields on Leyte Island, destroying one enemy medium-sized transport ship and causing explosions and fires in several places in Tacloban Airport and several places in the city.

### Captured Enemy American Air Force Recounts Attack on Nanjing

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The captured enemy American airmen have now been escorted to Nanjing. The reporter made a special visit to one of them, and the conversation was as follows: (Question) Please briefly describe the situation when you set out on this expedition. (Answer) At noon on November 9, we departed from a base in India and arrived near Chengdu at 7:00 p.m. On the 11th, we departed again at 2:00 a.m. to bomb Japan. After departing for a considerable period of time, due to the bad weather, we changed our original plan and bombed Nanjing. (Question) Did the captain give any instructions when you set out? (Answer) There were no clear instructions, because we are all Catholics, so before departing, we all gathered in one place, prayed, and then received maps and aerial photographs to prepare for departure. (Question) What was the situation when you arrived over Nanjing? (Answer) We were all guided by the instructors and did not know where Nanjing was, but soon the Japanese anti-aircraft guns seemed to have started firing at the front, back, left, and right of the plane, and there were explosions of shells everywhere. (Question) B29. The type of aircraft was previously advertised as absolutely inviolable. What are its advantages? (Answer) I used to trust it quite a bit, but recently many of them have been shot down in northern Kyushu, and we have doubts about its performance. (Question) What was the situation when you were hit? (Answer) Now when I think about it, it's like a dream. After I opened the bomb bay and the bombs had just left the plane, I felt a violent push. At first, I thought it was the sound of the bombs I had dropped exploding, but then I realized that I had made a mistake. It turned out that it was a Japanese anti-aircraft shell that hit the bombs I had dropped, causing them to explode. This was truly a miracle. Not long after, I looked out of the window on the right side and saw that one of the engines on the right wing was on fire. I immediately contacted other planes and told them that my plane was on fire. Not long after, the two engines on the right wing stopped working, and the fuselage tilted to the right, and the fire became more intense. Then the left wing also caught fire and burned, spreading throughout the plane, and the entire plane separated. At this time, the speaking tube may also have been damaged, so I did not hear the order to parachute. The fate of death was approaching us, so we overcame all obstacles and descended with parachutes with the passage of time. From the time the parachute opened until I was captured by the Japanese army, the situation was clear to me. Although I am now a prisoner, it is better than going back. (Question) Your bombing is almost blind bombing, and many innocent Chinese civilians have been innocently sacrificed. You said earlier that you were Catholics, and you prayed before you set out. What do you, as a Catholic, think about the blind bombing and killing of the innocent? (Answer) This is purely a matter of necessity. We were ordered to bomb and did not know the result. We are all forced to do so in the bombing deaths of Chinese civilians, what else can I say.

### Exerting All Strength of Six Armies for a General Offensive on the Siegfried Line, Fierce Battles Underway in Three Key Areas

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – Eisenhower deployed the U.S. Ninth Army, the final reserve force, to the front lines on the 16th, contrary to German expectations. A large-scale offensive and defensive battle has begun along the 700-kilometer front stretching from the Dutch coast to the Swiss border. The focal points of the entire front are currently the Metz, Aachen, and Venlo regions. A general overview of the battle situation is as follows: (1) Although the French army has launched attacks from the Swiss border with Saarbrücken as the target, their objective is to reach the Rhine River via Belfort and Mulhouse, between the Jura and Vosges Mountains in Switzerland, to cover the main force of the British army and attack the central German lines. This is very clear. The U.S. Seventh Army and the French army are directly attacking the Vosges Mountains in parallel. (2) The U.S. Third Army, under the command of Patton, is concentrating its attack on Metz, but its aim is to gather super-heavy weaponry to break through the German defense lines and reach the mouth of the Main River via the Saar. The northern flank of this army is also concentrating a large force. (3) The British Second Army and the U.S. Army are closely coordinating their offensives, launching an offensive in the Venlo area, with Canadian troops deployed on the northernmost flank. From the above situation, it is clear that Eisenhower has committed all the strength of his six armies to the attack on the Siegfried Line. However, the anti-Axis forces will find it extremely difficult to achieve their goals, as time, the greatest factor in determining the outcome of the battle, is running late.

The Northern Front Approaches Cologne

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – The anti-Axis forces are currently fiercely attacking Cologne, the heart of German heavy industry, and reports indicate that they have broken into the Strasbourg and Karlsruhe regions. According to London reports, the U.S. First and Ninth Armies are engaged in fierce fighting 30 kilometers south of Cologne, and are said to have advanced to a point 7 kilometers from the crucial transportation hub of Jülich and the Cologne Plain.

Fierce Bombardment by Thousands of Aircraft

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – Reuter reports: The new offensive by the U.S. Ninth Army in the Aachen area was launched thanks to improved flying weather. The offensive was preceded by over a thousand bombers, followed by infantry and tanks. Autumn weather is often favorable to the anti-Axis forces and unfavorable to the German defenders. Furthermore, the continent has been plagued by clouds and fog this year, making it difficult for German aircraft to take off and land, while the British Isles have clear weather, allowing British aircraft to frequently fly to the continent.

Now, the Construction Department's Jian Jia Zi No. 1290 reply states that, upon receiving the letter from your government's Shanghai City Group No. 10471, which requests an investigation and reply on the Municipal Advisory Committee's request to crack down on railway porters arbitrarily extorting money, it has been ordered that the China Railway Company thoroughly investigate and eliminate all porters if there is no need for their existence. This is a corresponding reply and is hoped to be noted.

### Two Police Officers Abuse Authority, Fisherman Beaten to Death: Court Concludes Trial Yesterday

Zhu Daoyuan, a police officer from the Yanjing Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau's Yanjiaqiao Police Station, was ordered to be on duty at the Yanjiaqiao embankment at 5:00 p.m. on August 22nd of this year. A fishing boat happened to pass through Yanjiaqiao, and Zhu ordered it to stop for inspection. It turned out that Zhu's attempt to extort money from the boat owner failed, leading to a conflict with Chu Xingeng, a member of the boat crew. Zhu, feeling insulted and losing face as a police officer, returned to the station and, together with another police officer, Wang Guangjiang (28 years old, from Nanjing), returned to the boat, holding a rope. Chu Xingeng, seeing this, was frightened and went ashore to escape, but the two police officers chased after him to the bank of the Huangpu River. Chu Xingeng, in a moment of desperation, jumped into the river and drowned. After the incident, the local Procuratorate investigated and found the facts to be true, and prosecuted the two police officers for abusing their authority, causing death. Yesterday, the case was formally tried in the Fourth Criminal Court of the District Court. The two defendants completely denied the matter in court, but as the facts of the case were clear, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled a date for sentencing.

### Over a Hundred Organizations in This City Send Condolences to Madam Wang; Memorial Service in Beijing Ends on the 22nd

The news of Chairman Wang's death caused shock and grief throughout the country. In addition to following the central government's regulations for mourning, this city held a solemn public memorial ceremony a few days ago, and various organizations and institutions have also sent telegrams of condolence to Madam Wang. It has been found that yesterday, those who sent telegrams of condolence to Madam Wang included 31 workers' unions from various industries, 36 fellow-provincial associations, 17 police stations, Baojia offices, and Baojia units in various districts, and 39 other organizations such as charitable groups, industry associations, welfare societies, sports associations, women's associations, press associations, Confucian societies, and the Anqing Society, totaling 123 units, most of which sent joint telegrams based on the similarity of their nature.

According to a telegram from the Beijing Funeral Committee for the late Chairman Wang, the deadline for officials and civilians from other provinces to go to Beijing to pay their respects is the 22nd of this month. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "The date for public memorial services for the late Chairman Wang by various institutions and organizations in Beijing has ended. Officials and civilians from other provinces may still come to Beijing to pay their respects and offer their condolences, but the deadline is the 22nd of this month." It is reported that the municipal government has instructed its affiliated agencies to take note.

### Adjusting Economic Relations between Central China and Manchuria

Mr. Furuhai, Director-General of General Affairs of Manchukuo, who came to Shanghai to attend the Sino-Manchurian Economic Adjustment Conference, met with a group of reporters on the 15th and delivered a speech on Manchukuo's mission of wartime economy and the adjustment of Sino-Manchurian economic relations, as follows: The economic relationship between Central China and Manchuria in the past cannot be called smooth. Now that the situation has entered a decisive stage, it is naturally necessary to overcome all difficulties in order to achieve a satisfactory adjustment. The problem of prices will be easily solved after the establishment of credit lending. In short, the primary task is to enable the important products of the two regions to be exchanged with each other. As for the handling of credit lending, based on this, we must make every effort to eliminate petty bureaucratic concepts. Fortunately, a certain amount of credit lending worth hundreds of millions has been established between Manchuria and Central China, and the economic adjustment between the two regions based on mutual understanding has been largely settled. Now, we must continue to work hard based on this principle to promote the exchange of materials between the two regions.

### Police Bureau Actively Promotes Crime Prevention Work

The Crime Prevention Section of the Judicial Department of the Municipal Police Bureau can be said to be sparing no effort in planning and managing crime prevention work. In terms of propaganda, in addition to publishing regular publications, it will also stage the crime prevention drama "Turning Back Is the Shore" at the Lyceum Theatre for four days starting today (the 19th), and will also publish "The Meaning of Crime Prevention," on the one hand, to show that the police authorities attach importance to crime prevention, and on the other hand, to call for popularizing general legal knowledge among the people and the cooperation of all levels of society. However, on the part of the people, it goes without saying that we deeply hope that the police bureau will maintain law and order, but we even more sincerely hope that the police and judicial authorities themselves will earnestly rectify themselves to achieve a state of integrity and public service, so that the "all-knowing" policing of the past can be eliminated at once, and the spirit of true rule of law can be brought into full play. Rectifying oneself and rectifying others, with a two-pronged approach, can the ultimate goal of crime prevention be achieved.

### Director Ye Speaks on the Aftermath of the Nantong Steamer Disaster

The Nantong steamer of the China Shipping Company sank in Hupu on October 23rd, resulting in the drowning of over a thousand passengers. Yesterday, Director Ye Xuesong of the Public Utilities Bureau made the following statement on the aftermath of the case: The bureau attaches great importance to this case. The company's Huatai steamer had an accident last winter, and a satisfactory solution has not yet been reached. It is a great regret that this has happened again. We have sent personnel to the company to inquire about the follow-up issues. We have learned that the company has now formed a Nantong Steamer Disaster Aftermath Committee, which may soon decide how to compensate the families of the deceased. As for the cause of the accident, the Japanese naval attaché is assisting in a thorough investigation, and salvage work is also being actively carried out. The bureau has urged the company to quickly handle everything in order to comfort the families of the deceased.

### The Chinese Art Gallery Opens Tomorrow

Chinese art and culture originated the earliest. For thousands of years, the cultural relics have been splendid, and the national spirit is treasured here. However, because there has been little organized research work in the country, the precious cultural relics left over from the past dynasties have either flowed into foreign lands or been locked in the hands of private individuals, and the public cannot easily see them, which has greatly affected the progress of art and culture. Famous people in Shanghai, such as Tang Wenzhi, Zhao Shuru, Hu Puan, Ding Fubao, Xu Langxi, Wu Zhenxiu, Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Yuqian, and Chen Binhe, have seen this and have specially established the Chinese Art Gallery to preserve antiquities, conduct open research, promote art, and improve culture. It is scheduled to open at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow. The famous porcelain of past dynasties collected by the gallery from major collectors in Shanghai is the most artistically valuable antique in our country and will also be systematically displayed during the opening period. This is truly an unprecedented event. Admission tickets are not charged, but in order to limit the number of people, each person is requested to donate 50 yuan each to the Shen Bao Student Aid Fund and the China Health Association to benefit poor students and promote public health. Observing the legacy of our ancestors and promoting our national spirit is truly spiritual food for the public and a good opportunity to appreciate ancient art. We also hope that schools and institutions will visit in groups. (The address of the gallery is Majestic Building, 996 Jing'an Temple Road).

### Divine Wind Special Attack Force: Remarkable Achievements Established in the Seas off the Philippines, Enemy American Pacific Fleet Turned into Seaweed

The day when the arrogant enemy American fleet would be turned into the Pacific seabed has finally arrived. On October 25th, the Japanese Navy suddenly launched a fierce sea and air combined attack on the remaining main force of the enemy American fleet in the eastern sea area of the Philippines. We had been eagerly anticipating such a day in our hearts, praying to the gods and Buddha, hoping it would come soon, and now it has indeed come. Who can forget the emotions and excitement of this day? Just a few days ago, naval aviators, who had been gazing at the vast sky and lamenting the absence of enemy planes, are now piloting elite aircraft, as numerous as clouds and mist, and bravely going to annihilate the enemy.

On this day, the weather in the Philippines was clear after a long period of rain. Today is suitable for launching an attack. The Allied aircraft, which had been gathering day and night, had all preparations completed through the tireless efforts of the maintenance personnel before the general attack was about to begin. The first strike to destroy the enemy was launched by the naval air force's preemptive attack. The target was the enemy's aircraft carrier group. The enemy, who had invaded Leyte Gulf and forcibly landed near Tacloban, was mobilizing the full strength of their remaining fleet to cover this landing force and establish a strong bridgehead in the Philippines. Only after resolving the enemy's air force in this area can our fleet fully exert its power under our air supremacy. Therefore, the task undertaken by the naval air force based in the Philippines is truly significant. As soon as the order for a general attack came down, aircraft after aircraft thundered off the base in succession.

All naval aviators are determined to die. Among them, the Divine Wind Special Attack Force is the essence of the Japanese Navy. The name of these guardian eagles of the nation should be forever remembered. They attacked with human bombs, crashing into enemy aircraft carriers with both men and machines. Once they flew out of the base and discovered the enemy American mobile unit, they would never return. This kind of suicide special attack force is the main axis of the front-line air force, organized to shoulder the important task of the nation's survival, and they are a long-trained air suicide squad.

"We are standing at the forefront of the entire nation's expedition, permanently protecting the glorious history of the motherland. The tradition of the Imperial Navy must be brought into play today." Naval youth pilots, holding such beliefs, had blood boiling throughout their bodies. The commander, who personally visited the base of the Divine Wind Special Attack Force, was deeply moved by the tragic feelings of the young pilots. When he delivered a training speech with tears in his eyes, the young warriors did not even twitch their eyebrows.

Calm and Composed

On the 25th, the time for a general attack had arrived. The young warriors of the special attack force looked up at the clear sky and said lightly:

"We'll definitely do it today!"

"Please take care of everything!" While saying this, they warmly shook the hands of the maintenance personnel. There were cheers everywhere. Afterward, everyone silently raised their hands to salute each other.

Unexpectedly, everyone had this kind of silent attitude at the moment of departing for a suicide attack, because in the distant homeland, there were elderly parents, and also a beloved wife who had just married this spring. So, what are these young pilots thinking in their hearts now? In the rumbling sound of the engines, the reporter stared at the young warriors climbing into their beloved planes. Their mouths were tightly closed, and one could see their firm determination. And a serene smile floated on their faces. They moved calmly and as usual. Once they became airborne, there was nothing in the minds of the naval aviators except the thought of sinking enemy aircraft carriers.

Anxiously Awaiting Victory

The sound of the aircraft engines thundered crisply. The planes took off smoothly along the runway, one after another. Some warriors waved goodbye to the personnel on the ground, while others were wholeheartedly maneuvering their aircraft. They all formed up into squadrons in the sky above the base. This first attack squadron of the Divine Wind Special Attack Force then disappeared into the blue sky. Afterward, several hours had passed. If they had not found the enemy, then they should have returned to the enemy aircraft carrier. The base suddenly became noisy.

After they found them, what would happen? It would be best if they succeeded happily, but if they were blocked by the enemy's defensive fire and could not hit the aircraft carrier, wouldn't the deaths of the young warriors be too regrettable? At this time, everyone couldn't help but become worried.

Mission Accomplished

However, that afternoon, a report witnessed by Allied aircraft was transmitted from another base. The situation was like this:

"The first special attack squadron discovered the enemy American mobile unit in the sea area from Suluan to 〇〇 degrees 〇〇. Two planes rammed into aircraft carriers, sinking them; one plane rammed into an aircraft carrier, setting it on fire (the enemy aircraft carrier was unable to navigate); one plane hit a cruiser, sinking it."

Ah, how tragic! This was not a bomb hitting the enemy ship, but men and machines hitting the enemy ship together. The mission of the first special attack squadron has been completed. When the report of this great achievement was received, the commander simply closed his eyes and said:

"Now, the young team members have become gods. I have always thought so."

In this way, the enemy American fleet is successively turning into the seaweed of the Pacific Ocean. This is because the arrogant enemy American forces underestimated the strength of the Japanese Navy, and at the same time despised the spirit of the naval air force, which is as sincere as burning for loyalty and service to the country. (Report by Yoshida News Team) (Translated from the October 30th Asahi Shimbun)

### Modern Divine Wind

On the evening of the 25th, when the good news from the eastern sea area of the Philippines was successively transmitted, the headquarters of the front-line base received such a wireless telegram:

"The Shikishima squadron's battle results: one aircraft carrier, sunk by one plane ramming; one aircraft carrier, set on fire by one plane ramming, navigation stopped; one cruiser, sunk by one plane hitting."

Alas, this battle result! This is precisely the first report of the lofty battle results obtained by the Shikishima squadron members of the Japanese Navy Divine Wind Special Attack Force, who replaced bombs with their bodies and beloved aircraft! After this, the good news from the second and third Divine Wind squadrons will follow one after another. Divine Wind Special Attack Force, what a noble name! This is to pilot an aircraft with special explosive devices, with the determination to die, to carry out bombing. In the history of air warfare, it can be said to be an unprecedented initiative. This is an air suicide attack that only the Japanese air force can do. Moreover, the warriors of the Divine Wind Special Attack Force, centered on the young naval air squadron leader, are all very young. As for its mission, as its name suggests, in this sea battle in the Philippines, which is betting on the nation's survival, it uses a daring hand-to-hand combat to take the lead in the attack, stirring up the Divine Wind of victory (Translator's note: In May 1280, the Yuan army launched a large-scale attack on Japan. In the intercalary July, a hurricane suddenly rose at sea, and almost all of the Yuan army's ships were overturned. Therefore, there is a saying of Divine Wind in Japanese history.) Therefore, each attack squadron of the Divine Wind Special Attack Force, as the vanguard of each carrier-based bombing squadron, successively departs from the base and never returns. The following is what the reporter witnessed at the base where the headquarters is located, the situation from the birth of the Divine Wind Special Attack Force to its departure.

Dare-to-Die Spirit

On the 20th, when the enemy began to land on Leyte Island in the central Philippines, the base was filled with murderous intent from dawn. "Have they come, those arrogant enemies!" The time to annihilate the enemy by death has arrived, and the eyes of every "sea eagle" are shooting out the light of destroying the enemy, revealing the determination to repay the country with death. They were formed for such a day, they have been training fiercely, and now, the day to exert their power has finally come! A cheer of Banzai Banzai spontaneously surged on the base. The carefully selected warriors of the attack squadron are all experienced young soldiers aged nineteen to twenty-four. This air suicide squad is divided into the first attack squadron, the second attack squadron, and the third attack squadron, etc., and the formation is completed. At 10:00 a.m., Commander 〇〇 Lieutenant General from a certain base gathered all the members of the special attack squadron in front of the headquarters and gave them encouraging and grateful remarks for their departure.

"The rise and fall of the country depends on this battle at this time, and it is on your shoulders! The Divine Wind of victory in this great Pacific decisive battle will be stirred up by your human bombs. For His Majesty the Emperor, for the country, this commander hopes that you will devote yourself silently!"

The eyes of the young pilots are as clear as autumn water, staring at 〇〇 Lieutenant General. Next to them are Commander Y and Deputy Commander K with clenched fists. The lieutenant general's voice and body trembled slightly, and he continued:

"The only regret for you must be that after attacking the enemy fleet with hand-to-hand combat, you will not be able to know the achievements you have made. However, your battle will surely be seen clearly by your allied aircraft that directly cover you and reported to the commander. The commander will surely report the battle results to you before reporting them to His Majesty the Emperor. So there is no need to feel regret."

After the encouragement was over, the commander and the young warriors of the special attack squadron shook hands warmly.

After that, the sound of the joint singing of "Sea Journey" and "Preparatory Training Song" resounded through the sky. Amid the murderous intent and excitement, the Divine Wind Special Attack Force was born with Navy Air Corps Captain Seki, a veteran of many battles, as the leader.

The Wind Howls

The time for sacrifice has come. The first attack squadron, the "Kushima Squadron," finally set out to attack. At dawn on the 25th, on the silent base, which was wet with morning dew, the Divine Wind attack aircraft, which the maintenance personnel had been preparing all night, emitted a rumbling roar. Inside the command post, spreading out a map, the deputy commander carefully told the warriors of the attack squadron:

"The target of the attack is the enemy aircraft carrier. When ramming, you must aim at the weak points of the aircraft carrier.

After that, Captain Seki, the squadron leader of the first attack squadron Shikishima squadron, said loudly to his subordinates:

"We are not bombing squadrons, we are bombs. Follow me!"

Captain Seki's eyes were bright, shooting out the light of determination to die. The pupils of each suicide pilot also revealed a fearless divine light. It was time to attack. The young members of the suicide squad, with pure folded cloth wrapped around their heads, fully expressed their determination. Without even taking parachutes, they successively climbed into the aircraft with special explosive devices. The sound of the engines roared, and the squadron leader's plane took off first, followed by the second and third planes, and a burst of smoke surged over the base. The people on the plane waved their hands, making their final farewell. The warriors never return, and the Divine Wind Kushima squadron flew away from the base with great momentum; from now on, they will never return.

Commander Y, who had injured his right elbow, leaned on a crutch and leaned on his soldiers, personally came to see off his young warriors departing. The deputy commander also looked up at the Shikishima squadron and kept waving his cap until the silhouette of the Shikishima squadron was deeply submerged in the southern sky.

### Leyte Island Situation Map

It has been a month since the enemy Americans landed on Leyte Island, and the land, sea, and air battles surrounding the island are becoming increasingly fierce. On land, Japanese troops and enemy soldiers are engaged in close combat in the dense forests. The Japanese air force is fiercely bombing the enemy airfield in the Barue area. In the sea east of Samar Island, the enemy fleet suffered heavy damage, and the enemy forces in the Ormoc area also suffered heavy damage.

### Eve of Farewell

— Meien

For the sake of life, I have to carry my luggage and go to another country.

The train ticket was bought decisively. Logically, that night should have been an opportunity to say goodbye to relatives and friends, to let them know that I have begun to be independent and use my own strength to seek independent survival. Who says that a girl has no way to go except to marry! But no, I didn't say a word to a relative or a friend. Even if I did, what would happen? At best, they would put on a show of sadness at parting, and greet me with words like, "Write to us when you get there!" "When will you be back?" False and indifferent verbal concern, they think they have done their duty, and on the contrary, I would feel sadly depressed. Obviously, there is no one in this place who truly cares about or misses me!

This night, I seem so lonely, so deserted! Not a single person came to visit me. No wonder, who knows that you are going to leave without saying a word? And no one came to see me off. I still have to heat up the leftover cold rice from the morning to eat it, but stepping on the cold charcoal stove in the corner of the wall, I just stared blankly: that small pot had already been returned to the landlady downstairs. As the saying goes: "Cold tea and cold rice are delicious, but cold words and hot words are hard to bear." Who cares! Eat, pocket it, and climb into this mouth. No vegetables? There is a cookbook on the table, with recipes for fresh shrimp with tofu, braised chestnut pork, fried noodles... Swallowing a bite, then another, with a plate of pickled radish shreds next to it.

Passing through the throat, it slipped down like a block of ice, and the accompanying radish shreds regurgitated a sour taste, with a hint of coolness in the sourness, but not bitter! The feeling in my heart is also cold, but cold and calm. This calmness was stirred up by a knock on the door outside, but even though the knock disturbed the quiet air, I didn't forget to hide the bowls and plates, wipe my lips, and pretend that I hadn't eaten cold rice.

The person who came in surprised me. She was carrying a basket, and said with a scolding yet kind face:

"You're leaving tomorrow, and others don't say hello, why don't you even pay attention to your grandmother! Alas! Young people are reckless in doing things. If I hadn't come this morning and you weren't in the house, seeing your packed luggage, I wouldn't have known that you were really leaving tomorrow..."

I took the basket from her hand, smiling and silent, and also condemned myself for being confused in doing things.

The lid of the box was lifted, and a fragrant and sweet heat sprayed out. I jumped up happily and took my grandmother's hand. She looked at me with a sad smile:

"Eat it! It's hot, just like this, I don't know when you'll be back..." Yes, "Just like this, I don't know when you'll be back..." These were my grandmother's words, this sentence is very familiar, I have heard it more than once. It seems that she has said this to both her daughter and her son. She sent her daughter to another world, and let her two sons go far to the border. She often said to me: Wang Sanjie guarded her husband (Xue Pinggui) for eighteen years, when will she wait to guard her sons? Thinking of her sons, she burst into tears and asked me to write letters for her. There seemed to be a lot of words in the letter, but in the final analysis, it was nothing more than telling them to come back quickly. She missed them, she thought, they should also be thinking of her. After sealing the letter, she pressed me to go to the post office and watched it being put into the mailbox with her own eyes. In fact, this letter had nowhere to go, it would just fall into the hands of a stranger and be torn up, this is what I thought in my heart, but I never had the courage to say it.

Now she is going to send off her only granddaughter again, without much sadness; only a silent sigh....

She looked at the cold cake that had wrinkles from being exposed to the air and told me to eat more, wishing she could stuff it all into my stomach.

In the dim light, these two lonely people sat opposite each other, one old and one young. Heaven seemed to have deliberately arranged for the two of us to coincide together. You pity me, and I care about you.

In the misty dawn, we began to part. Before getting on the car, she still urged me tightly: "Write to me!" I nodded knowingly, but looking at her trembling lips, I didn't hear a single idiom...

The street lights gradually went out from dim to bright in the morning light. Turning my head, in front of me was a blue sky and a vast plain. I don't know when, the army is about to be hundreds of miles away.

### Evening

— Kunyang

Watching the ceiling darkened by cooking smoke,

The color of the street is desolate, cold and deep,

A string of whistles sounded,

It is the crows returning from their tired travels,

Light flowed out from the gap in someone's window,

You should go back too

However, where is my home?

### Autumn

— Kunyang

The eaves are crying,

The window bridge sighs,

Even the parasol tree is haggard for you,

Harboring how much sorrow,

Such a heart-wrenching feeling?

### The Story of a Bicycle

— Lan Ying

Written for the "Traffic Safety Campaign"

Tao Sheng's father bought a new bicycle, but after using it for less than a week, he took it to sell again and exchanged it for a seven- or eight-year-old used bicycle.

It turned out that after secretly calculating, his father felt that at this time and place, riding a bicycle was much more convenient than taking the tram, and from an economic and spiritual point of view, paying for tickets in small amounts and being crowded or yelled at in the tram all the time were more worthwhile. He wanted to buy a bicycle for his eldest daughter, Tao Sheng, who left early and returned late, but he couldn't scrape together so much money at once. So, in a moment of thought, he sold his own brand new bicycle and bought a half-new one. He gave the extra money to Tao Sheng and told her to look for and buy one herself within the amount of this money. Father's love is great.

With a heart of gratitude and reverence, coupled with unspeakable happiness, Tao Sheng began to ask her friends everywhere, seeking a suitable bicycle. Two weeks later, she was finally introduced by a colleague to meet a Mr. Shi, and with Mr. Shi's enthusiastic guidance, she finally agreed on a used bicycle that was said to be "of good origin." However, although it was used, it was very useful. One day, in September, the wild chrysanthemums kissed the setting sun in a drunken embrace. It was a bright near-dusk. Mr. Shi came to visit Tao Sheng.

"Mr. Shi, I had an accident when I went out this morning. There's something wrong with the bike. It keeps making rattling noises when I pedal it. I was just about to go out to repair it!"

Generally, the first time people meet, they become acquainted through singing, and after that, they always like to talk about singing. Similarly, as soon as Tao Sheng saw Mr. Shi, the words about the bicycle blurted out without thinking.

"Did you not hurt yourself? What happened?" Mr. Shi asked.

"It's also because I was riding too fast, but I can't blame myself entirely. When the bike passed the Gaoshan Road intersection, there was a crowd of people waiting for the tram. There were always thirty to fifty people or more. As I was pedaling past, ringing the bell all the way, a man suddenly squeezed out from the side, standing numbly in the middle of the road, still asking, "Has the tram come yet?" My bike couldn't stop in time, and I was afraid of hitting the man, so I threw myself onto the tram tracks." Tao Sheng is an innocent and mischievous girl, and she was gesturing as she spoke. After speaking roughly, there was still a sigh of annoyance between her eyebrows.

"Let me take the bike back and repair it for you.——Don't you believe I can fix it well?" Mr. Shi said, and gave a polite smile. Tao Sheng was very unwilling to let him take it to repair, because if it was repaired well, she would owe him a favor, and if it wasn't repaired well, she couldn't complain, and it would only delay time in vain. However, he had said it first, and if she didn't let him repair it, it would seem that she didn't believe he could fix it well, and it would make him unable to step down immediately. She had no choice but to give the bike to him.

An amateur trainee is not a professional technician after all. Because the body parts were not properly aligned, Tao Sheng fell again and almost let a passing truck...

In addition to being frustrated, Tao Sheng couldn't help but blame Mr. Shi.

As for Mr. Shi, the joy in his heart aroused ten times his diligence, and he became even more ingratiating.

One day, Tao Sheng pushed her bicycle out of the office and met Mr. Shi at the door. Mr. Shi was also riding a bicycle and accompanied her home all the way. On the way, he repeatedly invited her to have tea and rest, and could not resist Tao Sheng's repeated refusals. He came up with some other topics to talk about. Talking is like writing an article. If you talk well, you are clear, concise, and to the point. If you don't talk well, it's a mess, and you especially can't attract people's attention. In the end, you even confuse yourself. So, you don't look at the red lights or the green lights, and you don't care if there are cars in front or beside you...

"Crash..."——A bicycle crashed into a policeman's stone platform, and the bike finally lay on the asphalt road, and the owner sprawled on the ground. A three-wheeled car sped past beside him, taking away a piece of skin from his arm. A rickshaw behind him inexcusably pulled over the bicycle.

As the saying goes: "There is one, there is two, there must be three!" Tao Sheng had fallen twice, and this time even she herself thought that it was bound to be her turn to cause trouble.

However, in fact, it was Mr. Shi who was injured, not her. This time, Mr. Shi's ankle was broken!

Tao Sheng returned home and didn't say a word for a long time. Later, she seriously said to her father: "Father, we must never ride too fast when we ride our bikes in the future, especially don't talk to people on the bike, and we should always check our bikes for any problems, otherwise it's too dangerous. The road is like a tiger's mouth."

Father nodded.

From then on, Tao Sheng was cautious and careful. However, who dares to say that there are no careless cyclists on the road!

### Shanghai News Cup Basketball League: Recent Situations of Groups A and B

The Shanghai News Cup Basketball League, for both Groups A and B, is shaping up well. After a one-week suspension, it will resume today as scheduled. Below are recent situation analyses for each section of Group A and Group B, which team members and fans can use as a guide.

Group A: China Union Drug Factory Leads the Pack

China Union Drug Factory has won all six of its matches, remaining the only undefeated team, making them the top contender for the championship. Following closely behind is Zhongbei Shantai Team, with only one loss. Dahua and Huanan, each with two losses, still have a chance to strive for the top. Mingxing, Renyu, Tongren, and Huaying will compete for higher rankings. V, having suffered repeated defeats, seems destined for last place. Attached is the situation table:

Group B Section 1: Renyu and Lusheng are Evenly Matched

In Group B Section 1, Renyu and Lusheng are evenly matched, both currently on winning streaks. The two teams also met in the Morning Friends Cup, where Lusheng won by a significant margin. Renyu has strengthened its lineup for this competition, determined to avenge that defeat and win the section championship. Chengfu is highly motivated, while Zhongxing and Fanjiang seem less capable.

Group B Section 2: Dahua and China Storage are Strong Contenders

In this section, the Fatty Team and China Storage Team have both won all three of their matches, while Dahua B has won all two of its matches, all progressing simultaneously. In terms of actual strength, Dahua seems to have a slight advantage, but the Fatty Team players have rich experience, and may have clever strategies to defeat their opponents. Therefore, the top spot in Section 2 will definitely be contested by these two teams. China Storage also enjoys a strong reputation in the banking industry, making this section the most exciting and competitive.

Group B Section 3: The Flying Team is Brilliant; The Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) is Promising

The Flying Team has won all four of its matches in Section 3, making their future bright. The YMCA, with fewer matches played, also remains undefeated. The YMCA's recent performance has shown great progress, having won other Group B league championships. It is possible that they could stand out and surpass the Flying Team. The Feihong team has yet to win a match and is currently at the bottom.

Group B Section 4: Moore Wins All, Shantai Follows Closely

Shantai Team continues the style of Group A, presenting a particularly excellent performance. They are indeed a rare team in Group B. They still have two matches to play, so they should be ranked after Moore, who has won all four matches. However, when Shantai meets Moore, the latter may find it difficult to withstand their attacks. Shantai is generally considered the most promising, followed by Moore. The Bombing Team is mediocre and unlikely to develop, while Xiafeng still has potential.

Group B Section 5: The Morning Friends (Blue) Team Stands Out

The teams in Section 5 are the most evenly matched. Zhenyuan, for example, has lost two matches in a row, but only by a small margin. Tie Fu also suffered a crushing defeat, but still has hope for the future. The Morning Friends (Blue) team currently stands out from the crowd, but there are many hidden reefs ahead, so they must proceed with caution. The team has veterans like Wang Lidu and Wang Cunrui, which should make it easier for them to develop. Linglong is the weakest team in terms of strength.

Group B Section 6: Zhongbei and Lingyou will Fight for the Championship

In this section, the team with the most hope for last place is likely to be Qiangshi and Jianyi. It should be noted that Qiangshi is purely organized by teachers and staff from a school, which is unique in Shanghai. Although their basketball skills are inferior, this point is still worth mentioning. The leader of this section is likely to be Zhongbei, influenced by Group A team members. Moreover, with skilled players like Mu Shiyan, there is high hope that they will surpass Lingyou and seize the top spot.

Overall, Group B has not yet reached a critical stage. The competition resumes today, and all subsequent matches will be increasingly crucial. It is predicted that all the young heroes will be ready for battle, hoping to win the section championship. After the section champions are determined, they will still need to compete for the overall championship, with the elite from the six sections facing off. This may be no less exciting than the Group A competition, and may also produce many rising stars.

Competition Resumes Today After a Week-Long Break

The Shanghai News Cup will resume today as scheduled, with the same order as before. However, the matches originally scheduled for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of next week will be made up for the three days of suspension this week. The order will then be adjusted accordingly, except for Sundays. There are many exciting Group A matches next week, with the Dahua vs. Mingxing game on Monday being a highlight. The latter has been diligently practicing, and their basketball skills have been improving daily, which will pose a threat to Dahua.

China Union vs. Shantai Showdown on Wednesday

The China Union vs. Shantai match on Wednesday the 12th) has been the talk of the town for basketball fans. Some say China Union is sure to win, while others say that Shantai, having suffered a crushing defeat to Huanan, has been working hard to avenge the defeat. It is said that Shantai has been actively arranging friendly matches with various teams and discussing strategies at the club, showing their ambition. China Union has maintained a consistent spirit from beginning to end, with scheduled practice. Fans should arrive early on the day to avoid disappointment, as the venue is small and has limited capacity.

Two Exciting Group A Games on Friday

On Friday, one Group A match is between Huaying and Mingxing. The former is a movie star team, while the latter's Mingxing is organized by employees of the Mingxing Perfume Factory, hence the name. Both teams have been performing well, but both have recently had the same weakness: difficulty getting a full team together. However, this match is crucial for their rankings, and they will both do their best to compete. The other match is between Zhongbei and Dahua, which is also expected to be a sensation. Zhongbei's performance has a large following, and Dahua is undoubtedly a top-tier team. Moreover, both teams have many veterans with long-standing reputations in the basketball world, each with experience and unique skills. The performance is expected to be excellent.

### Preview of the East China vs. Portuguese Business Soccer League Match This Morning

Today at 10:00 AM, the East China vs. Portuguese Business match at Yiyuan is expected to be one of the most exciting matches since the start of the season. When two strong teams meet, a fierce battle is inevitable. Moreover, this year's competition adopts a single round-robin system, where wins and losses affect the future of the championship. Both sides will be more cautious to strive for victory. Therefore, in addition to strength, intelligence is also needed. The team with the better strategy and tactics will win.

The Portuguese Business Team's Lineup is Fierce and Intimidating

The Portuguese Business team's lineup has been announced and has been slightly adjusted from the friendly match against Lianyi in the Welfare Cup. Veteran hero Costantin has been moved to left midfield, while Bauhio has been moved to center defense, and rising star Camabolro has been assigned to left wing. With this adjustment, the defense line is solid and formidable, and the forwards are also fierce and intimidating. In recent days, they have been working hard to prepare for the battle. East China has no choice but to face this strong enemy. However, I am worried about whether they can emerge victorious. East China's performance in recent matches has not been ideal. Except for Dai Linjing, the other veterans are not in good form. If Li Ning and Sun Jinshun cannot restore their peak performance from the end of last season, then this battle will be difficult, which is worrying!

Clamping Down on Foun is the Key to Victory

In terms of forwards, Portuguese Business is better than East China in the center. Foun is an excellent right winger in Shanghai, with fast dribbling, passing, and shooting. He is a dangerous person in the Portuguese team. A-Liang and Li Ning are no match for him in terms of speed. This player should not be confronted head-on. Instead, they should observe the ball's position, stand in the appropriate position, and attack him from both sides. With Liang and Li's experience and full effort, they may be able to curb his fierceness. Tan Fuhen, in addition to intercepting in midfield, should often retreat to assist in defense to compensate for Liang and Li's shortcomings. If Foun is contained, the Portuguese team's right-wing attack will be greatly weakened, and the overall situation will be stabilized. After Costantin gets the ball as the left midfielder, he should remember not to dribble too much. He should look for opportunities to pass the ball forward, and then run with the ball for thirty yards until he is exhausted, and then advance. Costantin is old. Although he has rich experience, his stamina cannot match the young guys.

Zhang Banglun's recent performance has been poor, and he is expected to make an effort to improve. He should pay special attention to V. Su Ruozhi's long shots. Zhang Lingen should not go out too far and should closely monitor Su Ruo without giving him any slack. If Su Ruo reduces his activity, then the Portuguese team's right-wing attack will not be so intimidating.

In short, this battle is a contest of intelligence and strength. With the strong spirit of the East China players and their united front, if they can fight steadily step by step, then although the Portuguese are tough, they are not invincible. Encourage and hope!

### More Than a Hundred Athletes Participate in Sports Meet

The Shanghai YMCA Sports Department hosted the Shanghai Autumn Sports Meet at the Russian Overseas Chinese Sports Association's new track and field on Taishan Road and Wuxing Road (near Wenlin Road) this morning at 9:00 AM. A total of 111 male and female athletes participated. Shanghai's track and field stars, such as sprinter Zhu Shafei, javelin thrower Wang Xuewu, long jumper Liu Dekuan, high jumper Li Zhenzhong, discus thrower Guo Qichang, shot putter Guan Hongda, and long-distance runners Wang Zhenglin and Lou Wenao, all attended. This is an unprecedented grand event for track and field in Shanghai after the war. There will also be group calisthenics performed by the YMCA Middle School performance group, various Chinese martial arts and wrestling performances by the Jingwu Sports Association, the Minsheng National Arts Research Society, the News Daily National Arts Class, and the YMCA. YMCA fitness group will perform weightlifting and bodybuilding exercises. Famous national arts teachers Tong Zhongyi and Yu Fuhong were also invited to the venue to perform their lifelong skills. The conference was enthusiastically sponsored by YMCA member Zhang Yixiang, who covered the expenses and collected many prizes from various parties. (Happy)

### Miscellaneous

The Tie Fu football and basketball team set off for Nantong this Monday to raise funds for winter relief in the area. The four female celebrities of the "Four Sisters" also accompanied them. The entire team is scheduled to return to Shanghai today.

After the Morning Friends Cup, it is said that there will be a Bank Cup, limited to bank employees. Xie Yiqin of the Salt Industry Bank is very enthusiastic. Xie was the backbone of the previous Banking Friendship Association basketball league. This revival is also due to the fact that the lives of bank employees are too dull.

Zhengxing Girls' Middle School initiated and hosted the Zhengxing Cup Shanghai Women's Individual Table Tennis Championship. The regulations were drafted by committee member Chen Linsheng. A committee meeting will be held at the school today at 3:00 PM, and advisors (the "King of Balls") are welcome.
