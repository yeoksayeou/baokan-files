### Japanese Planes Bomb Leyte Gulf, Sinking or Damaging Seven Enemy Ships; Surprise Attack on Morotai Airfield Also Inflicts Heavy Damage

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:44 PM on the 2nd: (1) On November 1st, Japanese air units bombed enemy warships in Leyte Gulf, sinking one battleship or cruiser, three cruisers, and damaging three battleships. (2) Since October 16th, Japanese air units have been conducting daily surprise attacks on enemy bases on Morotai Island, each time bombing enemy airfields and nearby facilities. The surprise attack on October 31st was the most successful, with four enemy airships catching fire and crashing, and a large number of enemy planes, including two B-24s, catching fire. A large fire also broke out in the airfield area. In this attack, three Japanese planes did not return.

Manila, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Japanese air units in the Philippines have been continuously and fiercely bombing enemy landing forces in Leyte Gulf. On the 31st, they also attacked enemy airfields on Leyte Island, with three hits and fires at each of the Tacloban and Dulag airfields, and two hits and fires at the Seaplane Base airfield. Also, on one day, thirty to forty large planes and over thirty P-38s attacked the Kuktangbalot area in the Visayas region. Japanese air units engaged them in aerial combat.

The Philippine Offensive and Defensive War Enters the Stage of Contesting for Dominance

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The offensive and defensive war in the Philippines has entered the stage of contesting for dominance in the Pacific War in all three aspects: land, sea, and air. Every battle will affect the future of the decisive battle, and the fierce attacks continue. The enemy forces rely on material quantity and are constantly reinforcing, but they have already suffered heavy losses. The number of enemy ships sunk or capsized in Leyte Gulf is increasing daily. The enemy's aircraft carriers have been repeatedly sunk or damaged by the Japanese forces. Therefore, they are desperately seeking to replenish their fleet and air power, and are even attempting to strengthen the air raids on the Philippines with the air power of the enemy bases in the Morotai Island area. The Japanese air units are launching preemptive attacks to crush their attempt.

Manila, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese garrison on Leyte Island is still bravely repelling the enemy forces. The results of the battle up to the 30th are as follows: one cruiser and one destroyer destroyed, over 150 landing craft sunk, one 15-cm gun destroyed, over ten tanks destroyed, over twenty enemy planes shot down, and approximately 3,000 to 4,000 enemy casualties.

### American Aircraft Carrier Investigation in the Philippines

Japanese Military Base in the Philippines, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to an investigation on the 31st, the enemy aircraft carrier strength in the Philippines is as follows: one in Leyte Gulf, one standard type and one converted type east of Lamon Bay, one standard type and one converted type east of Siargao Island. In addition, there is an enemy mobile unit 300 nautical miles east of Luzon Island. In total, there are six to seven American aircraft carriers currently in the Philippines. The enemy's aircraft carrier-based air raids on the Philippines are as follows: 243 on the 26th, 283 on the 27th, 10 on the 28th, 36 on the 29th, none on the 30th, and none on the 31st. The number of enemy aircraft carrier-based air raids is decreasing daily. As can be seen from the above, especially on the 29th and 30th, the Japanese kamikaze attack teams sank one large enemy aircraft carrier, damaged one large aircraft carrier, and damaged one medium and one small aircraft carrier. Therefore, the reason for the decrease in enemy aircraft carrier-based air raids in the past few days is clear. The Battle of Leyte Island will determine the fate of the Pacific, which is known and acknowledged by not only the people of Japan and the United States, but also the world. The reason for the decrease in American aircraft carrier-based planes on this battlefield is whether land-based planes are replacing carrier-based planes. The number of enemy land-based planes attacking the Philippines in the past few days is as follows: 88 on the 26th, 55 on the 27th, 57 on the 28th, 15 on the 29th, 65 on the 30th, and 57 on the 31st. Moreover, when Japanese forces scouted the Tacloban and Dulag airfields on the 1st of this month, there were no enemy planes. From this, it can be seen that the enemy's aircraft carrier strength has been almost completely depleted by the Japanese forces. American naval authorities have claimed to have 100 aircraft carriers in the Pacific, and their operational power in the Gilbert, Marshall, and Mariana Islands is to have 20 to 30 aircraft carriers to protect the operations. Why is there less than 20 to 30 aircraft carriers providing protection in Leyte Island? This is nothing more than ironclad proof that American aircraft carriers have suffered an unprecedentedly large blow.

### Manila Organizes Home Defense Corps

Editorial

### On Efficiency

Any undertaking must strive for efficiency. In the modern environment of scientific prosperity and mechanical progress, efficiency is emphasized. In today's decisive stage, it is even more important to increase the overall efficiency of the nation.

The overall efficiency of a nation arises from the lives and work of each individual. There is no way to talk about national efficiency without life, and there is no way to talk about national efficiency without work. However, even with both life and work, it is necessary to consider the coordination of life and work before talking about national efficiency. The following are four ways to discuss this separately:

1.  Living for Life: Everything is aimed at personal life, and the desires of life are endless. After being well-fed and warmly clothed, one hopes for comfort, and after comfort, one seeks wealth and luxury. It is not enough to care for one's own life, but also to worry about the lives of one's children and grandchildren. Therefore, those who are diligent and busy, their purpose is here. Although it seems that they are busy all day long and their work is heavy, it does not help the overall efficiency of the nation. It is precisely because their private desires are rampant that they disregard shame and use any means, even at the expense of exploiting the interests of others and damaging the vitality of others. Therefore, the result of living for life is sufficient to maliciously reduce the overall efficiency of the nation.
2.  Working for Life: With neither money nor power, and no means to develop one's private desires, or with higher moral standards, one is unwilling to follow the crowd and be a pawn for others and share the profits. Then one has no choice but to use the income from work to feed oneself. However, the needs of life are endless, and hunger and cold are ruthless. To keep a family of five from freezing and starving, one cannot go a day without work. As for the type of work and the nature of the work, one has no time to choose. Regardless of the interest in the work, one only seeks the income. Therefore, one will do any work, and one will rush around east and west, working day and night. Even if life is maintained as a result, the results are almost equal to zero, or even below zero. Therefore, the result of working for life is sufficient to naturally reduce the overall efficiency of the nation.
3.  Working for Work: Either with the blessing of ancestors, or with sudden wealth through speculation, after squandering, one's conscience is discovered, and the desire for profit is transformed into a desire for fame. Therefore, some run charitable organizations, some run schools, and even some open factories and run businesses. However, because their education is limited, and they are infected with the habits of a dandy, they do not know the essence of various undertakings, let alone the technology of various undertakings. In the end, they are neither able to give orders nor receive orders, and the undertakings wither, and those that stagnate and collapse are rare. From the standpoint of forgiveness, there is nothing wrong with being able to work for work. However, from the perspective of national total productivity, the results may be able to make a slight contribution, but in reality, they are often equal to zero or even below zero.
4.  Living for Work: Neither extremely poor nor suddenly wealthy, life is stable and not extravagant, and living is reasonable and without worries. With cultivated character and skilled skills, one learns in youth and acts in adulthood, each choosing the department of work that is closest to their nature as their lifelong career, in order to give full play to their abilities and talents. To damage their work is like harming their life. If all undertakings are centered on this kind of talent and based on this kind of spirit, then with daily accumulation, one can gradually make some achievements and then talk about the overall efficiency of the nation.

China is known as a nation of 400 million people, and it is also vast in land and rich in resources. The reason why it is so weak is that there are too few people who live for work. Even if there are some, they are not enough to counter the other three factors. Is the low overall efficiency of the nation accidental? According to statistics from the tenth year of the Republic of China, the efficiency of each person in China was only one-fortieth of that of Europe and the United States. After twenty years of evolution, it is undoubtedly getting worse. In this critical moment, how to reform the organization of society, change the control of the economy, and improve the concept of life, so that the majority of the people can live for work, so as to improve efficiency and seek the survival of the nation, I hope that people with good intentions will think deeply about it.

### Police Bureau Investigates Dangerous Goods Businesses

The Administrative Office of the Municipal Police Bureau is investigating the operation, storage, or disposal of dangerous goods such as explosives, gunpowder, and flammable liquids, which pose a risk to the property of individuals and the public. For the sake of public safety and special prevention, it is urgently necessary to manage them meticulously. In the past, the Public Works Bureau and the First District Public Office required that the storage or disposal of the aforementioned dangerous goods be submitted for approval and licensing before the relevant business could be carried out. However, in the meantime, due to changes in administrative areas or administrative organizational changes, the request for approval has not been comprehensive. Therefore, in view of the importance of dangerous goods to public safety, a detailed investigation should be conducted first for those who operate, store, or dispose of dangerous goods, as well as non-operators who exceed a certain amount for personal or family use, in order to prepare and manage relevant necessary preventive measures. Therefore, investigation forms have been issued, ordering each branch bureau to conduct a thorough investigation and report to the bureau for approval within ten days. The investigation form must specify the name of the person in charge, location, quantity, equipment, and other details.

### Elderly Care Issues: Symposium (2)

Huang Jingwan: The elderly suffer from many diseases due to age, and most of them are due to malnutrition and lack of hygiene knowledge. Now, we especially invite Ding Fulao to talk about the nutrition and hygiene of the elderly.

(3) Nutrition and Hygiene of the Elderly

Ding Fubao: I have been studying longevity methods and found that the elderly over 80 or 90 years old and centenarians, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, all eat two meals a day and are vegetarians throughout their lives. This is because meat eaters' meat rots in the intestines, causing chronic poisoning, especially in the elderly, whose digestive power is weak, so vegetarian food is most suitable. Soybeans in vegetarian food contain a large amount of vitamins, protein, and fat, and are rich in nutrition, but they should be chewed carefully and swallowed slowly, and drinking more boiled water is most hygienic and should be practiced more. Good air circulation is indispensable for health. Most elderly care organizations have several people living in the same room, so I hope they will open more windows to keep the air fresh, and take deep breaths outside, which will not only benefit health but also calm the mind and cultivate nature. I hope the elderly will practice more, and also walk more to replace exercise. Most elderly people live in seclusion and rarely go out, which is actually very bad. I hope the elderly will make more use of space to relax their blood vessels. The above is physical health care. In addition, the most important thing is mental health care, which is to be happy all day long, accept blessings with respect, and practice the eight virtues, then the mind will be broad and the body will be healthy, and one can reach the realm of longevity.

Master Fan Cheng: Sakyamuni regarded birth, old age, sickness, and death as the sufferings of life. Now, I am grateful to Ding Fulao for his thorough explanation of the words sickness and old age, and I hope the elderly will follow and not forget them.

Yang Yusheng: The elderly are mentally frail and need support, and it is especially important for young people to respect the elderly. I hope all sectors will earnestly promote the elderly care and respect for the elderly movement.

Fang Zijun: The issue of elderly care is not only an issue for the elderly. We hope that in addition to the elders present today, the elderly, strong, and young people all over the world should pay attention to the issue of elderly care. At the same time, the elderly care movement is not just a temporary discussion at one or two symposiums or the Sixth Sixth Respect for the Elderly Festival, but needs to have this impression permanently engraved in people's minds. Therefore, the elderly care and respect for the elderly movement needs to be promoted in terms of both time and object.

Tang Zuxiang: The elderly care movement needs to be earnestly promoted and be practical. We are presenting specific methods today for reference, such as launching elderly care assistance funds, elderly care cemeteries, free park tours, preferential treatment for boats and vehicles, preferential treatment for hotels, medical services, and entertainment for the elderly.

Zhao Ximing: I think that when providing relief to the elderly, we should pay attention to the poorest and most helpless groups and elderly people.

Yang Yusheng: There is currently a bad phenomenon in the market that is closely related to the health of the elderly, that is, doctors in various hospitals are very welcoming to children's diseases, but they are indifferent to elderly diseases. In other words, pediatricians are very prosperous, but elderly disease experts are not seen, which is really not a blessing for the elderly.

Tang Zuxiang: I hope that all hospitals will universally set up free quotas or free beds.

Ying Yongyu: Donations can be used to promote the idea by opinion leaders, appealing to all sectors to recognize and donate a certain number of free beds, and then various newspapers and hospitals will introduce patients for treatment. Regarding elderly groups, I advocate dispersing them to the suburbs, which can reduce expenses.

Tang Zuxiang: As reported by the various nursing homes just now, the elderly are working by chanting scriptures and folding foil, which is extremely passive. We should promote active work and engage in production, such as light work like matchboxes and stapling notebooks, on the one hand to pass the time, and on the other hand to produce.

Yang Yusheng: In short, the work should be based on benefiting the crowd.

Ying Yongyu: Regarding the retirement of the elderly, we should promote the old-age pension system. On the one hand, it can allow young people in the workforce to work with peace of mind, and on the other hand, elderly employees will not be subjected to living pressure. Especially with the current soaring prices, the old-age pension system is even more needed. I hope that various companies, factories, and organizations will provide retirement pensions and retirement gifts to employees over 60 years of age who are weak in energy and not suitable for service, but have meritorious service. At the same time, promote the employee savings system, with monthly or annual deposits, and the company authorities will double the deposits, to be paid to employees when they leave the job due to old age. In addition to old-age pensions, elderly care insurance is also an effective method.

(5) The Elderly Care Movement Needs Organization

Sun Xiangzhong: I have benefited a lot from the broad opinions of the elders today. The central emotion is really not something that can be covered in a few words. First, I hope there will be an organization. The organization should include enthusiastic people from all walks of life, on the one hand to listen to the suffering and needs of the elderly, and on the other hand to make practical plans. Only with organization can it not be scattered, and only then can it produce strength. Second, the society's respect for the elderly movement is not yet universal, and it is also not in line with reality. I hope that public opinion will promote it more, with love as the driving force and respect as the destination. Third, the elderly care movement should not have the religious barriers of Confucianism, Buddhism, Christianity, and Taoism. It is the same career, and it should not have门户之见 due to the identity or beliefs of the organizers, indirectly hindering its progress. Finally, I hope that the elderly themselves should not regard themselves as old, accept offerings willingly, but should cheer up, lead young people to inspire people's hearts, have great ambitions, and virtues of benevolence and love, and exert their spiritual power to influence the world, and then they are worthy of being called "national elders", "world elders", and "great elders of the world."

Huang Jingtou: On this good day, thank you for your guidance and great contributions to the elderly care movement. The central gratitude is indescribable. Now, please enjoy the entertainment program. (Finally, the representative of the National Music Research Association played a famous Guqin song under the group Guo Qiuyue, and everyone dispersed happily.) (End)
