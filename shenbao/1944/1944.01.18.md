### Assisting Education Through Promoting Schools

In recent years, the movement to assist education has gained momentum through the promotion of various sectors, with a vigorous atmosphere. The number of donors and the amount of donations have gradually increased, and the number of students applying for scholarships in this session is particularly crowded. Observing this phenomenon, we can gain various factual understandings: People in the general public are gradually realizing the urgency of the country's need for talent and the importance of talent to the country's future. Therefore, they extend their love for their own children to assist children from poor families. People in the general public are also gradually recognizing the importance of education, especially the universality that education should possess. Therefore, they use collective methods to reduce the anxieties of poor children in seeking education. All parents wish to send their children to school. In the small sense, they hope that their children will have considerable cultivation in character and academics and will be able to support themselves in the future. In the broad sense, they hope that their children will become adults and establish careers, not only to serve the country but also to bring honor to their families. Therefore, even when their resources are insufficient, they still pay attention to scholarships to complete their children's education. All young people are pure and lovely, and their desire for knowledge surpasses their desire for food and drink. Under the pressure of family finances, they have to seek ways to make a living first to reduce the burden on their parents, but the pain of being deprived of education in their hearts is often unbearable, and they cannot help but feel sad and shed tears in the quiet nights. Therefore, when there is an opportunity for scholarships, they must apply based on their excellent grades, hoping to achieve their ideal goals.

From this perspective, to repay the enthusiasm of people in society, the responsibility lies with schools at the secondary level and above, striving to cultivate talent based on the actual needs of quantity and quality for the use of the country and society. From this perspective, belonging to the nature of universal education, the responsibility lies with schools at the secondary level and below, striving for low tuition fees and reasonable standards, especially paying attention to the physical and mental well-being of students to meet the expectations of people in society. Regarding both of these perspectives, although the targets are parents or the young students themselves, the responsibilities of the schools are the same as in both of those mentioned before, and they should be even more vigilant to avoid "misleading young people."

The entire education problem is originally one aspect of the undertakings that the government should handle. The fact that there are so many private schools in Shanghai is already an abnormal state, which will not be discussed in detail here. During this wartime, the government has been unable to plan for everything. Therefore, people in society are encouraging their spirit of "everyone has a responsibility" and are voluntarily sharing the government's burden. However, things have appearances and realities, and names have emptiness and substance. If we only pursue the appearance without seeking the reality, and only see the emptiness without actualizing it, then the price of enthusiasm may not be enough to achieve what is expected. Therefore, social pioneers with more abundant resources have already taken measures to promote schools, either by contributing funds to establish ideal middle schools or by planning to establish practical vocational schools. These are all expressions of the spirit of promoting schools, taking it as their mission to reverse the prevailing trends and complementing the movement to assist education. If we can first establish a model in Shanghai where all levels of schools are practical and realistic, then people will have a sense of right and wrong and judge their merits and demerits, and people will have a sense of love and hate and know what to choose and discard. By learning from each other and competing with each other, we can rectify the atmosphere of learning and thus meet the expectations of the above four points. The human and material resources required to establish new schools must be large, so we can also take a moderate approach by reorganizing and assisting existing schools, which seems lighter and easier to do. In the National Forum of this newspaper on July 29 last year, Mr. Chen Shao  revealed his "From the Movement of Assisting 'Scholarships' to the Movement of Assisting 'Schools'", which seems to be the meaning of this. The discussion is quite detailed, and much is enough to inspire people to wake up and provide us with reference. At that time, it was a pity that it was near the beginning of the school year in various schools, and it may not have been noticed and adopted by society. Now, it is brought up early for discussion by those who are interested.

Our consistent advocacy for the education cause is to achieve the goals of universal education and cultivating talent, so in addition to calling for scholarships, we also discuss the meaning of promoting schools.

### Aviation Industry Association Established - Japanese Prime Minister Personally Sends Congratulatory Message - Encouraging Close Cooperation to Increase Aircraft Production

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Minister of Munitions Tojo, who also serves as the military minister, delivered a congratulatory speech at the establishment ceremony of the Aviation Industry Association.

### Dr. Okada Invents - New Method for Treating Cancer

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - According to a Nagoya telephone report: The treatment of cancer has been a long-standing problem that has not been resolved despite the painstaking research of the medical community in the past. Now, Dr. Kiyosaburo Okada of the Faculty of Medicine at Nagoya University has invented a treatment method. The method was announced in 1940, but this treatment involves injecting cancer essence extracted from 20-day rat cancer into the static group to destroy cancer cells and cause them to die. The results of animal experiments are used in the human body. According to recent clinical trials, the treatment of stomach cancer, esophageal cancer, breast cancer, uterine cancer, liver cancer, etc., has achieved good results, and there have been no recurrences for two and a half years after treatment. Many patients have returned to their original health before treatment, which has attracted the attention of the academic community. The following is a statement by Dr. Okada: Whether cancer can be completely cured requires long-term observation. In general, cancer is easier to treat in the early stages, and it is difficult to treat when the symptoms worsen and the cancer grows. Sometimes, complications such as stenosis and perforation often lead to deterioration. My treatment method recognizes that cancer patients, after being cured, should be able to work the same as healthy people. There are also many who can work for two and a half years from the start of treatment. Leaving aside the technical clinical treatment for the time being, I have particular confidence in the possibility of a cure.

### Zhang Yipeng - Addresses Staff

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - The newly appointed Minister of Justice, Zhang Yipeng, took office on the 16th and summoned the staff of the Ministry to give the following instructions: "Peng was ordered to take charge of the affairs of the Ministry of Justice and feels deeply fearful. Fortunately, he succeeded Luo Gong, and the wealth will not be lost. The Ministry of Justice and the Judicial Organization must be as the body that uses the arm, and the arm that uses the finger. The various institutions within the Ministry are also like this. From an objective point of view, the position of the Minister is the highest, but in fact, each department has its own special responsibilities and its own communication relationships. Internally and externally, successively and horizontally, the expression of political power lies entirely in this. Although the official ranks are of different sizes, the efforts of each person to fulfill their own responsibilities are the same. Life should be stable, and body and mind work should also be stable. All members of the department must work together and be responsible for their own duties. Yipeng is willing to take full responsibility and will never make things difficult for his colleagues. Former Minister Luo is now the Governor of Anhui Province and has agreed to continue to assist in the affairs of the Ministry. This is especially gratifying to Yipeng. A reporter from the Central News Agency went to interview the Minister in order to understand his policy direction and was granted an audience. He briefly stated that he has not yet fully reviewed all the files. The current plan is to first select talents to strengthen the promotion of judicial administration, and then adjust the judicial personnel in various places. The future policy direction and the points that should be promoted or reformed can only be told after reviewing all the files.

The training of security teams and police, etc., has achieved considerable results in the past. In order to ensure security in the future, it should be further strengthened.

### Prospects for the Pacific War (1)

The decisive battle situation of the Greater East Asia War is becoming increasingly fierce in both the East and the West. Especially on New Britain Island, the enemy's counterattacks, although entailing great sacrifices and attrition, have not yielded any major victories. However, in order to eliminate the pervasive war-weariness and to prepare for the presidential election this autumn, the enemy is expected to continue its fierce offensive. The Indian Ocean and the Aleutian Islands in the North Pacific have also become starting points for large-scale counterattacks. Regarding the progress of the war, we have absolute faith in the invincible soldiers of the land and sea forces on the front lines and have no anxiety. However, the full exertion of national strength is an indispensable element for victory in war. In modern warfare, a nation that accurately grasps the truth of the war situation and completes its combat deployment can wear the crown of victory, while the opposite is true for failure, as history has often demonstrated. At this juncture of transforming world history and deciding the three thousand-year fate of Japan, the one hundred million people in the rear should have a thorough understanding of the war situation unfolding in the waters surrounding Japan. War history tells us: "When the enemy challenges us with all their might, we must inflict a fierce blow on them and make them suffer the horrors of war, which is a step closer to victory." Now is the time for decisive victory, and the opportunity for victory is about to arrive. Whether we seize it or let it go, this key lies not only in the hands of the soldiers on the front lines but also in the hands of the people in the rear.

North Pacific

One of the key points of naval warfare is how to utilize the weather. The reason why there are no large-scale battles in this area now is that the movement of large fleets and the replenishment of forward bases are hindered by the raging waves of drifting ice and cannot proceed as desired. However, since the Japanese army withdrew from the Aleutians, the enemy has mobilized construction of airfields and troops to prepare the forward bases of Attu Island and Kiska Island. For example, on Attu Island, two airfields have been completed, and long-range large bombers can freely take off and land, conducting reconnaissance attacks on the northern Kuril Islands and Paramushiro Island.

The Alaska Highway, which is seventy feet wide and has a transportation capacity of tens of thousands of tons per month, is being utilized to the maximum extent. The enemy's base for operations in the North Pacific, Dutch Harbor, has stockpiles of military supplies piled up like mountains, which are gradually being transported to forward bases. In Dutch Harbor, Kodiak, Nome, Amchitka, Adak, Kiska, Attu, and other places, there are about one thousand aircraft, mainly heavy bombers, and the army includes about six divisions, including those in Alaska, and is also equipped with tanks, armored vehicles, parachute troops, etc. As for naval forces, according to reports from northern forward bases, there are two special-purpose aircraft carriers, two cruisers, and several destroyers and other vessels. On December 21st of last year, the U.S. Navy Department announced the appointment of Vice Admiral Frank Fletcher as the naval commander of the North Pacific area, from which it can also be inferred that a considerable fleet has been deployed in that area.

This route through the Aleutians was originally the operational base for the thorough bombing of the Japanese mainland, as stated by Alexander P. de Seversky, the leading American air power theorist: "Only Alaska or the Aleutians will do." Renowned military commentators also agreed with Seversky's opinion, saying: "The key to victory in the Pacific War lies in the North," advocating that jumping from island to island in the Central and South Pacific was extravagant, and they believed that this route was a "stepping stone to Japan" and had great expectations. Now is the preparatory period before the storm. In the 84th Diet session, Navy Minister Shimada said: "The defense of the North Pacific is becoming increasingly solid, and preparations for attack are also ready." Japan is also using this route as a stepping stone to the American continent, adopting a waiting and leaping posture.

Central Pacific

The four thousand five hundred soldiers under Major General Shibasaki, with their loyal blood, reddened the coral reefs of Tarawa and Makin Islands. More than a month after their heroic sacrifice, the enemy consumed two thousand nine hundred tons of steel and sacrificed tens of thousands of landing troops and more than twenty ships sunk at Tarawa and Makin Islands, forming an "undersea aircraft carrier fleet," giving the Japanese naval and air bases in the Marshall Islands, behind the Gilberts, an advantageous position for interior operations, and deploying a strong defensive line. This is also evident from the fact that the air battles over the Marshall Islands and the subsequent attacks by enemy aircraft on Mili Island, Maloelap Atoll, and Taroa Island were fiercely struck.

However, we cannot fail to note that the enemy's air force in this area has also completed its preparations. In the air battle over the Marshall Islands on December 5th, the enemy launched an attack with a mobile force mainly consisting of two aircraft carriers, using about one hundred carrier-based bombers and fighters to attack Japanese bases. The disadvantage of aircraft carriers intruding into the center of land-based air force spheres of influence has been a lesson learned since the start of the Greater East Asia War, especially in the air battles around the Gilbert and Bougainville Islands. However, the enemy still used aircraft carriers to launch attacks, which shows that the enemy's land-based bases in this area at that time did not have the ability to provide powerful air forces, and large aircraft with long-range endurance did not materialize.

However, ten days later, the enemy's attacks on the Marshall Islands were carried out by formations of twenty to thirty large Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers, each with seven or eight crew members. This simultaneous operation of multiple large aircraft proves that the enemy's land-based air force has been strengthened. However, the enemy's current attacks on the Marshall Islands are less of a genuine offensive and more of a means to defend against Japanese bombing and replenish enemy forces. Regarding the enemy's objective in the central invasion route, enemy reports also say that it is "an operation to strike directly at the Japanese mainland via the South Seas," but in reality, after the Gilbert Islands are strengthened, the enemy will target the South Seas within Japan's strategic sphere and attempt a third offensive, forming a pincer attack with the South Pacific, so the war in this area should be closely guarded.

### Free Movement of Rice Permitted Within the Joint Defense Area of Three Provinces and Two Cities: Rice Control Association Sends Letter to Authorities of Three Provinces and Two Cities

Central News Agency: The Provisional Regulations for the Management of Rice Transportation and Sales in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui have been amended and passed by the Executive Yuan on November 25th of last year and promulgated for implementation. It is now heard that in order to alleviate the panic among the people regarding food supplies in rural and urban areas, the Association, based on the provisions of Article 5 of the regulations, yesterday sent separate letters to the governments of the three provinces, as well as the special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai, providing explanations and requesting them to notify their subordinates to inform the people to comply with the regulations. The gist is as follows: All citizens are allowed to freely move their harvested rice within the same village or from the village to the county seat. If the rice is not harvested by themselves, but is only for their own consumption within the same administrative area, then it is limited to within eight kilograms and can also be freely transported. However, there are separate regulations regarding the movement of rice within the Shanghai control line. All people outside the control line are allowed to handle it according to this.

### Air Defense Training Results Are Generally Satisfactory: Statement by the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters

Central News Agency: The air defense training period from the 13th to the 15th has ended, and the results are generally satisfactory. The authorities of the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters have issued the following statement:

Although the training period was only two days, all sectors of the city were able to clearly recognize the current war situation and worked diligently throughout to achieve the expected objectives. The authorities are extremely satisfied. In modern warfare, cities are bound to be subjected to air raids. Recent air battles in Europe have shown that the extensive bombing has drawn the entire city's citizens into the vortex of war, even in rear areas. The citizens of this city, whether Chinese, Japanese, or foreigners, must unite as one, military, government, and civilians, to further strengthen the air defense posture in preparation for enemy attacks and to establish reliable countermeasures.

The results of this training are more satisfactory than last year, but judging from the actual situation of air-raided cities in modern times, there are still many shortcomings. We will now list the matters that require attention and have repeatedly warned about in the past, but there are still many areas that need to be improved. We express our regret on this point and hope that all citizens will pay more attention and immediately improve them without waiting for the next training session, so that they can cope with air raids at any time. Finally, we express our deep gratitude to all the citizens for their efforts.

### Matters Requiring Attention: Cooperation Among People of All Nationalities

The results of several training sessions have been quite good, but due to language barriers among people of various nationalities, communication of meaning is difficult, resulting in incomplete cooperation. In the future, air defense terminology and various regulations and signals will be studied.

Thorough Implementation of Various Controls

Lighting Control: 1. Lighting control has not been good this time. Although no light leakage was seen from the ground, light leakage was still visible from aircraft or high-rise buildings, especially in the area south of the Suzhou Creek. This was mostly due to incomplete light shielding of windows and skylights on the back sides of bustling street-side buildings and residences. 2. On the first day of the invasion, the state of alert control at the start of training was extremely poor. In the future, preparations must be made within the time period for issuing control orders, and alerts should be issued at any time. 3. During lighting control, there was still light leakage due to lack of shielding, and during alert control, some cars were still driving without lights or with excessively bright lights. Improvements must be made in the future.

Sound and Traffic Control: Sound and traffic control were generally satisfactory, but Chinese pedestrians still continued to move about during air raid alarms. After the issuance of alert alarm orders, those without urgent matters should stop going out and wait quietly at home.

Handling of Multiple Places Bombed Simultaneously and High-Altitude Bombing: People in general, especially in office areas, are not enthusiastic. Very few people implement damage and evacuation drills, which is regrettable.

Raising Training Standards

There has been rapid progress compared to the last time, but there is still excessive noise and too many people at each training location, which reduces work efficiency. Instructors must direct subordinates to ensure smooth progress of work. Cooperation with neighboring autonomous groups is not close. There have been refusals to lend various tools, causing inconvenience. In the future, Baojia must have a spirit of mutual assistance and engage in more cooperation. In general, people other than air defense personnel are indifferent to air defense. Many people regard air defense work as a kind of drama and watch from the sidelines, which is inappropriate.

Various Comprehensive Training Exercises

During various training exercises, the command of the instructors is still not thorough enough, causing confusion. Therefore, the squad leader must consider the number of squad members and make appropriate commands. The progress of work at a simulated damage location is often mixed with other work, hindering the progress of other work. Instructors must weigh the importance and urgency of work, make judgments promptly, and take appropriate measures.

Wounded First Aid Method

Each unit can quickly use wound treatment methods, and bandaging techniques have been improved. However, no practical training has been conducted on hemostasis. Each unit can quickly handle the transportation of the injured, but the following matters require further study and practice:

1. Rescue commanders failed to thoroughly command the work, causing confusion and affecting fire and gas defense work. 2. The location for first aid work at the incident site should be based on the principle of not being affected by smoke, fire, or poisonous gas and not hindering other work. 3. The stretcher method should be rapid, and the injured should not be tied too roughly. The performance of the exercises in the Shanghai area was particularly good.

### High School Second-Year Students Applying for Scholarships to Register Today: Mr. Yang Fusheng Generously Donates 20,000 Yuan Yesterday

The balance carried over from the previous session was 1,071,242 yuan, and the balance carried over to this session is 1,354,954 yuan.

### New Director of the Health Bureau, Yuan Junchang, Takes Office: Striving to Improve Future Health Administration

The new Director of the Shanghai Special Municipality Health Bureau, Yuan Junchang, arrived at the Bureau to take office at 11:00 am yesterday (the 17th). Mr. Yuan is a native of Shangyu, Zhejiang. He holds a Doctorate in Medicine from the University of Paris, France, and has received a silver medal from the French Academy of Medical Research. He graduated from the Higher Institute of Hygiene of the University of Paris and the Faculty of Tropical Diseases of the University of Paris. He was a researcher at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. In 1929, he represented the Chinese Ministry of Education and the National Central Research Institute at the 13th International Congress of Physiology held in the United States. Upon returning to China in 1929, he was appointed as a technical expert and section chief at the Central Epidemic Prevention Office in Peiping, and as the director of the Nanjing Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital, concurrently serving as a lecturer at the Army Medical School of the Ministry of Military Administration. In 1935, he was appointed as a technical expert and section chief at the Forensic Research Institute of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, as well as a consultant physician at the Sacred Heart Hospital in Shanghai. He then served as the superintendent of the Shanghai Puci Sanatorium, concurrently serving as the director of the Department of Mental and Neurological Diseases. When the concessions were taken over last year, he served as the deputy director of the First and Eighth District Health Offices of Shanghai.

Issuing a Statement

After taking office, Director Yuan issued a statement to reporters, saying: "Health administration is closely related to public health and social welfare. The city has a vast area and a dense population, making public health particularly important. The city is currently divided into eight districts, and due to different historical backgrounds, there are variations in various health facilities, allowing for comparisons of advantages and disadvantages to improve. Due to funding and other reasons, it may not be possible to achieve our ideal goals at once, but within the realm of possibility, we will do our best to meet the expectations of the public. This is also our responsibility. Politics is not about talking too much, but about being realistic, seeking truth, and striving forward. We hope for the assistance of the press and the public, which would be very fortunate."

Yesterday's Publication Time: 7:05 PM

Economic Sector

### Commentary: Protection of Producers

This year is a year of increased production, which is also a year of increasing the power of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, we are not afraid of being repetitive and will say everything we believe is related to the issue of production. The National Economic Commission recently convened its third plenary committee meeting in Nanjing. The chairman personally wrote an instruction, stating that this year's economic construction should focus on increased production, with increased production of food and cotton being the priorities. In addition to agriculture, attention must also be paid to light industry, such as yarn and flour industries. This shows that if we do not talk about increased production, then the only targets for increased production are the people's clothing and food, because "securing the home front" is the only way to "repel foreign enemies," which is a winning principle.

Returning to the topic of increased production, we feel that one sentence in the chairman's instruction is particularly worthy of our support, which is: "The government should devote its full efforts to the protection of producers, ensuring that producers can enjoy the fruits of their production." What is the protection of producers? Everything that disturbs producers from the outside, such as the looting by the Communist bandits, the extortion by corrupt officials, and the exploitation by unscrupulous troops, must be prohibited. This is certainly one explanation. Another explanation is what this column said on the National Day last year in the discussion "Increasing Agricultural and Industrial Production," that the state must embody protection within its rewards for increased agricultural and industrial production. The methods are as follows: 1. Pay special attention to guaranteeing the income of agricultural producers to encourage their reproduction. 2. Pay special attention to the advancement of labor welfare undertakings to ensure the livelihood of workers. 3. Support legitimate private business organizations to encourage their production of daily necessities for the people.

Discussion Content

Strengthen government-private liaison to make the relationship between the embassy, which is in a guiding position, and the business community, which is responsible for actual operations, closer. If the embassy has any shortcomings in its affairs or other aspects, the business community should actively offer opinions. The embassy will also make its best efforts to handle matters quickly. Those in charge of each industry should personally direct and enhance production and promote procurement. Those in charge of each industry should take the lead in personally directing to thoroughly convey the new Sino-Japanese relationship to subordinate organizations. Prioritize the allocation of human resources and make efforts to allocate human resources to important departments. Utilize material resources. In order to utilize raw materials, each industry should strengthen coordination, share resources, and use limited materials to achieve maximum results. This should also apply to technical issues.

Ambassador Tani's Speech: Total War, Forge Ahead Courageously

In brief: The scope of this world war and the intensity of the fighting are unprecedented in history. The world's major countries are divided into two camps: either ours or the enemy's, and a decisive battle is underway. In this war, there is no room for compromise to decide the fate of the nation. There is only victory or annihilation. The Greater East Asia War waged by Japan is also such a decisive battle to determine the fate of our Yamato people. Judging from past battles, the ambitions of Britain and the United States are increasingly exposed. However, whenever our Yamato people encountered national crises in the past, they relied on promoting the essence of unity to overcome all difficulties and prosper the nation. This is what history has shown since the founding of the country. Therefore, the people of the whole country, whether on the front lines or in the rear, should exert their total strength until the enemy kneels down. The war we need ahead is a war in which the whole country exerts its strength. Although the soldiers on the front lines are good at planning and fighting bravely, if even one person in the rear does not perform their duties, the Greater East Asia War cannot be won. In particular, this year is the third year of the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War, which is the most important year. Victory or defeat depends on this year. If the people recognize the situation and bravely forge ahead, then a glorious victory will undoubtedly be ours.

Sino-Japanese Relations Enter a New Stage

On January 9th of last year, the National Government announced its participation in the war, and the relationship between China and Japan entered a close stage of shared life and death. In order to adapt to this new relationship, the Japanese government decided on a fundamental policy of a new policy towards China. Recently, it has been implemented based on the new policy. The so-called new policy is to respect the self-determination and responsibility of the National Government, vigorously promote its autonomous activities, and strengthen the guiding force of the National Government. For example, returning concessions, returning the Beijing Embassy area, abolishing taxation rights, handling enemy property, adjusting Sino-Japanese joint venture companies, and strengthening the Commercial Control Association and its subordinate institutions are all concrete manifestations of the new policy. The so-called new policy is not a new policy. It is to implement the policies that Japan has wanted to implement for many years but could not due to external obstacles. The new policy is a manifestation of the original relationship between China and Japan, and it is also a measure that Japan should take. The promotion of Japan's fundamental policy towards China has further led to the conclusion of a treaty of alliance to replace the old basic treaty, and the announcement of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident in China, six years have passed. During this period, various incidents have been caused in order to carry out war actions. Therefore, the current situation is still quite different from Japan's goals. However, restoring the relationship between China and Japan to the normal relationship revealed by the treaty of alliance and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is our major mission in the third year of the decisive battle. The establishment of a normal Sino-Japanese relationship is the beginning of a new order in Greater East Asia. The completion of the new order in East Asia will enable the empire to survive and defend itself.

Work Hard to Establish Friendly Relations

At the same time, East Asia will also be stable, which is by no means an exaggeration. Judging from the pure mistakes of the Moscow Conference and the Cairo Conference, the Sino-Japanese Incident is entirely a link in the world war. Our opponent is by no means a warlord or politician in Chongqing, but the hearts of 400 million Chinese people. The warlords and politicians in Chongqing ignore Japan's fair policies and follow Britain and the United States, and the distance between them and the Chinese people who wholeheartedly remember China is even greater. The Greater East Asia War has entered its third year, and the domestic systems in Japan are becoming more complete, and the morale of the people is rising. We, the compatriots in China, should reflect on whether the allocation of our occupations and the business of our businesses can conform to the domestic system? Can we reach the point of Sino-Japanese co-existence and co-prosperity? I hope that my compatriots in China will entrust as much work and affairs as possible to Chinese people in order to conform to the domestic labor mobilization plan. Today, all of you present are advanced people who are working hard in various aspects of the business community. If you allow me to express my opinions frankly, you will all agree that Shanghai has always been the place with the strongest British and American influence. Although the Shanghai concessions have been recovered and enemy property is being gradually disposed of, it is not easy to eliminate the British and Americans in the hearts of the Chinese people. I have heard a certain important person in China say that Shanghai people are a unique race different from Chinese people. You are in contact with Chinese people in a unique atmosphere every day, and I believe you are working very hard. Your efforts to establish friendly Sino-Japanese relations can be said to be effective. I would like to take this opportunity to hope that you will earnestly implement the following three points: (1) Actively cooperate to enhance combat power; (2) Implement Sino-Japanese economic cooperation based on mutual benefit; (3) Practice the spirit of morality.

Certificates for inoculation used in this city can be obtained from any health sub-office mentioned above. Certificates for inoculation required for leaving Shanghai are only issued by the health sub-office at 340 Hankou Road. Business firms, factories or other organizations that want to request personnel to go to the firms or organizations to inoculate their employees can submit a written request to the director of the health department of this office. However, all the said firms or organizations must be located within this district and must have 100 or more employees inoculated at the same time. In addition, a fee of two yuan per person must be paid, plus the round-trip fare of the inoculation vehicle dispatched by this office, calculated at 20 yuan per mile. The total amount used will be invoiced by this office to the firms after the event. Groups that want to apply for vaccine seedlings and ask their own doctors to inoculate can apply to the nearest health sub-office in writing through the registered doctor. This is hereby announced for general information. October 2, 32nd year of the Republic of China.

### Order at the North Station Needs Thorough Improvement

-- Shan Cuo

The long-troubled order at the North Station, since the Chinese and Japanese authorities decided to abolish the universal inspection of passengers from January 1st, the entrance and exit gates have been slightly more convenient. However, due to the large number of passengers inside and outside the station, the crowded situation is still common, and there are frequent reports of injuries to women, children, the elderly. In addition, train tickets are not easy to obtain, and such things still cannot thoroughly relieve the suffering of passengers. On the one hand, it is due to the large-scale activities of unlicensed vendors; on the other hand, the railway system needs to be improved, which is undeniable. I secretly hope that the Huazhong Railway Company authorities can further implement improvements. The methods are simple and feasible, and the benefits to passengers are great. Therefore, I will list them as follows based on my limited observations:

(1) Restore the South Station and change the South-bound Shanghai-Hangzhou trains to depart from the South Station, so that passengers traveling along the coastal Hangzhou line can enter and exit from the South Station, which can reduce the congestion at the North Station by at least one-third or more. Otherwise, another station can be opened nearby, such as Tiantong'an Station.

(2) After passengers enter the North Station, they still have to wait until one quarter of an hour before departure before checking their tickets and boarding the train, causing passengers to line up and wait, resulting in the station still being crowded and difficult to buy tickets. The authorities are considering removing the ticket office in the station to accommodate it. In fact, it is only necessary to restore the ticket checking system to the pre-war method, changing it to check the tickets as soon as they arrive, so that passengers can go directly to the platform to board the train and accommodate it on the train. Since the train has already been at the station when it departs from the North Station, there is no inconvenience. On the one hand, the passengers in the station will no longer be crowded, and the order will be well-maintained.

(3) Increase the number of trains and vehicles. The current passenger trains are extremely crowded and lack order and hygiene. It is hoped that the Huazhong Railway authorities can increase the number of trains. For example, after the train departs at 12:00 noon, there is no military departure until 4:00 PM in the afternoon. In the four hours in between, the number of trains can be increased. If not, then first increase the number of trailers. The method is to detach them station by station. For example, the last two carriages are detached at Suzhou Station to stay in Suzhou, and the next two carriages are detached at Wuxi Station to stay in Wuxi, etc. When returning, they are added station by station. In this way, it can not only make passengers convenient and comfortable, but also achieve the goal of coal economy. (Moved to help students)

### Navy: Ambition (7)

-- Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang

Actually speaking, the Sino-British War, although it was a fierce war, was still inevitable to have negligence. For example, the watermelon boat plan is a good example. This was an organization of more than eighty daredevils initiated by Narahara, who killed the British. They were divided into seven watermelon boats, all disguised as merchants, with a knife hidden in their breasts. They boarded the British warship and killed the British. At the same time, they fired artillery from the straits, and both sides sank to the bottom of the sea. At first glance, it seems like a famous case, but most Europeans and Americans do not like watermelons very much, so they have no reason to buy so many watermelons. Moreover, although the daredevils thought they were disguised as merchants, their eyes were piercing and they had knives hidden in their waists. The British warships would naturally be on guard. Although this plan ultimately failed, among the team members were the later Marshal Oyama, and especially Marshal Saigo Tsugumichi and General Nirei Kagenori, who had a very deep relationship with the Japanese Navy, which cannot be forgotten. Moreover, Marshal Togo, who was only seventeen years old, also went on his first expedition in this battle, and his firm belief that he must defend against the enemy from the sea on the sea became a famous saying.

The formal start of the war was at noon on July 2nd, in the midst of a rainstorm. From the beginning, whenever a foreign ship came to Kagoshima, there was always a rainstorm. This time was no exception. In the wind and rain, the soldiers took off their clothes and fired the first shot from the Tenpozan battery in the south. This was the signal gun for the start of the war, and each battery continued to fire. It was just like the unforgettable dawn of December 8th, when the giant guns were fired at the British ship "Petrel" in Shanghai.

There is also one thing similar to this war, that is, the British side mistakenly believed that Japan had no intention of fighting. It was just an offensive taken for intimidation, and not actually preparing for war. At this time, the batteries fired deadly shots, so they did not know what to do for a while. The Basas even hurriedly cut off the anchor cable and fled. It is a great shame for the navy of any country to abandon its anchor and flee. The flagship "Julius" hurriedly sailed to a location about half a mile away from the coast and began shelling, but there was a place for practice targets, so accurate shells were fired from the Satsuma battery. Although it was an old-fashioned round shell, three shells hit the British warship directly, and the deck was destroyed, and the captain and vice-captain were injured on the spot.

The damage to the Satsuma side was also considerable. The range of the Satsuma cannons was only two miles, while the range of the enemy's naval guns could reach seven miles. Moreover, the total number of Satsuma cannons was eighty-nine, while the British warships had one hundred and one. The Gionzhou battery was the most damaged. The cannons were bent like soft candy, and the cannon mounts had been destroyed and were unusable. However, the morale was not diminished at all. In the wind and rain, the command drum rang through the sky. The young drummer at that time was the later Marshal Ito. (2) (10) (7)

### Beware of New-Style Pickpockets

Recently, there has been a group of new pickpockets, about fourteen or fifteen years old, disguised as garbage collectors. Their clothes are not too shabby, so they are not noticed even if they get close to pedestrians. They mix among the crowds at tram stations and other places with many pedestrians, using garbage tongs made of lead money to pick up handkerchiefs, gloves, etc. that are exposed in the pockets of pedestrians' coats or long gowns, and the victims are completely unaware. I would like to advise people from all walks of life to be careful to avoid losses. (Hong)
