South China Front, 22nd – Central News Agency Dispatch – Following the capture of Guilin and the occupation of Guixian by the Japanese army, the results of the battles in that area have been clarified as follows: 2,412 bodies of Chongqing soldiers were abandoned; 56 people were captured; the captured supplies included one heavy mortar, seven field mortars, seven heavy machine guns, 353 rifles, 1,345 mortar shells, 1,005 field gun shells, 32,090 rounds of heavy and light machine gun ammunition, and 47,200 rounds of rifle ammunition.

Stockholm, 22nd – Central News Agency Dispatch – According to a Reuter's dispatch from Chongqing dated the 20th, Chongqing may relocate its capital due to the progress of the Japanese army's operations. With the Japanese army's aggressive advance in South China, it is time for Chongqing to relocate to another location. Since President Roosevelt's special envoy, Hurley, arrived in Chongqing, he has held talks with Chiang Kai-shek regarding the military crisis in Chongqing. Therefore, extensive measures for Chongqing's relocation are about to be implemented. Chengdu in Sichuan and Ganzhou in Gansu seem more suitable. However, if the capital is moved to Ganzhou, it would be close to the Soviet sphere of influence. Therefore, it is speculated that Chongqing may be relocated to Xikang Province.

### American Military Leaders Discuss Operational Difficulties

Lisbon, 22nd – Central News Agency Dispatch – According to a New York dispatch, as the Sixth War Loan Drive began in the United States, Roosevelt and the heads of the Army and Navy issued separate statements encouraging the nation to strive for war. However, they also discussed the difficulties of the Pacific War situation. The main points are as follows: (Undersecretary of the Navy, Bard) To win the Pacific War, the United States must commit all its resources. Currently, there is a shortage of ships used for naval attacks and ammunition used for heavy artillery. (Commander of the Combined Fleet, King) Generally speaking, the war situation now is more favorable than last year. However, even after the end of the European war, the Pacific will still be a long and difficult war. Although the speed of American military operations has increased, military production is insufficient. For example, the construction of attack ships and transport ships cannot meet military needs, and flame-thrower guns are also insufficient. Furthermore, high-performance bombs, which are indispensable for attacking coastal facilities, are also lacking. Other military supplies, such as repair parts for frontline warships and aircraft, are also in short supply. All of this will delay the operational plans of the American forces in the Pacific. (Commandant of the Marine Corps, Clifford) The closer American forces get to the Japanese mainland, the more urgent the decisive battle with the Japanese land forces becomes, but the more difficult the operations also become. The cost of transportation in the Pacific is one-quarter more than in Europe. The mobile forces operating in the Pacific theater require twice as many transport ships as in Europe. The Pacific War requires even more amphibious vehicles, aircraft carriers, supply ships, and oil than the European operations.

### American Aircraft Raiding Kyushu Heavily Intercepted; General Headquarters Announces Interception Results

Tokyo, 22nd – Central News Agency Dispatch – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 12:00 noon on the 22nd: Around 1:00 PM on the 21st, the Japanese Air Force in the China area pursued and attacked approximately 30 remaining enemy B-29 aircraft that had raided western Kyushu and were on their way back over the provinces of Anhui and Henan. Over two hours, a total of four aircraft were shot down (including one unconfirmed), and nine were damaged. Two Japanese aircraft have not yet returned. Further announcements regarding the results of the Japanese aircraft intercepting enemy B-29 aircraft over Kyushu on the 21st are as follows: One enemy B-29 was confirmed to have been shot down by Japanese aircraft, and seventeen enemy aircraft were hit.

Tokyo, 22nd – Central News Agency Dispatch – The Japanese Air Force Headquarters announced in the afternoon of the 21st that the newly developed Japanese fighter planes intercepted the B-29 aircraft of the 20th Air Force of the Chongqing-American Air Force raiding western Kyushu on the 21st. The added announcement, confirmed the results, as follows: Fifteen aircraft were shot down over Kyushu. Eleven not confirmed, Seven aircraft hit, spewing black smoke, seventeen shot down.

The high loss rate, the Ministry of Supervision for the new world air combat record, which is also more than enough to show the US by virtue of strategic bombing, Japan's new fighter attacks, and into a state of complete paralysis.

Tokyo, 22nd – Central News Agency Dispatch – Most of the enemy aircraft pilots shot down by the Japanese military when enemy aircraft raided the Kyushu region on the 21st fell into the sea along with their aircraft. The corpses observed floating on the surface of the water appeared to be those of recently arrived pilots. Their flight suits and other equipment were very new, and they still looked young. This is enough to show that the United States is short of aircrew and is using inexperienced youth to fill the positions. The rations, medical supplies, and other entertainment items they carried were extremely luxurious, showing their enjoyment of hedonism.

Lisbon, 22nd – Central News Agency Dispatch – According to a Washington dispatch, the head of the US Army Air Forces announced that a strong formation of B-29 aircraft belonging to the US 20th Air Force, based in China, bombed the industrial area of Kyushu, Japan, on the 21st. However, due to poor weather, part of the attacking force failed to reach Japan and instead bombed Shanghai and Nanjing. Since the B-29 aircraft bombed Kyushu, they encountered strong Japanese air force interception for the first time. Bombing results could not be determined due to cloudy weather. Losses to the bombing force will be announced after detailed reports arrive.

### Chairman Wang's Last Instructions

(3) We must be prepared at all times to exchange our individual lives for the lives of our compatriots, and our individual freedom for the freedom of our compatriots.

(4) Strengthen our bodies and temper our spirits to meet the unprecedented difficult situation with national enthusiasm.

### Burmese Prime Minister Announces Total Mobilization Situation; National Defense Army Greatly Expanded Recently

Tokyo, 22nd – Central News Agency Dispatch – Burmese Prime Minister Ba Maw met with a group of reporters at the guesthouse at 10:00 AM on the 22nd and made the following remarks: First, he stated that Burma is still alive and well. No matter how the enemy propaganda tries to portray the contrary, Burma will fight to the end with a strong will. He then discussed the situation of Burma's national mobilization with the reporters as follows: The national movement in Burma is being promoted with the Union of Burma as the center. The Union is composed of all classes of Burmese society. Its purpose is to ensure the total war effort in Burma. Ten thousand young people are currently being trained to be instructors necessary for this movement. Although Burma's National Defense Army is still in training, it has been greatly expanded recently. Because of the guidance of excellent Japanese officers, it is expected to become a powerful force of the times. The National Defense Army is also cooperating with Japan on the front lines, undertaking extremely difficult tasks. The morale of the Burmese people is very high. In the recent conscription campaign, the number of applicants has exceeded the quota. The economic problem is the most difficult problem. First, Burma is not an industrial country, but an agricultural country. Before the war, it was only a raw material exporting country. Industrial products, labor, and technology were all dependent on foreign countries. Under these difficulties, Burma is still able to supply the huge military needs and consumption of the Japanese, Indian National Army, and Burmese National Defense Army. In addition, nearly one million laborers have been formed to undertake tasks such as bridge construction, road repair, and airbase construction. Furthermore, the agricultural sector, which used to rely on foreign labor to transport food, is now self-sufficient and can grow cotton, wheat oil, etc., engaging in newly distributed production. I myself am also considering various measures to ensure the minimum livelihood of the people while cooperating in the war.

### Recent Situation in Rabaul, New Britain

Rabaul, 22nd – Central News Agency Dispatch – The Japanese garrison on the isolated island of Rabaul in New Britain in the South Pacific is engaged in self-sufficiency operations, developing the mountains and forests, and completing great construction projects. The recent situation in Rabaul on the South Sea front is introduced as follows: The Japanese garrison in that area is currently digging extremely deep and long tunnels, extending for hundreds of kilometers. Even bombs of several tons cannot destroy these fortress trenches. The Japanese soldiers will continue to fight tenaciously within these tunnels. Every soldier has no personal desires, only striving to complete the Greater East Asia War. The newly opened dense forests are now planted with cassava (a type of root vegetable), and wild vegetables are found everywhere, which constitute the main food supply for the garrison. Other supplies, such as bananas and coconuts, have also established a complete self-sufficiency system. Soldiers are often seen fishing at sea and making their own soap. Recently, a paper mill has also been completed. The area is close to a volcano, so sulfur is extracted to manufacture lead-acid batteries for automobiles and dilute sulfuric acid. In addition, there are locally produced sauces, local wines, etc. In short, even newspapers are issued regularly. All soldiers are enthusiastically engaged in production to achieve self-sufficiency. This growing sense of certain victory is expressed in action. This solid self-sufficiency posture is now strictly awaiting the enemy. Whenever enemy aircraft and warships attack, they adopt encirclement tactics to inflict heavy blows and move towards victory.

### New Developments in the Southern Wing of the Western Front; Street Fighting in Belfort and Metz

Berlin, 22nd – Transocean News Agency – The sudden advance of French forces along the Swiss border into Upper Alsace has created a new situation on the extreme southern end of the Western Front. While it cannot be described as serious, it cannot be denied that it is tense. This move threatens the entire front line of Belfort and the Vosges and poses the risk of encirclement. American forces southwest of Belfort have reached Basle, where fierce fighting is taking place as they cross the river. Major battles are also occurring in the Belfort area, with French forces advancing towards the Rhine area.

Battle for the Hürtgen Forest Dam

Western Front German Headquarters, 12th – Transocean News Agency, 20th: In the past 24 hours, the battle for the Hürtgen Forest Dam has intensified, overshadowing the material attrition warfare in the Aachen and Lorraine areas. The situation remains unstable, making it difficult to assess at this time. According to anti-Axis sources, the Moroccan 2nd Infantry Division and the US 5th Armored Division have also joined the battle for the Hürtgen Forest Dam. Street fighting broke out in the fortress of Belfort on Monday evening, with German forces launching a counter-offensive against the right wing of the US 1st Army. German forces in Metz and the American forces that entered the city are engaged in intense street fighting. The left wing of General Patton's army, located between Diedenhofen and Benzdorf, appears to be exhausted. The same is true for the American forces in Moyeuvre-Grande. Due to heavy losses in this area, the American forces halted their offensive 48 hours ago. North of Metz, German forces took advantage of the temporary weakness of the American forces and launched a counter-offensive against General Patton's left wing, pushing them back to the west.

Little Change on the Aachen Front

American forces continue to attack on both sides of Aachen without gaining ground. German forces have voluntarily withdrawn from the salient point of Eschweiler and are now holding the line from Trippsrath to the western outskirts of Eschweiler. German forces continue to hold their original positions in the Hürtgen Forest. American forces lost fourteen heavy tanks in the past 24 hours. North of Roermond in northern Holland, German forces repelled multiple British attacks on the west bank bridgehead of the Meuse River.

Strong French Forces Trapped in an Encirclement

Berlin, 21st – Transocean News Agency – Responsible sources revealed that a strong French armored force had broken through Mulhouse in southern Alsace, but German forces mobilized tactical reserve units to cut off the French armored vanguard and trap them in an encirclement. German forces launched a fierce counter-attack against the point of enemy penetration and also counter-attacked the French forces between the Rhine Canal. In general, German sources believe that the French forces advancing northeast from Basel and Mulhouse will be contained.

### Rumors of a Roosevelt-Churchill-Stalin Conference in the Spring Denied by Roosevelt

Lisbon, 22nd – Transocean News Agency, United Press Washington dispatch: Plans for an early meeting between the Big Three have been temporarily shelved. It is unlikely that this will happen before 1945. Plans for a post-war world security conference have also been revised. The conference, originally scheduled for this winter, has now been postponed to the spring.

Stockholm, 21st – Transocean News Agency – Reuter’s correspondent in Moscow reports: Soviet military and political figures have indicated that Stalin needs to stay in Moscow and therefore cannot leave the Soviet capital to meet with Roosevelt and Churchill, as he must direct the upcoming general offensive.

### New Appointments Announced by the British Government

Editorial

### The Battle Situation in Mainland China

Since the Allied forces stationed in China launched a new offensive against the first and eighth war zones of Chongqing in Henan Province on April 18th of this year, it has been only seven months, and the Allied offensive has fully unfolded on the Chinese mainland. Now, almost all of the air force bases of the Chongqing-U.S. forces in China have been lost. Even Liuzhou and Guilin, the so-called last fortresses of the resistance base areas, have been captured by the Allied forces a few days ago. Therefore, the great undertaking of connecting north and south China and severing the mainland, and even the Greater East Asia continental transportation line connecting Japan to the South Seas, is nearing its final completion. The operations over the past seven months, like the recent naval battle off Taiwan and the Philippines, have had historical significance in terms of striking at the enemy's so-called "East Asia Counteroffensive Plan."

The recent seven months of operations by the Allied forces on the Chinese mainland, in terms of the extension of the front lines, from the Henan battlefield to the Hunan battlefield, have reached a thousand miles with interlocking positions. Since the capture of Changsha and Hengyang, the Xiang-Gui front has developed into a major southwest operation centered on Guangxi, with the operational area including southwestern Hunan, northwestern and western Guangdong, the eastern border mountainous areas of Guangxi, and the entire central basin of Guangxi. Recently, there has been a tendency to expand to Guizhou and Yunnan provinces. During this period, the operations in the coastal provinces of Zhejiang and Fujian echoed the naval and air battles off Taiwan and the Philippines, and achieved significant accomplishments. Looking at the broad expanse of the Chinese mainland battlefield, its scale is comparable to, if not greater than, the three lines of Europe, east, west, and south!

What exactly are the reasons for the Allied forces' victories on the Chinese mainland in the past seven months? The following points are particularly worth emphasizing:

First, the significance of this new operation by the Allied forces is very clear: it is not to be hostile to the Chinese people, but to assist the Chinese people in expelling the British and Americans who are sacrificing China to realize their ambition to dominate East Asia. On July 5th, the Allied government made a special statement:

(1) The purpose of the Japanese army's military operations in China this time is to destroy the British and American attempts to invade and control;

(2) To maintain friendly relations with the Chinese people;

(3) If they refuse to cooperate with Britain and the United States, even the Chongqing army will not be regarded as an enemy.

Therefore, the Japanese army is acting as a "benevolent army," its morale is high, and its combat power is strong, while the Chongqing-U.S. side is completely the opposite and cannot withstand a single blow.

Second, due to Japan's new policy toward China, which has gradually penetrated into the people through the Chinese authorities and media organs and is understood by the vast majority of the people, there have been many instances of Chinese compatriots cooperating with the Allied forces on various battlefields during these seven months of new operations.

Third, there is the corruption and decline in combat effectiveness of the Chongqing army. The "Liberation Daily" in Yan'an said in its editorial on June 26th that water, drought, locusts, and Tang (referring to Tang Enbo's army) were the four scourges of Henan. In peacetime, the officers and soldiers were not in harmony. Even with restraint, the soldiers were often beaten and scolded, and suffered from hunger, cold, poverty, and disease. Once formal combat began, they had no fighting spirit and collapsed immediately. Therefore, even with new weapons, there was no benefit. This time, the retreat of 400 miles in a single day, resulting in a mythical defeat, was no coincidence. But it was not only Tang Enbo's army that was like this.

From the recent battles, the Allied forces launched a new operation in Henan on April 18th and soon captured bases such as Zhengzhou. In mid-May, they captured Xuchang and Yancheng, and on May 25th, they captured Luoyang, completely collapsing the first and eighth war zones of the Chongqing forces, achieving the greatest success in modern warfare.

Next, the Xiang-Gui campaign was launched. First, on May 27th, an attack was launched on the 16th and 92nd war zones of Chongqing. On May 31st, Pingjiang fell, on June 1st, Yuanjiang fell, on the 6th, Xiangtan fell, on the 11th, Xiangyin fell, on the 16th, Zhuzhou and Liuyang fell, on the 17th, Xiangtan fell, and on the 18th, Xiangling fell. On the same day, the entire provincial capital of Hunan, Changsha, was occupied. In just twenty days, Xue Yue's army, directly under the central government of Chongqing, began to collapse again!

The Battle of Hengyang followed. The Japanese army moved east from Jiangxi on June 24th, captured Pingxiang, and rushed into Hengyang Airport. On July 1st, they rushed into Hengyang, and on the 4th, they launched a separate attack on Geshuikou, surrounding Hengyang. On the 8th, they occupied Hengyang and other places. In Hunan, Xue Yue's famous 30 divisions of the army collapsed more than 27 divisions in less than two weeks, leaving less than three divisions!

The Allied forces then launched the Xiang-Gui campaign, moving out from both Hunan and Guangdong. The Allied forces in Guangdong coordinated in three routes. The northern route began to move north along the Yuehan Railway on June 27th. From July 1st to 4th, they successively captured key points such as Longhuaxu, Longmen, Jingyuan, and Conghua. After Hengyang fell, they divided their troops and advanced towards the northwestern Guangdong-Guangxi border, entering Sihui on September 11th, and then attacking Huaiji and Xindu in Guangxi Province, jointly surrounding Guilin. The Allied forces moving north along the Yuehan Railway created a situation of encircling Shaoguan starting in late October. The Japanese army on the southern route of the Leizhou Peninsula moved north in early August, occupied Lianjiang on the 4th, Kaiping on the 10th, and advanced towards Guangxi on a large scale, occupying Wuzhou, the largest city in southeastern Guangxi, on the 29th. The Japanese army continued to advance, occupying Fengchuan and Luoding on September 24th, Guiping on October 13th, Guixian and Lipu on November 3rd, Wuyi on the 4th, Xiangxian on the 6th, Rongxian on the 8th, Laibin on the 9th, and Liuzhou on the 10th. The Japanese army in South China on the above three routes created unexpected results in a short period of time.

The Japanese army in Hunan, after occupying Hengyang, advanced along the Xiang-Gui Railway, capturing Changning on September 3rd, Qiyang on the 5th, Lingling on the 7th, and occupying Dong'an. On the 8th, they captured Xinning, and in early October, they rushed into Guangxi, capturing Fuchuan and Pinglu on the 1st, Quanxian on the 14th, and entered Guanyang on the 20th and Xing'an on the 29th. At this time, Daoxian in Hunan was also occupied on the 13th, and Baoqing was captured on the 27th. In early November, the encirclement of Guilin was completed. On the 2nd, Gongcheng and Yangshuo were captured, and on the 9th, street fighting in Guilin began. On the 10th, Guilin and Liuzhou fell at the same time, with only a few hours difference. At this point, the capital of Guangxi Province had been lost, and only one of the four major resistance centers in Guangxi Province, Nanning, remained.

During the period when the Allied forces in Hunan and Guangdong launched a general offensive against Guilin, the Allied forces in Zhejiang launched a new offensive against the third war zone of Chongqing on June 10th and occupied Quzhou on the 26th. On August 27th, Lishui was occupied, on September 4th, Haikou City was entered, on September 9th, Wenzhou was occupied, and on the 12th, Yueqing was occupied, completing the strategic objectives of securing the sea area of southern Zhejiang and the estuary area of the Oujiang River. In Fujian, a landing was launched northeast of Fuzhou on September 27th, and on the 28th, the advance was made through Lianjiang. On October 4th, Fuzhou was occupied, thus completing the goal of capturing the key coastal points and air force bases in Fuzhou, giving a heavy frontal blow to the enemy's Pacific strategy.

Looking at the recent battle situation on the Chinese mainland, we can gain the most profound impression of the Allied forces' achievements. From now on, the Chongqing-U.S. dream of a so-called mainland counteroffensive has been completely shattered! From now on, the political region of the Chongqing resistance regime has been fragmented, and there is no longer any possibility of launching a counteroffensive from the interior to the coastal areas! From now on, the Japan-China-South Seas continental transportation route can be completely built under the protection of the Allied forces! (Currently, only a small portion of about 200 kilometers of the Yuehan Railway from Leiyang to Shaoguan, out of a total length of 1,100 kilometers, is incomplete, in addition to a small section near Nanwan). Thanks to the Japanese army's achievements in the past seven months on the Chinese mainland, the enemy's "general counteroffensive against Japan" plan, which they dreamed of, has been shattered before it could be fully launched! Today, although the enemy is vainly launching an offensive from the Philippines, they have lost all their bases on the mainland and are trapped in the battlefields that the Allied forces have pre-arranged in the ocean, just like "fish in a dry rut." What activities and future do they have? What we feel acutely when studying the new battle situation on the Chinese mainland today is the question of Chongqing's way out. After such constant and disastrous defeats, internally, the Communist Party and various parties and local forces are rising and accusing each other, and externally, the enemy's attitude towards Chongqing is also changing, and it is truly in a desperate situation. We always believe that brothers are still brothers, and the people under Chongqing's rule are all our compatriots. We sincerely hope that everyone will calmly observe the reality and make necessary plans as soon as possible, and jointly make plans for the self-salvation of the Chinese people and the mutual salvation of the East Asian people, so as to achieve peaceful unification as soon as possible and the final victory of the Greater East Asia War as soon as possible.

### Japan's New Sharp Warplanes Display Their Power on the Front Lines: The Zhu Yan Team Fiercely Attacks Enemy Ships East of Luzon

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The names of the Japanese Navy's new sharp fighters, the "Zero" and the "Raiden," have begun to become known to the world. The Zero fighter has shown its skills since before the Greater East Asia War. Under the Greater East Asia War, it appeared from time to time and established special achievements. The Zero fighter is equipped with powerful firepower, speed, and excellent turning performance, which are absolutely necessary for air combat. Japanese soldiers call it the Zero. When enemy planes encounter it, they abandon their bombs and flee. In addition, the "Raiden" new fighter has even better performance than the "Zero," and has established the special achievement of shooting down enemy planes coming to northern Kyushu. Naturally, there are also "Zero" and "Raiden" in the Japanese Navy fighters. In the decisive battle in the Philippines, the Kamikaze Special Attack Team, whose name is far and wide, also had Zero fighters.

Philippine Base, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Team Zhu Hui Team bombed the enemy mobile unit east of Luzon Island on the 19th. On the same afternoon, the 9th Seibu Team also dispatched to the Leyte area. After engaging with ten enemy P38 aircraft, they fiercely attacked enemy ships, inflicting considerable damage. Japanese Army Base on the Philippine Front, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Team pursued the enemy mobile unit on the sea east of Nidanau Island on the 20th. After an enemy-made aircraft carrier caught fire, it was confirmed that the ship was no longer navigable and was likely to sink.

### U.S. Plots Aerial Resupply to Leyte Island: Transport Convoy Subjected to Fierce Bombardment

Philippine Front, 22nd (Central News Agency) - In order to break the plight of the U.S. Army on Leyte Island, the U.S. is sending a large number of transport convoys to Leyte Island Bay to enhance the supply of landing troops. Recently, the bombing by the Japanese Air Force has been extremely fierce, making supply from the sea very difficult. In recent days, the enemy has been attempting aerial resupply from Palau Island using transport planes. From Palau to Tacloban on Leyte Island, about thirty Douglas B29 aircraft have been transporting soldiers and supplies every day, and carrying wounded and sick soldiers to the rear. The aviation route covers a distance of about 1,200 kilometers between Palau and Leyte, where the weather is extremely changeable, which is by no means a good supply route. It can be seen that the enemy cannot reverse the decline without aerial resupply.

Japanese Army Launches Offensive in the Rain

Manila, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The U.S. support troops who landed 30 kilometers south of Tarac earlier this month are advancing towards Bapaci and plan to continue advancing north to the west coast of Leyte Island from there. The elite of the Japanese Army, having detected the enemy's intentions, is preparing to intercept them and is waiting in strict formation. Since the 18th, near Tasraan Bay (18 kilometers north of Bapaci), they have inflicted heavy damage on about 300 of the U.S. advance troops moving north, and are still expanding the results of the battle.

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - A Czech Associated Press reporter from Leyte Island stated that the Japanese army has invaded the U.S. rear and has now begun to attack, so the U.S. coastal supply route has been cut off, making people feel that the Japanese army may have the possibility of counter-encircling the U.S. troops in northern Leyte Island. This is because a unit of the Japanese army has arrived at the rear of Limon, two miles from Carigara Bay, and has begun to attack the U.S. 32nd Division's outposts near Sinakiben. At the same time, they are attacking a unit of the U.S. 24th Division on the road near Cabucungan. According to U.S. officers, the Japanese army's actions in the rain seem to be an attempt to launch an offensive. The Japanese army may encircle and occupy the mountains near Limon, or cross the swampy areas and cut off the British army's front-line supply route along the coast.

Fierce Fighting Around Limon

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to enemy front-line news from Leyte, the MacArthur headquarters issued a battle report on the 21st as follows: The Japanese army launched another strong attack on the U.S. positions around Limon, and after a fierce battle, the U.S. army repelled them, but still defended the positions. The U.S. army south of Limon, although repeatedly attacked by the Japanese army, is still ensured by the U.S. army, preventing the Japanese army from reinforcing Limon from Baolmok. Due to the heavy rain, land, sea, and air supply battles have become more difficult and critical, resulting in a gradual decline in combat. At the same time, a unit of the Japanese army broke through the mountain area and suddenly appeared behind the U.S. front line. Although the force was small, it used favorable terrain to attack the U.S. supply route, trapping the U.S. army, which was burdened by heavy rain and swamps. Due to the Japanese army's disruption in the rear, it has become more difficult, and due to the bad weather, the air raids on both sides have gradually declined. According to U.S. network news, a team of the Japanese Air Force forcibly attacked the U.S. landing site on the 21st.

Japanese Assault Team Destroys Enemy Artillery Team

Manila, 22nd (Central News Agency) - While the land battle on Leyte Island is in full swing, the Japanese assault team also launched continuous fierce attacks on the enemy positions in the north from the 8th to the 12th and 13th. On the 12th night, they bombed and destroyed the enemy's heavy artillery positions, causing them to fall silent. This situation, besides being pointed out by the brave Japanese soldiers who have recently returned from the front line, is also due to the fact that the density of artillery fire on the enemy in certain directions has been reduced due to the attacks by the Japanese suicide assault teams. The details of the suicide march on that night are as follows: The Japanese assault team, selected from the front-line units on the night of the 12th, broke through the enemy's sentry posts in the dark and went straight to the enemy's first-line positions, and reached the enemy camp, deeply penetrating the enemy's positions, quietly observing the situation inside the enemy's camp. At that time, the heavy artillery positions that had been heavily bombed during the day were in a state of deep sleep. Then, several members of the assault team first threw grenades into the heavy artillery location, and other members of the blocking team loaded explosives into the towing vehicles, causing them to explode with a loud bang. As a result, the enemy's artillery positions were completely destroyed along with the explosion.

Markel Arrives in Chongqing to Serve as Deputy Chief of Staff

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The U.S. Military Command in the China Theater announced on the 21st the appointment of Major General Markel Ar, former commander of the Southwest Pacific U.S. Division, as Deputy Chief of Staff of the U.S. Military in the China Theater. Also, Markel Ar had flown to Chongqing on the 20th.

### Japanese Army Displays Attacking Spirit

Stockholm, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army spirit displayed by the Japanese Special Attack Team can be called unprecedented in the history of warfare, so the U.S. military is terrified. An article published in the American Times Weekly a few days ago is one example of its concrete expression. The content is as follows: The Japanese army's attacking spirit, which is difficult for others to understand, can be proved by the following two examples: (1) On Yalte Island, during the Marshall Islands operation in February of this year, the Japanese army's communication had been cut off by the U.S. and was isolated. The U.S. military bombed it even more, but according to air force soldiers' reports, when they recently passed over the island, they felt fierce artillery fire, anti-aircraft fire. (2) When the U.S. Navy troops broke into the ignition point of Peleliu Island, they found a Japanese inscription on the wall, which read: "Defend to the end, die afterwards. We will build a Pacific defense line with our corpses."

### Soviet Army Prepares to Launch Winter Offensive: Two Armies Stalemate Near Hundu

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Huitong News: The Soviet army is still making large-scale preparations in the rear, so the Eastern Front is silent. The Soviet army is concentrating troops on the Eastern Prussian border, the Narew front, the Vistula, and the area between Warsaw and the Carpathian Rongonia, but no major battles have occurred yet. The Soviet side seems to want to wait for victory to be achieved in the direction of Courland or Hungary before launching an offensive here. On the second day of the Soviet army's attack on Woz in the Baltic region, it was still possible to make a decision. The Soviet army's fierce attacks were defeated by German defensive artillery fire, and there were no major changes in the direction of Courland. The Hungarian battle is at a stalemate. After the German army recaptured Giengos and made progress in Hatwen, there was no change in the battle line there. Fierce fighting is taking place in the direction of Miskoltz. The Soviet army's pincer movement against Slovakia has made no progress. Pressure is still being applied to the Dukla Pass and between Sigva and Tokaj.

### Important Remarks on the Greater Group

— Yifei

A month ago, I, as a reporter, once visited the Greater Group area. Unfortunately, due to the limited time, I only stayed for a day and night, observing things superficially. The information I gathered was minimal. At that time, due to environmental factors, I was unable to see the whole picture, which I deeply regretted. I had long harbored the thought of returning for a more in-depth visit. Fortunately, I received an invitation from Gu Ming, the head of the Eighth District, who promised to assist me. This was of great convenience to my investigative work as a reporter, for which I must thank Mr. Gu. Now, I will report to the esteemed readers some of the important things I have seen and heard in the past few days.

Outline of the Greater Group Area

The Greater Group District is located in the southeastern corner of Nanhui County, hence it is also known as "Huijiao" (Confluence Corner). It is bounded on all four sides: the East China Sea to the southeast, Nanhui to the north, Xinchang Town to the west, and Fengxian County to the south. It covers an area of 450 square miles, with 206,511 acres of farmland. It governs a total of 14 townships, including Greater Group, Sandun, Zhenxi, Gongbei, Wanxiang, Chendian, Daonan, Pengzhen, Xiaoqin, Machang, Nancheng, Nicheng, Chengbei, and Huidong. The total population is 66,222, with farmers accounting for 20 percent of the total population, and those in other occupations and the unemployed accounting for 10 percent.

In terms of transportation, besides the Qin Gongtang Highway, which is accessible to automobiles, there is a regular steamer service to Zhoupu Town by waterway. In addition, there are regular large-footed rowing boats carrying passengers and goods between Greater Group and Xinchang Nanhui. Otherwise, only civilian boats serve as the sole means of transportation.

Major Products

The main products of Greater Group include: Cotton—approximately 200,000 bales harvested annually; Broad beans—15,000 dan harvested annually; Soybeans—25,000 dan harvested annually; Rice—15,000 shi harvested annually; Rapeseed—20,000 dan harvested annually; Peanuts—20,000 dan harvested annually; Wheat—20,000 dan harvested annually; Sweet potatoes—10,000 dan harvested annually; Melon seeds—60,000 dan harvested annually.

Market Volatility

Prices in Greater Group Town fluctuate daily. Taking rice as an example, when I, as a reporter, arrived on the morning of the 4th of this month, the price of rice was 16,000 yuan per shi. By the afternoon and evening, it had risen to 16,500 yuan. On the morning of the 7th, when I was about to leave, the price of rice had already risen to 18,000 yuan. It can truly be said that "a scholar who has been away for three days must be looked upon with new eyes." However, rice shops were still hoarding and refusing to sell, resulting in a situation of rice being available but not for sale at a certain price. This shows that the volatility and instability of the rural economy have led to serious livelihood problems, just like in the cities. As for other daily necessities, their prices are also soaring, but because the purchasing power of the masses is too weak, the trend is slower. However, the difference is only between fifty steps and a hundred steps.

Indigenous Handicraft Industry

The handicraft industry in Greater Group, with a certain scale, includes:

(1) Pudong Paper Mill Established on Double Tenth Festival this year with a capital of 3 million yuan. When I, as a reporter, visited, the manager, Mr. Li, was in Shanghai on business. Mr. Wang, a staff member of the factory, led me to inspect various departments and explained the process in detail. He said that the villagers have never been interested in industry, partly because it is difficult to guarantee profitability after investing, and partly because it takes a long time for profits to materialize. Therefore, it is not easy to talk about expanding by investing in this area. The factory currently has six workers and three staff members. The scale is very small, and the manufacturing method is entirely manual. The process is as follows: The raw material is old waste paper, which is soaked until rotten, then mixed with bleaching powder and beaten into pulp. The pulp is poured into a trough, and a bamboo curtain about three feet long and two feet wide is used to scoop up the pulp (this step requires skilled techniques). Then, multiple layers are stacked in sequence, pressed dry with wooden poles, and dried in the sun. As for the hard material, it is rice straw, reed grass, or wheat stalks, which are cut into pieces, soaked in water, and then put into a special giant stove for boiling (this type of giant stove is commonly known as an "incense-sticking stove," with only one round hole for feeding fuel). The remaining steps are the same as for the soft material. For drying, sunlight is used on sunny days, and on rainy days, wet paper is pasted on the stove wall, and a fire is lit in the stove to heat it. Then, the dried paper is taken off and replaced with wet paper. The factory currently produces four types of paper, including writing paper, letter paper, rough-edged paper, and check paper. The paper quality is very good and extremely white. It is said that a glazing machine is being prepared, and the results will be even more impressive in the future, making a significant contribution to rural society.

(2) 41 Industrial Company Greater Group's homespun cloth is famous far and wide, but it has been stuck in its ways and adhering to outdated methods. In the past, it was only a secondary occupation for farm families, and the products were very rough, not meeting the standards for use by urban residents. They could only be sold in rural areas or used by farmers themselves. However, the weaving methods are gradually improving, and the quality, patterns, and texture of the products have been greatly improved. There is a trend of thriving and making rapid progress. The 41 Industrial Company is the leader in the industry. When I, as a reporter, visited, I saw more than a dozen weaving machines, including iron-wood machines and wooden machines. At that time, the female workers were having lunch, so work was temporarily suspended. According to the manager of the factory, Mr. Gong Hansheng, an iron-wood machine can produce one bolt of cloth per day and night, while a wooden machine can only produce half a bolt. Currently, the most difficult thing is recruiting skilled female workers, because local women are not accustomed to using newer weaving machines, so they have to pay high prices to hire female workers from the Songjiang and Fengxian areas.

(3) Cotton Ginning Factories There are three here: Yuansheng, Xiangsheng, and Zhenxin, each with 32 cotton ginning machines. The scale is roughly the same. The workers in each cotton ginning factory are mostly women and children. Most of the children are only seven or eight years old, spending all day in the machine room with the roaring of machines, flying cotton, and polluted air. This has a great impact on the health of the children, and hygiene is out of the question. I privately think that over time, these workers are at risk of developing lung diseases, especially child laborers. From the perspective of the capitalists, this is a superb strategy, as they are greedy for cheap labor and easy to control. However, from the perspective of the entire nation, children are the future masters of the Chinese nation. As the saying goes, "The achievement of great undertakings is built on healthy bodies." If children's bodies have not yet grown up and they have already become "little old guns," then talking about future achievements is just wishful thinking. In my humble opinion, all advanced industrial countries in the world have long had legal regulations for factories employing child labor, while China has no standards at all, which is a serious problem. The wages of these workers are calculated by the basket. Each bale of cotton (weighing 73 jin) can be divided into three baskets, with a wage of five yuan per basket. If it is dry cotton, they can gin 50 baskets day and night, while wet cotton can only gin 30 or 40 baskets. This is only enough to earn the price of a cup of coffee for a typical "upper-class Chinese" in the city. The villagers work hard, toiling day and night, but their income is not enough to fill their stomachs. However, even in this situation, there is still more porridge than monks, which makes people feel the widespread poverty in rural areas, exposed without reservation.

Cotton Production Areas and Their Proportions

The largest cotton production area in Nanhui County is the Qinxintang area, three li away from Greater Group Town, accounting for about 30 percent of the county's total production. Xinchang in the Seventh District ranks second, accounting for slightly more than 20 percent of the county's total production, while the rest is scattered in various places. Each mu of cotton field in Greater Group can yield 100 jin of raw cotton. After the cotton ginning process, only about 35 or 36 jin of clean cotton can be obtained. Currently, about 200,000 bales of cotton and 60,000 dan of melon seeds are harvested each year, which is only half of the pre-war production.

There are five cotton firms in Greater Group: Yuansheng, Xiangsheng, Guwenfa, Zhenxin, and Dashenghe. Due to environmental factors, yarn factories have emerged. Currently, Limin Craft Cooperative and Huashen Craft Cooperative have already started production. Huashen was founded in March of this year, while Limin was founded in September. Both have a common feature: all of the textile machines used are the Xin Nong small textile machines produced by Shanghai Xinyou Iron Factory. The capital when Huashen was founded was 4 million yuan (now worth 20 million yuan), while Limin was about 10 million yuan. Currently, each has 384 spindles, with the same equipment, except that Huashen lacks a drawing frame. Limin produces Double Cat brand 16-count yarn, while Huashen produces Five Monkey brand, each bale weighing 400 pounds, with a market value of 380,000 yuan. The two factories have a total of 20 male workers, about 80 female workers, and 20 child laborers.

The Yuansheng Yarn Factory, sponsored by the Yuansheng Cotton Firm, which has been catching up from behind, is now under construction and will soon be completed. According to the staff of the firm, the founding cost of the factory is estimated at 40 million yuan, with factory construction costs accounting for about 10 million yuan, machinery 15 million yuan, and the rest for working capital. It uses large-scale machines, with a total of 1,194 spindles. There is also a business being planned by a group of gentry and merchants. From this, it can be seen that Greater Group's light industry is gradually developing and showing a vigorous trend, and it will definitely be comparable to Wuxi in the future.

### Enemy Aircraft Blindly Bombing, Preparations Should Be Made for Evacuation, Civil Air Defense Headquarters Releases Statement, Hoping for Preparation of Air Raid Shelters, etc., Rescue Work Actively Underway

Since the air raid on Shanghai by the US Air Force on the 11th of this month, the enemy has been sending a small number of aircraft for reconnaissance for several days. On the morning of the 21st of this month, they attacked again. Through the counterattack of the allied Japanese air force and ground fire, there was no damage to military installations, but the lives and property of the Chinese people suffered considerable losses. The result of this enemy aircraft's blind bombing of the Nanshi area of Shanghai was the destruction of dozens of Chinese homes and the sacrifice of approximately one hundred Chinese lives. There was no damage to military installations in the Nanshi area. In the eastern area of Shanghai, enemy aircraft also blindly bombed, causing injuries to several Chinese people. The Civil Air Defense Headquarters expresses its deepest sympathy to these victims.

Therefore, in the future, the public must quickly evacuate from such enemy aircraft bombings. On the active side, it is hoped that each family will prepare air raid shelters and waiting rooms. The fact that many people were victimized because their houses were destroyed can serve as a lesson. In the future, we must actively utilize open spaces to complete waiting facilities, because the extent of damage to air raid shelters in open spaces, except for direct hits, can be greatly reduced. The purpose of yesterday's attack by enemy aircraft was to disrupt the people's morale, so the people must have a firm resolve and not fall for the enemy's tricks. Also, yesterday's blind bombing damaged power lines, causing a temporary power outage. Therefore, based on this experience, in the future, when an alert is issued, not only should drinking water and fire-fighting water be prepared, but also food. The electricity company authorities hope that citizens will use alternative lighting to save electricity.

In order to rescue the victims of yesterday's blind bombing, the rescue teams and work teams of the Civil Air Defense Headquarters, upon receiving reports, immediately departed to the incident locations. The personnel of the work teams are still engaged in organizing the destroyed houses today. The Civil Air Defense Headquarters expresses its deepest gratitude to the preparatory work in the areas affected yesterday, and to the cooperative assistance of the rescue personnel and other workers, the Baojia, and the Air Defense Corps personnel. At the same time, it is hoped that this exemplary spirit of neighborhood protection can be widely promoted in other Baojia and Air Defense Corps to quickly carry out rescue work and reduce the extent of damage. Air defense is a self-defense action of the citizens. Therefore, at this unusual time, it is hoped that all citizens will provide more active assistance and cooperation.

Unregistered Schools Must Complete Registration Procedures

Mayor Chen, out of concern for the difficult lives of teachers and staff in the city's schools, specifically ordered the Municipal Education Bureau to work with the Goods Allocation Office to handle special rice allocations for teachers and staff. To date, the fourth allocation has been issued, and the teachers have greatly benefited. It is understood that in the first allocation, the Education Bureau treated registered and unregistered schools equally, but all unregistered schools must quickly complete registration procedures. Those who are unclear about the procedures can inquire with the Second Section of the Bureau.

### Various Organizations Host Farewell and Welcoming Parties for Outgoing and Incoming Ministers, Joint Tea Party to Be Held Tomorrow Afternoon

His Excellency Usami, Minister of the Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy, has been ordered to transfer. The China News Association, the Citizens Welfare Association, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have specially scheduled a joint tea party for 4 p.m. tomorrow (the 24th) to bid farewell to Mr. Usami and welcome the newly appointed Minister Tsuchida. The event is sure to be filled with enthusiastic emotions as they welcome the new and bid farewell to the old.

### Ambassador Cai to Japan Returns to Shanghai

Our Ambassador to Japan, Cai Pei, returned to the country to attend the funeral of the late Chairman Wang. He flew from Japan to Shanghai yesterday with Secretary Wu. He gave the following statement to reporters yesterday afternoon: "I once returned to the country to report on my duties, and a year has quickly passed. The relationship between China and Japan is improving due to the signing of the alliance treaty and the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. This is not only comforting to me personally, but is a common understanding of the people of China and Japan, as well as the importance of early cooperation and the results of the Greater East Asia construction. From the beginning of the 3rd of this month, Chairman Wang came to Nagoya, Japan to recuperate. The Japanese authorities specially selected famous doctors and prescribed good medicine for careful treatment. His Majesty the Emperor repeatedly sent envoys to express concern, and government officials and dignitaries from both the government and the public went to the hospital to inquire about his illness, which showed how eagerly Japan was looking forward to Chairman Wang's recovery. Unfortunately, Chairman Wang passed away on the 10th of this month, and the Japanese government and the public were deeply saddened. I originally intended to escort the coffin of the late Chairman Wang back to the country on the 12th, but because a memorial hall had to be set up in Tokyo for worship, I did not return with it. On the morning of the 13th, His Majesty the Emperor of Japan sent an envoy to offer condolences. In the days that followed, there were more than a thousand mourners. Japan's determination to share weal and woe with our country is now even more evident. At this decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, the more intense the Japanese war situation, the stronger the strategy will be, and the more steadfast the belief in victory. From the top to the bottom of the country, regardless of men and women, young and old, regardless of the front line and the rear, are working hard to complete the Greater East Asia War with a spirit of reducing private interests and giving priority to public interests. On our side, after the death of Chairman Wang, we should inherit Chairman Wang's will to build a peaceful country, make the greatest efforts to achieve unification, realize comprehensive peace, and achieve the goal of revitalizing China and protecting East Asia."

### Deputy Consul Fukumon of Japan Returns to His Country on Official Business

Mr. Fukumon, the consul of the Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy, has been ordered to return to his country on important official business. The newspapers of this city specially held a joint banquet at 12:30 noon yesterday to express their farewell.

### Household Matches Sold on a Regular Basis

The Shanghai Municipal Goods Allocation Office has approved the allocation of household matches in this city to be one small box of Deer brand matches per person, sold for ten yuan in Central Reserve Bank Notes. They are designated to be purchased from designated retail stores with the No. 17 Comprehensive Allocation Certificate. Starting from the 25th of this month, distribution will begin in the old District One and the Huxi District. The distribution dates for other districts will be announced separately.

### The Fall of Guilin and Liuzhou is of Great Significance, Department Chief Izubuchi Releases Statement

Mr. Izubuchi, the Press Department Chief of the Shanghai Army Department of the Allied Japan, made a statement at the regular press conference at 3 p.m. yesterday (the 22nd) to the Chinese journalists of this city, stating that the Japanese army's attack on Guilin and Liuzhou this time is of great significance in the mainland war. Not only did it severely damage the Chongqing side, but also the important base of the US Air Force in Chongqing was destroyed as a result. Department Chief Izubuchi said: "Regarding the battle situation in the Guilin and Liuzhou area, the Japanese army has achieved its victorious objectives. The brilliant results have already been seen in the newspapers. This battle has crushed the enemy's attempt to use Guilin and Liuzhou as an important air force base, and has annihilated as many as nine armies of the Chongqing army. Currently, the Japanese army is continuing to pursue and mop up the remaining enemies, and has advanced to the northwest of Liuzhou. The Japanese army has achieved great results in all aspects in the battle of Guilin and Liuzhou this time. Therefore, the enemy's important air force base in Chongqing has been destroyed. The enemy's biggest ghost in Chongqing was to use Guilin and Liuzhou as a base to try to destroy Japan's aviation supply line, and also to attack and destroy Japan's supply line in the south, and also to try to bomb Japan itself, which was considered very important. The enemy's air force base in Chongqing has a left and right hand. The left is Chengdu, and the right is Guilin and Liuzhou. The help Guilin and Liuzhou falling into the hands of the Japanese army not only caused damage to the Chongqing side, but also caused significant damage to the enemy's base. Now that the enemy's right hand has been cut off, it will be difficult to move forward. In particular, the enemy's attempts on the South and Taiwan will be difficult to exert their power. In the midst of the frequent victories of the Japanese army on all fronts, the capture of Guilin and Liuzhou is of great significance. At present, the enemy's right hand has been cut off, and there is an attempt to use the left hand to strengthen the evil, such as the recent strengthening of the activities of the enemy, such as invading Beijing and Shanghai, trying to disrupt peace and create a psychological warfare to salvage the situation and make a final struggle. However, think about the fact that the enemy's activities could not be effective when the left and right hands were complete, and now that the right arm has been broken, it is difficult to achieve the desired ideal by relying solely on the left arm."

### Various Organizations in This City Telegraph Chairman Chen to Express Support

The various organizations in this city support Chairman Chen, the telegram reads: Chen Junjian, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, Upon the death of Chairman Wang, you were formally elected as the Prime Minister of the Executive Yuan, and legally acting as the Chairman of the National Government.

### The Economic Bureau Cracks Down on Taking Advantage to Manipulate Prices, Hoping Citizens Will Report to Eliminate Bad Practices

After the prices in this city came down, they have risen again. Although the Municipal Economic Bureau is actively investigating hoarding and cracking down on secretly raising prices, most merchants consistently adopt a opportunistic style, taking advantage of opportunities to raise prices without authorization. If this bad practice is not thoroughly punished, the people's livelihood is truly worrying. The Central News Agency reporter recently conducted an investigation and found that among the main commodities yesterday, rice, oil, and daily necessities were particularly high. It is heard that the Municipal Economic Bureau, with the responsibility of managing prices and stabilizing people's livelihood, will not allow negligence and will resolutely follow the government's orders, further thoroughly investigate, crack down on, and severely punish illegal merchants who take advantage of opportunities to manipulate prices, and hope that citizens will report them to eliminate unscrupulous merchants.

### Municipal Buddhist Association Sends Representatives to the National Capital to Pay Respects to Chairman Chen

After the death of Chairman Wang, the whole country mourned. In addition to sending condolences, the Municipal Buddhist Association also notified temples throughout the city to chant scriptures for three days to appease his spirit. On the 23rd of this month, it will send Executive Director Bai Qian to the National Government Auditorium to offer sacrifices in front of his spirit. The recorded eulogy reads: "The great cause was about to be completed, but we suddenly heard of his ascension. The whole country cried in unison. Recalling his great achievements and looking to the future, East Asia has lost its mentor."

Sports

### Shen Bao Cup Basketball Yesterday's Game, Hualian Defeats Shan Team

In the Shen Bao Cup basketball game, the Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory team defeated their strong opponent Shan team last night with a score of 32 to 25, continuing to maintain their victory and record. The first half ended in a tie of 14 points each. The Shan team has suffered two losses and has no hope of winning the championship, but the team's fighting spirit is excellent, they are promising young men, and they have a bright future. Hualian only has one last decisive match against Zhongbei. The Shan team performed brilliantly in the first half, and the two teams were almost indistinguishable. In the second half, it seemed that due to physical strength and experience, the formation fell into disarray. Hualian's offense was very strong, and the Shan team was busy defending and neglecting offense. Hualian has many veterans, and their battle is very stable and impressive, especially Blot's offensive and Qu Kongzhi's defense. In another game, Ren Yu Ren, Ren Yu led 26 to 13 in the first half. The game was suspended due to an air raid alert when the score was 32 to 25 in the second half, with nine minutes and fifteen seconds remaining. In Group B, Tong Pen won against Qiang Shi, 26 to 13, with the first half score being 9 to 5.

### Appreciating Ancient Art: The Chinese Boxing Arts Hall Sees a Grand Visitation

Since its opening, the Chinese Art Museum has seen enthusiastic visits from all walks of life, including German Consul-General Mr. Fei Erfu, Wu Xiu, Xu Bao, Tan Jing, Zhang Muyu, Chen Zhong, Hu Huichun, and hundreds of others. This exhibition showcases famous porcelain from various dynasties, presenting a highly systematic display. Among the items are the Yue and Xing porcelain from the Tang Dynasty, the Ding, Jun, Ru, and Ge wares from the Song Dynasty, as well as the Longquan celadon. From the Ming Dynasty, there's the Tianbai (sweet white) ware, plum vases, Xuande ruby-red stem cups, and the Jiajing gold-traced wucai (five-color) dragon and phoenix large jars. Also featured are the Qing Dynasty Kangxi green-ground sancai (three-color) figurines, Lang kiln sky-blue large vases, Yongzheng coral-red wood-patterned yu-ti buckets, Qianlong tea-dust-glazed antique bronze-style eagle-head zun, and gem-glazed gold-traced coral-red double-eared yuan zun, alongside the rouge-pink brocade-ground sixteen-panel plum vases. Their lustrous colors are captivating, truly rare treasures. Exquisitely crafted, they are appreciated by both refined and popular tastes, indeed a rare opportunity to admire ancient art and a unique spiritual nourishment for people in Shanghai. The museum also publishes a beautifully printed special edition, detailing the origins and development of Chinese porcelain, for research purposes. This publication provides detailed descriptions and serves as a highly valuable reference book. On clear days, groups from academic circles have been visiting in increasing numbers, and it is anticipated that the upcoming holidays will be even more crowded. (The museum is located at the Majestic Theatre Building, No. 996 Jing'an Temple Road.)

### Important News from Datuan (Continued from Page 2)

The Living Conditions of Farmers

In the current situation of rural bankruptcy and social unrest, discussing the living conditions of farmers is a complex matter, and it's hard to know where to begin. What follows is a brief overview:

(1) Large Landowners Are No Longer Viable: In the past, those in rural areas who owned thousands of acres of fertile land enjoyed immense power and lived abundantly. Even a king would not easily exchange his life for theirs. However, today's large landowners have all disappeared, fleeing one after another and seeking refuge in the cities,不敢回鄉. The reason for this is well-known: there is a danger of being "invited" and treated as a "god of wealth." Taking the large landowners of Datuan as an example, the fruits of their farmland, which they regarded as money-making sources year-round, are subject to substantial land taxes and military grain requisitions. In addition to these, there are endless exorbitant miscellaneous taxes. While the former were somewhat limited, the latter could come several times a day, with no end in sight. Therefore, most landowners feel headaches and struggle to cope. As for income, last year's rent was only 650 yuan per mu. Although the major landowners have discussed and decided on a new rent collection method for this year, setting a provisional rate of 4,500 yuan per mu from mid-October to the end of October, 5,000 yuan per mu from November 1st to 15th, 5,500 yuan per mu from the 16th to the end of the month, and provisionally setting 6,500 yuan per mu for December 1st to 31st. This would then increase to 8,000 yuan per mu by March of next year. Rent is to be paid in cash. The sharecroppers, or tenant farmers, agree with the landowners to split the crops harvested from the fields equally. This may seem fair, but in reality, the landowners live far away and the tenants often conceal the true amount, reporting less than what was actually harvested, causing the landowners to suffer significant losses. Logically, the rising rent prices should be a burden on the small farmers, but in fact, the large landowners are still not making enough to cover their expenses, mainly due to their vast expenditures. The so-called "Gentlemen-Merchants Special Contribution," assessed based on the individual, can easily reach hundreds of thousands of yuan. This decree must be paid overnight, leaving no room for discussion. Otherwise, disaster will strike immediately. Therefore, today's large landowners are truly in a situation where they don't know whether to laugh or cry.

(2) Prosperous Farmers Cannot Stay: Those farmers who own less than a hundred mu of land may not have the "honor" of being assigned the "Gentlemen-Merchants Contribution," but in the countryside, often in the dead of night, they are visited by batches of uninvited guests who "borrow" gold, silver, and jewelry for long periods. They are often forced to sign several large checks, which are later rejected by the bank, spelling ruin for the entire family. The same is true for businesses. For example, on the night of the 3rd of this month, the Tongchang Xieji cotton, grain, and oil shop in Nicheng, a neighboring village of Datuan, was visited by "honored guests" who asked to sign five Shanghai Zhuang checks totaling 2.5 million yuan. Afterward, the owner closed the shop and fled, posting a notice to stop payment. Therefore, prosperous farmers who encounter such incidents have no choice but to leave their homes and go far away to avoid the communist onslaught.

(3) Middle Farmers Cannot Gamble: The regular patrons of the gambling dens here are mostly farmers from the surrounding villages, with the majority being middle farmers who own their own land. These middle farmers mostly cultivate their own fields, without paying for labor, and the yields from their fields, at today's soaring prices, are considerable. Taking rice as an example, this year's harvest is 1.5 dou per mu, which can fetch 27,000 yuan, a sizable amount. This is unlike the rent collected by large landowners, which is only 5,000 to 6,000 yuan per mu and is subject to a huge "Gentlemen-Merchants Special Contribution." Therefore, their expenses cannot be compared. As such, middle farmers who are content and law-abiding should have no worries about food and clothing. However, if they indulge in gambling, they will inevitably ruin their families and bring unimaginable consequences. Thus, gambling dens are essentially the graveyards of these people.

(4) Tenant Farmers Cannot Be Despised: Tenant farmers rent farmland from landowners. Besides handing over a portion of the harvest to the landowner according to the agreement, they do not bear any exorbitant miscellaneous taxes. Their income is barely enough to make ends meet, and they are not coveted by anyone. They are not qualified to be assigned the "Special Contribution." Therefore, if they can rent a dozen or so mu, their entire family can live without worry. However, according to the reporter's on-the-spot investigation, those with less than three mu and a family of five often suffer from financial difficulties. These farmers become long-term customers of the Shangtian Bank (agricultural bank).

(5) Poor Farmers Cannot Live: In this era of expensive rice and firewood, the life of poor farmers with no land to stand on is truly problematic. Moreover, obtaining loans in rural areas today is not easy, as everyone is preoccupied with their own problems. When it comes to providing relief, one can temporarily invite relatives and friends to pool funds to alleviate the immediate crisis, but this is not a long-term solution. Therefore, when the poor reach the end of their rope, many resort to desperate measures and become bandits, harming the countryside and greatly affecting social order.

A Tour of the Gambling Dens

As the saying goes, "Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times." This time, the reporter revisited Datuan, and in order to provide an accurate report, at 11 PM on the 6th of this month, braving the autumn rain, I followed a specially engaged local guide, treading on the muddy, barely passable sheep trails, stumbling and bumbling through the desolate wilderness. There were many mud puddles along the way, and we fell repeatedly. We dared not turn on the flashlight, fearing that it would attract the attention of criminals. After walking about seven or eight li, we finally reached our destination. First, we went to a smaller establishment, which was a private house. The house was very narrow, but there were four mahjong tables arranged, packed with people, and the air was very foul. When the reporter and the guide entered, we pretended to be looking for someone, and the waiter immediately came to ask, "Have you two had your late-night snack?" He offered tea and cigarettes, and was very attentive. After we sat down, we looked around and saw that the gamblers were of all sorts. There was even someone wearing a tiger skin coat openly participating. There were all kinds of people. At one table, there was a young man with a rather refined face, leaning on his beautiful wife, who was acting as his advisor, giving orders. They could be called "like-minded" and "husband and wife in harmony." We left after a short while. Then we went to a larger establishment. First, we entered a dark alley, which was very long. Then, the guide knocked on the door, announced our names, and we were let in to go upstairs. The interior was very spacious, passing through the cashier's office and dining tables, before entering the inner room. The gas lamps illuminated the room like daytime. There were crowds of people, totaling twenty tables. According to the waiter, the business was worse tonight because of the rain, otherwise there would be more. The reporter asked how much the owner could get in winnings tonight. He said that it would be about 1.2 to 1.3 million. Later, we asked some gamblers who were familiar with the guide how much the stakes were per game. They replied that it varied, and was determined by the four families beforehand. Small or large, it was up to them. The usual stake was 40,000 yuan, with a "7 plus bottom," which meant that the chips were counted as 40,000 yuan, and the final game was multiplied by seven. What caught the reporter's attention the most was that at a table near the door, there was a child who had not yet lost his childishness, about fourteen or fifteen years old, also gambling heavily, with a natural attitude and skillful techniques. Even stranger, there was an old woman with wrinkled skin and white hair standing behind the child's chair, presumably his grandmother. Perhaps her eyesight was poor and she could not gamble herself, so she sent her beloved grandson to take her place. It could be said that "everything is available, old and young are gathered." This shows how large it is.

Three Alarms in One Night

We left the gambling den close to midnight. As we went downstairs and out the door, we had only walked a few steps when the guide, who had been walking with us, shone his flashlight, seemingly seeing something. He quickly pulled the reporter aside. When we looked, we saw a large dog, covered in blood, in a terrible state. It was probably shot by someone. If this scene were seen by people from the Shanghai Animal Protection Society, they would certainly lodge a protest.

On the way back, we had already reached the town when the reporter was holding a flashlight, illuminating the muddy road. Suddenly, a group of armed comrades flashed out of the darkness, ordering us to stop. At the time, we were greatly alarmed. Later, we learned that it was a military patrol. After showing them our credentials, we were released.

As we were about to reach our residence, we passed an alley and heard the sounds of a man and woman quarreling violently. At first, we didn't pay attention and continued to walk. Unexpectedly, there was a gunshot in an instant, which was quite alarming. The next day, the guide came to tell us that it was a love affair, and the male protagonist was injured and was seeking treatment.

### Contributing Some Opinions on the Issue of Company Layoffs

— Li Liangru

The black market price of rice has skyrocketed more than twofold in less than two months, exceeding the 20,000 mark. The citizens' lives are all feeling severely threatened. Those who are most deeply and fiercely affected should be the salaried class in the middle layer of today's society. However, some of the salaried class are now going through the agonizing stage of layoffs. It is said that certain large companies and banks have decided to lay off employees. Their motivation is due to their unavoidable predicament, as their monthly operating revenue has been insufficient for years. If they want to find ways to increase revenue, they have reached the end of their rope. If they continue to struggle, the company's future will face unimaginable crises. Therefore, to prevent problems before they occur, they have to adopt austerity measures. This is indeed a common and sympathetic situation for all legitimate business organizations today. However, to take into account the serious impact that the implementation of layoffs may cause, I hope that the company's top management can consider the following two suggestions:

First, in recent years, the company's business organizations have not had any public layoffs. However, the rapid increase in the cost of living has long been unbearable for ordinary companies. However, they have been struggling to support themselves until now because everyone has the awareness of sharing the joys and sorrows to get through this sacred era together. Now, if the company is going to cut back, and if all major businesses, companies, and banks follow the example and use it as a model for reducing their debts and increasing their net assets, the impact on this society of oversupply of labor can be imagined. So, the best way is still to avoid public layoffs. Instead, the company's management should try to suggest to employees to resign voluntarily, and give them a considerable amount of "severance pay" and "seniority bonuses." Then, employees who can find other jobs, those with other skills, or those who can use their last given funds to survive can give up their jobs and seek other ways to survive. Although the abilities of those who voluntarily resign are often superior, wouldn't this conflict with the company's principle of "employing staff on an equal and advanced basis, and choosing one with higher work efficiency"! But let's think about it. The company is in a state where it cannot increase revenue, and the company's layoffs are for austerity, for the purpose of not "all being eliminated," not because a few employees are not competent. Then, all the employees in the company can be said to be qualified under the current situation. Because of this reason, the company's management should first consider whether the laid-off employees can live in the future when laying off employees. The company should never consider "ability." Only when two employees meet the first condition at the same time and need to be dismissed, should the company consider their work ability. Therefore, rather than having the company carefully assess and dismiss an employee with ordinary work efficiency and directly threaten their livelihood, it would be better to dismiss an employee who voluntarily resigns, has higher ability, and can cope with future life.

Second, business groups are certainly not charitable organizations or nursing homes, but supporting employees cannot be compared with supporting refugees. Especially in a business group with a long history, its employees have spent a lot of their efforts in serving in the past. From the accumulation of past efforts, on the one hand, the enterprise itself is becoming increasingly consolidated; on the other hand, the employees' age is increasing, their energy is decreasing, and their ability is limited due to the division of labor and specialization. Therefore, once they are laid off, they will face the crisis of waiting for death. So, I hope that the company can always follow the highest human morality of "compassion, which everyone has" and use past surpluses to "help" your poor employees within the possible scope.

In summary, it is nothing more than making employees resign voluntarily and giving as much severance pay as possible. However, if the number of employee resignations does not reach the predetermined number, and the company's previous surplus cannot be made up for and the gap between future income and expenditure, then the last step is to formally lay off employees. Here, I put forward three layoff criteria, hoping that the company authorities that are preparing for layoffs will adopt them: (1) The employee's family economic situation. (2) The employee's work ability and attendance in the company. (3) The employee's special contributions to the company during the service period and the importance of the duties they perform. As for the severance pay standard for those who are laid off, there are also three points: (1) The amount of the current salary. (2) The number of people who depend on it for life. (3) Seniority. In this way, it may be possible to remove the hidden crisis of the salaried class today.

Social Service

### Shanghai Health Association Offers Free Blood Type Testing

Since the Shanghai Air Defense Headquarters announced that citizens must prepare identity cards with their blood type marked for emergency first aid in case of accidental injuries, the medical community has published the scientific principles of blood types in newspapers, and citizens have been able to understand blood types. It is heard that schools have taken the lead in launching group testing. From this week onward, the Shanghai Health Association has stipulated that on Wednesdays and Saturdays from 5 pm to 7 pm, it will provide services to members and citizens. In addition to paying a material fee of 50 yuan per person, no other fees will be charged.

### The Women's Patriotic School of the Girls' Christian Association Assists Out-of-School Women

In two inconspicuous corners of Shanghai, Xiaoshadu Road and Beile Road, there are two night schools for adult women run by the Girls' Christian Association, where hundreds of women study and take classes every night.

Running compulsory education for adult women is the most historical work of the Girls' Christian Association. The early Girls' Christian Association first noticed the universality of illiteracy, especially among women; therefore, literacy classes and remedial classes became the focus of the early Girls' Christian Association's work.

For the past 30 years, the number of schools in Shanghai has been increasing with the times, and the door to education has been widely opened. However, it does not have any relationship with the general adult women who are out of school, the female workers in factories, the housewives, and the girls from poor families.

This group of people crying in the dark has a more eager desire for knowledge than the average intellectual youth. In their simple minds, they don't understand what their wishes are, can't figure out a way, vaguely envy the blessings of others, and sigh at their own misery. However, uniformly, they have a firm and upward heart. Once they are inspired, they will go to the goal wholeheartedly!

In the past, the Girls' Christian Association had more than a dozen compulsory night schools for adult women scattered throughout Shanghai. Later, due to insufficient funding, only two are currently maintained, and also due to funding, housing, electricity and various difficulties, it is like a candle in the wind and may disappear at any time. We hope you don't forget these crouching people. They have no ability to appeal to society themselves, and they rely entirely on others to notice their needs. We hope that all circles will work hard to donate and extend a helping hand! (Hai Yan)

### China Children's Welfare Association Appeals to Rescue Child Refugees

The China Children's Welfare Association, due to the current difficulties in providing support, has made a special appeal to society to donate money, with a target of 5 million yuan, in order to maintain half a year of funding. The association currently cares for more than 300 orphans, providing them with primary school education and learning skills, and implementing strict daily life training and hygiene habits to develop healthy qualities such as hard work and endurance, hoping to become healthy citizens in the future. These innocent children have unfortunately been abandoned by their parents. If they are allowed to roam the streets, the number of vagrants will increase. If we can first find a way to rescue these street children, so that the country will have more good people, the society will be more helpful. However, the association is unable to adopt them on a large scale due to limited funding. We hope that the society will help with all its strength.

Donations Report: Zhao Tingjie, Weng Xiaoxiang, Wang Ye'ao, Lin Ji, Yu He, Yang Tiequan (all six households solicited by Cen Xinliang) Lu Zhizhuang, He Guolian (solicited by He Zhicheng) Gongyu Baohao (solicited by Gan Dounan) 5,000 yuan each, Lin Ji (solicited by Liu Bao), He Zhicheng 3,000 yuan, Weng Xincheng, Shen Xiangfu (both households solicited by Cen Xinliang) Anonymous 1,578 yuan, Delongchang Baohao, 2,000 yuan each, He Zheng's family, He Wang's family, He Huiyu, He Huishang, He Junyi, Wang Chang's family, Wang Zhenguo (all seven households solicited by He Zhicheng), Liu Bao, Hua Xu Fang (Hua Bao solicited) Wang Hengxiang (solicited by Lu Zhizhuang) Dongyu, Yongsheng Hardware Store, Linde Yiji, 1,000 yuan each, Cen Xinliang, Mr. Fang (solicited by Cen Xinliang) Li Yuanshan, Huaxin Company, 500 yuan each, Dai Shizu 100 yuan, the above totaling 75,100 yuan, plus the previous total of 911,016 yuan.
