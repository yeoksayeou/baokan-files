### An Urgent Appeal: Requesting the Government to Exempt National Elementary School Tuition

The Greater East Asia War Common Knowledge Exhibition held by this newspaper lasted for three days. Coincidentally, the sixth round of scholarship applications began. We took advantage of the exhibition venue to distribute scholarship application forms, hoping that students could also visit the exhibition and gain some wartime knowledge. Unexpectedly, the crowds over the three days exceeded our expectations, deeply moving us. We believe that not only those who witnessed it firsthand were moved, but also those who heard the news would be touched and enlightened. Why? Firstly, these students are innocent and pure, their only hope is to have the opportunity to study. Therefore, they braved the wind and cold, waiting patiently. Such a widespread phenomenon of children desiring education shows that "while the green hills remain, there is no fear of lacking firewood." It shows that China's future still holds promise. Secondly, who doesn't have children, and who doesn't love them? If children are willing to study, no parent or elder brother would heartlessly deprive them of their education. However, due to the heavy burden of life, there is no extra money to bear the cost of their children's education, and they are forced to cruelly deprive them of their education. Now that there is a scholarship opportunity, they naturally don't hesitate to work hard, bringing their children to apply. This ardent phenomenon of fathers and elder brothers hoping their children can study is also equally worthy of attention.

In the previous round, more than 4,000 students received assistance. In this round, the number of new and returning students requesting application forms totaled over 9,000 on the first day, over 4,000 on the second day, and over 3,000 on the third day, totaling over 16,000, more than four times the previous round. This fact illustrates that as prices rise and life becomes more difficult, there are more opportunities for students to drop out of school.

In addition, we have recently contacted many friends who are intellectuals with legitimate professions. Regarding the scholarships provided by this newspaper for their children's education, it is based on the four criteria of "poor and outstanding". If they do not meet the standards, no one can be accommodated. Moreover, this newspaper's scholarships are limited to students starting from the fifth grade of elementary school. Even if they meet the standards, we cannot accept those below the fifth grade. However, we feel that the inner pain of the general intellectual class of friends who cannot raise the education fees for their children and watch them drop out of school is even more profound.

We believe that providing scholarships through group efforts has a limited effect, like a cup of water on a burning cart of wood. Ensuring that all school-age children have the opportunity to attend school is the responsibility of the state. Therefore, we urgently appeal to the government authorities and the education authorities, hoping that they will pay close attention to the current serious phenomenon. At the very least, as a first step, universally establish national elementary schools and make them all free, so that every child has the opportunity to receive elementary school education. We hope that the government will make a firm decision and implement it starting from the next semester. There should be no problem with free education in public elementary schools in various regions. Private elementary schools should be subsidized by the government and required to provide free education across the board. We believe that as long as the government has the determination, the funding problems during implementation will definitely be solved easily.

In modern advanced countries, they all strive to popularize national compulsory education, especially primary and secondary education. People have the opportunity to receive education, and the government even forces them to accept it. Therefore, there are very few illiterate people, and the national knowledge is increasing day by day, and the national strength is strong. The number of illiterate people in our country was already staggering when tuition fees were low in peacetime. Now the situation is becoming more and more serious, and even those who originally had the opportunity to attend elementary school will be deprived of it. The consequences are frightening. We deeply believe that the government authorities, especially those responsible for education, must have profound insights and far-reaching considerations, and will they not make every effort to find ways and take urgent action?

### The Central Reserve Bank and Yokohama Specie Bank Sign a Centralized Remittance Agreement: Implementing Remittances in Central China, South China, and the South

Central News Agency dispatch: In order to facilitate the development of trade in various cities of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Central Reserve Bank, after several consultations with the Allied Yokohama Specie Bank, which holds authority, has centralized the exchange system in Central China, South China, and the South. The agreement was signed with the Yokohama Specie Bank at 11:00 AM yesterday (11th) in the conference hall of the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank on the Bund in Shanghai. Those present included the President of the Central Reserve Bank, Fo Hai, advisors Kimura and Yoshikawa, and representatives of the actively progressive Japanese banks, Taiwan Bank, and Teikoku Bank. The key points of the remittance in the Central China, South China, and Southern regions, as well as the speech delivered by President Zhou Fo Hai of the Central Reserve Bank, are recorded separately below:

Key Points of Implementation

Key points of the Central Reserve Bank's implementation of centralized remittance in the Central China, South China, and Southern regions: 1. The Central Reserve Bank attaches great importance to the buying and selling of exchange in the Southern region. 2. Remittances in the Southern region are expressed in Japanese Yen. 3. The Central Reserve Bank will set up a special Yen account in the Tokyo branch of the Yokohama Specie Bank to handle remittances to the Southern region. 4. The exchange rates for remittance transactions between the banks handling remittances in the Southern region and their customers will be calculated based on 100 Central Reserve Bank notes being equivalent to 18 Japanese Yen. However, the banks handling the transactions can charge customers a handling fee of 0.05% of the total amount of the remittance transactions, of which 0.025% must be paid to the Central Reserve Bank as compensation. 5. Banks handling remittances in the Southern region should summarize once at the end of each ten-day period and buy and sell the remittances to the Central Reserve Bank. 6. The centralization of remittances to the Southern region is currently limited to the Foreign Exchange Bureau of the Central Reserve Bank. As for the remittance transactions of other branch banks, they should be handled by opening accounts with the Foreign Exchange Bureau of the Central Reserve Bank, and all transactions must be bought and sold to the Central Reserve Bank. 7. Other matters will be handled in accordance with the current procedures for the time being, and the Central Reserve Bank and the Japanese side will maintain close contact at all times.

President Zhou's Remarks

Regarding the communication of remittances between Central China and the South, President Fo Hai of the Central Reserve Bank delivered the following remarks: "The banks in Central China that handle remittances in the Southern region have reached an agreement with the Yokohama Specie Bank today regarding the centralization of remittance funds in the banking sector. At the same time, a memorandum of understanding regarding the centralization of funds has also been signed with the banks handling remittances in the South. I am deeply gratified. Since its establishment three years ago, the Central Reserve Bank has been fortunate to fully exert the function of domestic currency. Now, with the realization of the centralization system, it can be said that the Central Reserve Bank note also possesses the function of trade currency under the control of this bank. Currently, Central China and South China are eagerly anticipating the smooth flow of transactions in various cities of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The mission of the Central Reserve Bank, as a central bank, will naturally be even more important."

Central News Agency Shanghai dispatch: Regarding the Central Reserve Bank's centralized handling of remittances in the South, the authorities of the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office issued the following statement: "The implementation of the centralized system for Central China and South China's remittances to the South by the Central Reserve Bank has resulted in the legal tender fully possessing the function of a unified domestic currency and an external economic currency, which is of great benefit to promoting trade with the South. Furthermore, remittances to the Southern region will be expressed in Japanese Yen, and the exchange rate fluctuations will be the external value of 18 Japanese Yen per 100 legal tender, which is even more noteworthy. Japan fully supports the Central Reserve Bank's centralized handling of remittances and will guide Japanese remittance banks to fully cooperate to ensure the smooth advancement of the centralized system. It is deeply believed that the implementation of centralized remittances in the South will receive a positive response from the Chinese economic community."

### Japanese Planes Repeatedly Attack Suichuan Airport

Hankou, November 11th, Central News Agency: Japanese planes, in combined large formations of fighters and bombers, attacked Suichuan Airport in Jiangxi Province several times from the night of the 10th to the 11th. They engaged in aerial combat with more than ten Chongqing planes that intercepted them.

### Japan's Third "Patriotic" Coastal Defense Ship Launched: Suppressing Submarine Warfare Will Be Further Developed

Tokyo, November 11th, Central News Agency: According to a Nagasaki telephone report, the "Patriotic Third Ship Coastal Defense Ship," built with donations from 100 million Japanese people, held its launching ceremony at a certain shipyard in Kyushu.

Tokyo, November 11th, Central News Agency: The first Japanese coastal defense ship was launched in the old brain. Recently, its second and third ships have also been completed one after another. Many countries use old first-line warships as coastal defense ships. However, the Japanese Navy was the first to design and build new warships with excellent performance to serve as coastal defense ships. Its equipment is naturally stronger and more powerful than previous coastal defense ships. The successive launching of Japanese "Patriotic Coastal Defense Ships" proves that Japan still has a great shipbuilding capacity under this profound war situation. At the same time, due to the construction of coastal defense ships, the Japanese Navy has decided to actively defend the territorial waters and prevent the enemy's submarines from traveling between Japan and the mainland or between Japan and various southern regions. It is almost impossible to completely prevent the enemy's submarines from traveling to the East. However, due to the progress of various weapons, which is changing with each passing day, there will be a leap in submarine tactics in the future. The position of today's sharp coastal defense ships is extremely important.

### Japanese Army's War Results in Various Provinces of North China

### Land and Air Battles in New Guinea and Elsewhere Become More Intense: Japanese Naval Air Force Raids Makin Island

Tokyo, November 11th, Central News Agency: According to a telegram from a Japanese military base in the South Pacific, the war in New Guinea and New Britain has recently become more intense. On the 6th, about 400 to 500 enemy troops, under the cover of seven tanks, attacked the Japanese army positions in the northern region of Arasa in New Guinea, but were repelled by the Japanese army guarding the area. In this battle, the enemy troops abandoned many corpses, and one tank was destroyed. In addition, air battles have also become more intense in recent days. At about 10:30 AM on the 7th, eleven enemy B-25 aircraft attacked the southern region of Marchang. The Japanese aircraft immediately intercepted them and shot down five of them. The Japanese army suffered no losses. At 9:00 PM on the same day, four enemy P-38 aircraft bombed the northern region of Madang and were shot down by Japanese aircraft. The Japanese side suffered no losses. On the 8th, enemy aircraft repeatedly bombed the southwestern region of Madang three times. The first time was at 8:00 AM, with an enemy fighter-bomber joint formation of 28 P-25 and P-38 aircraft. The second time was at 2:00 PM, with an enemy fighter-bomber joint formation of 46 B-25 and P-38 aircraft. The third time was at 3:00 PM, with an enemy formation of 14 P-40 aircraft. On this day, Japanese aircraft shot down a total of six enemy B-25 aircraft (including one unconfirmed) and one P-40 aircraft. The Japanese side suffered no losses. On the 8th, the enemy attacked Madang with a large formation of 88 B-25, P-38, and P-40 aircraft, and as a result, the Japanese anti-aircraft artillery units shot down six B-25 aircraft and one P-40 aircraft.

Tokyo, November 11th, Central News Agency: According to a telegram from a Japanese military base in the South Pacific, the Japanese naval fighter squadron engaged in combat with enemy P-21 aircraft over the sea north of New Britain on the night of the 9th, shooting down one of them.

### German Troops in Italian Mountains Launch Fierce Counteroffensive: Arranging Echeloned Fortifications That Are Indestructible

Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency: According to the German military authorities: German troops on the Italian front have withdrawn from San Vittore, six miles from Cassino.

Lisbon, November 11th, Central News Agency: Reuters reporter Brown reported on the 10th that the German army has launched a strong counteroffensive on the Italian front, saying that the German army has launched a fierce counteroffensive against the positions of the U.S. Fifth Army on Mount Magugu, which is located four miles north of San Vittore, 4,000 feet above sea level, and is the throat of northern Latzshi, which is very important. The German army also launched a counteroffensive against the U.S. Fifth Army in other places.

Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency: According to a dispatch from the Haitong News Agency, the U.S. Fifth Army launched a large-scale offensive on a 20-kilometer-wide battle line north of the highway from Minano to Cassino. It lasted for three consecutive days from January 4th and reached its most intense point on the fourth day, but its momentum weakened after the fifth day. This offensive only captured the abandoned village of San Vittore and the nearby heights, advancing only three kilometers in total. The German army has deployed echeloned defense lines along the mountains, which are not easy to break through. Although the German army has suffered some losses, its defensive power remains intact. It has now withdrawn to the pre-arranged defense lines east of Vidigusokifaaro to continue to defend. It is still unknown when the enemy army will be able to launch another offensive. As for other fronts, there have been no awards since the new year.

### Peace Proposal Said: German Side Denies

Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency: According to a dispatch from the Haitong News Agency: A German Foreign Ministry official said yesterday: The rumor about the peace proposal made by the German ambassador to Turkey, Papen, "is purely fictional. Those who spread this rumor and repeatedly mention Bata are trying to make readers more easily deceived. This rumor is often repeated by the enemy after a considerable period of time."

### The German Governor-General of Poland's Letter to the Polish People

Krakow, November 11th, Central News Agency: According to a dispatch from the Haitong News Agency: The Polish people are eagerly awaiting news that will determine their fate. Many people gather to listen to the loudspeakers set up on the streets. The general public generally believes that the fate of their country has been decided. No matter what the outcome of the war, Poland will not become an independent country in the end. Only a small part of the Polish people welcome the entry of the Soviet army due to Pan-Slavic and communist ideas. However, they also do not know whether Moscow is willing to accept their cooperation, or whether there is already a Polish regime in Moscow. Due to this hesitation, many guerrillas are entrenched in the forests of eastern Poland. Their activities are mostly small-scale, such as attacking German sesame cake farms. The German Governor-General of Poland, Frank, issued a letter to the Polish people, saying that the sincere Polish farmers, businessmen, and public and private employees can be seen from their usual attitude that they only seek to live and work in peace and participate in the common work of Europe in order to restore peace as soon as possible. The Governor-General's Office is responsible for repeatedly stating that those who participate in such work will definitely be understood by the German authorities. In order to protect these law-abiding people, the authorities will do their best to put out the terrorists who are disrupting order. It must be known that violent actions are not enough to write to the German authorities, but are enough to endanger the safety of the Polish people. However, the German army on the Eastern Front is the only force to prevent the red imperialists from ravaging Poland.

### Soviet Army on the Eastern Front Conducting an Encirclement Maneuver: Advancing Towards Bessarabia

Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency: According to the German military authorities: Soviet troops have reached Sarni, 25 miles inside the old Polish border.

Stockholm, November 11th, Central News Agency: For the past two days, the Ukrainian front has been experiencing blizzards and the temperature has dropped to minus six degrees, but the Soviet army, which is attempting to encircle the German army in the bend of the Dnieper River, and the German army, which is fighting bravely, are still engaged in bloody battles everywhere on a 500-kilometer-long battle line. In addition, in order to seize the Odessa-Krakow railway, the Ukrainian trunk line, to cut off the German rear, the Soviet army has been encircling Vinnitsa from the east, west, north, and south on the 10th and is also actively advancing towards the Bessarabian border between Zhmerinka and Proskurv. However, the German counterattack force is also increasing with the progress of the war. It has now formed a strong line of defense along the Bug River to prevent the Soviet army from advancing head-on. Another Soviet army unit is tailing the German army that withdrew from Kirovograd and advanced to Alekusevka north of the city and Ivanovga, 20 kilometers southwest of the city, on the 10th, intending to encircle the German army in Krivoy Rog. If the Soviet army's operation is successful, the situation will become serious. The German authorities have also recognized the seriousness of the situation and are implementing a shortening of the sticky battlefield and increasing reserve forces in order to defeat the Soviet army one by one. The war situation is now intensifying daily.

### British Aircraft Violate Airspace: Sweden Lodges Protest

Lisbon, November 11th, Central News Agency: According to London news: The Swedish envoy to London has lodged a protest with the British government regarding the British aircraft's intrusion into Swedish territory on the 6th of this month.

### Under British and American Inducement and Threat, Turkey Still Maintains Neutrality

Istanbul, November 11th, Central News Agency: Since the convening of the Tehran Conference, the United Kingdom and the United States have used various means to pressure the Turkish government to try to make Turkey join the anti-Axis camp, but the country seems to be maintaining a cautious attitude and watching the progress of the war. Recently, a British military mission arrived in Istanbul and has begun to investigate military facilities and air force bases in Turkey. In addition, the newly appointed Supreme Commander of the Mediterranean, Wilson, also recently arrived in Ankara, and it is rumored that the British military envoy's arrival in Turkey is the vanguard of Britain's strong pressure on Turkey. Recently, the number of British engineers and workers in Ankara and Istanbul has increased sharply. These British people seem to be following. In addition, the Turkish ambassador to the United Kingdom, Airbe, recently returned to Ankara, planning to strengthen British-Turkish relations, which has led to widespread speculation that the Turkish government is about to be reorganized. However, judging from the current situation, Turkey has no intention of joining the war immediately. When we judge Turkey's attitude, we must pay attention to the Soviet offensive in the southern part of the Eastern Front and the Soviet-Polish conflict. Now the Soviet army does not want to continue to launch an offensive in the southern part of the Eastern Front, and the United Kingdom and the United States have taken a disdainful attitude towards the Soviet-Polish dispute. Therefore, it is expected that Turkey will still adhere to its policy of neutrality. It is said that the Turkish Prime Minister raised two difficult questions to the British and American representatives at the Cairo Conference as a prerequisite for Turkey's participation in the war: First, Turkey will increase the supply of military supplies, and second, it will drive out the German domination of the Aegean Sea and the Balkan Peninsula. The above conditions cannot be realized

### Report from America Suggests Agreement with Soviet Union to Maintain Permanent Peace

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a Reuters dispatch, the New York correspondent of the London Daily Mail reports that the United States may reach an agreement with the Soviet Union to avoid a third world war. Political figures are paying close attention to several speeches hosted by the State Department, and it is said that these speeches frequently touch upon this agreement. The draft is said to have been brought back by Hull from Moscow.

Subtle Relations Between Soviet Union and Poland

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a Reuters dispatch, the German Foreign Ministry stated that the Soviet Union immediately denied the news of the Soviet-Polish border dispute published by the diplomatic correspondent of the London "Observer." The relationship between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States is not difficult to discern. The correspondent mentioned that the Soviet Union suggested demarcating the Soviet-Polish border according to the so-called "Curzon Line" of 1920, and compensating Poland's lost territory with German territory. The German Foreign Ministry believes that the "Observer's" diplomatic correspondent published this news, or had first obtained understanding or hints from British and American authorities. It is widely believed that Britain and the United States hope to discuss the Soviet-Polish border dispute, but the Soviet Union's denial shows that it does not want to discuss this issue. The German Foreign Ministry also mentioned the recent Swedish newspaper's surprise at the Soviet Union's unwillingness to take advantage of the benefits that democratic countries offer, stating that the opposite is true. The Soviet Union not only does not accommodate the anti-Axis powers but also disregards its anti-alliance. The Swedish newspaper's remarks show that the neutral public often has misconceptions about the true views of the Soviet Union.

### Trial of Italian Treason Case Concluded, Ciano Sentenced to Death

Verona, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a Reuters dispatch: The special court here has concluded the trial of Ciano and seventeen former members of the Fascist Grand Council who signed against Mussolini, which ultimately led to the July 25th Incident. Yesterday, Ciano and eighteen other members were sentenced to death, and one person was sentenced to thirty years of hard labor. Only Ciano personally appeared in court. Marshal Bono and five former members including Maricuei Baresi Kotehadi, etc., except for former Deputy Secretary of the Fascist Labor Union Qianeti who was sentenced to thirty years of hard labor, all other defendants were sentenced to death.

### On the Eve of the Decisive Battle: Germany's Defense Capabilities

The Asahi Shimbun's Berlin-based special correspondent, Moriyama, recently traveled to neutral Spain and Portugal, spending about a month there before returning to Berlin at the end of the year. After seeing these two Iberian countries, he deeply felt that the great powers currently contending for national survival in Europe are the three major powers of Germany, England, and Russia. In today's Europe, so-called integrity, kindness, truth, and everything else are floating like rootless seaweed in the ever-changing tides. Whether it is the Atlantic Charter, the New Order Declaration, or hundreds of other propaganda and discussions, all are flowing in this turbulent current. In the end, they cannot break through the rather simple and timeless iron rule of "the strong dominate." In other words, the current stage of the European war is progressing much like a physical process: strong forces create environments, and environments dictate human thought. So, what kind of mechanical phenomena are the forces of Germany and the external pressures of the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States creating on the current European battlefield? Here, we must frankly admit that since the valiant sacrifice of Field Marshal Paulus's Sixth Army in Stalingrad, Germany has faced an extremely difficult path in the Eastern Front, the Southern Front, and the Third Front in the air over the past year. Forces with more weapons and creating advantages occupy favorable positions. The European war is heading towards a world with these conditions.

When the homeland is in danger, attacking enemy battleships with human torpedoes has become common knowledge among the Japanese. Therefore, it is difficult to understand when seeing this "world of common sense" in Europe. But first, we must know that, in principle, there are no miracles on the European battlefield.

Reality Advances to the Victory of Common Sense

The European war is entering its sixth year with the new year, and it will soon enter a decisive phase. Both sides stand resolutely in a four-cornered formation, about to determine the final outcome. Moreover, they are not lined up in a four-cornered formation in the center of the wrestling ring; the positions of the enemy and us are constantly moving along the edge of the wrestling ring. The gasping sounds heard from there are extremely urgent. The blows suffered by the opponent are deep, and the tempering experienced by the allies is also profound. Faced with this reality, if one still cannot believe in "the victory of common sense" or "the victory of physical strength," then the European war is truly a tragedy.

But here, it must be pointed out that the heroic ideas often held by the Japanese harbor the danger of misjudging the future of the European war. Germany's idea of placing the origins of the new European order on military strength was correct. Germany always believed that it must use force to defeat the enemy and overwhelm the enemy. Hundreds of propagandas and statements are no match for a single small military victory. Looking out at the enemy situation from the neutral countries of Iberia, recalling Germany, and then returning to the bombed-out Berlin, the reporter felt this point most strongly.

Germany's Strength as Seen in Defensive Capabilities

So, where is the strength of Germany, which made France surrender in six weeks, now at work? This strength cannot be seen in the form of active offensive power, but we find this strength in the current defensive capabilities. On the vast Eastern Front, desperately stopping the fierce pressure of the superior Soviet army, resolutely responding to the terrifying bombing piercing the heart of Berlin, this strength can be said to be stronger than the German strength that subdued France in six weeks in a certain sense. We see a different form of German strength than three years ago. In other words, it is "tenacity." It is not a blitzkrieg racing through the battlefield; the enemy and us are struggling on the edge of the wrestling ring. The German tenacity displayed there amazes us, and the most shocked are probably the enemies themselves. In the previous war, the famine war of food blockade caused the German people to collapse from within. This time, the enemy's strategy is to replace food blockade with terror bombing, attempting the same effect.

In 1943, German military communiqués stated that 54 cities, large and small, suffered the tragedy of terror bombing, with Berlin being the worst. It was subjected to 13 major air raids, dropping a total of tens of thousands of tons of bombs. As a result, a part of Berlin has been completely destroyed. On the bustling streets of Berlin, one sees the same scene as Zhabei and Yangshupu, which were turned into scorched earth after dozens of days of fierce fighting. Every citizen of Berlin keenly feels the impression of fighting on the front line. Seven million citizens in Hamburg and small cities in the Rhine region have moved to other safer places within Germany. The tragedy of hundreds of thousands of families being destroyed overnight, leaving them disheveled and fleeing in panic, would have turned into rebellion or riots in peacetime.

Attempt to Discourage Fighting Spirit Fails

The police force and the organization for maintaining order have been established, ensuring the safe evacuation of the elderly, women, and children. Emergency relief facilities such as food and lodging are fully equipped. Every German citizen maintains an extremely strong morale under wartime conditions. The same is true in Hamburg. If one of the goals of the enemy's terror bombing is to discourage the morale of the German people, it will not be achieved. In 1940, Germany also bombed London, believing that it could make the British abandon their will to fight. However, that was a delusion, and now the British and American air forces are repeating the same mistake. At the current stage, if one wants to draw a conclusion about bombing, it is possible to make the people of small countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium lose their will to fight. However, it is impossible to make the people of large countries such as England and Germany abandon their will to fight solely through bombing. In some cases, it creates the opposite effect, making the opponent's will to fight even stronger. Although it seems like a detour, bombing should be concentrated on destroying the enemy's military facilities or military industrial capacity.

All Sectors Responding Enthusiastically

The readers of this newspaper are enthusiastically responding to the scholarship fund, donating generously, which is deeply appreciated. We received a letter from Lai Youji yesterday, stating that the scholarship fund organized by this newspaper not only benefits the poor but also cultivates talents for the country. They have gathered a few friends to contribute 10,000 yuan in national currency to express their support. The students of all grades of the Zhongxi No. 1 Primary School extracted 2,000 yuan in national currency from the charity donations raised during Christmas as the scholarship fund for this newspaper to express the mutual assistance of the children. Mr. Wang Huichen saw the newspaper's call for aid to education and expressed deep sympathy. He specifically saved his New Year's bonus, totaling 500 yuan in national currency, for aid to education. At the same time, he hopes that other readers will also actively participate.

Short Commentary

### Paying Respect to All Those Who Generously Donate to the Scholarship Fund

The application forms for the sixth round of this newspaper's reader scholarship fund were distributed over three days from the 8th to the 10th. The crowding situation exceeded expectations, with over 16,000 forms issued to new and returning students. Our hope is that all those who meet the standards can receive assistance. However, the problem lies in whether the amount of the scholarship fund is sufficient. The original plan was for 3 million yuan, which is not enough for distribution. Therefore, we have been calling on readers to donate generously for days.

As expected, it has aroused the noble sympathy of people from all walks of life. Yesterday, we were honored to receive 200,000 yuan from Mr. Sheng Wenyi and his wife and son. For the previous scholarship fund, Mr. Sheng personally and through fundraising from relatives and friends donated as much as 170,000 yuan. Such enthusiasm is truly worthy of our respect.

Dr. Wang Zhenchuan also donated 80,000 yuan yesterday. He transferred 340,000 yuan, which were the birthday gifts from relatives and friends for the seventieth birthdays of his parents, to be used for charitable deeds. This newspaper's scholarship fund received 80,000 yuan, which has a profound meaning and is worthy of emulation.

In addition, people from all walks of life responded enthusiastically, and we received over 300,000 yuan throughout the day, which makes us feel extremely excited. However, we are still far from the goal. We are preparing to launch a campaign to request donations from leaders in the industrial and commercial sectors. We firmly believe that the enthusiasm of people in the industrial and commercial sectors will not lag behind others and will definitely be able to contribute to the success.

### Dedication Plane Cup Soccer Match: China Defeats Italian League 3-2, Charity Auction of Soccer Ball Nets 100,000 Yuan

The Dedication Plane Cup Charity Soccer Match, sponsored by the Municipal Public Dedication Plane Movement Committee, kicked off at Yiyuan Stadium yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. China faced off against the Italian League. Mayor Chen personally kicked off the game, and Minister Ding presided over the auction of soccer balls and the awarding of prizes. The charity sale began, and the bidding was extremely enthusiastic. In the end, Liuhe She broke the highest record for the auction of Italian soccer balls. The Chinese team relied on good luck to defeat the Italian League 3-2, and team captain Li Ning took home the trophy.

Relationship with Luck

Although the Italian League suffered a crushing defeat yesterday, their spirit and perseverance far surpassed China's. Due to extremely bad luck, they lost the game. In terms of individual skills, the Italian League's defender, Mai Gezi, acted on his own, giving the impression of a group without a leader. The cooperative understanding of the center-back line was lacking. The rear defenders, Qi Xiang and Li Ning, had different playing styles, making cooperation impossible. In the second half, Qi Xiang and Zhang Lingen switched positions, and the situation gradually improved.

Match Process

At the beginning of the match, the Italian League's offensive was strong, with great momentum. After eight minutes, Di Pan Na stood on his own, hooking the ball in mid-air. Liu Xianhan was caught off guard, and China conceded the first goal. Four minutes later, the Chinese team launched a full-scale offensive. Song Lingsheng stood in the way, intercepted the ball, and passed it to Xu Wenkui. The ball crossed the final defensive line, and Li [Blank] scored with a header. The angle was precise, and McNitti risked his life to save it, but it was too late. The score was tied. Ten minutes later, Wu Qi Xiang accidentally scored an own goal, and Liu Xian Han was too careless and should bear half the responsibility. As things changed, Xu Wenkui steadily secured the victory. Each team scored two goals in the first half, resulting in a tie. After switching sides, both teams went all out. The game went from relaxed to tense. [Blank] Yongfu and Sun Jinshun sold their youth well, but they failed to contribute. Before long, Italian League's Luo Xulai committed a foul in the penalty area and was awarded a penalty kick, which Sun Jinshun kicked in to make it 3-2, coming from behind. When time was up, China defeated the Italian League 3-2.

### Citizen Welfare Association Requests Strict Supervision of Maritime Administration to Avoid Repeating the Huatai Ferry Disaster

The Municipal Citizen Welfare Association, in view of the tragic disaster of the sinking of the Huatai ferry due to the lax supervision of the Maritime Administration, to avoid repeating the same mistake, specifically requested the Ministries of Transportation and Finance to strictly order the relevant agencies to strictly enforce the regulations. The original text is as follows: "Regarding the Huatai Ferry Disaster, which was due to the lax supervision of the Maritime Administration, we earnestly request that the Customs be strictly ordered to instruct the Maritime Administration to strictly enforce the regulations to prevent future tragedies: We have learned that the Huatai ferry of the Shanghai China Shipping Company suffered an accident in the Xin'gang River area at 7:30 PM on December 9th of last year. Crew members and passengers were killed by drowning, with over 700 people dead, making it an unprecedented catastrophe in the shipping industry in recent years. Regarding the cause of the sinking, the company blamed it on passengers not maintaining order and swarming onto the ship before the passengers inside disembarked. As a result, both disembarking and embarking passengers gathered on one side of the ship, causing the ship to tilt and flood rapidly, making it impossible to stop. According to the accounts of surviving passengers, most of the passengers were porters carrying goods piled up on the deck. The crew members would not allow them to enter the cabin until they had negotiated terms and received fees. Therefore, the top was heavy and the bottom was light, causing the ship to tilt and capsize. The Maritime Administration believes that the main reason for the ship's capsizing was that the load exceeded the prescribed limit by more than double. The crew members did not comply with the regulations and were not inspected, and there were also shortcomings in driving management. Combining the talks from the three parties and comparing them, the cause of this accident should be attributed to each party's responsibility. However, the disorder and crowding of passengers, as well as the stacking of goods on the deck, were due to the crew members' lack of guidance, who only knew how to be greedy and exploit passengers, not knowing that the crew members have the obligation to serve travelers. This cannot be entirely blamed on the passengers. The Dongchang ferry, a municipal ferry barge, carrying 402 passengers, piled the wood it was carrying on the top of the boat, creating a top-heavy situation. When the boat turned around, there happened to be wind and waves, causing it to capsize. Passengers fell into the Huangpu River, the same as the Huatai ferry disaster. Not long after this case occurred, the company's Anhe ferry arrived at Xin'gang at 2:00 PM on December 14th. Thirty or forty sampan boatmen climbed aboard, causing the ship to tilt and presenting a dangerous situation. Fortunately, a neighboring boat rescued them, and nothing happened. Based on this, the disaster of capsizing can happen at any time. How can we not learn from the pain and plan for the future? Members of this association, in view of this tragic case, propose the following plans to be warned by previous occurrences: We specifically request that your Ministry strictly order the Jianghai Customs to instruct the Maritime Administration to strictly enforce the regulations regarding the technical inspection of crew members, the prohibition of exceeding the prescribed load limit, and how to smoothly facilitate the transportation of materials in various places, to avoid small merchants risking their lives for profit, traveling on the river at night. The company should be ordered to build docks or build platform boats in convenient locations to ensure the safety of travelers embarking and disembarking. Instead of trying to fix things after they happen, it is better to put more effort into the people, so that the people can benefit more. The laws of the country must not be empty words, and major tragedies must not recur in society. This is what the members of this association hope for. As for the aftermath of the Huatai disaster, we should promptly handle it strictly. The members of this association humbly request that the Ministry review and instruct us on the implementation. Sincerely submitted to the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Finance.

Economic Community's Comments

### General Mobilization of Production

Yesterday, we mentioned that the National Government's participation in the war has entered its second year, and the Chairman has declared that this year's focus should be on the production increase movement. Now, we would like to add our supportive words to the broadcast speech given the day before yesterday by Mr. Tajiri, the Japanese Minister to our allied nation, on the "Strengthening Production Movement."

Minister Tajiri believes that this is not a time for empty talk. All personnel in various industries should unite and exert their full strength to study and enhance production. We are very pleased to feel that the sentence we quoted yesterday, "Governing is not about talking much, but about acting vigorously," is exactly the same as what Minister Tajiri said. In short, empty talk about increasing production is a thing of the past. From now on, it is a period of general mobilization of production. Whether one was previously engaged in production or not, everyone must now gather under the banner of the production increase movement and dedicate themselves as industrial warriors on the production line. As Minister Tajiri said, "No one should be allowed to fall behind." Only then can it be called a general mobilization of production.

The most important condition after the general mobilization of production is the active improvement of production methods. The ways to achieve this are: In terms of management, all factories must strive for scientific management in the future, whether it be in personnel, equipment, machinery, materials, or operations. They must strive for the most efficient operation under the two conditions of reducing consumption and increasing efficiency. In terms of work, the managers, factory directors, and workers of all factories must work hard within their respective positions and not be disturbed by any thoughts or activities outside their positions. Managers should focus on production planning, factory directors should focus on production management, and workers should focus on the use of production machinery and equipment. Only then can the production increase movement achieve the most satisfactory results and contribute to the circle of industrial co-prosperity!

### Chinese Stocks Suddenly Soar; Evergreen and Other Old Stocks Once Again Become Investment Targets for the Wealthy

Investment targets for Chinese stocks have recently shifted to most of the old stocks, resulting in a vigorous rise in recent days. Medium and small new stocks have become dull.

### Improving Railway Transportation: A Stopgap Measure

— Wang Weiying

The recent election of Zheng Hongnian, a leader in the transportation industry, as the president of the China Central Railway Company, with the intention of improving the long-chaotic railway transportation and reducing the suffering of travelers, is indeed a wise move by the authorities.

It is undeniable that the fundamental problem of the current transportation situation lies in the large-scale activities of individual peddlers. Therefore, to prescribe the right medicine, eliminating the peddlers would solve the root cause. However, this involves politics, so let's put it aside for now.

As for stopgap measures, there are two main ideas: (A) Absolutely prohibit passengers from carrying luggage. Only single travelers without personal belongings are allowed to board. If they entrust a travel agency to transport their goods, they will not be able to obtain huge profits, and the procedures will be more time-consuming, which they will not be willing to do. It is easier for the controlling authorities to inspect, and it is not inconvenient for ordinary passengers. (B) In addition to the date, the train number should be added to the ticket, and regardless of first, second, third, or fourth class, seats should be assigned to each person. Or, for third and fourth class tickets, which are more numerous, the car number can be printed in addition. In this way, each ticket guarantees a seat, which will definitely reduce the degree of disorder.

### Request for Manuscript Fees

Ambition (2)

When the autumn semester started, Masato's painstaking sunbathing paid off and he received praise from Major Kikuchi. At the same time, he was also ridiculed by his classmates.

"Look! The apple has turned black, what a roasted apple."

At that time, roasted apples were popular in coffee shops on the street.

"Hum..." Masato smiled indifferently. This was because he didn't even know what a roasted apple was. He never bought things outside. This was mainly because he didn't have much money in his pocket, and especially because his mother didn't like that kind of behavior.

At the beginning of the new semester, Masato was elected as the deputy group leader. Although his music scores were not good, his mathematics and English scores were outstanding. So that's why he got this result.

"That's great..." His mother was also very happy and bought group snacks called "Harukoma" to celebrate.

Mother - is there anyone better than a mother in the world? Masato's love for his mother has become even more profound recently. Now he understands the feeling of his mother fighting for her children and family at all costs. He also understood why his mother wore ragged clothes herself, while making sure that Taro and Masato wore neat clothes. If his father was still alive, he would never understand his mother's heart so deeply--

"Mom's rice, let me serve you!" One morning, when the family gathered for breakfast, Masato said this, dragging the rice bucket to his side.

"Boys don't need to do such things." His mother gently rebuked him. In fact, there were many maids such as Matsueda, Kayo, and Akigiku.

Masato lost face and blushed.

"Then, I'll just serve one bowl..." Having said that, his mother couldn't refuse, and handed him the rice bowl. Masato seemed to be showing his respect by filling the bowl to the brim.

"Oh, this is really too much..." His mother didn't know how to take it, but a smile appeared on her long face.

From then on, Masato never complained about the dishes in his lunch box. Even if there were only a few pieces of salted radish, he never complained. When he finished eating, it was as clean as if it had been washed, without leaving a single grain of rice. That was because he noticed that it would save his sisters trouble when cleaning up. Sometimes he squatted by the well to wash his own things. His technique was also quite skilled. All in all, Masato was a very admirable young man. But his admirable qualities did not win his mother's favor.

(It would be better if that kind of child died quickly...)
