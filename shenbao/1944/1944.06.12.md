### Civil Rights

The wartime academic lectures jointly sponsored by the News Daily and this newspaper first hired Dr. Sasaki, an agricultural expert from an Allied nation, to lecture on agricultural technology, providing guidance on improving production methods, and giving detailed observations and unique insights on the agricultural situation in various countries around the world. Professor Yūki Tomotsune was then invited and arrived in Shanghai at the end of last month. On June 3rd, he gave a radio address on Shanghai Radio, elaborating on the true meaning and new spirit of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, giving us the latest explanation.

Some in the government, rather than seeking the true intention of the common people, are often afraid of civil rights, and because of this fear, often oppose them. In fact, civil rights can help the government exercise its governing power, just as Professor Yūki said: "So-called civil rights do not mean advocating one's own privileges alongside the people and restricting the power of those in government." He also said: "Those in government must constantly reflect on themselves, always be willing to be honest, just, and poor, always listen to the voices of the people, and strive to seek out and not overlook talent." This is the true meaning of civil rights. Indeed, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, in the Three Principles of the People, analyzed the distinction between political power and governing power extremely clearly: civil rights are political power, belonging to the people; governing power is administrative power, belonging to the government. Because the people have political power, the government can then exercise governing power in accordance with the will of the people; because the people have political power, the government can then strengthen its governing power. In the Eastern national tradition of "the people are paramount," this is the most ideal system. The greatest hope of those who advocate civil rights lies in the government carrying out its policies in accordance with the will of the people, while the people wholeheartedly support the government that implements policies based on the will of the people. The people will never restrict the government's governing power, and will be even more willing to find ways to solve the difficulties the government encounters when implementing policies based on the will of the people. When the government implements policies on behalf of the people, the people will naturally wholeheartedly maintain it.

Some even say that civil rights are acceptable in peacetime, but in wartime, war comes first and civil rights come second. Little do they know that it is precisely because the country is at war that the need for civil rights is even more urgent. Professor Yūki said: "If the hundreds of millions of people do not rise up, national strength cannot be generated. The slogan of the Meiji Restoration was, 'Enlighten the common people, keep the people tireless, and decide all matters through public opinion.'" Total war requires the strength of the entire nation. The government's responsibility is to concentrate all forces, condensing them into one extremely great force, and this force is national strength. Therefore, the generation of national strength must come from the rise of the people. The government must lead the people to rise up, hoping that the people will exert their own strength; in other words, it must encourage the people to exert their strength. The saying "With the hearts of all the people united, lifting is easy" is extremely necessary in peacetime, and even more urgent in wartime. Professor Yūki said: "In this way, public opinion will be readily conveyed, and public discourse will flourish. Then, China will unintentionally become a paradise of the Kingly Way." Therefore, only those who recognize the power of the people, and recognize that only the entire power of the people can defeat everything, can talk about civil rights. Those who do not have this understanding cannot lead the people to rise up, and if they cannot lead the people to rise up, they cannot gather national strength.

The most important thing in wartime is the concentration of power. Within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the individual strength of each country must first be concentrated, and then the strength of each country must be concentrated to devote the strength of all the countries of Greater East Asia to the Greater East Asia War. Victory is certain, and liberation is inevitable.

### After Treatment by Allied Doctors, Chairman Wang's Health Restored; Foreign Minister Chu Returns to Nanjing to Report on His Trip to Japan

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) Since Chairman Wang of the National Government went to Japan to recuperate, his health has been improving day by day under the careful treatment of Allied doctors, which has been a cause for great joy throughout the country. Foreign Minister Chu recently made a special trip to Japan to respectfully inquire about the Chairman's condition, and to convey the concerns of the people of the country. He returned to the country on the 8th, and returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 10th. This reporter made a special visit to inquire about the details of his trip. He shared the following: "I, on behalf of the National Government, went to Japan in late May to respectfully inquire about the Chairman's condition, to inspect his illness, and to convey the regards of my colleagues and the concerns of the people of the country. During my stay in Japan, I respectfully expressed thanks on behalf of the Chairman to all sectors of Allied Japan, from the Emperor down to officials and the public. I also visited the Ise, Kasuga, Meiji, and Three Shrines, as well as the Momoyama Imperial Mausoleum and the Yasukuni Shrine. I held separate banquets, respectfully inviting Prince Mikasa, Prime Minister Tōjō, and various cabinet members, Minister of the Imperial Household Matsudaira, Marshals Sugiyama and Nagano, and Advisors Arita and Yamashita. At the same time, I attended a tea party held by Prince Mikasa, and banquets hosted by Ministers Matsudaira, Shigemitsu, Aoki, and Ishiwatari, and Advisors Arita and Yamashita, as well as President Yoshizawa and General Tsuda. I also visited the Greater East Asia Academy led by General Tsuda. I completed my official duties and returned to the country on the 7th of this month. On the 8th, I flew back to Shanghai, and on the 9th, I visited Acting Chairman Chen and Acting President Zhou to report on my trip. I also visited the heads of Allied agencies in Shanghai. That evening, I attended a banquet hosted by General Kondo. On the evening of the 10th, I arrived safely in the capital. On the morning of the 11th, I respectfully visited the mausoleum of the Founding Father, and attended the joint stupa ceremony for the bones of the Great Tang Sanzang Master. At noon, I went to the Kunyuan Temple to worship the Eleven-Faced Guanyin, and inspected the repair work of the Zhejiang Compatriots Association. Over the next two days, the 12th and 13th, I will visit the embassies of Allied nations in Nanjing, as well as the heads of various army and navy agencies, to maintain proper decorum. The Allied doctors are providing meticulous treatment to Chairman Wang, and his health is improving day by day. During my stay in Japan, I accompanied the Allied attending physicians to visit him daily, and I am convinced that he will recover within a few months. I am adding this to my report upon returning to Nanjing to comfort the people of the country."

### Government Stabilizes Finance, Regulates Rural Currency

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) The government's financial authorities, in view of the abundance of idle capital in urban areas and the fact that general merchants are using this large amount of idle capital to arbitrarily manipulate goods in pursuit of exorbitant profits, which has a significant impact on the completion of the controlled economy, made every effort to tighten the supply of funds in February and March of this year. As a result, the money market suddenly tightened, and general merchants felt a sense of illiquidity, forcing them to gradually dump their hoarded goods. Since the implementation of this tightening policy, it has had a considerable effect, and the prices of various goods have stabilized somewhat. If it can be further implemented thoroughly in the future, then all goods will inevitably be guided towards proper production. In recent times, urban credit has been very tight on the surface, but in reality, only lower- and middle-level merchants with smaller capital and weaker operating capacity cannot withstand the initial tightening of funds, and immediately release their hoarded goods. As for those with stronger financial resources, the current degree of tightening is not enough to force them to dump their stockpiles, which is something we cannot ignore. In addition, the amount of currency in rural areas is also increasing compared to before. If there is no appropriate way to deal with it reasonably in the future, the future is not optimistic. This is because the large-scale purchase of agricultural products inevitably leads to an increase in rural currency. However, the industrial supplies needed by rural areas cannot actually be supplied in appropriate quantities, so the funds used to purchase agricultural products cannot return to urban areas, but remain in rural areas. If this continues, rural currency will undoubtedly show signs of inflation, and the consequences would be disastrous. Therefore, in the future, in terms of purchasing agricultural products, we should minimize the amount of cash as much as possible, and exchange them for industrial materials as much as possible. On the one hand, we should make every effort to bring the existing currency in rural areas back to urban areas, and prevent it from remaining there, so as not to cause undesirable consequences. In summary, regarding the two points of tightening urban credit again and regulating rural currency, it is deeply believed that the relevant authorities have long been aware of the advantages and disadvantages, and have formulated effective countermeasures, and will implement them as soon as possible. Then the stabilization of finance, the stabilization of people's livelihood, and the future of the entire wartime economic system will be infinitely bright.

### General Overview of the Northern Burma War Situation: British, American, and Chongqing Forces in a Dilemma

The U.S.-Chongqing Allied forces under the command of enemy General Stilwell, on the maritime front, attempted to echo the offensive of U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz to open up a new supply route to Chongqing. On the land front, they harbored the unrealistic plan of attacking the Japanese mainland. Therefore, since the autumn of last year, in the Hugong area of northern Burma, they supervised the three divisions of Chongqing forces stationed in India to fight, vainly attempting to open the Ledo Road. As a result, the Hugong area was built into a mountain of corpses and a river of blood, and the enemy forces were repeatedly defeated. At the beginning of March of this year, the enemy dispatched airborne troops, making a desperate gamble. These paratroopers attempted to disrupt the rear supply lines of the Japanese forces in the Hugong area and recapture the major cities of northern Burma. However, the Japanese forces took swift action to encircle and attack them, and the enemy forces were on the verge of collapse. However, the enemy did not change its nature, and again used a Chongqing army-formed airborne unit to land in the rear of the Japanese forces near Myitkyina, attempting to echo the American forces invading on the ground, to take Myitkyina in one fell swoop, and then connect with the Chongqing army advancing across the Nujiang River. Before the imminent rainy season, they would completely open up the Ledo Road, so they were fighting desperately. The fierce offensive and defensive battles currently unfolding in northern Burma are described below.

Hugong Front

This line consists of three divisions of the Indian-Chongqing army and two brigades of British and American troops under the command of Stilwell. They attacked in the Hugong area with the slogan "The Road to Tokyo" and with the assistance of the so-called superior U.S. Air Force, counterattacking for seven months. During this period, it was an excellent opportunity for the Japanese army to carry out a war of attrition. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and was in a state of inability to fight. In addition, the rainy season was approaching, the climate was bad, and the U.S. Air Force used the defense of Imphal as an excuse to reduce its cooperation. The attempt to open the Ledo Road was shattered.

Airborne Troops

Thousands of troops attempted to resist by relying on the first line of defense, which was as solid as a fortress. However, due to the careful and decisive attacks by the Japanese-Indian Allied forces on land and in the air, and the brave struggle of the people of northern Burma, the enemy's position finally collapsed. They retreated north and built a second position, attempting to cut off the Japanese supply line again. However, after a fierce attack by the Japanese army, most of them were encircled and annihilated. The few who escaped were suffering from hunger and disease in the torrential rains of the northern Burmese forests, and continued to wander towards death.

Paratrooper Troops

Stilwell's airborne troops had just failed, and as the rainy season approached, they became increasingly impatient. They then dispatched paratroopers in seven or eighty transport planes to the vicinity of Myitkyina, and added a brigade of American troops invading on the ground, attempting to recapture Myitkyina. However, the Japanese army did not let them go, and attacked them. Within a few days, most of the paratroopers were captured or annihilated. Now, the remaining paratroopers are only asking for air supplies to preserve their lives. Mountbatten, the commander of the anti-Axis Allied forces in Southeast Asia, wanted to focus on the area around Imphal and make the opening of the Ledo Road secondary, so he refused to assist Stilwell. From this, we can see that the heads of Britain and the United States have conflicting operational intentions and harbor different dreams, and their flaws are fully exposed. The paratroopers in Myitkyina have no support and can only be annihilated.

Nujiang Operations

The U.S. military attempted to open up the Ledo Road, a large-scale transportation route for troops and supplies to Chongqing, to make it serve as the forward post for the general land counteroffensive in the Greater East Asia war zone. Stilwell's unrealistic plan to open up the Ledo Road was even greater than Mountbatten's absolute defense of Imphal. Therefore, he planned that before the real rainy season arrived, the Indian-Chongqing army advancing east from Hugong would connect with the Yunnan army on the west bank of the Nujiang River in northern Tengchong. As a result, a division of the Yunnan army crossed the Nujiang River and attacked the Japanese army's flank. After ten days of fighting, corpses were left everywhere, and the "Tragedy of the Nujiang River" unfolded.

In that area, rain clouds covered the front line for days, making it difficult for the U.S. military stationed in Chongqing to be active. The generals on the front line begged Stilwell, who had forced them to cross the river, to supply food and ammunition from the air. At a time when the Air Force was providing inadequate assistance to the paratroopers in the main operational area of Hugong, it was of course impossible to cooperate on the Nujiang front.

### Japanese Army Advances to Yiyang; Fierce Fighting on the Outskirts of Changsha; Japanese Planes Bomb Lingling and Hengyang

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing army authorities announced on the 10th that fierce fighting continued on the 9th on the defensive line on the outskirts of Changsha. Artillery positions north of the Laodao River fiercely shelled Changsha, the provincial capital, all day long.

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing army authorities announced on the 10th that the Japanese army had advanced to the outskirts of Yiyang, northwest of Changsha, on June 9, and was currently engaged in fierce fighting.

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing army authorities announced on the 10th that the Japanese army had reached the outskirts of Liuyang, 60 kilometers east of Changsha.

Heavily Damage Chongqing Army Air Force Base

A certain base in China, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) Japanese planes bombed the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force base, the Lingling and Hengyang airfields in Hunan Province, on the morning of the 10th, dealing a severe blow to the U.S. Air Force, which was attempting to aid the Chongqing Sixth and Ninth War Zones and launch a counteroffensive. The Japanese planes that raided Lingling engaged in a fierce dogfight with Chongqing fighter planes in the dark, and also carried out low-altitude bombing, causing fires everywhere, so that the airfield and military facilities were reduced to rubble. In addition, they destroyed nine small fighter planes and set two on fire. The Japanese planes that attacked the Hengyang airfield also inflicted heavy damage and set two small planes on fire. Therefore, the Japanese planes that bombed Lingling and Hengyang achieved significant results and returned safely to their bases.

Guangdong Rural Clearing Office Eliminates Roaming Bandits

Guangzhou, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) Since the establishment of the Rural Clearing Supervisory Commissioner's Office in the Dongbao area of Guangdong Province, it has been determined to promote rural clearing work. On the military front, it closely cooperated with the 45th Division to eliminate roaming bandits. At around 4:00 AM on the 5th of this month, more than a thousand communist bandits attacked the defense area of the 30th Division. They were met with a head-on attack by the 88th Regiment of the division. The fighting lasted until dawn. Regiment Commander Lin Fu-cheng dispatched troops to carry out the suppression. The bandits were no match and fled towards Dalingba, Baishi, and other areas. The battle lasted for about five hours, and many bandit weapons and ammunition were seized. The bandits suffered heavy casualties, leaving dozens of bodies behind. Commissioner Xu, who also serves as the director of the office, has telegraphed awards to the meritorious officers and soldiers to encourage future efforts.

### Britain and the United States Turn a Blind Eye, Chongqing Greatly Disappointed - Statement by Captain Shiota -

After the British landed in northern France, opening the prelude to the invasion of Europe, Chongqing's "Asia First, Europe Second" strategy, which it had been vigorously advocating, became the opposite of reality. In the end, it could not avoid being deceived by Britain and the United States and falling into their trap. Captain Shiota of the Japanese Naval Fleet Reporting Department in China issued the following statement on this matter yesterday:

After Nimitz launched an offensive in the central Pacific, Chongqing immediately propagated to the public that this was the natural result of the Cairo Conference, or the operation decided at the Tehran Conference, and declared that this was the meaning of "Asia First, Europe Second." Its intention was nothing more than to prevent the people's hearts from turning away.

Roosevelt and Churchill took this opportunity to carry out large-scale political maneuvers to lay the foundation for their future invasion of China. Wallace is currently waiting in Siberia for an opportunity to deal with the most troubling issue for Chongqing, the adjustment of the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The leaders of Chongqing, deceived by the plots of Britain and the United States, did not understand the operational strategies of Britain and the United States. Until the morning of the 6th, when the Allied forces invaded Europe, they were still mobilizing newspapers and telegraphs to shout the slogan of "Asia First, Europe Second." Chongqing once declared to the world that it had become one of the four great powers since the Cairo Conference, which is both ridiculous and pathetic. At a time when the people in the war zone were increasingly uneasy during the Japanese army's operation in Henan, the news of the Allied forces' invasion of Europe was enough to make the people's faith in their leaders plummet.

Liang Han-tsao, Minister of Propaganda for Chongqing, told reporters on the 7th: "The news of the attack on Europe yesterday has once again invaded our country, and our people are extremely excited. This can deal a heavy blow to Japan and promote the completion of the War of Resistance." His words rarely mentioned the issue of the attack on Europe. Liang Han-tsao must have felt extreme anger and anxiety in his heart that the slogan of "Asia First, Europe Second" that he advocated had become the opposite of reality. A special correspondent for C.D.N. in Chongqing said: "Most of the people in the Chongqing area believe that the European issue does not directly affect China. Therefore, they do not express concern."

Although Chongqing has been promoting the conquest of Asia for a long time, in this Nimitz offensive, the strategic posture of the Japanese army remained as solid as a golden wall. On both the Eastern and Western fronts, the leaders of Chongqing were deeply frightened by the Japanese army's surging attacks. Apart from comforting themselves, they only took pride in being one of the four great powers. But even if the leaders of Chongqing work hard to resist the war, if they only rely on the U.S. Pacific offensive and the British invasion of Europe, then they will often be used by Britain and the United States to take the blame for others, and have no choice but to deceive the public with propaganda to muddle through.

### Normandy Defense Line Flooded, Coastal Area Becomes Water Country, Fierce Battle for Cotentin Peninsula

Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a report from Reuters correspondent Stein, who is with the anti-Axis European Expeditionary Force: After the Allied forces flooded part of the German army's important defensive line on the Normandy coast, communication has become difficult. The area from the mouth of the Vire River around the Cotentin Peninsula to the west of Sainte-Mère-Église has become a water country. East of Lsigny, there is almost no point above sea level, and the German army has also flooded the roads between the rivers due to the lack of high ground. The German army is preventing the Allied forces from advancing on the large hills and various lines in the southwest of the Cotentin Peninsula, and fierce fighting is unfolding.

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) The German military authorities announced on the 10th that the Cotentin Peninsula is still being secured by the German army, but Lsigny, located at the mouth of the Vire River, has long been abandoned.

The Area Around Bayeux Falls into Chaos

Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) The most noteworthy aspect of the fourth day of the Allied forces' landing operation in northern France is that the U.S. military on the Cotentin Peninsula has significantly increased. Large-scale operations began on the 9th, and the German side has also acknowledged this fact. According to a London dispatch, although the U.S. military has cut across the Carentan-Cherbourg highway in several places, the German counterattacks remain extremely fierce. Eisenhower's headquarters also stated in its tenth battle report on the 10th: Fierce fighting is currently unfolding east of Cherbourg, and powerful German armored units have joined the battle. At the same time, the fighting from Caen to the mouth of the Vire River has also become fierce, and tank battles seem to have broken out south of Bayeux and around Caen. According to an Associated Press dispatch from London, the German 21st Tank Division has now been dispatched to the Caen area, and the German 12th Tank Division has also been dispatched to the Bayeux area. Near Tilly-sur-Seulles, southeast of Bayeux, the Allied forces have made contact with powerful German forces, causing the area around Bayeux to fall into chaos. The German fortresses remaining between the Allied bridgeheads continue to resist. It is reported that the Allied warships also fear injuring their own troops and have not been able to bombard them.

### Invading European Troops Establish Frontline Headquarters in France

Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to reports from London, Montgomery has established a frontline headquarters at the bridgehead, and the headquarters of the US Ninth Air Force has also been moved to France.

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) - The German military authorities announced that the anti-Axis forces in northern France have received reinforcements in the past 24 hours and are currently expanding the bridgehead.

British and American Union Not Emphasized by Germany

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) - Huitong News Agency reports: The British bridgehead between the mouths of the Ona and Vire rivers has been connected to the American bridgehead in the southeastern part of the Cotentin Peninsula. British troops have crossed the Vire Canal and made contact with American troops in Carentan and Sainte-Mère-Église. However, German authorities do not consider this union to be of any significant importance. The British troops in the Bayeux area and the American troops between Carentan and Montebourg have not been able to expand their bridgeheads in order to simultaneously launch strong offensives. Meanwhile, with the help of tanks, American troops are attempting to expand their bridgehead northward towards Cherbourg. At one point, they have reached the highway between Montebourg and Quinéville, but the American troops launching a westward assault from Sainte-Mère-Église have also been repelled.

Defense Forces' Strength Proven Formidable

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) - A German military reporter reports: Since the anti-Axis forces landed, the fighting has only occurred in a coastal area of several hundred square kilometers for over a hundred hours. Moreover, this area has definitely not completely fallen into enemy hands. There are still several locations that serve as German bases and fortresses, where resistance is ongoing. In the area between the mouths of the Ona and Vire rivers, the depth of the anti-Axis bridgehead has increased by an average of ten kilometers in the past twelve hours. Furthermore, enemy troops crossed the Vire River, attempting to expand their bridgehead southwestward in order to establish contact with troops north of Carentan. In the past few hours, Eisenhower, suffering heavy losses on the left flank of the anti-Axis forces, has shifted his attention to the right flank. It is expected that the enemy will launch a new offensive to seize the Cotentin Peninsula. So far, looking at the overall situation in northern France, the following points are noteworthy: The strength of the German forces has proven to be ____. The German reserve forces have driven the enemy into ____ areas in several locations, while reserve forces in other locations are still awaiting orders. The strong enemy forces between the mouth of the Ona River and Dives have been defeated ____, and the strength of British and Canadian forces east of the Dives River to Le Havre has weakened, and they are currently trapped in a ____ state. Since the start of the operation, the enemy forces in Normandy have, in addition to several thousand captured, also lost 1,200 transport vehicles and 200 tanks, with the number of deaths exceeding the number of prisoners by several times.

German Military Strategy Lures Enemy Deep

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) - The German authorities announced at noon on the 10th: The anti-Axis forces' landing operation in Europe will likely enter the second stage in the next few hours or days. The current operation is its initial phase. The anti-Axis forces have occupied a very wide and extensive coastline, and they have deployed new elite troops in these areas. However, judging from the current situation, the enemy forces are using all their strength just to maintain their acquired positions. In the next few days, the second stage of land battles will unfold. This landing operation will determine the outcome of the war. The German High Command advocates not preventing the anti-Axis forces from landing, luring the enemy in, and then completely annihilating them. The future goal of the anti-Axis landing is to cross the Vire River and advance northwest to establish contact with the anti-Axis forces near Sainte-Mère-Église and Carentan. Although the enemy has a wide landing area, it lacks major harbors. When the anti-Axis forces are about to establish contact, in order to occupy Cherbourg as a base of operations, they are attempting to cut off the Cotentin Peninsula. The German army has dispatched a large force in advance to counterattack. As far as the German army is concerned, the current battle is still in its initial stage. The German army is currently only participating in the bridgehead battle with the initial strategic reserve forces. Enemy ships are very active at sea from the Strait of Dover to Biscay. It is expected that this may be a feint operation for a new landing operation. In short, the German army has not yet begun the formal offensive that Eisenhower hoped for.

One Landing Ship Sunk

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) - German naval fast attack craft are now launching night attacks on anti-Axis landing fleets and convoys, disrupting the enemy's landing operations. According to the German military authorities, from the evening of the 9th to the morning of the 10th, German fast attack craft broke into the central waters of the Seine Bay from the north, launching torpedoes and hitting an enemy ship of 5,000 tons, which immediately exploded and sank. Two other ships of 2,000 tons were also sunk by torpedoes. The sunk 5,000-ton ship was formerly a ferry in the English Channel and was converted into a small landing craft carrier before this landing operation. However, the number of small boats it carried is not yet detailed. Judging by its size, it could carry at least 20 landing craft (each carrying 96 people).

### French Labor Minister Encourages Nationals

Paris, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) - French Labor Minister, Mr. D, delivered a speech in Paris on the 10th, earnestly hoping that the French people would rise up together when the anti-Axis forces landed in northern France. His main point was that the battle currently unfolding in Normandy represents a great struggle between the world of totalitarianism and the world of social justice. I believe that the German army will be victorious in this battle, and at the same time, I have the same conviction about the revival of France. In fact, the time to decide the fate of France has now arrived, and the French people must abandon their bystander mentality and actively contribute to this unprecedented great struggle.

Attempted Assassination of Italian Crown Prince Fails

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency telegram) - Huitong News Agency reports from Rome: An assassination attempt on Italian Crown Prince Umberto failed. The assailant fired several shots and immediately fled.

### Rice Shops Will Implement Free Trading of Rice; Actively Working to Handle Affairs

Regarding the issue of stabilizing the city's food supply, the authorities are adopting effective measures in all aspects to encourage purchasing merchants, rice shops, and farmers to transport rice to Shanghai as much as possible, and to severely punish illegal merchants for hoarding and speculation, and to crack down on extortion along the way. Since the municipal government announced on June 2 that before the "Measures for the Management of Rice Grain Entry into This City" is promulgated, purchasing merchants and nearby farmers who transport rice grain to Shanghai will be exempt from obtaining passports and certificates, and will be free to enter various entry points in the city, and the quantity will not be restricted. After the announcement, the amount of rice transported to Shanghai in recent days has not been small, and it is entirely used for civilian food. All rice shops in the city have also made considerable preparations. In addition to the rice shops in Nanshi, Zhabei, and West districts that are already trading freely, over a hundred rice shops engaged in rationed rice in the First District sent representatives to visit the First District Public Office authorities yesterday to explain the situation and request instructions. It is reported that the industry has obtained the permission of the authorities, and before the promulgation of the "Measures for the Management of Rice Grain Entry," they are allowed to participate in free trading, and will report the daily trading of rice to the competent authorities for reference. The rice shops in the district are actively engaged in purchasing and importing goods, busy with preparations, and will be able to meet the market soon.

Household Flour Rations Will Be Increased

Recently, the source of rice in the city has been insufficient, and prices have risen sharply. The municipal government authorities are paying close attention and are actively working to remedy the situation to help the people of Jiangsu overcome their difficulties. The Grain Bureau of Zhabei and the Economic Department of the First District have been in contact with the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee and other relevant parties for several days to prepare to increase the household flour rations by one time compared to the previous example, so that the city's food supply can be slightly conserved. The total monthly ration of household flour in the city has been about 220,000 bags. It is now planned to increase it to 440,000 bags per month. The collection of raw materials and the manufacture of flour are being actively planned. However, due to procedural matters, the household flour distributed in early June will still be allocated according to the original allocation of one jin of first-class flour per person. However, it is planned to increase the allocation of corn flour by half a jin, requiring an additional 40,000 bags. It will be generally sold from the 13th of this month with Comprehensive Ration Certificate No. 3. It is hoped that the doubled allocation of household flour can be realized from mid- or late-June. It is also reported that the authorities are determined to find ways to fully allocate the three installments of household flour this month.

### Oriental Culture Translation Institute Held Establishment Meeting Yesterday; Translation Work Begins Immediately

The Shanghai Branch of the China-Japan Cultural Association, in order to study new developments in Oriental culture and promote communication between Chinese and Japanese cultures, has recently hired well-known figures from the Chinese and Japanese cultural circles in Shanghai to organize the Oriental Culture Translation Institute to engage in publishing. The institute held its first board meeting yesterday (the 11th) afternoon. Those present included Secretary Nakata, Fumio Ozake, Hirokichi Hayashi, Toyusuke Yoshida, Zhengping Zhao, Quanshi Li, Hufan Wu, and Binhe Chen, totaling more than ten people. The meeting was first addressed by the chairman, Mr. Binhe Chen, who gave an opening speech and explained the significance of the establishment. The selection of the board members and the work plan were then approved, and the meeting adjourned in the evening. It is reported that the institute is located in the China-Japan Cultural Association on Xianyang Road, and the translation work will begin immediately.

### Recent Rice and Grain Exports from Songjiang County

After finishing his investigation of rice and grain conditions in the Kunshan area, the Continental News reporter, Mr. Takemoto, went to Songjiang, the distribution center for "Songjiang rice." He visited the rice control committee office, the rice industry trade association, Japanese trading companies, the preparatory committee of the Chinese purchasing trade association, the county government, the county cooperative, and other related agencies to investigate the rice and grain problem in Songjiang and the problem of shipping rice to Shanghai. The rice and grain issue is also the most important issue in the area, and the relevant authorities find it quite difficult to handle and deeply feel the need to quickly establish a unified central and local policy. Songjiang has long been the most prosperous area for transportation by rail, road, and waterway, and it is also the area most deeply affected by the new rice and grain measures. Future rice and grain countermeasures should not only start from Shanghai's perspective, but must be based on Songjiang, Kunshan, and other rice-producing areas surrounding Shanghai and promote a comprehensive and planned approach. Sacrificing Songjiang's livelihood for Shanghai's people's livelihood, or sacrificing Shanghai's people's livelihood for Songjiang's people's livelihood, is not desirable. It is hoped that a new policy for rice and grain purchase and allocation that includes all producing areas and all consuming areas will be implemented. The above requirements are by no means abstract, but arise from the concrete realities encountered by the Songjiang County government. Therefore, how the National Government and the Rice Control Committee handle this request is noteworthy. The rice and grain problems encountered by the Songjiang County government are roughly as follows:

County Government's Countermeasures

Songjiang rice and grain market prices began to rise sharply on April 29. By the first ten days of May, they had risen by 90%. After that, the rising trend slowed down slightly. Since June 3, they have gradually declined. This is less due to the impact of the decline in Shanghai's rice and grain market prices than to the result of the Songjiang County government's emergency measures to suppress rice prices on June 3. From April 29 to June 2, the amount of rice and grain shipped from Songjiang or through Songjiang rice merchants to Shanghai is estimated to be about 100,000 shi. Because thousands of shi of rice and grain are being transported by rail, road, and waterway, the trend of transporting Songjiang rice and grain to Shanghai continues. If this continues, it may cause a major obstacle to ensuring the food supply for the people of Songjiang. The county government, together with various relevant agencies, researched preventive measures. The content of the countermeasures is:

1. Suppress Songjiang rice and grain to a maximum of 4,000 yuan.

2. Prohibit the removal of more than 〇 kilograms of rice and grain.

After the announcement was issued on June 3, the rice shops were forced to close down for several days. Later, after the rice industry trade association stated various reasons, especially the highest market price of 4,000 yuan, which was too low compared to Shanghai's market price, it appealed to the standing committee. As a result, it was decided that 5,500 yuan would be the county government's recognized highest market price, and the rice shops would be responsible for selling five catties of rice to residents of Songjiang city area with citizen's certificates each time. Of course, after the announcement, a considerable amount continued to be transported out. Although this is not the same as Shanghai's rationing system, it can at least be regarded as a temporary bud of a rationing system during the lean season, which is worthy of attention. The above facts illustrate that the problem of transportation to Shanghai should be based on a comprehensive plan that takes into account the reasonable relationship with the problem of transportation from various regions. It is hoped that the food policy for each major consumer area will be implemented with unified guidance. (翔: Translated from the Continental News of June 11)

### Municipal Government to Ban Shipping Business Offices Today

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Huazhong Transportation Industry Shipping Business Office has privately collected fees, affecting the unified shipping industry. At a time when materials are urgently needed to be cleared, this is hindering transportation. After reporting to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, it was considered that the business office had not been approved in advance according to the law and had set up a fee-collecting office without authorization, which was inappropriate. Therefore, it ordered the subordinate first and second battalion general bureaus to ban it in order to maintain shipping and ____ merchants ____.

### Second Police Bureau Strengthens Special High Work

In order to strengthen special high work, the Shanghai Second Police Bureau has adjusted the lineup of the special high section and appointed Chen Liang as the section chief.

### Electricity Saving Campaign Encourages Residents to Promote; Electricity Bills Have Increased This Month

In order to make up for losses, the Shanghai Power Company has slightly increased the electricity bills for users from this month. The previous price of 2.81 yuan per kilowatt-hour has now increased to 4.31 yuan per kilowatt-hour, an increase of about 50 percent. At the same time, according to reporters' inquiries with the company, the electricity saving campaign encourages residents to save another 20 percent of electricity. Although it is not mandatory, it is hoped that citizens will understand the difficult times and strive to achieve this goal. As for those who exceed the initially set limit for more than two times, the company will now cut off their electricity. The decision on how long the electricity will be cut off will be based on how much the user exceeds the electricity limit.

### Health Exhibition Open All Day Today

The Shanghai Summer Health Movement Conference officially opened on the first of the month, and a health exhibition was held at the racecourse. The exhibition was carefully planned and arranged by the Municipal Health Bureau, and major pharmaceutical factories and health food companies participated in the display.

It is reported that the exhibition will be extended to ensure that the general public can visit and gain health knowledge. It will be open all day from today (the 12th) for people to browse. It will end in mid-month.

### First Police Bureau to Issue Transportation Passports

The relevant information has been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that the bureau has completed all the preparatory procedures, and it is specifically stipulated that the issuance of this passport will begin on the 15th of this month (June).

Tickets are sold for 100 yuan, 200 yuan, and 500 yuan. Since the beginning of this season, Donghua's strong style has been unparalleled. Qiaolian is known for its fierceness, and has the help of four knights from Tianjin, Bonini, Tai Erzika, Jiang Xuedou, and Yayi Tuomali, which has greatly increased its strength. At the time, there will be a fierce battle. Football auctions will be purchased in the name of the seventy-two disciples of Confucius, which can be described as unique. The lineup is recorded below:

The city's price trends are still quite stable under the strict supervision of the competent authorities. However, due to the frequent rise in black market rice prices, some of the important foods used to fill the stomach, such as noodles, cooked foods, miscellaneous grains, and cooking oil, have been slightly affected, resulting in inconsistent selling prices. In addition, in the past half month, agricultural products from various places have been transported to Shanghai quite frequently along the way. However, they are all generally carried on the shoulders of scattered small vendors. Although the number of each shipment is not as large as ideal, the number of vendors is numerous, and it is estimated that the agricultural products transported to Shanghai in half a month are quite considerable, so it is very helpful to the supply of spot goods in the city.
