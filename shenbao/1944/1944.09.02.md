### My View of the Chongqing Regime (Part Two)

— Tosuke Yoshida

Question: What is Chiang Kai-shek's own opinion regarding a comprehensive peace? Based on the ideas he expressed in "China's Destiny," he seems to be a proponent of resisting Japan to the very end. It is said that he is very stubborn and has a personality of unwavering determination once he has made a decision.

Answer: Your opinion of Chiang Kai-shek is in danger of being superficial. Over the past seven or eight years, countless biographical accounts of Chiang Kai-shek have emerged, because anyone and everyone has picked up a pen to say a few words about Chiang Kai-shek. Most of them are filled with nauseating words of praise and flattery. If not of this type, they are attacks aimed at catering to Japanese intentions, showering him with venomous abuse. In short, both types of reviews are difficult to agree with. (For example, Sven Hedin's "Chiang Kai-shek" only expresses the fact that a great explorer of Central Asia is not necessarily a great explorer in anthropology). But the "character assessment" of Chiang Kai-shek that I admire the most is only one: that is, when Chiang Kai-shek first began slaughtering communists in Guangdong on March 20, 1926, the next month, the Guangdong Communist Party leader Stepanov submitted the following report to the Russian Communist Party. This report concerns Chiang Kai-shek's attitude towards Russia and the sudden and alarming suppression of the Communist Party... The purpose of this report is to explain several reasons for the incident. Although there are many reasons for the incident, the individual characters of the instigator, Chiang Kai-shek, and our comrades played a significant role. Therefore, a slightly more detailed description of Chiang Kai-shek is necessary. The character I am pointing out here is also jointly recognized by representatives of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. In my and the Chinese Communist Party's view, Chiang Kai-shek is a special person with obvious characteristics. His most prominent nature is his ambition and desire for power. He wants to present himself as a hero to all the Chinese people. He calls himself a revolutionary, but the revolutionary he speaks of does not simply refer to a national revolutionary, but also has the meaning of a global revolutionary. However, the question is how the revolutionary term he speaks of is understood. He likes power and money. What I should point out here is that, as far as I know, the reason why he likes money is definitely not because he wants to become rich himself, but only to put on a beautiful liberal posture. He spares no expense on gifts and bribes, spending huge sums of money to seek the support of newspapers and to sing his praises. In fact, Chiang Kai-shek is very clever (Rather clever). He not only understands Chinese political problems very well, but also understands world political problems. He does not trust the masses, but is willing to accept the support of the masses. And in order to achieve his political goals, he also knows a little about how to use the masses. For the same purpose, he certainly uses us and the Chinese Communist Party, but only for the period that he needs us. Similarly, the reason why he uses the national revolutionary movement is because he wants to be a national hero. Therefore, he does not associate with people who are criticized by Chinese public opinion. This is precisely the reason why he often hesitates between the "right wing" and the Communist Party. At the same time, I believe that this is the reason why he loudly shouts that all of China is constantly disturbed by the "red peril"... (World wide Soviet Plots By N. Mitarevsty pp. 22-23)."

Naturally, this report was written by his political enemy, but there are not many articles that portray his characteristics so simply, clearly, profoundly, and pertinently.

In order to achieve his goals, he uses everything he can use. He uses England, the United States, the Soviet Union, and even Japan. He is happy to use whoever he can use. From this point of view, he is indeed firm in his will, but this cannot be called "stubbornness," because "stubbornness" means "ignorant and obtuse." On the contrary, even Chiang's enemies say that he is "very clever, he not only understands Chinese political problems very well, but also understands world political problems." In this case, he is definitely not an "ignorant and obtuse" person. He is a "person who understands at once." (When Prime Minister Inukai was attacked by thugs in the February 26th Incident, he said "I understand at once", but the thugs did not want to listen to Inukai's words, but said "No need to talk nonsense," and then shot him dead. Such people are "people who do not understand even if you talk to them").

He does not want to listen to Japan's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere theory, and even if he is lured with the moving words of "the world's four great powers," he will not fall into the trap. At the same time, I believe that he also knows very clearly that it is definitely not Chongqing that will benefit from resisting Japan to the end. Therefore, this is the reason why I firmly believe that a comprehensive peace is hopeful.

Question: If Chiang Kai-shek and the National Essence faction, as you said, have the intention to negotiate peace with Japan, then hasn't the Chinese Communist Party seen through this long ago?

Answer: That's right. The difficulty of the KMT-CPC negotiations lies here. The ultimate goal of the Chinese Communist Party is naturally to build a socialist China. As long as the Chongqing regime can be used in this direction, the Chinese Communist Party values this utility and never wants to abandon it. However, the Chongqing regime will soon become completely dominated by the pro-British and American faction, or will become an economic vassal state of the United States, or will compromise with Japan - this decisive moment is gradually approaching - if so, the Chinese Communist Party is always prepared to enter a state of complete armed confrontation with Chongqing. The Chinese Communist Party's conjecture about the Chongqing regime is simply this. The situation is becoming increasingly urgent. In the near future, the Chongqing regime will have to make a final decision, either throwing itself into the arms of Japan, or joining hands with the United States, one of the two. When deciding which of the two to choose, Chiang Kai-shek, who represents national capital more than comprador capital, will definitely choose to compromise with Japan, which has a higher possibility of allowing the independent development of national capital. Because what Chiang Kai-shek fears most now is that China will become a second Mexico when the United States wins. The national capital of Mexico is completely subordinate to American financial capital. Similarly, after the war, American financial capital - just imagine its enormous power and desire to pursue profits! - will monopolize all Chinese enterprises and completely dominate China's national capital. Chiang Kai-shek is no longer afraid of Japanese financial capital monopolizing Chinese enterprises. He believes that Japan cannot conquer all of China. What he fears at this time is the post-war United States and the post-war Soviet Union. The Chinese Communist Party knows very well that Chinese national capital is afraid of the United States and the Soviet Union, and is urging Chiang Kai-shek to choose the path of compromise with Japan.

Question: Does the Chinese Communist Party have any drafts to deal with this point?

Answer: It is difficult to say what kind of drafts the Chinese Communist Party has, perhaps there is no unified plan yet. However, according to the pro-Soviet faction in Chongqing, the Chinese Communist Party seems to be building a new socialist China centered on the current Yan'an regime. After the European problem is completely resolved, the Soviet Union will have plenty of spare capacity. Therefore, the Soviet Union will not permanently maintain the current state of complete lack of voice on the Sino-Japanese issue. The pro-Soviet faction within Chongqing speculates that the Soviet Union has such intentions, and wants to ask the Soviet Union to participate when the Greater East Asia War reaches a decisive stage. At the same time, they want to use the power of the Soviet Union to establish a socialist China in northern China to confront the Chongqing regime. Does the Soviet Union agree with this idea of the pro-Soviet faction? This depends on the Soviet Union's world policy at that time. Stalin has always been a "ripe persimmon eater," so Stalin will not participate in the Greater East Asia War if the objective conditions at that time are not ripe, because he will never eat unripe persimmons no matter what. However, do not ignore that this idea has considerable influence among young members of the Chinese Communist Party and the pro-Soviet faction in Chongqing. Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai are older, so they are trying their best to suppress this idea. Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai are unwilling to stimulate Chiang Kai-shek until the last resort. Although the middle and lower-level cadres of the Chinese Communist Party have not forgotten Chiang Kai-shek's hatred for slaughtering their comrades in Jiangxi and Shanghai, Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai have transcended personal feelings and believe that as long as such a person as Chiang Kai-shek is beneficial to the national revolution, they want to use him until he can no longer be used. Regarding this point, the last sentence of the Stepanov report mentioned earlier has the following meaningful sentence:

"Another element is the personality of Chiang Kai-shek. As long as such an extraordinary person exists, we must naturally use all means to use him to achieve the goal of national revolution. We will not temporarily talk about how many revolutionary components Chiang Kai-shek has, or how many counter-revolutionary components he has, but we should pay attention to not throwing him out of our common cause. Because his character (if our estimate is correct) is a character that can be used in the process of national revolutionary struggle. This is not only our opinion, but also the opinion of the Shanghai Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Guangdong Committee."

Seventeen years ago, they highly valued Chiang Kai-shek's utility value. Today, Chiang Kai-shek is the "national hero" of the anti-Japanese war in China, of course, his utility value has reached its peak. Therefore, Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai are not willing to easily dismiss him. (The following turns to page four)

### Cutting off Supplies to the Indian Ocean Japanese Submarines Active, Sinking Several Enemy Tankers and Cargo Ships

A certain base in the Indian Ocean, Central News Agency dispatch. The Indian Ocean Fleet under the command of Mountbatten is currently actively engaged in increasing its forces and receiving supplies. In order to cut off its supply lines, Japanese submarines are currently actively operating. A large Japanese submarine that returned to base on a certain day destroyed several enemy tankers and several cargo ships, totaling several tens of thousands of tons, in just a few days during its sortie.

### A Tanker Blown into Two Pieces

On a certain day of a certain month, the submarine newly deployed to the western waters of the XXXXX archipelago to search for enemy transport ships. At 3:00 PM, it suddenly discovered enemy ship tracks. At that time, an enemy patrol boat appeared. So, it temporarily implemented submerged navigation and hid for a long time. The captain gave the order, "Enemy ships are found, track them immediately." Then, the submarine adopted an attack tactic. At that time, the captain said that the enemy ship was a 7,000-ton tanker. Soon, the distance between the two sides gradually approached. The sound room immediately ordered the launch of torpedoes. After a while, a huge sound of torpedo bombardment was heard from the other side, indicating a hit. Their screams of fear and disturbances were also heard one after another. At the same time, flames emerged from the middle of the enemy ship's stern. The Japanese submarine quickly surfaced and approached the enemy ship to continue firing at it. However, the tanker, with its strong buoyancy, did not sink immediately. They also fired back and barely fought back. The torpedoes launched by the Japanese submarine cut through the waves and made a final strike against the enemy ship. At that time, water columns surged, soaring dozens of feet high. Then, the huge warship was blown into two pieces. The stern sank into the water, and the bow created splashes in the air before gradually sinking.

### Aircraft Materials, Wooden Boat Sunk

At about 10:00 PM on a certain day of a certain month, a giant ship in the central part of the enemy formation also fell into the Japanese encirclement. Later, in the pitch-black sea, when it was illuminated with a periscope, it was learned that the enemy ship was a 5,000-ton class cargo ship. Then, an attack was launched, firing torpedoes at the enemy ship. At that time, it was 11:30 PM. The cargo ship was hit and suffered a fire crisis. Soon after, it sent out a distress signal and soon fled quietly from the sea at the highest speed. On a certain day of a certain month, the Japanese submarine sank an enemy wooden boat of about 100 tons fully loaded with aircraft materials with three shells. Less than thirty hours later, the track of an enemy ship was found on the horizon. The speed was increased to pursue it, and its entity was inspected with a delicate large telescope. It was learned that the warship was a new 7,000-ton class oil tanker built by the British with all their scientific essence, and was slowly heading towards Ceylon Island, unaware of the Japanese military's surprise attack. At this time, the Japanese submarine quickly submerged and pursued it, and successively and fiercely launched torpedoes that were sure to hit the enemy ship. After ten seconds, twenty seconds, and thirty seconds, a huge explosion sound rang on the side of the enemy warship, indicating a hit.

### General Okabe Appointed as Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in North China, General Okamura Transferred to an Important Position

Tokyo, Central News Agency dispatch. The Ministry of the Army announced on the 1st: Appointed General Okabe Naozaburo as the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in North China. General Okamura, the current Supreme Commander of North China, was transferred to an important position.

Tokyo, Central News Agency dispatch. General Okamura Yasuji has served as the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in North China since July of the 30th year of the Republic of China, succeeding General Tada Shun, and has now been in office for three years. During this period, the general made many contributions to the Greater East Asia War and the war against Chongqing, and has previously been transferred to an important position. At a time when the Japanese army is launching a new operation on the mainland and the Chinese war situation is entering a landmark stage, it is even more promising that General Okabe Naozaburo will succeed General Okamura as the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in North China and assume the important task of North China.

### Controlling the Raging Waves of the Arabian Sea

In order to carry out a bombardment battle, the Japanese submarine quickly surfaced. The artillerymen inside the submarine immediately fired accurately at the enemy ship. The enemy ship was immediately damaged and caught fire, but because it was a newly built ship, it was difficult to sink even if it was seriously injured. After five to ten minutes, the fire became more and more intense, soaring into the air, completely reflecting the heroic posture of the Japanese submarine on the pitch-black sea. After a while, the Japanese submarine switched to submerged retreat, because submarines are easily targeted by enemy warships in enemy formations, which is very dangerous. Therefore, after the torpedoes exploded, it was confirmed that the enemy warship had sunk after the explosion sound. The enemy sank about two hours after the Japanese submarine attacked. The purpose of the Japanese submarine's crossing of the Indian Ocean and continuous hard fighting is to control the raging waves of the Arabian Sea and cut off the lifeline of British and American maritime transportation.

### Taiwan Raided Yesterday, Four American Planes Shot Down

Tokyo, Central News Agency dispatch. At about 10:00 PM on August 31st, more than ten American Air Force B24 and B25 aircraft stationed in Chongqing raided Taiwan. After being intercepted by Japanese aircraft, four of them were shot down (two of which were not confirmed). The Japanese side suffered very little damage on land.

### Rural Construction Committee to be Established Within Days Zou Jingfang Discusses the Tasks of the Rural Construction Committee

Nanjing, Central News Agency dispatch. The Rural Construction Implementation Committee is being organized and will be established in the next two or three days. The first phase of work in each experimental county will be promoted on schedule from September to December.

Nanjing, Central News Agency dispatch. The Executive Yuan's Rural Construction Implementation Committee is about to be established. Chairman Zou specially issued a statement as follows: The Chinese people have long yearned for peace and stability. The government, mindful of the difficulties of the times, announced at the beginning of this year that correcting thinking, ensuring security, and increasing production would be the policy direction for this year, in order to comfort the people's hopes. We aim to strengthen our forces and consolidate our foundations on the national policy of revitalizing China, preserving Asia, and coexisting and co-prospering. All those who care about national affairs and love peace are looking forward to it and are working hard to improve it. Therefore, there is a plan to implement rural construction and select experimental counties as a plan to

correct the root and clear the source. It was approved by the Supreme National Defense Conference to set up a committee to preside over the matter. It has now been established on schedule and started work. This is indeed a new institution that keenly addresses the needs of the time after the return to the capital, and it is also a major turning point in the renewal of local administration. There is no better way to remedy shortcomings and save us from abuses, and it is indeed a matter of urgency. From now on, all work in the selected experimental counties, such as implementing the established national policy, organizing farmland irrigation, revitalizing education, improving group police, maintaining transportation, utilizing welfare, clearing taxes, and advocating industry, must be promoted in order, without neglecting one and losing the other, leading to partial weakness. All

bribery, supply, sending off and welcoming, solicitation of bribes, and the evil habits of taking advantage of opportunities to exploit, must be strictly investigated, and counties must prohibit it, and must make sure that abuses are eliminated and the atmosphere is clean, and that corruption disappears. Anyone who tries the law with his own body will be punished according to the law without any leniency. This is the initial and essential point of the work, which cannot be tolerated or ignored. The promotion and demotion of staff members shall be based on the criteria of matching their talents to their positions and assigning them to suitable positions, based solely on tests and assessments, and not subject to favoritism. On the one hand, cultivate talents and prepare them as cadres, and on the other hand, recruit celebrities to fill the role of teachers. All measures must follow the rules, so that official positions

will not be in danger of falling. Once the experiment in one county is reduced, it can be extended to other counties. Things will be easier and more familiar, and the results will be twice as good with half the effort. Then, time will not be wasted. Knowing the basis of this to deal with affairs, then in the future, establishing a foundation of popular cooperation, cultivating national livelihoods, increasing agricultural production, and accomplishing the goals of the holy war will all be based on this, is it not unrestrained? But the matter belongs to the beginning of the game, as if facing the depths, the responsibility is heavy and the task is difficult, and vigilance is increased. I only hope that all our internal and external workers will sharpen their sincerity, work together in harmony, be pragmatic and seek truth, and strive to make progress. With the labor of collective wisdom, we will save the decline of the countryside. When the cause of rural construction is completed, the peace of the territory can be seen,

The fate of the nation and the reproduction of the nation, success or failure, all depend on this, it is not only the focus of this year's administration to implement it. Now, at the beginning of the establishment of this committee, I dare to use a word to respectfully encourage the people of the country to help each other. I also hope that the wise men at home and abroad, the elders of the rural areas, and the scholars who study rural construction will not hesitate to teach and dare to correct us, so as not to live up to the earnest expectations of the government and the public. The future of this committee is almost certain.

### Japanese Ogata President's Speech

Tokyo, Central News Agency dispatch. Japanese Information Bureau President Ogata made a statement today regarding the appointment of parliamentary officials this time, saying: The government's reform of the past provincial committee system and the establishment of parliamentary vice ministers and participating officials have been published today. The first key to gathering the total strength of the people is to actively convey public opinion, and only by raising public opinion can a complete and unyielding decisive battle system be created, so that it can cooperate with the entire nation to advance towards the goal of completing the war.

### Breaking Through Solid Positions, Japanese Troops Occupy Lishui, Defeating Chongqing Troops in Heavy Rain on Both Flanks

Zhejiang Southern Front, Central News Agency dispatch. On August 21st, elite Japanese troops began operations from a certain base on the Zhejiang Eastern Front, breaking through the mountainous area south of Jinhua on the left and right flanks, defeating the Chongqing troops in torrential rain and advancing bravely. At 0:30 AM on the 27th, the left flank detachment broke through the solid defensive position of the 32nd Group Army and the newly编21st师 (师长罗君雕) under the 86th Army of the Chongqing troops defending Lishui County, rushed into Lishui County and completely occupied it.

Zhejiang Southern Front, Central News Agency dispatch. Lishui, an advanced base of the U.S. Air Force, fell into the hands of the Japanese army on August 27th. Lishui County is located at the confluence of the Hao Xi and Da Xi rivers that flow into Wenzhou Bay, and is a strategic point for transportation between Zhejiang and Fujian in the upstream area of the Lishui River. In the spring of the 31st year of the Republic of China, when the Japanese army launched the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign, it once occupied the area. Afterwards, the Chongqing and U.S. Air Forces used this as a frontline base for air raids on Japan and for destroying southern transportation routes, and expanded the airfield five miles north of the county town to prepare for the landing of medium-sized aircraft. Despite repeated bombing by the Japanese Army Air Force, they still did not give up their attempt to use it. In addition, the headquarters of the 88th Army of the 32nd Group Army of the Chongqing troops was also located in Lishui County, with the newly编21st Division assigned the responsibility of defending it. Lishui County, due to its military and economic importance, is flourishing, with a population of more than 30,000. As for its defensive facilities, there is a city wall five meters high with thousands of guns, and the intersections of the roads inside the city are also made of cement.

Guangzhou, Central News Agency dispatch. Chongqing telegram. The Chongqing Military Commission announced on the 30th that the war sank the second time: The Japanese troops near Hengyang launched a fierce attack on the area east of Zhumuchong in the southwest of Hengyang on the night of the 28th, and fierce fighting continued until the 29th. Fierce fighting is also taking place in the area west of Yongfeng, and there is no change in the war near Laiyang. There is also war in the south and west of Anren. The Japanese troops in the east of Zhejiang suddenly entered Lishui at dawn on the 27th from Wuyi.

### U.S. Aircraft Attack Wuhan, Repelled

A certain Japanese army front line base, Central News Agency dispatch. On the afternoon of the 29th, at 0:50, more than 40 U.S. Air Force fighter-bombers in a large formation raided the Wuhan area. Japanese fighter planes immediately took off to intercept them. As a result, three P40 fighters and one P51 fighter were shot down. Four P40 fighters, one P51 fighter, and four B24 bombers were destroyed. The Chongqing-U.S. aircraft randomly dropped bombs into Dongting Lake and flew away. The Japanese side also lost two aircraft.

A certain Japanese army front line base, Central News Agency dispatch. The Japanese army's new elite fighter squadron discovered six Chongqing-U.S. fighter aircraft in the airspace 30 kilometers north of Changsha at 2:13 PM on the 30th and immediately intercepted them, shooting down three of them.

### Enshi and Suichuan Airfields Bombed

A certain Japanese army front line base, Central News Agency dispatch. On the night of the 30th, the Japanese army air squadron attacked the Chongqing army's Enshi and Suichuan airfields again with a bomber formation. One team of Japanese aircraft that raided Enshi braved the adverse weather and carried out a fierce bombing. Five small aircraft were hit and caught fire, and two small aircraft were destroyed. A total of two trucks were destroyed and six facilities were hit and caught fire. The Japanese aircraft bomber squadron that attacked Suichuan by surprise destroyed two ground facilities. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.

### Japanese Ambassador to Thai New Cabinet Members

Ambassador Ishii delivered a speech at the banquet, followed by a reply from Prime Minister Abhaiwongse, expressing his gratitude to Japan for its cooperation with the new cabinet and clarifying his determination to cooperate with Japan and implement the Greater East Asia War. The atmosphere during the banquet was very pleasant.

### Philippine Agricultural Delegation to Visit Taiwan for Inspection

Manila, Central News Agency dispatch.

### Memorial Ceremony for Martyr Heyun's National Sacrifice Held Solemnly by the Central Government

Nanjing, Central News Agency dispatch. The 1st was the Memorial Day for the National Sacrifice of Peaceful Anti-Communist National Construction Martyrs. The central government solemnly held a memorial ceremony. More than 300 directors of ministries and departments, high-ranking officials of various agencies, led by Chu Minyi, paid the highest respect to the spirit tablet of Martyr Heyun. They observed a moment of silence to express their condolences. The chairman presented a wreath, and the Memorial Song of Martyr Heyun was played. The ceremony was completed in solemn military music.

### Japanese Forces Strongly Attacking Longling and Tengyue Areas

Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – According to a Chongqing Associated Press dispatch, the battle situation on the Nujiang front is as follows: After reinforcements arrived, Japanese troops launched an attack on the Chongqing army in the Longling and Tengyue areas, pursuing them near the northwest gate of Tengyue. Frontline sources indicate that a large contingent of Japanese reinforcements appears to be moving southeast from the vicinity of Mangshi. Chongqing military authorities issued a communiqué on the night of the 30th, stating that while the Japanese army is under siege by the Chongqing forces, it is simultaneously securing Longling. The reinforcing Japanese troops, launching a vigorous offensive, have opened the road through the city and occupied high ground southeast of the main Chongqing positions. According to a United Press dispatch, Japanese troops fiercely attacked Chongqing army positions eight and a half kilometers south of Longling on the 29th. The Chongqing army attempted to block the old Burma Road between Mangshi and Longling. After receiving reinforcements, the Japanese occupied high ground southeast of the main Chongqing positions, and fighting continued until midnight. Because the Chongqing forces are tenaciously defending the area, the Japanese have detoured around their positions and attacked positions south of Longling. The Chongqing army's offensive in the Tengyue area has been unsuccessful.

Dian-Burma Front, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – Japanese troops in northern Burma and the Nujiang area are employing a war of attrition, inflicting heavy losses on the Chongqing army. In approximately half a month since August 1st, the Chongqing army has abandoned 4,196 bodies in the Nujiang area alone. To investigate the Chongqing side's difficult situation, the United States has dispatched War Production Board Director Nelson and Major General Hartley to Chongqing. Zheng Dongguo has also returned to Chongqing to discuss post-war strategies with the Chongqing authorities. These facts sufficiently demonstrate the blows suffered by the Chongqing army. Moreover, the conflict between the Chongqing army and the British and American armies is intensifying. The deputy commander of the newly formed First Army of the Chongqing army and the commander of the 30th Division, which invaded Myitkyina, have made significant sacrifices but were still criticized by Stilwell and were finally transferred back to the winter area on August 3rd. Chongqing officers and soldiers deeply resent the arrogance of the American army. Furthermore, on the Yunnan-Burma border, clashes recently occurred between the Chongqing army and the British army, resulting in 80 Chongqing soldiers killed and 61 wounded. Their mutual antagonism is difficult to conceal.

### Growing American Influence Penetrating Deep into Chongqing

A certain base in Northern Burma, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – In the mountainous region of northern Burma, the American-equipped Chongqing army, commanded by Hatcher, has continued its counter-offensive since engaging the Japanese army, despite suffering heavy losses and remaining unenlightened. This Chongqing army is entirely equipped by the United States and possesses modern, sophisticated weaponry. Initially, its strength was three divisions, but due to unfavorable combat and increased casualties, two divisions were drawn from the Yunnan Expeditionary Force, forming a total of five divisions, with the aim of opening the China-India Highway. The United States intends to control Chongqing militarily and economically by strengthening its anti-Japanese offensive base on the mainland. In military terms, the results of this operation have demonstrated that the Chongqing army is merely a sacrifice for the American army. American plans completely disregard the damage suffered by the Chongqing army, treating them and materiel equally. The Chongqing army's progress, from Hsinbyuan to Mawain, to Myitkyina, is slow, averaging only 600 meters per day, placing them in a disadvantageous position. Moreover, regardless of internal and external circumstances, the American army is currently engaged in Americanizing the Chongqing army, with the 15th Division of the Yunnan Expeditionary Force bearing the brunt. The commander of this army, Chen Cheng, strongly opposed this, but was soon dismissed by Chiang Kai-shek and replaced by Wei Lihuang. Consequently, the American army's work in Americanizing the command of this army has progressed further. Hatcher is now continuing to extend his influence to the Yunnan army centered in Kunming and the armies in the various war zones along the Yuehan Railway. With the American army's influence increasingly penetrating deep into Chongqing, generals centered around Chen Cheng are reportedly voicing strong opposition.

### Fighting in Northern France Closes in on the Belgian Border German Troops Withdraw from Verdun and Reims

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – A German press release, quoted by the German News Agency, states: Under heavy enemy pressure, German troops in northern France have retreated northeast to the Somme River area. The enemy has occupied Amiens (in northern France) and is advancing northeast and north. The fighting in Verdun has been particularly intense, and German troops withdrew from the area in the afternoon.

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – The Hai Tong News Agency reports: German troops withdrew from Reims (northeast of Paris) in an orderly manner. There were no anti-German demonstrations by the population. The people feared bombing by Allied artillery and aircraft and mostly took refuge in cellars at night. Large groups left the city at night, heading east and north, in good order and not in a disorganized retreat. Allied tank spearheads attempted to disrupt German movements in certain sections but were defeated by German Tiger tanks. The Allies clearly intended to cut off the retreating German forces, but failed.

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – The Hai Tong News Agency reports: After reinforcing its right flank southeast of Compiègne, the Allies continued their advance north. There is currently no tendency to move east into the Argonne Forest. British forces clearly intend to link up with the main body of the U.S. Third Army, which, after occupying Reims, has crossed the Laon. German forces are striking the enemy flanks and rear, inflicting heavy losses. German forces between the Oise River and the Channel coast are continuing to retreat north to avoid encirclement. British tank units are attacking fiercely between the Oise River. German counter-attacks north of Beauvais are attempting to contain the Allies, and that area has become the new focus of fighting.

### German Troops Moving North Along the Adriatic Coast

Berlin, 31st (Central News Agency telegram) – The German News Agency reports: On the Adriatic coast, German troops withdrew from the second line of battle on the afternoon of August 29th with minimal losses. British forces have advanced to a point 30 kilometers from the Gothic Line.

### Lieutenant Commander Shiota Refutes False Allied Reports Exaggerated Propaganda is Absurd and Nonsensical

At a joint press conference co-hosted by the Allied Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministry information authorities in Shanghai yesterday (the 1st) at 3:00 PM at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, Chinese reporters in Shanghai were met by Lieutenant Commander Shiota, representing the Navy Information Department, and Deputy Consul Fukuma, representing Director Matsudaira of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy. Lieutenant Commander Shiota sternly refuted the enemy's exaggerated and false reports of the war situation in the Pacific. Finally, he stated that the recent three surprise attacks on Shanghai by American aircraft based in Chongqing were repelled by the local Japanese army's intense anti-aircraft fire, and there was no damage.

### Enemy False Reports Not Worth Laughing At

According to yesterday's (the 1st) broadcast from San Francisco, the enemy falsely claimed that the fate of Japan could be determined based on the progress of the European war. The Japanese side dismisses this with a laugh. I can assert that the Japanese national character is such that the more difficulties encountered, the more fierce their fighting ability and national spirit become. This is a traditional spirit since the founding of Japan. Furthermore, regarding the Pacific war situation, Lieutenant Commander Forrestal Sherman, deputy chief of staff of the U.S. Navy's Nimitz Headquarters, stated on August 30th that the U.S. Navy had applied all its strength in the Pacific war. However, according to our observation, the only bases the enemy is currently using in the Pacific are Hawaii and Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands. Therefore, we must pay attention to future observations of the war situation and combat strength. Therefore, the claims from San Francisco and Wallace feel like first-rate false propaganda. Today, Japanese forces are continuing to fight fiercely on Omiya Island and in various naval battles in the Pacific. Except for a small part of Saipan and the Marshall Islands, the remaining vast islands of the South Seas are all under Japanese control. Therefore, the enemy's exaggerated propaganda, claiming that the Pacific war situation can be resolved, is a blatant lie and extremely misleading.

### Heavy Damage to American Ships

Furthermore, according to what Rear Admiral Oborin, the U.S. Navy aviation staff officer, said on the 29th of last month, the U.S. Navy has a hundred aircraft carriers. Recalling the numbers initially stated by the enemy at the start of the battle of Saipan, they were also the same. Afterwards, after the fierce fighting by the Japanese army on that island, the enemy suffered heavy losses of both formal aircraft carriers and auxiliary aircraft carriers, but up to today, the numbers are still the same as before the battle of the island. This is absurd and bizarre. Based on this situation, we can conclude that the enemy relies on the superiority of numbers and does not hesitate to exaggerate and lie. In addition, the lack of understanding of combat strength and the unreasonable recklessness are extremely nonsensical. Also, the Japanese army retreated from the Kiska base in the Aleutian Islands in the last part of July, but the enemy propaganda claimed that Kiska was bombed continuously on August 10th and that the Japanese resistance was fierce, etc. However, since the retreat took place ten days earlier, there were no Japanese troops present when they landed. Therefore, the victory claimed by the United States and Canada is extremely absurd and nonsensical.

### Air Raid on Shanghai Wasted Effort

Furthermore, the feelings of Chinese youth towards the past are completely different compared to now. The representative of the department said that in the past, some Chinese youth, based on the progress of the war situation, were optimistic about the destiny of China. However, this has completely changed. It is no longer about cooperating with Britain and the United States to save the country, but only about strengthening China's own power and laying a solid foundation. Finally, it was stated that since the 8th of last month, there have been three air raids in the city. The details of the first situation have been published in detail, and the details of the second situation in the area between Shanghai and Wusong have also been published in detail. However, two days later, the enemy Stilwell claimed to have bombed the Japanese army's material accumulation area. In fact, of the bombs dropped, one fell on an abandoned field, and one damaged a broken wall of an abandoned house, measuring two meters in depth and five meters in diameter, and were not large bombs. However, during the third air raid from the evening of the 29th to 1:30 AM the next morning, enemy aircraft attempted to drop bombs in the city, but after the local garrison fired intense artillery fire, they fled in disarray. Therefore, no bombs were dropped.

### Soviet Union Further Increases Pressure on Turkey Bulgarian Representative Arrives in Cairo to Negotiate Armistice

Stockholm, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – The German News Agency reports: According to a United Press dispatch from Moscow, the Soviet Union is absolutely determined to increase pressure on Bulgaria and Turkey, simultaneously with its offensive in Romania. These countries will be forced to participate in the work of forcing the German army to withdraw from the Balkans. Bulgaria and Turkey have received this warning. The Moscow newspaper "Pravda" wrote that the Soviet Union has told Bulgaria that its passive attitude is not satisfactory to the Soviet side.

### Göring's Nephew Killed in Air Combat

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – The German News Agency reports: Lieutenant Göring, nephew of German Marshal Göring, died for his country while fighting over Normandy. He is the fifth nephew of Marshal Göring to die in this German war.

### U.S. Production Director Travels to Chongqing via Moscow

Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – The German News Agency reports: According to news from London, U.S. War Production Board Director Nelson has arrived in Moscow and will continue to Chongqing after brief discussions.

### Soviet Forces Break into Warsaw Encounter Strong Resistance Germans Build a Defensive Line Using Natural Barriers

Stockholm, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – After breaking through the Galati Pass, Soviet forces on the Romanian front invaded the Wallachian Plain in one fell swoop, reaching Ruse and engaging in fierce fighting, putting pressure on the weakened German forces. Fierce fighting has also broken out between Soviet and German forces in the area around Constanța and to the south on the Black Sea coast. According to news from Berlin, German forces launched a major offensive northeast of Warsaw with four infantry divisions and a large number of tanks, attempting to break into the city of Warsaw. However, they were met with fierce German resistance before reaching the city streets and only occupied the train station eleven kilometers northeast of Praga.

Budapest, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – German forces have once again entered Czechoslovakia, following the pattern of their entry into Hungary on March 19th. It is speculated that the German move is intended to create a final strong defensive line using the natural barrier of the Carpathian Mountains. It is also reported that Soviet forces advancing on Krakow from the direction of Burdaimis are preparing for a large-scale operation. German forces have strengthened their defensive line to defend the main industrial area of Silesia. After entering the Czech Republic and Hungary, the German plan is to construct an iron-clad defensive line from the Czech border to the Carpathian Mountains of Transylvania to prevent Soviet forces from invading German territory.

### Goebbels Writes Article Expressing Firm Belief

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – The Hai Tong News Agency reports: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article in the "German Weekly," stating in brief: All the needs of German reserve troops are being met by the civilians, and various measures have been taken to meet future needs. Regarding weapons, the Allied countries surpass Germany in technology, and their advantage has not been quickly overcome, but it is undeniable that Germany is gradually gaining an advantage. A war situation more favorable to Germany is about to arrive. It would be foolish to think that using new weapons could immediately turn the war situation in Germany's favor. This decisive development requires a gradual revelation. We should be patient, and we should not expect Germany to rely solely on mysterious weapons to change the war situation. The German military's operational techniques will have a more gradual development, but the enemy will certainly feel burned out when dealing with Germany's war machine.

### Three Control Committees Take Over Permits for Movement Applications Other Materials Still Handled by the Business Control Committee

The Business Control Committee stated that in order to strengthen material controls and solve the problem of large-scale movements of major materials, except for matters concerning flour and wheat movement permit applications, which have already been transferred to the Flour and Wheat Control Committee, the applications for permits to move the three major materials of oil, cotton (including cotton, yarn, and cloth), and daily necessities (including matches, candles, and soap), have also been transferred to the Oil, Cotton, and Daily Necessities Control Committees starting yesterday (the 1st). In addition, applications to move other major materials should still be submitted to the Material Movement Permit Application Office of the Business Control Committee.

### Flour Allocation Offices Established in Various Regions

### Customs Rectifies Discipline Strictly Prevents Customs Officers from Engaging in Malfeasance Welcomes Outside Exposure and Whistleblowing

Responsible personnel of the Customs Line Tax Department issued a statement yesterday, saying: "The customs authorities have recently received letters from outside exposing customs officers for engaging in malfeasance. The Shanghai Times newspaper on the first of this month also published similar letters, demonstrating that all sectors attach importance to customs administration, which is worthy of acknowledgment. The content of the letters has been strictly reviewed and investigated. However, because the letters lack accurate addresses and genuine names, it is difficult to conduct investigations and seek evidence. However, during the period of rectifying discipline, we have taken various effective measures to prevent malfeasance, such as organizing patrol teams to conduct thorough searches and recently issuing a notice to merchants at the Jianghai Customs Office that if goods are detained, they must obtain a detention receipt. If officials refuse to issue receipts, they are allowed to be reported by name. These measures have already shown results. However, the customs checkpoints are scattered in the suburbs, and intelligence personnel have mixed ears and eyes. To eliminate corruption, it is related to the administration of this office, and exposing cases relies on external assistance. We welcome whistleblowing in the future. However, whistleblowers must provide accurate addresses and genuine names to facilitate investigation and consultation. The Customs will absolutely keep the names of whistleblowers confidential, so there is no need to worry. However, if there is fabrication or intentional slander, this office will also investigate according to the law to maintain honor."

### Bicycle License Exchange Strictly Prevents Malfeasance

The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau began processing bicycle license exchanges in the city on the 15th of last month. The number of people going to register every day has been extremely enthusiastic. In order to assist in preventing bicycle theft, the authorities have been very strict with inspecting the steel stamps on bicycles. Owners have to spend time waiting for the inspection. A small number of owners, unable to wait, asked intermediaries to handle the procedure on their behalf. It is unreasonable for those who arrive first to have to wait longer. In view of this, the bureau specially dispatched personnel on the 26th of last month to assist in inspecting the steel stamps at various registration offices. It has also contacted the Finance Bureau to send personnel to the registration offices to jointly collect and remit funds in order to expedite the process. The bureau also sends personnel to the registration offices at any time to check whether there is any difficulty or overcharging of citizens. Once discovered, severe punishment will be given. It has been learned that the authorities recently discovered three employees accepting bribes and have already dismissed them, hoping

### Police Officer Commits Extortion by Intimidation and Illegal Detention Prosecuted

Zhang Deshi, an investigator in the Judicial Section of the Xujiahui Sub-bureau, together with Cai Linshan and Meng Zhenshan, street vendors selling bread, went to the home of Jin Ronggui, a tailor residing at No. 19, Weifu Lane, Fangbang Road, Nanshi, on July 34th. They claimed that someone named Wang had been detained and that Wang had testified that he was related to Jin. They took Jin to a tea house in Nanshi and, through intimidation, extorted 4,000 yuan from him before releasing him. Cai received 600 yuan in "hat money," and Meng received 200 yuan in "hat money." Zhang misappropriated the remaining 3,200 yuan. Afterwards, Jin Ronggui, unable to bear this undeserved injustice, filed a report with the Yimiao Sub-bureau, which reported it to the Judicial Department. Director Li ordered the Investigation Section to investigate. Section Chief Liu's investigation confirmed the facts. Zhang was detained, and the two suspects, Cai and Meng, were apprehended. After interrogation, all suspects confessed to the crime. They were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and legal questioning on charges of extortion by intimidation under Article 346, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law and Article 339, Paragraph 1 of the same law. In addition, Zhang was charged with abuse of authority as a public official.

### Opium Smoker Registration Deadline Extended

in Shanghai has reached more than 13,700, and more than 50,000 in other regions. As the number of opium smokers applying for registration has remained enthusiastic in recent days, the Ministry of Interior Affairs has telegraphed the bureau to extend the deadline by one month to September 30th. The fee for each license remains 150 yuan. During this extended registration period, opium smokers in this city can still apply for registration and obtain licenses at the opium smoker registration offices set up by the police stations in their respective jurisdictions and at the Second Section of the Opium Suppression Bureau at No. 1286, North Sichuan Road.

### Short Commentary: The Issue of Electricity Restrictions for Theaters

The restrictions on water and electricity in this city, particularly the repeated restrictions on theaters, are undoubtedly necessary from the authorities' perspective. From the users' perspective, there is also an absolute obligation to comply. However, there should be two different distinctions in the amount of restrictions: Pure consumers should be limited to the bare minimum, while wasters should be absolutely prohibited. Production departments of wartime necessities, wartime essential work departments, and public welfare departments should be moderately maintained to the necessary extent. We believe that the authorities will also consider this distinction, and not treat them equally. The recent electricity usage survey of factories by the Economic Bureau, and the Ministry of Industry's plan to adjust electricity usage for Shanghai factories, are examples of this.

As for social welfare departments, such as hospitals that use electricity for surgical tools, cannot be reduced. This fact should be carefully considered, and the necessary usage should be maintained as much as possible. Recently, we have received many letters from hospitals explaining the reasons why they cannot reduce electricity usage. However, the power company has not considered the actual needs and will implement power cuts according to the restrictions, causing considerable difficulties for medical care and patients.

Based on the principle of reasonable differentiation in electricity restrictions, we believe that the necessary electricity usage for hospitals in medical care should not be treated the same as consumer waste. We hope that the electricity authorities will consider this carefully and make reasonable adjustments to benefit public welfare.

Finally, it is worth reiterating a method for conserving electricity that we mentioned in our commentary on March 9th: "During the middle ten days of each month - from the eighth to the eighteenth - when the moonlight is bright (except on rainy days), the streetlights on the roads, even at their dimmest, are almost imperceptible under the moonlight. During this period, it would be better to eliminate streetlights and transfer the electricity saved to supplement the electricity shortages in livelihood and public utilities." Such wanton behavior has been rampant these past few years, especially since joining the Greater East Asia War. The allies’ assistance can be described as supremely benevolent and righteous, and the people's tolerance and expectations for the government have reached their limit. Thinking of this today, the martyred heroes certainly have no reason to be ashamed of the nation, nor does the nation have reason to be ashamed of the martyred heroes. However, we comrades who survive them have let down the heroes and the nation too much.

At present, the peace movement, due to the intricate complexity of subjective and objective conditions, has nearly despaired of achieving comprehensive peace. However, the goal of the peace movement is to save the country, and its process requires achieving comprehensive peace before the wish to save the country can be realized. Based on this principle, no matter how tortuous the path to comprehensive peace may be, we must bravely move forward and not stop until we reach our goal.

Once we understand our goal, we should uphold the spirit of the martyrs and strive forward along the normal path. Therefore, I hope that my comrades who live on will: First, uphold the spirit of "public-mindedness and selflessness" to seek political reform. When it comes to comprehensive peace, most people pay attention to military developments. Naturally, when the Chongqing authorities still believe in final victory, military developments are important. However, political struggle is more effective and significant because comprehensive peace is not peace for a few leaders, but peace for the entire nation; it is not peace of submission or coercion, but peace of inner awakening. The greatest driving force for achieving this kind of peace is enlightened politics within the peace zone because enlightened politics can stabilize people's lives and reduce unnecessary suffering. Although the people's knowledge is low, their perception of politics is very keen. They don't care about war and peace, they don't feel enthusiastic about Pan-Asianism, and they don't understand the ABCD line. If someone can help them to settle down or reduce their suffering, they will not care if the government is A or B, and they will rush to praise it, saying, "This is our benevolent heaven." If 300 million out of the 450 million people turn to the peace zone, how can comprehensive peace not be achieved?

Since the beginning of the peace movement, we have only seen military struggles, ideological struggles, and economic struggles, but not political competition. On the contrary, we only see some officials becoming increasingly shameless, social order becoming increasingly chaotic, right and wrong becoming increasingly blurred, and people's lives becoming increasingly miserable. In this situation of political corruption, social degradation, and people struggling to survive, it is difficult to achieve a comprehensive peace based on the people.

I realize that the reason for all this corruption and degradation is nothing more than the prevalence of "selfishness." Therefore, we must first uphold the spirit of "public-mindedness and selflessness" of the martyrs to seek political reform. As the saying goes, "Severe punishment is needed in chaotic times." This sentence comes from painful experience. We should use resolute and selfless means to eliminate all corrupt officials, so that politics can gradually get on track, people's lives can gradually become stable, and people's hearts can return. No external force can stop this.

### Fight the Reactionary Forces With a Spirit of Defying Death

Second, we must fight the reactionary forces of the Communist Party with the spirit of defying death of the martyrs. Based on their distorted theories, the Communist Party insists on destroying the existing social order and disintegrating the existing national organization. In a backward, semi-feudal agricultural society, they create mutual killings among people to replace the so-called class struggle. All our citizens must consider the survival of the nation and the country, and must not be indifferent to or ignore the existence and development of the Communist Party. Some people say: It is not uncommon for several parties to exist in one country. Why can't they coexist peacefully, and why must we fight to the death? Little do they know that the parties in other countries are ordinary political parties. They do not have a complete plan to transform society, they do not need to overthrow the entire old political system, they do not have armies, and they do not need to seize power by force. Their advances and retreats are based on democratic methods. The Chinese Nationalist Party is a revolutionary party, and the Chinese Communist Party also claims to be a revolutionary party. Both want to build a new society, both have military forces, and both want to seize power. A country can only have one regime. Now, the Nationalist Party has taken power and will not let go, and the Communist Party wants to steal it. In this situation, if the two parties don't have guns, they will fight with fists. Since both sides have military forces, what way is there to avoid war? Take Chongqing as an example. In order to maintain a united front with the Communist Party, they try to seek compromise. Now, the friction in their bones not only cannot be reduced, but even the superficial compromise is almost impossible. Therefore, I believe that the Nationalist Party's anti-communism is determined by the Nationalist Party's fate, and the anti-communism of patriotic people is determined by the patriotic people's duty. We cannot escape this unfortunate fate and duty, nor do we need to escape it. Therefore, we can only fight to the end with the Communists with the spirit of the martyrs who defied death.

### Complete National Construction With Courage and Hard Work

Third, we must have the self-confidence of the martyrs and complete the construction of the country with courage and hard work. If we want to overcome a certain obstacle and complete a certain great undertaking, it depends on our self-confidence. For example, if the conditions for success are not met, but the person involved has strong self-confidence and works especially hard, it may be possible to succeed. Conversely, if the conditions for success are fully sufficient, but the person involved lacks self-confidence and wavers at the slightest setback, this is bound to fail. What our comrades and people lack most now is self-confidence and the spirit of courage and hard work, especially the situation of the general public in the city, which is even more heartbreaking. Everyone drifts with the tide, speculates and takes shortcuts, lives a corrupt life, and is mentally exhausted. There are very few who have the self-confidence to muster their spirits and work hard to accomplish something. If this situation is not reformed, even if there is a good opportunity to build the country, it will be useless. Therefore, if we want to complete the work of building the country, we must have the self-confidence and the spirit of courage and hard work of the martyrs, especially in times of extreme poverty of manpower and resources, and all shortcomings must be compensated for with excessive self-confidence and redoubled hard work.

The above points are my personal understanding and feelings, and I will use them as a memorial to the martyrs. (Broadcast speech on September 1)

### Special Scholarship Amounts Have Been Approved; Complaint Letters Must Include Procedures

The scholarship office of this newspaper, entrusted by enthusiastic people from all walks of life to handle special scholarships, has a total of twelve cases, including five newly established ones: the Ai Ju Wen Zhu Ren Scholarship, the Mayor Scholarship, and the Zi Yun, Shou Zhi, and Zhuo Zai Scholarships. The handled scholarships include seven types: Bai Zhi, Yu Wen, Da Hua, Da Cheng, Ting Xin, Fu Sheng, and Ding Jun. The number of recipients and the departments they attend are all pre-designated by the donors and reviewed by this office. Those with both excellent character and academics are included in the special scholarship list. The list has been mostly finalized and will be announced tomorrow. We hope that all scholarship recipients will pay attention.

This office has recently received complaint letters, and some are similar to anonymous letters with the intention of sabotage and do not include real names. This office believes that they do not meet the procedures and will not handle them. In the future, if anyone reports accurate situations, please include your real name, address, and evidence. We will consider them.

### Health Checkup Must Be Attended

The Nanyang Hospital is conducting physical examinations for the students in the primary school group of this newspaper's scholarship program, entirely free of charge, saving time and money. This newspaper has arranged a schedule and issued free examination certificates along with the scholarship checks, one certificate for each person, and instructed them to attend the examination on the scheduled date. According to the Nanyang Hospital, some students are either late, interfering with other people's examination schedules, or do not attend at all, not caring about their own health and failing to live up to the hospital's good intentions, which is regrettable. Knowing whether or not their bodies are healthy affects their studies. If the students do not participate in this examination, their qualifications will be revoked in the next application. Therefore, we hope that all students will attend the examination on time.

### Yesterday's Scholarship Received

Bu Qiu Wen Da Xuan Zhu donated 10,000 yuan, Zi Bu Hao Xue Wei Ren donated 5,000 yuan, Xu Ji donated 500 yuan, Yan Bangrong (his son, Suo Denian, will move and donate) donated 300 yuan, Jiangxi Road Post Office (lost and found) donated 220 yuan, Shang Ru donated 100 yuan.

On Behalf of Opinions

### Continued from Page 1

Q: Granted, but hasn't Zhou Enlai recently issued a statement vehemently attacking Chongqing?

A: Zhou Enlai's statement was in response to Liang Han Cao. Liang Han Cao attributed the breakdown of the negotiations between the Nationalists and Communists on July 26 entirely to the Communist Party, stating that, "The obstacle to a fundamental resolution still lies in the Communist Party's capricious attitude, but the Nationalist Party is consistently willing to cooperate with the Communist Party in a friendly manner" (as originally stated). In response to this point, Zhou Enlai pointed out the Nationalist Party's consistently duplicitous behavior, stating that, "The obstacle to resolving the issue lies consistently in the Chongqing Nationalist Party's unwillingness to abandon dictatorship. The Nationalist Party regime is entirely a one-party dictatorship, and it repeatedly neglects the guidelines stipulated by the Three Principles of the People, unwilling to immediately implement genuine democratic politics." The reason Zhou Enlai's statement was so forceful is not simply because a Communist Party supports him. The war realist United States believes that anything that can be used to defeat Japan should be utilized, and thus recently it has valued the Chinese Communist Party's ability to resist Japan and has been seeking to use it to launch offensives against Japan. Thus, military cooperation negotiations with the CCP have already begun. At this time, no matter how forceful the CCP's attitude may be in China, Chongqing has no recourse. The Chongqing authorities are troubled by dealing with the CCP, because they fear the United States, and can only try to avoid surface conflict with the CCP as much as possible and adopt a policy of concession. Seizing the opportunity of Chongqing's policy of concession, the CCP increasingly advocates that the Chongqing regime immediately realize democracy. The United States has no time to consider what global implications may arise from the CCP's advocated realization of democracy of the Chongqing regime, and is simply partnering with the CCP, shouting in unison, demanding the democratization of the Chongqing regime. After being pressured by these two sides, Chongqing recently had no choice but to publish democratic legal acts of the class of human rights protections and inspection alleviation. Naturally, this is only a pretense of democratic politics, and is nothing more than an unwilling expression forced by the circumstances. However, it is filled with anger in its heart. Jiang Jieshi has openly and repeatedly stated that if he does not implement autocratic dictatorship during the war of resistance, he will be unable to rule China. Even just a pretense of democracy, the reason that Chongqing had to express it is because it was theoretically defeated by Yan'an. Such situations are definitely not elements that promote Nationalist-Communist cooperation. On the contrary, they are elements that are increasingly creating two paths diverging from each other.

Q: Is that why you believe that Jiang Jieshi is increasingly approaching Japan?

A: Don't be impatient. Regarding this question, it is useless to simply consider China's conditions without considering Japan's own subjective conditions. To put it bluntly, if Japan did "not approach Jiang," Jiang would not pay attention to Japan no matter how much the CCP ridiculed him or how much the United States played with him. At the same time, it's not just that. The current Sino-Japanese issue cannot be decided solely by Jiang Jieshi, the National Essence faction, the pro-British and American faction, etc. Regarding this point, I previously cited the following statement by the former Hangzhou Consul, Minaiyama Seibu, in my essay "Opinions on a Comprehensive Resolution of the Sino-Japanese Issue," which still has a need for careful consideration. "It is certainly a fact that Jiang Jieshi's personal influence is ruling resistance China, but at the same time, do not neglect that Jiang Jieshi is very good at absorbing Chinese anti-Japanese forces. The foundation of the anti-Japanese sentiment is not Jiang Jieshi, but something else. To put it more concretely, it is the psychology of the intellectual masses, and to go a step further, it is the national psychology..." This is well said. Now Japan should pay attention not only to famous Chinese politicians, but also to the entire Chinese populace who regard being "descendants of the Yellow Emperor" as supreme glory. In the current era of China, neither Jiang Jieshi nor Mao Zedong can forcibly implement politics that the Chinese populace is unwilling to accept. However, Japan's politicians have not yet fully understood this point, and only deal with China's famous politicians. For example, some Japanese politicians always want to resolve the Sino-Japanese issue with painful-to-hear personal relations like "Jiang Jieshi's mother's brother's nephew's aunt's husband's brother," or "He Yingqin's grandfather's nephew's son's wife's brother's son's father-in-law's friend," or study the Sino-Japanese issue with corrupted and unbearable antique figures from the Beiyang warlord era, completely ignoring whether the most important Chinese populace can accept it. Therefore, the current Chinese populace cannot be said to have a good impression of Japanese policies. According to the current situation, even if Jiang Jieshi is willing to run to the Japanese side, he definitely cannot drag the Chinese populace over to join hands and be happy with Japan. If he forcibly does this, he is in danger of being expelled by the people, so Jiang cannot come to Japan to negotiate peace.

Q: I want to ask boldly, then how exactly should Japan do well?

A: Even if you ask boldly, I cannot answer this question boldly. For this question, it is necessary for you to come to China to study it in person. Goethe once said: "The common man not only completely denies life outside his own life, but also demands that all of humanity outside himself must live the same life as he does." When the Japanese study this question, they should carefully consider this sentence. The Japanese should first stand in the position of the Chinese and think, if they were Chinese, what would they do in that situation? Assuming they were Chinese, what emotions would they have in that situation? If they can think of this, they will definitely slightly imagine the emotions that the Chinese currently harbor towards the Japanese. Observing things based on such an acquired "Chinese emotion" will easily lead to understanding the core of the Chinese issue. To give a very small example: Suppose American troops landed in Japan, and the Americans looked down on everyone, strutted around, and got drunk and beat people. What kind of feelings would the Japanese have towards the Americans? If the Japanese were beaten by the Japanese, they could still endure it, but this is being beaten by foreigners, no, being beaten by Americans. If you can understand the emotions of the Japanese at this time and in this place, you will naturally understand the emotions of the Chinese when they are beaten by the Japanese. Observing things based on such Chinese emotions can give you some grasp of the center of the Chinese issue. Many Japanese suspect, why are the Chinese so stubbornly unwilling to give up their anti-Japanese sentiments? The Japanese think that, "Since Japan and China have concluded an alliance treaty, the Chinese are Japanese comrades, so the Chinese must have comrade emotions towards the Japanese." This is the Chinese view obtained based on "Japanese emotions." Based on such "Japanese emotions," even if you study the Sino-Japanese issue for a hundred years, you will never find a way to resolve it.

Zigong asked, "Is there one word that can be practiced throughout one's life?" Confucius said, "That would be forbearance! Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire." (End of full text) (Translated by Lu)

### National Forum: The Dual Numbering System Urgently Needs to Be Abolished

— Xu Keyuan

I live in the western part of Shanghai (formerly Zha Bei District). The number on my house seems to be the same as the house number on the property tax bill, but it has always been based on the white plaque (nailed up by the old municipal government). Every time citizens collect their ration cards, the staff at the distribution office always ask the citizens in detail about their addresses. Citizens often have difficulty receiving ration cards because they don't remember the number on the white plaque (i.e., the number on the property tax bill), which causes disputes. This fact is enough to show that the above-mentioned house number problem needs to be improved urgently. I wonder if the municipal authorities have paid attention to it or if there is already a concrete solution.
