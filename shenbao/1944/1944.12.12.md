### Attacking Eight Enemy Ships Sunk in Surigao Strait: Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announces Achievements of the Danshin Unit

Tokyo, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on November 11th: The six planes of the Japanese Special Attack Unit, the Danshin Air Unit, attacked an enemy transport convoy in the Surigao Strait southeast of Leyte Island on December 10th, achieving the following results: Sunk two large transport ships, one cruiser or large destroyer, and two large landing craft; heavily damaged and set ablaze two large transport ships and one cruiser or large destroyer; the aforementioned cruiser or large destroyer that was heavily damaged and set ablaze was later sunk by Japanese fighter escorts.

A certain Japanese military base on the Philippine frontlines, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: On the 9th, the weather in the Leyte area was extremely bad. Disregarding the adverse weather, the Japanese Air Force launched a fierce attack on enemy troops landing at Albuera, inflicting considerable damage on enemy tanks, armored vehicles, etc. in the vicinity of Albuera. Another unit attacked Albuera and other locations such as Ypaka and Calibara, destroying an enemy landing craft off the coast of Albuera and bombing and strafing a supply depot in Damlaan, causing it to ignite and burn.

Manila, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: American forces forcibly landing near Albuera have suffered heavy damage and are advancing north with tanks and armored vehicles towards Ormoc. Japanese garrison forces are currently engaged in fierce fighting with them. Furthermore, in the vicinity of Albuera, Japanese units are continuing to launch fierce attacks on the enemy landing forces. The Japanese Air Force is also braving the adverse weather to cooperate with ground troops in a fierce bombing campaign against the enemy.

### Japanese Forces Occupy the Brown Airfield on Leyte Island

Manila, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: The enemy's largest air base on Leyte Island, the north and south airfields of Brown, have finally been occupied by the Japanese. As a result, the enemy's main objective in the Leyte Island operation, which was to establish a strong air base, has suffered a major setback. Furthermore, the occupation of Brown will have a significant impact on the entire land battle on Leyte Island and deserves close attention. Since the enemy's aircraft carrier strength suffered heavy losses after operations in the Philippines and a major gap emerged in the deployment of air power, they have been striving to develop the Brown airfield, the only one on Leyte Island capable of handling large aircraft, pouring in large amounts of personnel and materials. Unfortunately, their efforts were unsuccessful, and the number of aircraft they needed to assemble was also captured by the Japanese army's surprise air and land attack. Brown, together with Tacloban and Dulag, forms one end of the triangle of the central base of the Leyte Island field army. The enemy is well aware of the importance and weakness of this area and has deployed strong forces near Tanauan to attempt to invade the western mountain highlands and eliminate the threat from the side. But all to no avail. In short, the loss of this airfield has had a major impact on the entire enemy force on Leyte Island.

Philippine Base, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: After the Japanese "Airborne Divine Soldiers" of the Takachiho Unit strongly attacked San Pablo, the enemy's position fell into a state of chaos. According to reports from the Japanese land forces, large fires broke out at the Brown South Airfield and San Pablo Airfield on the evening of the 7th. Furthermore, a portion of the Japanese paratrooper unit that forcibly landed on the 26th of last month is still alive and active. The enemy's 7th Division and 76th Division are now extremely exhausted, and their will to fight is waning. As of the 9th, the north and south airfields of Brown remained in Japanese hands.

### Japanese Aircraft Attack on India of Great Significance

Tokyo, November 10th, Central News Agency dispatch: Japanese air force units attacked a B-29 type aircraft base west of Calcutta, India, on the 7th. Amidst fierce enemy resistance, they launched a fierce attack on the airfield and achieved the results announced by the Imperial Headquarters. This attack is of great significance because the total number of B-29 type aircraft in India and mainland China is no less than 400, and their strength is very considerable. They used Kharagpur in India as an air base, with Calcutta and Ceylon as major bases, and then opportunistically deployed a portion of their forces to Chengdu to prepare for further air raids on Kyushu, Japan. At the same time, in addition to air raids on Manchuria for the past two months, they have also directly advanced from their Indian base to spy on southern regions such as Singapore, Sumatra, and Bangkok, echoing the battle on the Philippine Islands in the Pacific. Furthermore, with the sudden and urgent development of the Burma front, their actions have become more active. At the same time, the enemy's Mariana base in the Pacific has been subjected to fierce attacks by the Japanese army for days, so the only relatively safe base is the Calcutta base. However, this Japanese air raid has proven that this area can be threatened at any time in the future, and that even the B-29 aircraft base is in danger of being attacked by the Japanese army at any time.

A certain Japanese military base on the Burmese front, November 10th, Central News Agency dispatch: On the 7th, under the bright light of the waning crescent moon, the night bombing squadron of the Japanese Air Force in Burma launched a long-range bombing raid on the enemy's 20th Bomber Airfield in Midnapore, the heart of India, and a B-29 airfield 170 kilometers west of Calcutta. Amidst the flashing of enemy anti-aircraft fire, Japanese aircraft successively entered the airspace above the airfield, dropped bombs, burned five enemy aircraft, and inflicted significant damage on other facilities, causing large fires to break out in many places. All aircraft returned safely.

### Shipbuilding Commando Unit Established in Java

Java, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: In order to rapidly complete transport work, the Java Shipbuilding Bureau has established a shipbuilding commando unit. This commando unit is divided into shipbuilding and aircraft manufacturing teams and can be dispatched to shipbuilding and aircraft manufacturing factories throughout Java when necessary. The team members are all experienced technicians, and their activities are highly anticipated.

### American and Chongqing Aircraft Raid Hong Kong, Two Shot Down

Tokyo, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: Several American P-57 type aircraft from the Chongqing-based air force invaded the Hong Kong area at around 9:40 AM on the 8th, but two were shot down by the Japanese side, and they immediately retreated.

### Person from Inland Talks About Chongqing's Numerous Difficulties: Military Command Cannot Be Unified

Central News Agency dispatch: According to a person who recently arrived from inland Sichuan, the people of Sichuan are resentful and opposed to American pressure on Chongqing and have specially sent Zhang Lan as a representative to make suggestions to Chiang Kai-shek, urging Chiang to respect China's autonomy and independence and to reduce the suffering of the people. Chiang was deeply surprised when he received the letter of suggestion and immediately investigated the background of this move. As a result, he learned that it was instigated and planned behind the scenes by ×× military personnel and is currently being carefully studied. Zhang Lan was formerly the governor of West Sichuan Province and later the president of Chengdu University.

Chongqing's Military Power Cannot Be Unified: Regarding the reasons for Chongqing's defeat in the Guangxi campaign, the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao published a thesis tracing the root causes, generally stating that the orders of the Chongqing Supreme Command were inconsistent with the orders of the theater commander, resulting in failure. According to the discussion, the so-called orders from the Chongqing Supreme Command were issued by the Military Affairs Commission, while the orders from the local theater commander were issued by the American staff, who did not go through the Chongqing government and directly issued orders from the local headquarters, resulting in inconsistencies.

Chongqing Is Full of Refugees: Now, there are more than 600,000 refugees from Hunan and Guangxi who are wandering in the interior. Although Chongqing has sent buses and trains to transport them, it is still not enough. In the past, the population of Guiyang was 200,000, but now it has reached over 300,000. The population of Chongqing used to be around 990,000, but now it has exceeded 1,250,000. It is said that the two cities have taken measures to prevent refugees from entering. In these areas, refugees are staying in public places such as guild halls, warehouses, and schools, and are everywhere along the way. At the same time, the general public is very dissatisfied with the local relief work. In particular, the sharp increase in refugees has led to a sharp increase in the black market prices of goods and transportation costs. For example, the original price of a long-distance bus ticket from Guiyang to Chongqing was 6,000 yuan, but the black market price reached more than 40,000 yuan. Even hiring a truck costs 300,000 yuan per day.

Chongqing Sends Personnel to Relieve Refugees: Guangzhou, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: While busy with troop replenishment and front-line expansion, the relief of refugees has become a major problem. According to a telegram from Chongqing, the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission and the Social Affairs Department of the Kuomintang have jointly undertaken this work and have sent 300 staff members to Qijiang, Guangyuan, and Bishan in Sichuan, and Zunyi and other places in Guizhou. According to news from Yong'an, Fujian, the provincial relief committee has provided relief to a total of 8,000 coastal refugees, teachers, and students in the past two days.

### Japanese Aircraft Raid Suichuan Airfield Again

Mainland Base, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: A squadron of Japanese bombers raided the Suichuan airfield on the evening of the 9th, braving intense anti-aircraft fire to fiercely attack aircraft and ancillary facilities stationed at the airfield. Two large aircraft and one small aircraft were hit and caught fire. Two aircraft of unspecified type and military facilities were also destroyed. The Japanese aircraft returned safely.

### Japanese Residents in Nanjing Hold Decisive Battle Rally

Nanjing, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: From 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM on the 11th, the Japanese Naval Association and the Kōa Hōkoku Kai jointly held a decisive battle rally for Japanese residents at the Donghe Theater in Nanjing and invited Colonel Matsushima, the naval press chief from Shanghai, to give a speech. After the meeting began on time, military music was played first, followed by a speech by Mr. Tanaka, the consul general and the Nanjing branch director of the Naval Association. The speech by the press chief Matsushima was full of encouragement and moved the audience. Finally, a film was shown.

Naval Association Holds Meeting Today: Nanjing, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: To commemorate the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Naval Association will hold a commemorative tea party at the International Club at 9:00 AM on the 12th, inviting government officials and Chinese and Japanese journalists. At that time, there will be a speech by the press chief Matsushima and a film screening.

### People in Longzhou and Other Places Actively Assist Japanese Forces

Hanoi, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: Japanese forces advancing from Vietnam have occupied Longzhou, Mingjiang, Ningming, and other places. The local residents have returned one after another, and flags supporting the Nanjing government are flying everywhere. The 188th Division of the Chongqing army, which was previously stationed along the Guangxi border, requisitioned food from the people, so the people did not cooperate with the Chongqing army when the Japanese forces attacked. The Japanese army, on the other hand, reversed what they deeply hated and allowed the residents to live and work in peace after occupying individual areas, so they all actively cooperated with the Japanese army.

### Governor-General's Office of Vietnam Holds First Deliberative Council

Hanoi, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: The highest advisory body of the Governor-General's Office of Vietnam, the Deliberative Council of Vietnam, was established on the 1st of this month and held its first meeting at the Governor-General's residence on the 9th, chaired by Governor-General Decoux, to exchange views on current economic issues.

Stockholm, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: Reuters quoted a London message as saying that British authorities announced last night that Admiral Fraser had been appointed commander-in-chief of the British Pacific Fleet. Fraser is 56 years old and was originally the commander of the British fleet in Southeast Asia. Vice Admiral Power has been appointed commander of the East Indies station, while Rear Admiral Daniel has been appointed deputy commander of the British Pacific Fleet.

### Japanese Army Will Launch Next Phase of War in South China: Chen Cheng Speaks to Foreign Correspondents

Lisbon, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: According to a telegram from Chongqing, Chen Cheng, the newly appointed Minister of Military Administration in Chongqing, met with foreign journalists for the first time on the 9th and spoke about the war situation in South China as follows: From any point of view, the Japanese army will have to prepare to launch the next phase of the war. The goal of the Japanese army is to completely control the Canton-Hankou Railway, to completely ensure land communication between mainland China and French Vietnam, and, taking advantage of the insufficient strength of the Chongqing army in Guizhou Province, to turn their sharp edge towards Guizhou, currently advancing and retreating at a point a hundred and ten kilometers away from Guiyang. Chen Cheng also spoke about the reform of the Chongqing army and the issue of cooperation with the United States, the main points of which are as follows: It is a well-known fact that the Chongqing army is unable to fight against the Japanese army, so we must strengthen and reform this incapable Chongqing army.

Implementing the Military First Policy: Lisbon, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: In order to overcome the current military crisis, the Chongqing military authorities have recently been desperately focusing on military matters. According to local sources, Song Ziwen, the acting president of the Executive Yuan, stated the following: In this time of pressing crisis, military issues must be dealt with first, and all measures taken by the government are to aid the military in its fight against Japan.

### Reflections on the Third Anniversary of the War: Broadcast Address by Information Minister Matsudaira

Military Supply Production Reduced by 60%: "According to the speech given by Minister of Wartime Supplies Sumawit at the CTD Conference in mid-November, the average production of military supplies has been reduced to 60% of the planned amount. On the 28th of the same month, the US Army Department announced that Eisenhower's European Expeditionary Force had dispatched 27 officers to this country in five groups to visit various military factories to emphasize the increase in military production in order to urge the United States to urgently send weapons and ammunition. Why has the average military production in the United States been reduced by 60% of the planned amount? This is ultimately due to the impact of inflation caused by the huge budget of 200 billion US dollars. To explain further, it is because the conversion of peacetime industries to military industries has gradually reduced general materials, and the consumption of materials due to the expansion of the front lines and the intensification of the war has significantly increased, so the necessary materials for life are also in short supply. According to fragmentary information, for example, no store in Chicago could obtain white butter oil in July of this year, and in Los Angeles, 900 restaurants and 100 grocery stores have closed down, the allocation of milk has been reduced by 50%, and white butter oil has been reduced by 60%. Due to the shortage of materials, people are queuing up to buy things from morning to night.

Material Shortages Affect Life: Furthermore, recent purchases are purchased in queues like in Shanghai, and there is no more cigarette allocation to the military. Although the prices of agricultural products are not controlled, because of the sharp decline in this year's wheat harvest, each person has to reduce their average meal by 20%. Although it is called the world's largest wheat-producing country and a country that exports to foreign countries, the reduction of each person's meal by 20% this year is a situation that has never been imagined before. Therefore, the United States, which has abundant materials, is now in a state of utter depletion of materials, and inflation is promoting the rise in prices. As a result, wages have to be increased, and because of the suppression of capitalists, strikes and labor disputes occur frequently, naturally causing production to decrease. On the other hand, there is a continuous stream of people who want to convert from the price-controlled military industry to the price-uncontrolled peacetime industry, and the government cannot control this, so it has allowed people to operate 72 types of peacetime industries since July. The military industry is now drastically reduced, and since December, 120 major cities have taken measures to stop the recovery of peacetime industries, exposing the government's incompetence, and the mistakes made by their leaders are fully exposed by the above phenomena."

Our View of Britain and America

Turning the tables, what is our view of Britain and America? Our Easterners' ideas are based on direct impressions, as just described. I believe that until Japan decided on its final policy on December 8th three years ago, everything was analyzed from all aspects, and judgments were made based on scientific foundations established by reference to numerical statistics, and the future of the country was considered more calmly, with no evil thoughts existing in the pure and honest state of mind, and the destiny of the country was directly felt. Based on this comprehensive judgment, the country's major policies were decided. I believe that in the inference of all things, which is more reasonable, to be directly touched, or to be obtained by scientific inference? This question is extremely difficult to determine. Although we cannot determine which is absolutely superior and absolutely reasonable, at least the most ideal is to be directly touched and to be inferred by scientific vision. In this sense, we have both kinds of feelings, both directly touched and scientifically visionary.

Exerting All Efforts to Win Victory: Since the enemy's counterattack on Guadalcanal, Japan's observation of the enemy has become more accurate, and there is a consistent view from top to bottom, but the enemy has not yet clearly recognized the true nature of Japan, and its guidance of its own people is also disjointed. Especially in the United States, they fabricate false war results that Japan's strength has been weakened to promote Japan's weakness and their own strength to the people, while the army and navy promote to the people that Japan is difficult to invade and try their best to encourage the strengthening of combat power. This is the enemy's weakness. All beliefs that are born from intuition are true beliefs. We have spirit and beliefs in our weapons, and we have the best quality of combat compared to the enemy. Because we have this confidence, we must exert all our spiritual and material strength for the coming decisive fourth year and win the glory of final victory. (To be continued)

Editorial

### The People Are Supreme (Part 1)

A nation is constituted by three elements: land, people, and sovereignty. The absence of any one of these three elements renders a nation incomplete. Among these, the most crucial element is the people. Consequently, the political institutions of a nation should prioritize the interests and welfare of its people. As the ancient sages stated, "The people are the foundation of the state; when the foundation is secure, the state is at peace." This principle not only represents the political philosophy of China for thousands of years but has also become the political conviction of the Chinese populace. The adage "Those who win the hearts of the people prosper, those who lose the hearts of the people perish" underscores whether the political policies of a nation garner the support of its populace.

The Chinese people do not traditionally regard the state and the government as an indivisible entity. At times, they perceive them as entirely separate entities. Therefore, the people adopt a selective attitude toward the government. However, due to the excessively composed and resilient nature of the Chinese people, their selection of a government is not particularly proactive. They only display enthusiasm towards a government that they wholeheartedly and sincerely endorse. Conversely, they will revolt against a government that they deeply abhor, even at the cost of mutual destruction. Towards a government that has not yet reached the threshold of deep abhorrence, they adopt a laissez-faire attitude, refraining from demanding civil rights from the government in advance to rectify its errors or impeach its improprieties, until it reaches the point of deep abhorrence, at which point they rise up in revolution, prepared for mutual destruction. The cyclical pattern of order and chaos in Chinese politics over thousands of years has not deviated from this pattern. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People were rooted in historical precedent.

From this, we can understand that a chasm exists between the Chinese government and its people. The class of scholar-officials who "excel in learning and then seek officialdom" (now referred to as intellectuals) are the ones who bridge this chasm. Due to the generally low level of education among the Chinese people, intellectuals constitute the backbone of society, and their influence is likened to "the wind upon the grass." The people's choice of government is based on the direction of the intellectuals. Throughout history, intellectuals have played a leading role in major revolutionary movements, a fact that has become irrefutable. If the intellectuals, the mainstay of society, do not address the interests of the people, which are also the interests of the entire nation, and instead side with their own private interests and become enemies of the people, they will accelerate the demise of the nation and widen the distance between the government and the people.

In this way, we can further understand that only when the government acts in the best interests of the nation and strives for the happiness of the people, strengthens itself, and interacts with sincerity, will the people be "heartily convinced" and care about politics as if it were their own personal affair. Only a government supported by the people has a legitimate basis for a political party to exist. Political parties will never thrive in governments without a foundation of popular support.

These are not profound political theories but rather the basic political knowledge of a modern citizen and the fundamental principles for a government to lead its people toward a modern nation. Recently, I read some key documents published by the Kuomintang: one is the declaration issued by the Sixth Provisional Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee for the passing of Chairman Wang; the other is a letter to the people of the whole country on carrying out the Chairman's last will. The Kuomintang is the largest political party in China and the ruling party leading the construction of a new China. Her remarks are the direction of Chinese politics and the indicator of the efforts of the general public. Therefore, all Chinese people should pay attention to them, especially those who bear the responsibility of public opinion, should pay more attention to them, and support these two important documents from the perspective of the people. At the same time, the opinions of the people should be expressed from the standpoint of the people. The above-mentioned basic political theories are the basic viewpoints for us to express our opinions.

The words of the declaration and the letter to the people are earnest and insightful, giving the people a deep impression that the Kuomintang is full of vigor. The fundamental spirit is to inherit Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and the last will of Chairman Wang, to complete peaceful nation-building, to implement the revolutionary spirit of the Three Principles of the People, to declare externally the determination to oppose communism and Anglo-American imperialism, to cooperate to complete the war, to strive for co-existence and co-prosperity, and to ask internally for the unification of the party and the country. They expressed sympathy and understanding for the plight of Chongqing today and put forward the principle of "the party must not be divided, and the country must be unified." They also stated that "Now that Mr. Wang has abandoned us and passed away, we are not worried that communism cannot be eradicated, but only that the comrades of our party cannot unite; we are not worried that the policies of imperialism cannot be resisted, but only that the revolutionary efforts will be dispersed day by day..." A few words are enough to express the honest spirit of the Nanjing Kuomintang comrades and can promote the awakening of the Chongqing comrades who are hesitating and wavering, which is beyond doubt. On domestic political issues, they pointed out that "the bureaucratic system is an obstacle to eroding the revolutionary spirit" and that "corrupt politics directly disturbs the people's livelihood and indirectly creates the poison of red disaster." They also said: "It is inevitable that life will be difficult during the war, but the roaming bandits are rampant, destroying production, the cunning merchants hoard and manipulate prices, and the harsh taxes and levies are sucking blood, all of which are man-made pains." Then it says that "this party must do its best to implement it, so that every word and sentence will be realized." In short, to seek independence externally, we must first unify the party and the country, and to seek unity internally, we must first stabilize the people's livelihood. Then we can "All my comrades and compatriots must look up to this purpose, abide by the General's legacy, follow the President's last will, have no second thoughts, no detours, be courageous and diligent, and achieve final success." Building a new Republic of China with the Three Principles of the People as its foundation.

Indeed, the world is changing rapidly, and the mission of the Kuomintang comrades is becoming heavier, and the responsibilities of all our compatriots are also greater, and the problems that need to be solved are more and more complex. No matter how heavy the responsibility is and how complex the problem is, there is only one fundamental requirement, that is, the government does not leave the people and leads from the front instead of facing them. The root cause of the "deep suffering of the people" in today's political situation lies in the fact that "those who are responsible in all aspects either turn a blind eye because officials' lives are difficult, or reduce the punishment for subordinates based on past merits, which leads to the deterioration of officialdom and the neglect of government affairs..." The result is that "the bureaucratic system is an obstacle to eroding the revolutionary spirit" and "corrupt politics directly disturbs the people's livelihood and indirectly creates the poison of red disaster." The leaders of the government reviewed the shortcomings of past politics in front of the people, frankly admitted their responsibilities, and made up their minds to reform and renew the people. This kind of statesmanly demeanor is admirable! However, looking at the problem more closely, we feel that "turning a blind eye" and "reconciling based on past merits" are still external factors. The root of the root is that some peace activists in the party and government personnel are not firm in their belief in peace, and they do not have a thorough spirit, and even mistakenly think that the present is a transitional era. As a result, they take the opportunity to fish in troubled waters and use their positions to do things that are blinded by profit, and they do not know how to serve the country, but only how to serve themselves.

### Soviet-French Alliance Treaty Signed

Stockholm, Sweden, November 11th, Central News Agency: According to Moscow Radio: The visit of De Gaulle and Foreign Minister Bidault to Moscow demonstrates various expressions of sympathy between the two nations, which has been strengthened by the experiences of the two nations in the war. During the talks, the Soviet side was chaired by Chairman Stalin and Foreign Minister Molotov. Operational actions, peace organization, and the German issue were all on the agenda. The two governments repeatedly emphasized their determination to defeat Germany and their willingness to jointly take necessary measures to protect Europe from further aggression, which has now been completed. Based on the spirit of this decision, the two governments signed an alliance and mutual assistance agreement on December 10th, which will be announced separately by both parties.

London newspapers welcomed the Soviet-French treaty, stating that it is similar in nature to the agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union, and is important not only for continuing the war but also in peacetime.

### German and Hungarian Forces Recapture Three Important Cities in Southern Hungary

Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency, Huitong News Agency: In the Battle of Budapest, German and Hungarian resistance has strengthened. After the Northern Saar forces occupied Veszprém, they made no further progress. Only a portion of the Soviet forces gathered there intends to attack Budapest, while another team is advancing towards the Slovak border, apparently intending to cut off German transportation. Soviet forces southwest of Budapest are currently pressing towards Budapest, and German forces are fiercely resisting and sometimes counterattacking. South of Lake Balaton, German forces have recaptured the three cities of Keszthely, Marcali, and Balaton.

### Post-War Transportation of Three Countries

Geneva, November 11th, Central News Agency, German News Agency: In the Anglo-American-Soviet post-war transportation conference currently being held in London, representatives of the three countries are vying for favorable rights for their respective countries in the European transportation system. Not only have conflicts of opinion arisen between the American and Soviet representatives, but also friction between Britain and the United States. Although Britain and the United States have agreed on unified management, the Soviet side objects to this proposal and advocates that transportation lines should be extended to the Soviet border.

### Bloody Battles on the Saar Front for Four Days and Nights: American Forces' New Tactics Encounter Setbacks

Headquarters of the German Army in the West, November 11th, Central News Agency, Huitong News Agency: On the Saar front, the fighting is becoming increasingly fierce along the 50-kilometer stretch from Mancy to Saarbrücken. The intensity of the street fighting is second only to that of the Battle of Aachen. The focus of the fighting is in Dillingen, where fierce battles have been raging for over 100 hours. General Patton's new tactic of seizing the Siegfried Line for the first time, sending small groups of tanks and engineers to infiltrate various sections in an attempt to disrupt communication between them, has encountered setbacks in Dillingen. The commando team that broke in was surrounded and cut off by German forces.

Becoming the Second Graveyard of the American Army: The second focus of the battle in the Saar region is between Saarlautern and Ensdorf in Lower Saar. American forces attempted to break through the German positions but were repelled by concentrated German artillery fire. Since the Battle of Aachen, the Battle of the Saar can truly be called the second graveyard of the American army. The fierce fighting between Saargemünd and Haguenau is also related to the Battle of the Saar, but the American Seventh Army has not made easy progress either. American forces are attacking the city of Haguenau, and their vanguard has reached Bischwiller. German forces are now counterattacking. There are no major changes in the Aachen area. After German forces withdrew from the Rur bridgehead near Jülich, the river has now become the main front line for the two armies.

### Travel Notes in Wuhan (1)

— Yoshida Toyosuke

On November 3rd, braving the light drizzle, the plane I was on landed at Hankou Airport. Just like Shanghai, which is located along the Huangpu River, Hankou is also located along the Yangtze River. The area equivalent to Yangshupu in Shanghai is the Japanese Concession; the area equivalent to the Public Concession is the French and British Concessions. What Pudong is to Shanghai, Wuchang is to Hankou, and what Nanshi is to Shanghai, Hanyang City is to Hankou. Wuhan is unfamiliar to me, so as soon as I got off the plane, I jumped into a rickshaw and followed the directions I was given to the residence of Mr. Jiang Xianqi on Huangpi Road, whom Mr. Su Chengde of Shanghai introduced me to. I was a bit negligent because I didn't realize that Mr. Jiang had the title of Lieutenant General in the Army until after we exchanged business cards. Speaking of lieutenant generals, according to Japanese etiquette, a commoner like me without any official position is not supposed to casually visit such an important person. If I were to request a meeting, I would have to be turned away two or three times or go through several intermediaries before I could see him. However, although Mr. Jiang Xianqi had the title of lieutenant general, he was not the kind of person who inspired awe, but rather he met me immediately with a friendly demeanor. This attitude of the Chinese people is perhaps what foreigners call Chinese-style democracy. This is not to say that China's current politics are democratic. It is very surprising that even though China has remnants of a feudal system that are more deeply rooted than in Japan, social life is filled with a more intense atmosphere of democracy than in Japan. A Chinese person once told me that they always feel a chill when approaching Japanese people, simply because of the awe-inspiring seriousness that Japanese people possess. In short, there are no class-based social customs in China that prevent ordinary people from directly contacting "noble" people, so there is an environment in which Chinese people can talk to each other directly. Japanese people do not have this kind of environment. In order to make friends with Japanese people, you have to invite them for a drink first. Only when they are drunk and forget about class etiquette will they reveal their human nature. Japanese people who haven't had three cups of sake often behave like male dogs encountering each other on the street for the first time, cautiously approaching each other with a wary attitude, using their sense of smell to test each other's strength. Chinese people, on the other hand, act the opposite when they meet each other for the first time, just like a male dog finding a female dog on the side of the road, wagging its tail and walking forward, expressing a friendly and amiable attitude. I have lived among the Chinese people for ten years, and this kind of kindness has deeply permeated my soul. This time, Mr. Jiang's whole family also welcomed me with heartfelt joy. I felt like a female dog surrounded by a group of male dogs, surrounded by an atmosphere of amiability. That night, I had a great time. I took Mr. Jiang's car to the Deming Hotel on Simin Road.

There has been no electricity in Hankou for a week. I heard that it has been raining continuously for a week. It was so cold and dark that I couldn't muster any energy, so I had to go to bed early. But at this time, a young cultural figure named Song Luohong came to visit me during my travels. The young man who swaggered into my sleeping quarters made me very happy. Mr. Song said that the articles I wrote were very popular with the people of Wuhan. I told him that it was not a good thing for a foreigner's articles to be welcomed in China. When the time comes when Chinese people can freely comment on everything in their own country, then the nonsensical articles I write will be discarded. I sincerely hope that that era will come soon. When Mr. Song heard my remarks, he seemed unable to think of an appropriate response and just stared silently at my face.

After Mr. Song left, I found it difficult to fall asleep as a guest in a foreign land, so I began to ponder alone in the darkness. The damp hotel room, permeated with moisture, was very dark, much like living in a cave in ancient times. A world without light is indeed terrifying. When humans first appeared on this world, God must have given them fire. Recently, I read the world-renowned Beijing anthropologist Dr. Pei Wenzhong's record of the lives of the Peking Man, who lived 400,000 years ago, published in the "China Journal." It said that the Peking Man used to hunt and eat each other, and even these humans had traces of fire in their caves. Perhaps it was not used for burning things, but because they were very afraid of the dark, they used it to obtain light. At that time, the deadly enemy of humans was the giant animal with sword-like teeth, the "Saber-toothed Tiger." They often attacked the Peking Man from the darkness, and with a stab of their sharp teeth, a large hole would appear in the human skull. At that time, the Peking Man, who had no other weapons to fight the enemy, could only throw stones. The only defense against the Saber-toothed Tiger was to light a fire in the cave where they lived. Wild beasts were particularly afraid of light, so the Peking Man barely escaped the Saber-toothed Tiger's attacks. Today's Chinese people are fortunate not to have the Saber-toothed Tiger's troubles, but what they cannot avoid is the disaster of the "Grain-hoarding Tiger." Someone said, "The suffering of the Chinese people is inherent." The lives of the Peking Man and modern Chinese people are filled with disasters. To avoid this kind of disaster, we need to ignite the fire of reason. — It was in this kind of contemplation that I finally spent my first night in Wuhan.

The Vitality of the Chinese People

After breakfast, I braved the fine rain and went for a walk on the street. I heard in Shanghai that Hankou was almost bombed by American planes every day, but I couldn't see any traces of bombing in the city. Emergency repairs are carried out in the bombed areas, and people continue to live happily there as before. The Chinese people are like weeds, with extremely strong vitality. No matter how you trample on them, no matter how you ravage them, they will still get up. This is truly an incomprehensible vitality. As I walked, I wondered what exactly is the essence of the Chinese people's mysterious vitality? Unknowingly, I stepped into the crowd of people gathered at the market. The morning markets in China, from the southern end to the northern end, are all the same bustling. People always hope to buy as much and as fragrant food as possible with as little money as possible, and they "bargain" with all their might. I saw a lady trying to buy a big carp from an old fisherman. The old fisherman asked for 500 yuan, while the lady offered 300 yuan, a very large difference. The old fisherman said that it had been raining every day recently and he couldn't catch any fish, so the minimum price was 450 yuan, and he wouldn't sell it for a penny less. I thought they could close the deal at 400 yuan, but it still didn't work out. Suddenly, I remembered a short story written by the great Spanish writer Blasco Ibáñez. The story was about a fisherman who had not been able to catch fish for four or five days and took his thirteen-year-old son to the sea to fish for tuna. After a great deal of effort, a big tuna finally got caught on the hook. After half an hour of focused pulling, they managed to get the fish onto the boat. Looking back, the son was missing from the boat. During the period of focusing on fighting the fish, his own son had accidentally fallen into the sea and disappeared with the raging waves. The fisherman silently rowed the boat back to the land washed by the sea. The fisherman briefly told the wife who came to greet him, and the wife just grieved silently. The fisherman was not surprised that the sea had taken his son. At the same time as the couple mourned the death of their son, they loudly argued about the price with the people from the city fish shop who came to buy the fish. The merchants tried to buy the fish as cheaply as possible, while the couple, spurred by the pain of their son's death, resolutely wanted to sell it at the highest possible price. But perhaps only the fisherman's family, who paid the price of their son's life, knew the true price of this tuna! As I thought about Ibáñez's "Fisherman" story in my mind, I stared blankly at the old fisherman's face. It was a plain, kind face of an "ordinary person" that can be seen everywhere in China. In the wrinkles of his face, although I couldn't definitely determine whether there was an expression of a son being taken away by the suppressive squad, or whether there was the "sorrow" of the whole family being scattered by the war, but in his silence, it was clear to see the fiery determination to fight without retreating a step in order to maintain the minimum level of life, and the strong vitality possessed only by those who are forced to live on the lowest survival line. I thought that this was perhaps the essence of the Chinese people's vitality, which is generally considered mysterious. Everywhere in China, there are poor people struggling on the lowest survival line. These people, no matter how their hometown is bombarded, no matter how their homes are destroyed to the point where not a single tile remains, cannot leave their homeland a step. Leaving their land is equivalent to suicide for these people. Therefore, even if the walls collapse, they plaster them with mud; even if the roof leaks, they cover it with wheat straw, and they still live there. This is the scene of the Chinese people defending their hometowns to the death. — As I thought this in my heart, I stared at the old fisherman's face again. At this time, the rain was still falling non-stop.

Salt

There are two or three salt administration warehouses in the city of Hankou. In the morning, when heavy trucks transported salt to other places, a group of poor people would rush over to pick up the scattered grains of salt. They would pick up even a grain of salt that had fallen on the road, together with the mud and dirt. Salt is such a highly valued and precious commodity in Hankou. In Hunan and Hubei, salt is the biggest problem. It is said that in the countryside, a handful of salt is sometimes used as payment for a day's short-term labor. In a country like Japan, which is surrounded by the sea, salt is as cheap as air, so I never thought that salt would become a problem. Turgenev's prose poem tells the story of a Russian landowner who went to visit a tenant farmer who had suddenly lost a son. Seeing the mother of the dead son heartily drinking the leftover vegetable soup, she was furious and said, "You can still drink vegetable soup while grieving over the death of your son!" The tenant farmer's mother replied, "What the lady says is right, but there is salt in this bowl of vegetable soup!" Anyone who does not know how precious and important salt is in Russia does not understand the meaning of this story. The main component of tears is salt. Poor people cannot cry if they do not have salt. The landowner who does not know the value of salt naturally cannot understand the true sorrow of the tenant farmer. The Greek philosopher said, "One grieves, but does not cry; one cries, but does not grieve." Therefore, the emotion of "sorrow" is perhaps excessive for peasants who cannot cry.

In ancient Rome, there was an era when salt was used as currency. The English word for salt is "Salt," and the German word is "Salz." Roman soldiers received salt instead of salary, so salary is called "Salary" and soldiers are called "Soldier" or "Soldat." But in China, especially in Hubei, although salt is not currency, it has a value that is even more precious than currency, it is the life of the people. I once asked someone, "Currency can lead those who use it to evil, so what about salt?" The answer was, "Salt is used for preservation, but in China, it is used to corrupt people." I heard that in Hankou, another incident similar to the Hou Daxun case has now occurred because of salt.

### Although Air Defense Shows Progress, Strengthening Still Requires Effort: Air Defense Headquarters Comments on Training Performance

The Shanghai Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters issued the following comments on the performance of the air defense training on the 9th of this month:

General air defense training has shown progress everywhere. People of all nationalities, including Chinese, Japanese, and foreigners, have enthusiastically participated. The headquarters is deeply impressed. The progress of the Chinese people in particular is surprising. Women have also voluntarily participated, which is enough to change the long-standing perception of the Chinese people and proves that the new Chinese citizens can truly live and die together with Japan, which is extremely moving. However, some members of the public still lack practical experience and engage in mostly impractical actions and preparations. The following is a detailed description of each item:

Facilities and Materials

There is a general feeling that facilities and materials are insufficient, and the number of tools is particularly small. Even the horizontal supports are incomplete. Furthermore, the number of safety devices such as ladder supports and ladder treads is extremely small, which is terrifying at first sight. The construction of air raid shelters also needs to be increased because air raid shelters are very reliable during actual air raids. Therefore, most air defense helmets are merely formal, consisting of a thin layer of cloth. As seen during the last air raid, when anti-aircraft artillery shrapnel was falling like rain, they would definitely be useless. Therefore, even if there are no iron helmets to wear, thick silk floss and other materials must be thickly padded inside the helmet so that it hangs down to the shoulders for protection.

Evacuation Drills

Some people lie face down in the road, which cannot protect their backs and will inevitably be injured by machine-gun fire. Therefore, it is important to immediately choose to use the terrain or objects on the ground. When walking on the road, one should consider how to select an evacuation site, and pedestrians should also actively participate in drills.

Firefighting Preparations

Attention is only paid to watering a portion of the area, but not to large-scale watering or preventing the spread of fire. Furthermore, many people only focus on passing buckets of water but neglect quick and effective individual watering drills. There is generally very little water supply. Using such a small amount of water will not actually extinguish the fire. Therefore, efforts should be made to increase water storage sites and fire prevention water tanks, constantly store water, and prevent winter freezing. Also, the number of pumps is generally very small, and their use is not perfect. It must be remembered that firefighting is the essence of civil air defense firefighting, so more attention should be paid to operational preparations.

Rescue Work

The methods of rolling bandages, using triangular bandages, and stopping bleeding are mostly clumsy, so drills must be intensified. Furthermore, emergency rescue is carried out near the fire or on the fire prevention activity route, which should be reconsidered and carried out after transporting the injured to a smaller road.

Work situation, this has not been paid much attention, and is only imitating excavation and rescue work. The preparation of tools is extremely small. One must anticipate dangerous objects such as electric wires and power lines, and the destruction of water and gas pipes, and intensify preparations and drills.

Guidance and Application

The impracticality of activities is mostly due to the guidance not being perfect. The constantly changing situation must be quickly displayed, and people must be taught how to respond quickly. If the guidance is effective, then firefighting, rescue, and work drills will be quite realistic. Currently, firefighting and rescue teams are formed by Chinese, Japanese, and foreigners. When the air defense zone is completed, the skills, number of people, level of knowledge, and age of each country should be considered. An attempt should be made to form firefighting teams with Japanese people, work teams with Chinese people, and rescue teams with foreigners, so that a complete and integrated situation is achieved. Although it is difficult to equip all the materials and finances, efforts should still be made to cooperate and maximize capabilities, and the instructors should reorganize the teams accordingly.

Light Control

The warning control is quite good, but the extinguishing equipment is still not complete, and there are still several places where light leaks out. Moving to air defense control takes three minutes. Generally speaking, the performance is quite good, but there are still forty or fifty lights leaking out. These lights provide excellent targets for enemy aircraft attacks, so efforts must be made to improve. The performance in the concession area is poor. The area north of the Suzhou River is generally good, but not perfect. Therefore, more attention must be paid. The control equipment in general households and shops is insufficient, and the performance is extremely poor, so special attention must be paid to this. However, the warning control that starts at 7:00 PM is slightly better.

The air defense organization in factories is not yet fully sufficient. The protection of important production departments, which is vital for strengthening and stabilizing the people's livelihood, has not yet been established, which is a pity.

### City Police Department Personnel Changes

He Dehui, the chief of the Old Zhabei Branch of the City Police Department, has requested to resign due to his transfer to Beijing for work. His request has been approved. The vacancy will be temporarily filled by Deputy Chief You Tian Houji. In addition, Yao Zongrui, the chief inspector of the Reward and Punishment Supervision Office of the Inspectorate, a third-class police supervisor, has served for more than 30 years and has made significant contributions. His resignation was also approved last month.

### Japanese Embassy Held Regular Press Conference Yesterday

### Joint Speech Meeting of Students in Central China Held Yesterday at the China Railway College

The third joint speech meeting for middle school students of both genders in the Central China region, sponsored by the Central China Railway Company, was grandly held yesterday (the 11th) at 1:30 PM inside the China Railway College on Qiujiang Road, Mindeli Road.

At 6:00 PM that afternoon, an award ceremony and an exchange meeting for Chinese and Japanese students were held on the sixth floor of the Xindu Hotel. Students from the Japanese Dobun Shoin were invited to attend. The award ceremony was presided over by the Vice-Chairman of the Assembly, He Zihang. In addition to the certificates from the Assembly, the Director of the Army and Navy Press Department of the Japanese side, and the Dalu Xinbao newspaper, the first-place winner was also awarded a winning flag and other prizes. The other students were also awarded prizes according to their rankings.

### Supplementary Sale of Household Coal Briquettes in Four Districts, Including North Shanghai

### News of Speakers Assisting Students: Students Aided by Various Universities Are Willing to Jointly Promote "Special Fundraising"; Hoping Each Person Will Form a Team or Combine into One

Although the results of the student aid fund "Special Fundraising Team" launched by this newspaper have been mediocre for the past ten days, the expressions of sympathy and efforts to promote it from all quarters are proceeding enthusiastically. We believe that in the near future, donations from all sectors will flow in steadily, reaching our expected target. According to Mr. Ji Chuanbao, a student liaison from the university student fellowship of this newspaper's student aid fund, who came to the office yesterday, "The students aided by various universities are deeply moved by this special fundraising and are willing to use their spare time to solicit donations from relatives, friends, or classmates to accumulate small amounts into large amounts so that the work can be completed as soon as possible." This newspaper highly commends the wishes of the assisted students and will deliver one copy each of the soon-to-be-printed "Collective Donation Signing Form" and "Fundraising Rules" to the university fellowship representatives for distribution to the assisted students, aiming for each person to solicit donations for one team. For example, if relatives and friends donate an average of 2,000 yuan each, then ten people can form a team. The collected funds will be handed over to the representatives for transfer to this office, which will issue official receipts and publish them for verification.

Exhibition Results to Be Returned Starting Today

The exhibition of academic achievements of students aided by this newspaper, after its closing, has had the achievements of each group sorted separately, and everything is ready. The primary school and middle school groups will be returned starting today. Please have each school collect them first with receipt numbers 1 to 200. Numbers 201 and above will be returned from the 15th. The specialist and university groups will also be returned to each school starting today. This exhibition has attracted many visitors, and the frequency of flipping through the displayed items inevitably led to damage and soiling of the written materials. We hope the school authorities will understand.

Zhejiang Fundraising: Bank Donates Generously

Mr. Huang Yuqi, Chairman of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, came yesterday and stated: "Respectfully, our bank's new building was completed and an opening ceremony was held on the 2nd.

Dao Yi Shi Master Holds Charity Exhibition Starting Today

Mr. Xu's Dao Yi Shi Studio has been collecting calligraphy, paintings, and cultural artifacts for over 20 years. His appraisals are precise and discerning, and he has always been highly regarded in artistic circles, but he does not easily show them to others. Now, because it is worrying that the children of poor families will drop out of school, and winter relief is urgently needed in the cold weather, he is holding a "20th Anniversary Calligraphy, Painting, and Cultural Artifacts Memorial Charity Sale." Hundreds of famous works of old masters and cultural relics are displayed at the China Book Garden at the intersection of Chengdu Road and Jingan Temple Road, from today (the 12th) to the 18th, for public exhibition. The proceeds, after deducting the cost of the venue and employee meals, will all be donated to the *Shen Bao* and *Xin Xin Bao* student loan funds and the public welfare relief programs undertaken by the two newspapers, creating blessings for the purchasing public. We hope that all sectors will widely cultivate good fortune and that society will work together to support this cause, which will also help Mr. Dao Yi Shi achieve his desire to donate out of love to rescue and assist the talented.

Zhao's Figure Exhibition: Zhao Jun, a disciple of the late famous painter Qian Yunhe, is skilled at painting figures and ladies. His attainments are quite profound, and those who obtain his works cherish them. It has now been decided to hold a solo exhibition for seven days, starting tomorrow until the 19th, at the Ningbo Association.

### Postscript to Zhu Jihua's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition

— Wuan

Mr. Zhu Jihua of Yuchuan recently held a calligraphy and painting exhibition at the China Art Gallery for the purpose of raising funds for Zhejiang Shaoxing Hospital. He exhibited more than 300 works, half calligraphy and half painting. On the one hand, he sought progress for public welfare, and on the other hand, he promoted the national art. His intentions were excellent and need no further explanation.

Mr. Zhu's paintings are mostly of flowers, bamboo, rocks, plum blossoms, and orchids, with occasional Buddhist paintings. His artistic conception and brushwork are deeply imbued with the style of Qing Teng and Bai Yang. His outstanding points have the transcendence of Nantian, but without its prettiness, and the unrestrainedness of Fuzhai, but without its vastness. The inscriptions by Ye Xihou, Zheng Wuchang, Qi Baishi, and others should be praised for this kind of art with high style and concise meaning, and those who appreciate it should also feel the same way.

Hua Guang Da Shi discussed painting plum blossoms, saying, "The brushwork must be powerful, and there must be no delay. The ink must be thick and light, and no sloppiness is allowed. The beginning of the stroke must be unrestrained, and the winding path must be deceptive." Dan Qiusheng wrote about bamboo, saying, "The bamboo trunk should be written with the seal script method, the branches with the cursive script method, the leaves with the *lishu* method, or with the Yi Gong's withdrawal method." Mr. Zhu has thoroughly understood this path, so he can fully express its wonders when painting plum blossoms and bamboo.

Calligraphy has a close relationship with the art of painting, so many painters are also skilled in calligraphy. When studying Mr. Zhu's paintings, one should also understand his calligraphy. I recommend it to all my friends, and I hope you will not think my words are wrong. I am writing this postscript after the closing of the exhibition to inform those who have not personally experienced Mr. Zhu's art.

### Shanghai Zhenxin Hospital Continues Free Clinics

Shanghai Zhenxin Hospital, located at 252 Tianjin Road, was founded in the summer of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938). It has 60 beds, without any distinction of class. In the past, it temporarily organized free clinics every summer and autumn, specializing in the treatment of epidemic diseases. Whether for outpatient or inpatient care, all medical expenses, meals, and accommodation were completely free. No introduction was needed, and no money was charged. It has been enthusiastically supported by people from all walks of life and maintained until now. This year, with the soaring prices, medical expenses are even more alarming. In order to assist patients who are unable to pay, the hospital will continue to provide free clinics. Except for surgery, which does not have the necessary equipment, the hospital specializes in internal medicine (excluding lung diseases, venereal diseases, and acute infectious diseases such as meningitis and scarlet fever), and it is still completely free and does not charge any money. Impoverished patients should take note of this.

### Responding to the Office's Six Relief Efforts

Mr. Su Zijia wrote a letter saying: "Respectfully, the Social Services Office of your newspaper is holding various charitable activities, and its enthusiasm for public welfare is admirable. Although I am just a businessman, I should do my best to support local good deeds. I hereby donate all of my travel expenses from the Oil and Grain Control Committee from August 15th to the end of October, totaling 12,500 Central Reserve Bank notes, to your office's six relief efforts, expressing my meager sincerity. I have attached a check. Please accept it."

### Ferry Boat Industry Plans to Establish Free School

In recent years, transportation on both sides of the Huangpu River in this city has made progress in traffic safety equipment under the guidance of the ferry boat union and the rowboat workers' union. Now that the industry union, in view of the soaring prices, which affect the studies of school-age children, has taken a step to serve the society, it has submitted a proposal to the sixth joint meeting of directors and supervisors to establish free primary schools, completely free of charge. It has also appointed a preparatory committee of fifteen people, including Yao Jinxiang, Liu Xianglin, and Zhang Zhan. We have also heard that the union, within its capabilities, may also establish welfare undertakings such as scholarship funds and clinics.

### Filial Piety Does Not Wane

Mr. Huang Zhuojun wrote a letter saying: "Respectfully, the 12th of this month is the first anniversary of the death of my late mother (Madam He Peifang). Recalling my late mother's lifelong love of benevolence, it is a pity that she was always limited by her ability, which she considered a regret. Therefore, on the anniversary of her death, I am sending 10,000 national currency notes, asking that 5,000 yuan be allocated to the nursing home and 5,000 yuan be used for winter clothing and gruel distribution, to continue my late mother's legacy and to commemorate her."

### Xujiahui Library's Book Purchase Donation Campaign

The Xujiahui Catholic Church Library, founded in 1847, is the earliest and largest library in Shanghai, with a collection of more than 300,000 Chinese and Western books and more than 2,800 local chronicles of various provinces, prefectures, and counties. The *Shen Bao* newspaper from the first issue to today is completely intact. However, since the Incident, it has suffered from a lack of funds, and many rare books have been missed. Therefore, from December 1st to the end of December, a donation campaign was launched with a target of 2 million yuan to fund book purchases. Considering that there is no shortage of cultural enthusiasts in Shanghai, we deeply hope that they will generously donate and complete this beautiful endeavor so that the library can purchase more books, preserve our country's culture, and pass it on to future generations. The sincerity of this is a prayer. We will collect the donations on behalf of the library.
