### Order for American Nationals in Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi to Evacuate

Chongqing, 3rd (Central News Agency): According to a dispatch from Chongqing, the American Embassy in Chongqing, feeling threatened by the active advances of Japanese forces in southeastern China, has issued a special order for the rapid evacuation of 50 American nationals residing in northern Yunnan Province, western Guangxi Province, and eastern Guizhou Province.

### Loss of Air Bases in China by U.S. Forces Significantly Impacts the War Situation; Kunming and Chengdu Are Now Threatened

A Certain Base on the China Front, 3rd (Central News Agency): All positions of the U.S. Air Force in southwestern China have collapsed due to the Japanese army's advances. The U.S. Air Force has been forced to retreat to Kunming and Chengdu, and these locations are now also under significant threat. The future actions of the U.S. Air Force are a matter of great concern.

The U.S. 14th Air Force, primarily linking Kunming and the Guilin area, established a chain of extended bases along the coast in an attempt to attack the Japanese mainland. Since the deployment of B-29s in Chongqing in April of this year, this plan has become more aggressive. Despite General Chennault's boastful remarks, his plan has ultimately failed, and the focus of his mission has now shifted to the following three points: (1) acting as the vanguard for the 20th Air Force; (2) disrupting maritime supply lines; and (3) creating disturbances in peaceful areas of China.

An even more important mission is to support the U.S. military's supreme strategy for a counteroffensive against Japan in the Pacific. The Japanese army's current offensive on the mainland has thwarted this enemy plan, launching massive attacks in North, Central, and South China, and establishing a strategic advantage of absolute superiority.

As a result of this operation, the U.S. military, with its forward bases in full retreat, has had all of its missions blocked, suffering military pressure. The U.S. 14th Air Force has therefore completely lost its value. This can be pointed out in the following two ways: (1) the loss of the forward function has isolated the 20th Bomber Command; and (2) the retreat of forward bases has thwarted coastal operations. The enemy has long been aware of the dangers of B-29s bombing the Japanese mainland from bases in China. Pressure from the Japanese army on inland bases in Chongqing will inevitably intensify. In particular, the recent Japanese strategy aims to destroy the enemy's war effort, both materially and psychologically. As the enemy actively attempts to bomb the Japanese mainland, the Japanese military's suppression of enemy bases is the most satisfying blow. The thwarting of coastal plans has forced the U.S. Air Force to change its strategy, which has had a significant impact on the overall war situation.

### Chinese Nationalist Party's Message to the People: Uphold Chairman's Legacy

On January 9th of the thirty-second year [1943], the National Government entered the war, clearly showing the country that only by sharing the responsibility of East Asia can we save ourselves from destruction. In the past, we must not be arrogant, and from now on, we must not abandon ourselves. Through years of effort, coupled with the determination to live and die with our allies, we can reclaim concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. Our Premier's dying instructions have now been concretely realized.

Looking back over the past twenty years, our Chairman has worried and toiled, running around and appealing for help, never finding peace, all for the sake of the suffering masses, the fragmented land, and the turbulent East Asia! We still remember last October, when China and Japan abolished the basic relationship treaty and revised the alliance treaty. Those who previously had doubts about the country's freedom and unity should now be relieved. The issue of troop withdrawal has also been directly resolved, even abolishing the right to station troops under the Boxer Protocol.

Having obtained these conditions for just peace after defeat, what more can we ask for if we continue to work towards restoration? It was unexpected that the Chongqing side was repeatedly deceived at the Cairo Conference, and has been following this path ever since. Imperialists have turned against us, initially making things difficult, then oppressing us, and are about to implement their fourth phase of direct control, abandoning us and then controlling us. This is because England and America do not love China; they love to use it as a sacrifice. Once the degree of exploitation is exhausted, why regret abandoning it? Once the cunning plan of sacrifice has been sold, why hesitate to control us?

Recently, the attitude of England and America towards Chongqing has deteriorated daily. It is not that their love and hatred have changed, but that the ugly faces of aggressors are inherently like this. Alas! We are the fish on the chopping board, the pain of a nation's demise and the worry of extinction have been evident in various facts for years. Will we turn a blind eye and sink into the unrecoverable hell? Or will we rise together and free ourselves? I hope my compatriots will think deeply about this.

Since the peace movement began, there have been many hardships and setbacks, but the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty and the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration offer hope for the realization of Pan-Asianism. After the Premier's death, our Chairman led the anti-aggression struggle. All my comrades and compatriots should continue to uphold his legacy and carry it through to the end.

### The More Intense Our Struggles, the Closer We Are to Victory

All that has been said above is a historical account of the internal and external struggles of the past twenty years. At the First National Congress, Third Plenary Session, our party accepted the Premier's will and solemnly declared, "Our entire party will unanimously carry out the Premier's instructions and will not create anything new." The New Life Movement Outline personally drafted by our Chairman also clearly stated, "We will not promote a different ideology." We have "the Three Principles of the People as the foundation for building the Republic of China." All my comrades and compatriots must see the path of the peace movement as increasingly bright and correct. Our Chairman has dedicated his life to upholding the Premier's instructions, and what he has left to our country and nation can be said to be without regret!

What we cannot forget is that peaceful unification has not yet been realized, and the completion of the Greater East Asia War still requires effort. This is the responsibility of those who come after! This is also the process by which our Chairman inherited the Premier's leadership of the revolution. With the Chairman's lifelong dedication to the national revolution and his loyalty to Premier Sun Yat-sen, all his instructions are based on the Premier's legacy. He ensured that all misunderstandings and distortions were not used as pretexts, and that the fundamental spirit was advanced and utilized more effectively with the progress of the times. We must follow this purpose, adhere to the Premier's instructions, uphold the Chairman's legacy, be single-minded and avoid detours, and bravely advance to final success.

At this time of crisis and bitter struggle, we have also encountered the Chairman's passing. Comrades of our party should examine themselves, and the people of the whole country should reflect and take responsibility. We must know that the destiny of the nation lies in the self-determination of the people. Without the ability to be self-reliant internally, there is no qualification to coexist externally. In terms of self-reliance, we must enrich the people's strength and develop the country's strength to the best of our ability. In terms of coexistence, we must fulfill all the obligations that should be fulfilled in order to enjoy the rights that should be enjoyed.

The most important thing today is sincere unity, and the most urgent tasks are to complete the war, promote unification, and eradicate the communist scourge. Only through the unity of the entire party can we concentrate outstanding combat cadres and establish the central revolutionary force. Only through national unity can we achieve true unification and eliminate the crisis of partition. Only through the unity of China and Japan, and the unity of East Asia, can we resist external violence and seek internal coexistence, and then world peace can be established.

Bureaucracy is a germ that erodes the revolutionary spirit and hinders democratic forces. Our party must do its utmost to eradicate it. Corrupt politics is a toxin that directly harms people's livelihoods and indirectly creates the communist scourge. Our party must do its utmost to eliminate it. During the war, hardship is unavoidable, but roaming bandits destroy production, unscrupulous merchants hoard and manipulate prices, and harsh taxes exploit the people. All of these are man-made sufferings. Our party must do its utmost to alleviate them.

Hatred of neighbors and flattery of foreigners is the slavish mentality of defeatists. Our party must do its utmost to eradicate it. Peaceful unification is the ladder to national salvation. Our party must do its utmost to promote it. The Greater East Asia War is the first step in revitalizing China and protecting Asia. Our party must do its utmost to complete it. The alliance treaty is the foundation of Sino-Japanese peace, and the joint declaration is the guideline for East Asian co-prosperity. Our party must do its utmost to implement them, ensuring that every word is realized. The more urgent the world changes, the more intense our struggles, and the closer we are to victory.

Looking back, although time passes quickly, every struggle has led to progress. Looking forward, the freedom and equality of China and the independence and liberation of East Asia are already in sight. With one heart and one mind, we must strive forward and overcome difficulties together. The spirit of the Chairman in heaven will surely watch over us. (End of full text)

### Editorial: The Necessary Vigilance and Reflection

Recently, Mr. Tokutomi Soho wrote an article in the Mainichi Shimbun entitled "Expectations for the Leadership Class," in which he pointed out many undesirable phenomena exhibited by the "leadership class." In China, these issues can be said to be extremely serious. The politics of the Allied nations, in terms of both institutions and personnel, are well-organized and naturally much healthier than China's. Even with such healthy governance in the Allied nations, Mr. Tokutomi still felt the need to write an article to encourage further progress. How much more should our country, with its many institutional and personnel shortcomings, be vigilant and reflective!

What Mr. Tokutomi said that is subject to criticism is the so-called "job-selling elements" in the leadership class. There is no need to hide that among the officials in China's leadership class, there are certainly many who can follow the will of the founding father, but there are obviously too many who are incompetent or even derelict in their duties. We can divide the incompetent elements among the officials in China's leadership class into three types, some of whom may possess multiple characteristics.

The first type is those who are "powerful and domineering." They "lack enthusiasm, seriousness, spirit, and other qualities" in their work, but when they put up a facade, they have an awe-inspiring air. The so-called "being an official means being imposing" is their spirit as officials. How can such unapproachable people lead others? Moreover, those who take advantage of their power may even commit all kinds of wrongdoing. If they are displeased, they may even hold the power of life and death over others' lives and property. We have seen this type of official in the past, and we cannot guarantee that they do not exist now. They are not only derelict in their duties, but they are also breaking the law.

The second type is those who "disregard the country's noble goals, disregard the nation's survival, prosperity, and decline, and only seek to enrich themselves." They only know their own interests and do not care about the interests of the country and the nation. They often use their positions to abuse private power, favor their own people, manipulate things from above and below, engage in corruption and bribery, and fill their own pockets. As long as they can gain something for themselves, they do not care how much they harm the interests of the country or even affect its survival, prosperity, and decline. The pursuit of fame and fortune is their purpose as officials. This type of official is very common in all political levels in China, and they should bear a great responsibility for China's chaotic state of affairs. The importance of China's work in eliminating corruption lies here.

The third type is those who "are indifferent to crises and difficulties, perfunctorily fulfill their responsibilities, go with the flow, and are parasites who eat the emperor's salary and enjoy the country's benefits." Their style of work is what is known in China as "doing just enough to get by each day." They are merely concerned with seeking peace of mind and are often perfunctory in handling official matters. The better ones may only adopt the principle of "not seeking merit, but seeking no fault." Although they may not be doing evil, it is clear that they will not achieve anything. These officials believe that they are innocent of any crime against the country, but in reality, taking the country's salary without doing anything of value for the country, especially in the current wartime situation, is equivalent to being guilty.

What we need now are leaders who are enthusiastic about the country and the nation and possess a spirit of sacrifice. We must remove the evil elements who rely on their power to be domineering and enrich themselves, as well as the mediocre elements who seek temporary safety and comfort and should be leading others but are instead being led. We hope that those in power will reflect deeply on this.

### Ministry of Construction to Handle Applications for Permits for Shipping Merchants

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency): The Ministry of Construction has specially formulated measures for handling applications for permits for shipping merchants, which were promulgated and implemented by a ministerial order on December 1st.

### Military and Civilians Unite to Achieve the Goal of Eliminating Opium: Minister Mei's Talk on the Opium Prohibition Issue

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency): On the 2nd, the Supreme National Defense Conference held a temporary meeting, at which it was decided that matters relating to the prohibition of opium in the 34th year [1945] would be overseen by the Military Affairs Commission. In order to understand the past situation of opium prohibition and Minister Mei's thoughts on this measure, a reporter from the Central News Agency made a special trip to inquire yesterday afternoon. Minister Mei received them and answered their questions as follows:

(Question) The Ministry of Interior has been handling opium prohibition for eight months. What is the general situation of the work done in the past? (Answer) The past work of the Ministry of Interior on opium prohibition can be divided into three points: (1) phased abstinence. In accordance with the government's opium prohibition plan, the total number of opium addicts was reduced by one-fifth, but since the Ministry began handling this issue eight months ago, it has already reduced the total number of opium addicts by 70-80%. This has exceeded the central government's regulations. The biggest reason for this is that the allocation of government land has gradually decreased, and the number of opium addicts has also greatly decreased. Therefore, it is expected that the intended goal will be achieved in mid-April.

(2) Registration of opium addicts. Except for the three provinces of Hubei, Jiangxi, and Hunan, where registration started later due to inconvenient transportation and no reports on the registration of opium addicts have been received, registration in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as in the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, ended on August 30th. Although the total number of registered opium addicts has not been determined, in the areas under the jurisdiction of these three provinces and two cities, 80-90,000 opium addicts out of 100,000 have applied for registration. The 10-20% of opium addicts who have not registered are mostly those who are unaware of the government's opium prohibition orders and are evading them. However, opium addicts who have not registered will be punished according to the law once they are found.

(3) Opium cessation. The Ministry has entrusted the Department of Health to organize opium cessation, and the expenses are paid by the Ministry. The Department of Health has worked very hard since taking over this task. In addition to establishing opium cessation hospitals in Nanjing and Shanghai in September, it has also ordered public and private hospitals in various provinces and cities to begin handling opium cessation work, which has achieved good results. (Question) After the opium prohibition matter is taken over by the Military Affairs Commission, what greater effect will it have on opium prohibition? (Answer) Opium prohibition cannot be completed independently. It must be carried out jointly by the military and police in order to achieve the goal of opium prohibition. Now that the opium prohibition matter is under the jurisdiction of the Military Affairs Commission, the military and police will be able to cooperate and promote it further, and the results will be more significant than in the past. (Question) What were the root causes of past failures, and what should be paid attention to in order to achieve success in the future? (Answer) There are many reasons for the failure of opium prohibition in the past, but the root cause is mostly related to politics. Before the incident, opium prohibition was commonly practiced in all provinces, but the provinces that achieved the best results were Jiangsu and Zhejiang, because these two provinces were truly committed to opium prohibition. Therefore, I believe that the most important thing in handling opium prohibition matters in the future is to handle them with the concept of not being corrupt, and then the opium prohibition policy will be promoted smoothly.

### Secretary-General Lin Instructs Youth to Cooperate in Drug Prohibition

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency): The Supreme National Defense Conference decided to vigorously promote the opium prohibition plan and transfer the opium prohibition agency to the Military Affairs Commission. The Chinese Youth League Inspector and Chinese Youth Model League Secretary-General Lin Baisheng, on the anniversary of the 12/7 Movement, specially instructed members of the Youth League and the Youth Model League to follow the government's intentions and lead the people under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, not to be depressed or superficial, but to use the most disciplined, organized, and planned actions to gather social forces as a backing for the government to make opium prohibition a success. Briefly speaking, the actual situation of opium prohibition since last October 27th, the anniversary of the anti-drug movement, will soon arrive, and the government's implementation of the opium prohibition plan over the past year should be paid attention to by youth comrades across the country. The implementation plan for next year is of even greater concern to young people across the country.

I still remember last year when the anti-drug movement broke out in the capital, our leader was about to undergo surgery to remove a bullet from his back. The leader, who always cared for young people like a loving father and strict teacher to his children, was very concerned about the safety of the young people after receiving the report that the capital's youth had launched an anti-drug movement. He stayed up late into the night waiting for reports. Two weeks later, his health improved slightly, and he handled government affairs. He said that the top priority in eliminating drugs and prohibiting opium was to combine political and social forces and actively promote it. When there were dangerous words that slandered our youth's anti-drug movement, the leader rebuked them with tears in his eyes, "If we revolutionaries do not guide young people to work hard and fight, will we join corrupt officials, corrupt merchants, and evil bullies and sit idly by as the country is destroyed and the race is exterminated!" His words were so painful.

In October, I represented the youth comrades and served the leader beside his sickbed in Nagoya Hospital. I personally received his teachings. The leader inquired about "the suffering of the people" and what he expected of "young comrades." What he cared about was "saving the country through drug prohibition." A few words were repeated and repeated, and they are still deeply imprinted in my mind. Now that the anti-drug movement is about to reach its first anniversary, the leader has abandoned us. After this mourning, how should we carry out the leader's legacy to comfort the leader's spirit in heaven?

### Carrying on the Legacy and Eliminating Opium and Drugs

Since the leader's death, Acting Chairman Chen has inherited the leader's chairmanship of the country and completed the leader's unfinished ambitions during his lifetime. On the day he took office, Acting Chairman Chen immediately announced to the people that he would resolutely implement the leader's policies and measures and would make great determination to thoroughly carry out the leader's unfinished business. This time, the Supreme National Defense Conference decided to continue to implement the opium prohibition plan designated by the leader in the past, and in order to promote it quickly and forcefully, the opium prohibition agency was transferred to the Military Affairs Commission, with Chen, the acting chairman, concurrently serving as the opium prohibition director-general. This shows the government's determination to carry out the leader's legacy, and Acting Chairman Chen's loyalty to the leader, courage to take responsibility, and sincerity in planning for the country, as well as his dedication to his duties, can serve as a model for young people across the country.

### Enemy Planes Attacking Tokyo Shot Down Five

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency): The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 6:40 PM on the 3rd: Around 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, about ten enemy B-29s came from the Mariana Islands to the suburbs of Tokyo.

### American Prisoners of War Treated Humanely in Japan and Germany

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency): According to a Washington dispatch, a senior member of the U.S. House of Representatives Army Affairs Committee issued a lengthy report on the treatment of prisoners of war in Japan and Germany. The main points are as follows: In general, American prisoners of war in Germany are treated humanely. Germany is a country that has signed the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, so it can provide satisfactory treatment in accordance with the convention. Although Japan has not signed the convention, it generally abides by its provisions. According to the Swiss representative stationed in Japan, the materials provided by Japan to American prisoners of war are even better than those of the general public.

### Soviet Army Launches Encirclement Offensive Against Hungary

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency): The Ha Tong News Agency reports: The Soviet army's goal on the Eastern Front seems to be to encircle western Hungary, with Budapest as the final target. Pressuring Slovakia from the north and east is also for this purpose. The troops in the southeast of Hungary have been greatly reduced, as most of the Soviet troops have been transferred to the confluence of the Treva River and the Danube River. Fierce battles have taken place on the Bašoštic-Kapošvár line. It is not yet known whether the enemy's actions on the Treva River will advance towards the Austrian border or turn south towards Lake Balaton and approach Budapest.

### German Army Launches Large-Scale Counteroffensive on the Western Front

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency): A historically unprecedented large-scale material battle is currently unfolding on the Western Front, centered on Aachen. The German army had previously adopted a defensive posture to replenish its forces, but suddenly launched a counteroffensive on December 1st. According to a dispatch from a reporter accompanying the German Western Front Headquarters, the German army suddenly launched a large-scale counteroffensive in the Aachen area. The German battle group has broken into the Linich-Lendielin-Ganor triangle area in recent days, and the rear of several anti-axis troops has been cut off, and the American army has lost its retreat. The U.S. Third Army under Patton in the Saar region has made no progress. Although the U.S. army is approaching the Saar region in Metz, they are fighting in the middle of the Maginot Line in the area between Saarlautern and Metz, southwest of Forbach, and south of Saarlautern. However, the attacks of the U.S. army in the area have completely collapsed due to contact with German mines and intense crossfire.

### Japanese Air Force Launches Strong Attack on Enemy Convoy in Leyte Gulf; Enemy Supply Line in Northern Leyte Island Cut Off

Philippines, 3rd (Central News Agency): The U.S. military is currently working hard on relief efforts to facilitate the land operations on Leyte Island. In response, the Japanese air force has been launching fierce attacks on enemy ships and enemy bases for days, achieving the following results: (1) On the evening of the 29th, a fierce bombing raid on the enemy transport fleet in Leyte Gulf sank one ship. (2) On the 30th, the enemy transport ships east of Leyte Gulf were surrounded and attacked fiercely. On the 30th, a strong raid was launched on Tanoman, east of Tacloban airfield on Leyte Island, hitting enemy ground facilities with huge bombs.

Philippines, 3rd (Central News Agency): The Japanese air force has been launching strong attacks on enemy torpedo boat groups in the waters surrounding Leyte Island for days, achieving great results. On the night of the 29th, an attack was launched on several enemy torpedo boats in Leyte Gulf, sinking two of them. On the night of the 30th, an attack was launched on enemy small ships in the Carigara Bay area, sinking five and destroying three. On December 1st, four enemy torpedo boats were discovered near Polillo Island and sunk after a fierce attack. On the same day and night, a surprise attack was launched on a torpedo boat army in Leyte Gulf, sinking and destroying two of them.

Manila, 3rd (Central News Agency): The enemy troops in Managa Snas and Cabuquen have had their rear cut off by the Japanese army, and their land supplies of grain, ammunition, and troops have now been completely cut off. The morale of the American soldiers has been extremely low in recent days. The enemy at Managa Snas has been forced into a narrow area behind them, and a part of the enemy's 32nd Division, which was reinforcing them, was captured by the Japanese army due to breaking into a gap in the Japanese army's encirclement, and their supplies were also cut off. In addition, the Japanese army's artillery concentrated its firepower and destroyed many of its tanks. The enemy is threatened by Japanese commando teams day and night, and the enemies under siege are extremely exhausted, and those who are fleeing into the mountains to the west are constantly leaving.

### Prices Still Fluctuating, Awaiting Stringent Measures; Power Outages at Factories Affect Speculation and Price Manipulation

Although the trend of commodity prices in the city last week was under strict supervision by the authorities, there were still sharp fluctuations, especially in daily necessities such as rice, fuel, cooking oil, salt, and cotton and woolen textiles. Therefore, the citizens of the whole city are deeply concerned about the overall price issue in the future and unanimously hope that the authorities will take the most stringent measures to thoroughly stabilize the buying and selling situation of all industries, strictly enforce the approved standard price limits, otherwise, the people's suffering will not be alleviated. At the same time, extortion and other situations urgently need to be investigated and dealt with in order to reduce the burden on merchants and people.

### Overview of Finance, Industry and Commerce Last Week

The market situation in finance, industry and commerce in the city was still volatile last week. Incited by rumors in the speculative market, many people were searching for goods to hoard and speculate. In the financial aspect, the interest rate for red half-election (a type of financial instrument) was still stable in the first half of the week, but suddenly rose sharply in the second half of the week. Bullish traders were absorbing stocks diligently, and large investors were active, so the market rebounded from weakness on Thursday and Friday, and popular stocks saw peaks. Among them, buying picked up again because the money supply seemed to be moving, and the official interest rate for interbank lending remained at 5%, but the unofficial interest rates for interbank lending mostly increased.

In terms of industry and commerce, many factories in various industries, such as textile factories, were mostly stopping production due to electricity problems. Cigarette factories were also shortening their operating hours. Other silk factories and dyeing factories were also affected by electricity difficulties, which affected people's confidence. Speculators took the opportunity to manipulate prices to rise. The prices of goods in the retail shops of various companies and businesses secretly increased. Rice, miscellaneous grains, and daily necessities still saw rising trends, especially cigarettes, which rose the most sharply. Therefore, the authorities are also closely investigating and dealing with this.

### Regulations on Air Raid Measures for Rickshaws

Police Bureau Decides on Two Measures

The police defense department of the city's police bureau found that, in addition to the existing ox and horse-drawn carts in the city, various military vehicles pulled by oxen and horses had suddenly appeared, and the number was increasing daily. If these livestock were to encounter unexpected situations such as sudden explosions, they would become frightened and uncontrollable. At this time, the danger to the drivers would be obvious, and pedestrians would also be in danger of accidents. Therefore, two air raid measures have been formulated to prevent problems before they occur. The measures are: (1) When an air raid alarm is issued, vehicles pulled by livestock such as oxen and horses should quickly move to the side of the road to wait. The livestock should be detached from the vehicle, and their heads and front feet should be tightly bound with strong hemp ropes to prevent them from rushing around. (2) Vehicle owners should assign people to guard the livestock such as oxen and horses during air raid alarms to prevent them from rushing around. In addition to ordering the heads of each sub-bureau to inform vehicle owners and urge them to pay attention to the above measures, the Public Utilities Bureau is also requested to add the two measures to the license regulations so that offenders can be punished according to the regulations.

### French Concession Water and Electricity Company Urges Protection of Water Pipes

The Shanghai French Concession Tram and Electric Light Company recently stated to the public that Article 13 of the contract signed between the company and the tap water users stipulates that "users shall be responsible for the repair of water meters damaged by freezing, and the company shall not be responsible for the cost of repairs. In cold winter days, users should properly wrap the water meter box with straw, and close the main valve at night to prevent water from accumulating in the pipes to avoid freezing and cracking." Now that the severe cold has arrived, all users should pay special attention to the above regulations and take necessary measures to prevent unexpected losses.

### Education Bureau Calls Private University Presidents for Symposium to Discuss Registration and Tuition Issues

The City Education Bureau held a symposium for the presidents of private universities and colleges in the city at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association at 3:00 PM yesterday (2nd). The symposium was attended by Director Dai Yingfu of the Education Bureau, the Director of the Ministry of Education, President Zheng of Shanghai University, President Hu of Aurora University, President Gu of Tongde Medical College, and 13 other representatives. The symposium discussed university improvement issues, the registration and tuition issues of private universities, and the special allocation issues for faculty and staff. The meeting lasted for three hours.

### Price-Controlled Cigarettes Have Disappeared

Since the implementation of rationing of cigarettes in the city, the aim has been to eliminate the black market and suppress prices. Unexpectedly, in the past four months, price-controlled cigarettes have disappeared. Regardless of the size of the cigarette, retailers unanimously refuse to sell them, while the cigarette black market has become active. This not only increases the burden on citizens, but also undermines the rationing system. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will find a way to control it.

### When Filling in Moving Forms, New Street Names Should Be Written

Most of the street names in the city (only one or two districts) were changed by the authorities from the National Day last year. Because the general public has too deep an impression of the old street names, they often write the old street names when filling in documents and applying for moving certificates. It is now known that when citizens fill in household registration moving forms or applications for residence certificates to replace citizen certificates, they must fill in the current new street names. Otherwise, all Baojia offices will not accept them and will return the original documents. It is hoped that all sectors of the public will pay attention to this.

### 8th China News Reader Scholarship Special Fundraising Team

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Marshal Hata, the outgoing Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, and General Okamura, the incoming Commander-in-Chief, delivered separate farewell and inaugural speeches on the afternoon of the 3rd, as follows:

Marshal Hata's Farewell Address

I am now under orders to transfer to another post. I bid farewell to the officers and soldiers of the Expeditionary Force, with whom I have shared joys and hardships on the battlefield for many years, as well as to all the beloved Chinese and Japanese military and civilian officials. I also leave behind tens of thousands of heroic spirits in the mountains and rivers where we fought, and I am filled with immeasurable emotion and sorrow at this parting. Looking back over the past three years and nine months of my tenure, I have been able to shoulder this heavy responsibility with my limited abilities and strive to carry out my mission thanks to the divine protection under His Majesty and the pure loyalty and sincerity of all the officers and soldiers. I express my heartfelt gratitude for this. Moreover, I am deeply grateful for the assistance given by various circles in both China and Japan. As the global war situation becomes increasingly critical, there is no time more important than now for China and Japan to work together and unite. Therefore, I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life in China and Japan will further strengthen their solidarity and give full play to their abilities to strive for the successful completion of the Greater East Asia War. The new Commander-in-Chief, General Okamura, is known for his outstanding reputation, maturity, and experience. I am confident that he will be able to shoulder this important task, and I sincerely hope that all parties will provide him with much assistance in the future. As I bid farewell to the mountains and rivers of the mainland and return east, I recall the hardships of the soldiers on the front lines, and I wish them ever greater military success. At the same time, I wish our allied country, China, eternal prosperity and tranquility for its 400 million people.

General Okamura's Inaugural Address

I am deeply honored and grateful to have been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Force, and to assume the important role of leading the Chinese Expeditionary Force, which has achieved such glorious military exploits.

The former Commander-in-Chief, Marshal Hata, possesses a noble and refined personality and is a general of profound knowledge and insight. His reputation is well-known both internally and externally, and he is admired and respected by all officers and soldiers. In particular, since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, he has worked tirelessly day and night to guide the destruction of the American forces on the mainland, devoting himself to his command responsibilities. He also personally visited the front lines and captured key strategic locations such as Luoyang, Liuzhou, and Guilin. He received imperial messages of commendation, enhancing his reputation both internally and externally. I am deeply honored to inherit Marshal Hata's great achievements.

Now, the world situation is becoming increasingly critical, and we stand at a pivotal moment for the rise and fall of East Asia. I, with utmost reverence, accept this important responsibility and vow to exert myself to the utmost, leading the entire army to continue the Expeditionary Force's tradition of certain victory. With the unity of the entire army forged like steel, we will resolutely strive to defeat the enemy Americans. At the same time, we will further strengthen cooperation with China, aiming to create a unified front between the Chinese and Japanese military and civilians to accomplish the sacred war objectives and fulfill the Imperial will.

### Japanese Troops Along the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway Continuously Defeat Retreating Chongqing Troops - Japanese Air Force Takes Off in the Rain to Bombard

Chinese Front Line Base, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Guizhou-Guangxi Railway is the only escape route for the defeated Chongqing troops in the Guangxi area. American Air Force personnel and troops of the Chongqing Fourth War Zone are continuously retreating along this railway. In order to influence the pursuit by Japanese ground forces, the Japanese Air Force has launched attacks on the train convoys, causing frequent reductions in the densely packed Chongqing troops and destroying railway bridges to cut off the Chongqing troops' retreat route. Since the start of the pursuit battle along the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway, the weather in that area has been extremely bad. The Japanese Air Force braved the heavy rain in the battle area and dared to take off first, using new reconnaissance aircraft to take pictures along the railway. Relying on the reconnaissance aircraft, they made precise investigations of the activities of the retreating Chongqing troops, trains, automobiles, and material storage locations. They used these investigation reports as a guide for attacks, dispatching dive bomber squadrons. When necessary, they also dispatched direct descent aircraft squadrons for low-altitude reconnaissance. On the rainy days of November 17th and 18th, dive bomber squadrons, flying at extraordinarily low altitudes near Jinchengjiang, launched fierce bombing attacks on more than 100 vehicles of seven trains fully loaded with personnel and equipment, cutting off the railway. The army aviation team received two awards from the supreme aviation commander after this great victory. The team continued to launch relentless bombing attacks on the Chongqing troops. On November 29th, they bombed the railway bridge near Dushan, achieving a great victory twice as large as previous battles. Furthermore, the Japanese direct descent units, braving the sporadic activities of the American Air Force, took off to scout the enemy's situation and carried out attacks at any time. Especially on the 29th and 30th, they repeatedly bombed and strafed the large forces of Chongqing troops concentrated on the railway between Nandan and Dushan, inflicting great damage. Due to the fierce activities of the Japanese reconnaissance, direct descent, and bomber squadrons, the Chongqing troops, who were retreating along the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway, have been severely hit and are on the verge of collapse.
