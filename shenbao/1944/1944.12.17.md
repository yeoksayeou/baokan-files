### Nanjing Branch of the New Association Holds Inaugural Meeting

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Nanjing branch of the China News Association held its inaugural meeting at the Chinese Students Association of Japan in Nanjing at 3:00 PM on the 15th. Members of the Nanjing branch attended. Representatives from various news agencies including the Central News Agency, the Republic of China Daily, the Central Daily News, the Beijing Daily, the Wuhu New News, the Anhui New News, the Anqing New News, and the New Anhui Daily were present. From the head office, Vice President Guo and Executive Director Wu attended. Guests included Chief Huang and Chief Wu from the Propaganda Department, Section Chief Zhou from the Propaganda Office, and Chief of Intelligence An from the Japanese Embassy, among others, totaling several dozen people.

After formal greetings, Central News Agency Vice President Hu was elected as the temporary chairman. The chairman delivered a speech explaining the significance of the establishment of the new association, which aims to break down barriers and personal biases, unite efforts, and jointly complete the reporting mission during the decisive battle. After the speech, Mr. Qin Moxun, the president of the Republic of China Daily, reported on the preparatory work and revised and approved the branch's organizational charter. Subsequently, directors and supervisors were elected, including: Director candidates: Cha Shiji, representing the Central News Agency; Qin Moxun, representing the Republic of China Daily; Zhang Shenzhi, representing the Central Daily News; Nishijima Goichi, representing the Nanjing Continental New News; Liu Dexuan, representing the Anhui Daily; Cao Jianzheng, representing the Wuhu New News; and a vacant position representing the Huaihai Daily. Supervisor candidates: Xu Puzhai, representing the Beijing Daily; and a vacant position representing the Xuzhou Continental New News.

After the election of directors and supervisors, guests delivered speeches successively. It was generally believed that the establishment of the Nanjing branch of the China News Association would not only strengthen the close ties between the press in Nanjing, but also further fulfill the reporting mission of conveying information from above to below and from below to above. At the same time, the China News Association is a joint organization of Chinese and Japanese newspapers, so the Chinese and Japanese press can further strengthen their close cooperation. Subsequently, Vice President Guo, in his capacity as a representative of the head office, stood up and delivered a speech, stating that since the establishment of the China News Association, regional branches have been established one after another, and the organization has become increasingly sound. At this critical time of decisive battle, we deeply feel that the work of the press is indeed difficult. We often feel insufficient materials, while the need for work is increasing. In this dilemma where one side is insufficient and the other side is in need, we can only achieve success by using the most economical means to achieve the most satisfactory results. The so-called most economical means is to strive for the rationalization of people, not only in management, but also in the development of new areas, we should also strive for its rationalization, and then we can live up to the mission of the journalists in this great era. Please use this to wish everyone effort and struggle.

After the closing of the general meeting, all members took a group photo, and then continued to hold the first joint meeting of directors and supervisors. It was decided to elect the personnel of the Nanjing branch, including Director Qin Moxun and Executive Directors Zhang Shenzhi, Cha Shiji, and Nishijima Goichi. The draft budget of the branch was also decided. The meeting ended at around 6:00 PM, and all members dispersed after dinner.

### Travelogue: Resources and Development in North China (II)

Wu Gong

(III) North China Development Company

Since the incident, the heavy responsibility of developing the above-mentioned resources has fallen into the hands of the North China Development Company. According to its stated purpose, the so-called "North China Development Co., Ltd." is based on the principle of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, excluding the uncontrolled development of capital, making rational, planned investments and financing in important industries, and integrating and adjusting their management. Therefore, its business scope is limited as follows: (1) Regarding transportation and port undertakings; (2) Regarding communication undertakings; (3) Regarding power generation and transmission undertakings; (4) Regarding mineral undertakings; (5) Regarding the manufacture, sale, and utilization of salt; (6) Other undertakings that specially require integration and adjustment to promote economic development in North China. For the above-mentioned undertakings, the North China Development Company may, with the approval of the government, operate them on its own.

The regular general meeting of shareholders of the North China Development Company is held in June every year, but the president may convene an extraordinary general meeting at any time. Its organization, under the president, includes two vice presidents, five or more directors, and two or more supervisors. In addition, a number of consultants may be appointed. The president's office, planning bureau, management department, materials department, first management department, and second management department are set up in Beijing. The head office secretariat is set up in Tokyo, and branches are set up in Beijing and Zhangjiakou. Offices are set up in Osaka, Qingdao, Taiyuan, Tianjin, and Jinan. In addition, there is a planning committee and a North China Development Council, with the purpose of planning and deliberating on important matters related to economic development in North China and answering the president's inquiries. Regarding the investigation of underground resources and general economics, there is an investigation bureau with branches in Tokyo and Zhangjiakou. Regarding the training of development personnel, there is a development training center. It is said that the current mining technology personnel training school has 270 graduates from our country who are actively working in the front-line coal mines.

The North China Development Company is a special Japanese corporation, so all of its employees are Japanese. The current president is Juichi Tsushima, the vice presidents are Koji Nakamura and Hide Sakae Tsuda, the directors include Katsuji Mikumo and four others, and the supervisors include Masuzo Nomura and two others. One of the consultants is a Chinese national, namely Cao Rulin, a well-known figure in North China who is now living in seclusion in the old capital.

As for the investment and fundraising methods of the North China Development Company, they are divided into two types: capital and corporate bonds. The initial capital was 350 million yuan (divided into 7 million shares), with the Japanese government and private sector contributing equally. After the extraordinary general meeting on April 30, 1941, it was increased by 93 million yen, totaling 443 million yen (divided into 8,860,000 shares). As of the end of September last year, the paid-up capital from the Japanese government was 24,983,622 yen in cash and 13.5 million yen in kind, totaling 57.5 million yen. The total amount of capital paid was 311.75 million yuan. Our country's capital is only the 5 million yuan invested by the United Reserve Bank in December 1940. Therefore, from the perspective of equal and mutually beneficial economic cooperation, both China and Japan feel the need to increase it today.

In terms of investment and financing, as of September 1943, there were a total of 29 companies and 3 associations directly invested in or financed, including 4 companies in the transportation industry, 1 company in the communication industry, 2 companies in the electric power industry, 10 companies and 2 associations in the coal industry (including sales companies), 4 companies and 1 association in the mining industry, 1 company in the iron and steel industry, 3 companies in the chemical industry, 2 companies in the salt industry, and 2 other companies. The total amount of investment in these was 621,212,000 yen, and the total amount of financing was 971,774,000 yen, totaling 1,592,986,000 yen. Compared with the previous year, we know that investment increased by more than 168.1 million yen, financing increased by 266.12 million yen, and the total increase was 434.29 million yen.

If we further analyze the legal characteristics of the affiliated companies of the North China Development Company, we will find that there are a total of 31 companies: 3 Chinese special corporations, 13 Chinese ordinary corporations, 3 Mengjiang special corporations, 1 Mengjiang quasi-special corporation, and 11 Japanese ordinary corporations. In addition, there are 2 associations based on Japanese civil law and 1 anonymous association based on Japanese commercial law. Of the total basic capital of 1,579,303,000 yen, 765,623,000 yen is held by the North China Development Company.

(IV) Conclusion

The reporter originally intended to meet with President Tsushima during this visit to the North China Development Company, but Mr. Tsushima was busy with official duties. Instead, I had a long conversation with Mr. Nakao Tatsuo, a trustee, and Mr. Kondo Hiroshi, the chief of the public relations section of the president's office. I am very grateful for the many materials they provided. The points recorded above are only a general description. A more detailed report will be prepared after returning to Shanghai at another opportunity. However, regarding the affiliated companies of the North China Development Company, some are called Chinese special corporations and Chinese ordinary corporations, and it is regrettable that our Chinese people do not have active participation.

### Weekly Commentary: The Decisive Battle Situation in the Philippines

Zhishen

It has been quite a long time since the enemy Americans invaded Leyte Island in the Philippines, but so far, they have not achieved any gains, and their losses have been enormous. The enemy Americans originally planned to gain a foothold on Leyte Island and then use air power as the main force to attack other islands and threaten Manila. They intended to seize control of the air over the Philippines and, under the protection of the air force, advance ground troops to occupy all the islands of the Philippines, and then launch a large-scale invasion of the Chinese mainland and even the Japanese mainland.

In order to realize such wishful thinking, the enemy Americans have launched fierce offensives in the skies and coasts of the Philippines. On the one hand, they are constantly attempting to carry out air raids on the allied homeland, carrying out their war of nerves; on the other hand, they are trying their best to support the resistance of the Yu army to the advance of the allied forces to contain them and obstruct the opening of the continental longitudinal line. However, the enemy American air force attacking the allied homeland has suffered setbacks every time. On the Chinese mainland, the allied forces have now officially opened the continental longitudinal line. The enemy Americans' fantasy of cutting off the allied forces' supply lines to the Philippines is not only impossible to realize, but the opening of the continental longitudinal line has also provided the allied forces with greater convenience in supplying supplies.

In the Philippines, the enemy Americans have launched frantic offensives almost every day since landing. Some people believe that the battle in the Philippines can be said to be the most intense war since the Greater East Asia War. However, the enemy Americans' offensive has faced many difficulties and has finally been unable to use its skills:

First, they have encountered a head-on blow from the allied forces. The allied forces have not only mobilized a large number of new fighter planes and bombers, but also equipped them with invincible kamikaze special attack teams composed of magical flying warriors, which has made the enemy tremble. Although the enemy Americans rely on their strong material resources, under the fearless spirit of the allied warriors, with the determination of sinking one ship with one plane and sinking thousands of ships with thousands of planes, the enemy Americans have suffered irreparable losses.

Second, they cannot stand on their bases. Due to the tenacity of the allied forces' fighting power, the enemy Americans have not been able to consolidate their foothold even on Leyte Island, where they have landed for a long time. The enemy ground forces, consisting of the 5th Division followed by the 2nd Division, totaling about seven divisions, have not yet been able to deploy their combat power. Moreover, the airfields established by the enemy Americans on Leyte Island are simply unable to be used normally under the continuous attacks of Japanese aircraft. According to reports, sometimes the aircraft that the enemy Americans have spent a lot of effort to transport to Leyte Island are often turned to ashes overnight due to attacks by Japanese aircraft. Since land bases cannot be properly established, they have to rely on the carrier-based aircraft of the mobile unit for aerial harassment. According to experience, the number of aircraft dispatched from land bases each time is usually around 200, but if carrier-based aircraft cooperate, it can reach 400 or 500. However, mobile units are not easy to stay at sea under the power of the allied forces, so the cooperation of carrier-based aircraft is also fraught with difficulties. Because they do not have stable bases, the enemy Americans have found it extremely difficult to exert their strategic tasks.

Third, there is a difficulty in supplying supplies. According to a report by a special correspondent of the Asahi Shimbun, each of the seven divisions of the US military that landed on Leyte Island needs an average of 16 tons of supplies, and the monthly transportation volume required is 1.3 million tons, requiring at least 200 transport ships of 5,000 tons or more, and each ship needs to travel an average of three times a month. This difficulty is obvious. MacArthur once requested the US authorities to replenish 1,000 aircraft to the Philippine Islands, which are thousands of miles away, every day, but this is simply impossible. Moreover, the allied air force warriors are now sparing no effort to destroy the enemy American transport fleets, and New Guinea, which serves as a supply base, is also often threatened by Japanese aircraft. Therefore, the difficulty in replenishing supplies is also one of the enemy Americans' great pains.

In summary, the enemy Americans' disastrous defeat in the Philippines is inevitable and destined.

### Fierce Battle Underway at the Southwestern Tip of Mindoro

Expanded War Results of the Japanese Air Force

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 16th: (1) An enemy force of about one division, escorted by powerful warships, invaded the Sulu Sea of the Philippine Islands and began landing near San Jose at the southwestern tip of Mindoro Island since the morning of December 15. The Japanese Air Force bombed the enemy transport fleet, and the Japanese ground forces near the enemy landing site are currently engaging the enemy forces and engaging in fierce fighting. (2) The war results obtained by the Japanese Air Force from the 13th to the 15th for three days have now been determined as follows: four enemy transport ships sunk, eight enemy transport ships destroyed, two battleships, three cruisers, two cruisers or destroyers, and six ships of unknown type damaged.

### Kamikaze Aircraft Sinks Enemy Ship

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – A powerful enemy fleet entered the mouth of the Sulu Sea from the west of Mindanao Island between the 14th and 15th and was heading north towards Mindoro Island. The Japanese Air Force attacked it, daring to ram its transport ships and strike them. On the 14th, the Kamikaze Special Attack Team first discovered a fleet consisting of three transport ships and three destroyers off the island of Siquijor and immediately attacked it, sinking one of the transport ships. On the morning of the 15th, the special attack team attacked a fleet of ten transport ships, four cruisers, and a dozen destroyers south of Mindoro. Two large transport ships were bombed and caught fire. Then, they pursued them south of the island and sank three large transport ships and destroyed four that were on fire. In addition, one cruiser and one destroyer were also destroyed and caught fire. On the same day, a large enemy transport ship was also destroyed and caught fire in the port of San Jose in the southwestern part of Mindoro Island.

### Fierce Fighting Continues in Ormoc

Philippine Islands Base, 16th (Central News Agency) – A part of the enemy forces in the Ormoc area of Leyte Island invaded the city via the Southeast Highway and engaged in fierce street fighting with the Japanese army. On the 11th, the enemy forces again bypassed the Japanese army's left flank from the northeast and mountains in an attempt to invade the city. On the night of the 14th, they were repelled by the Japanese army. The defense and offense on the east and west battle areas of Ormoc on the Japanese right flank were extremely fierce. The main force of the enemy 77th Division that landed in the Abuyog area was urgently awaiting the assistance of the 7th Division and was blocked by Japanese artillery fire and突擊 in the northern part of Abuyog. The Japanese army in the Burauen area completely occupied the north-south airport and the San Pablo airport and is currently strengthening its positions.

### Enemy Aircraft Launch Frantic Attacks on Luzon

Philippine Islands Base, 16th (Central News Agency) – The enemy Americans, troubled by the Leyte battle situation, used carrier-based aircraft from the mobile unit that invaded Luzon Island on the 14th to attack the provinces of沙呂宋 throughout the day. At 10:00 AM on the 15th, they further launched a total of 300 aircraft to attack the entire island of Luzon, including Manila, Clark, and Philtranco areas.

### Lieutenant Tsunoi of the Japanese Army Discusses the Situation on the Mainland: The Enemy Americans' Dream Has Been Completely Shattered

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) – Lieutenant Tsunoi of the Allied Forces dispatched to the Mainland News Department met with Chinese news reporters at the Japanese Press Club at 3:00 PM on the 16th. He first explained the recent situation in Guangxi on the Chinese Mainland front. The current campaign can be divided into two parts: one is the Liuzhou to Guiyang front, and the other is the Liuzhou to Nanning front. Since Guilin and Liuzhou fell in mid-November of this year, the Yu army, except for a part that retreated into the mountains on both sides, mostly retreated to Guiyang. Currently, the Japanese army in that area is continuing to advance and has occupied Dushan and Baisai, encircling Guiyang. As for the Japanese army in South China, since occupying Nanning on November 24, the Japanese army in Vietnam has also broken into Qian territory through Zhennanguan. The two sides have recently met in Qian territory. This completely shatters the enemy Americans' dream of building air force bases in southeastern, southwestern, and northwestern China and launching a landing operation to attack the mainland in the Philippines.

Regarding the Myanmar war situation, there are about five armies of the Yu army stationed on the Yunnan-Vietnam border. At the same time, British troops are also stationed in the Myitkyina area. Currently, the Japanese army is preparing to counterattack in Ruili. As for the Ledo Road, which the enemy Americans have been promoting for a long time, only the section from Ledo to Myitkyina has actually been completed. The section from Myitkyina to  Vietnam has not yet been completed. Therefore, the enemy Americans' claim that they have prepared a large number of transport vehicles in the Ledo and Myitkyina areas is still far from the time of utilization. The domestic situation in the enemy America is also quite chaotic, especially in the military production industry, where there are frequent strikes. As for the battle situation in the Philippines, all four of the enemy Americans' air force bases have now been destroyed by the Japanese army. Therefore, the enemy Americans' dream of successfully landing in that area and using it as a base for attacking the Chinese mainland has been completely shattered. Finally, a simple analysis of the European war situation was also added. The meeting ended at around 4:00 PM.

### Enemy Transport Aircraft Suffer Blow in Myanmar

Japanese Army Base on the Myanmar Front, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese fighter squadron attacked the area south of Bhamo in northern Myanmar in the evening of the 14th and happened to discover eight enemy Douglas C47 transport aircraft and about ten P47 fighter aircraft dropping supplies. The Japanese aircraft immediately launched an attack and engaged in aerial combat. In addition to shooting down six enemy C47 aircraft and two P47 aircraft, they also destroyed a large amount of dropped supplies. In this battle, one Japanese aircraft exploded on its own and one did not return.

### Soviets Concentrate Heavy Troops East of the Vistula River

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) – Haisong News Agency reports: The Soviet army's fierce attack along the Tabisa-Darnowo Highway failed yesterday. The German command has long known that the Soviet army is concentrating heavy troops east of the Vistula River in an attempt to break into the central German battlefield. Whether this is the prelude to the Soviet winter offensive remains to be seen. There has been a slight change in the Eastern Slovakia war situation, with the Soviet army continuing to exert pressure on the areas of East Zhangpu Tsuof and Krakow. There was artillery fire near Gotolo and Stuhlweissenburg in Hungary. The Soviet army launched fierce attacks on both areas, but the German army counterattacked and finally improved its positions.

### Major Battle Underway on the Paratinas Border

American Troops Launch Five Unsuccessful Attacks

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) – Haisong News Agency reports: American troops concentrated 200 tanks and the strength of six infantry regiments, hoping to open the Blies Valley.

### Fierce Fighting East of Aachen Continues

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) – Haisong News Agency reports: The right flank of the American Ninth Army is participating in the major battle east of Aachen. South of Jülich, the anti-Axis forces attacked the village of Sofuwen. General Hodges' troops attacked German positions southwest and west of Düren. German forces counterattacked northeast of Monschau and drove back American troops. There are still battles between Dillingen and Saarlautern.

### American Troops on the Western Front Violate International Law

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) – Haisong News Agency reports: On Thursday, when 60 American tanks attacked the Dillingen area, they drove Germans in front of the tanks to prevent German troops from firing. The group of German residents, holding white flags, went to the German Elburg and asked the German troops to surrender. The German troops disregarded this and opened fire, repelling the enemy tanks. American troops also used German prisoners of war to cross over American tanks to prevent German troops from firing. In other areas, American troops also used soldiers who were fluent in German and wore German uniforms to German positions to call for surrender. When they were refused, they attacked German troops. All of these are violations of the provisions of international law during wartime.

### Transportation of Rice Up to Eight Kilograms is Absolutely Not Prohibited

Authorities Determined to Crack Down on Rumor-Mongering and Speculative Profiteering Merchants

The black market price of rice has continued to soar, causing panic among the people. There are also rumors that even small vendors carrying rice are prohibited from transporting it. In order to clarify the truth of the matter, this reporter made a special visit to the Rice and Grain Control Committee and the Economic Security Office yesterday to inquire about the situation. According to officials from the Rice Control Committee and the Economic Security Office, the recent surge in black market rice prices is purely due to rumors. Those who spread these rumors are rice merchants seeking huge profits. In order to obtain personal gains, they continuously disrupt the rice market through speculative behavior. Since the Rice Control Committee announced that rice grains under eight kilograms could be freely transported in accordance with regulations, there has been no change in regulations. Therefore, the rice market has been stable in the past few months, and there have been no changes. In mid-September, some unscrupulous rice merchants became active, and their speculative purpose was to create rumors, which caused chaos in the rice market. The relevant authorities have already made thorough plans to crack down on these undesirable elements and are determined to impose severe sanctions. In addition, if there are cases of extortion or obstruction on the way when transporting rice grains within the prescribed quantity, that is, within eight kilograms, it is hoped that merchants and people will report it voluntarily. Once verified, anyone will be punished. At the same time, it is hoped that citizens will secretly observe and report rumor-mongering, speculative, and profiteering merchants so that they can be brought to justice. According to the Rice Control Committee, the household rice distribution is fully prepared and will be distributed on schedule. It is hoped that citizens will rest assured and not disturb themselves, so as not to give unscrupulous merchants a chance to speculate.

### Price Review Committee Cables for Prompt Relief of People's Food Supply

Sends Letter to Economic Security Office to Crack Down on Price Hikes

Director Xu Tianshen presided over the meeting. After the formalities, the chairman first reported on the progress of suppressing prices and the dynamics of the city's highest prices, and then began discussions. The important resolutions are recorded as follows: (1) The chairman submitted a proposal that the price problem, with the rice price as the center, has been soaring like crazy in recent days. Not only is it shocking to hear, but the trend is also dangerous, which has led to a unified rise in other prices. The general public will find it difficult to make a living. The seriousness of the situation is beyond description. It is proposed that the committee immediately submit a request to the Ministry of Industry to seek effective measures for the city's rice to stabilize the people's livelihood. The resolution was unanimously passed. (2) The chairman submitted a proposal that many stores selling goods do not comply with the limited prices and repeatedly increase prices arbitrarily. It is proposed to send a letter to the Economic Bureau to inform the Economic Security Office to severely crack down on the matter. The resolution was unanimously passed.

### A Glimpse of the Enemy Aircraft Wreckage

Zhihua

The Shanghai Special City Civil Defense Headquarters displayed the wreckage of the shot-down enemy American B-29 aircraft in the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse Square from the 15th of this month for public viewing for six days. Yesterday (the 16th) was the second day, and citizens went in groups, which was very enthusiastic.

Although the cold wind was biting yesterday, the sun shone brightly. At about 2:00 PM, this reporter made a special visit. Approaching the side of the racecourse, I already saw thousands of heads moving, and the entrance to the east gate was even more crowded. Mixed in the crowd, this reporter was unconsciously pushed into the square. The first thing that caught my eye was the clear national emblems of the Greater East Asia nations, such as China, Japan, Manchukuo, Thailand, and the Philippines, which were arranged in a circle and fluttered in the wind. The swastika flag of Germany and the national flag of Italy were also hoisted high in the sky at the same time.

The wreckage of the enemy American B-29 aircraft has been dismantled and divided into ten groups. Each group is surrounded by ropes and labeled with the type. Two wooden signs are erected at the front end. One is pasted with the great war results of the Allied Japanese army, and the other is to explain the location where the enemy aircraft was shot down and to encourage the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia to work together to win victory. The original text reads:

"Everyone, this is the wreckage of the four-engine American B-29 bomber, the 'Fortress of the Sky'. The Daotai aircraft secretly attacked Shanghai and Nanjing on November 11. Due to the fierce attack of the Japanese air and ground forces, it crashed southwest of Guandian on the Jinpu Line. Its wreckage is displayed here for everyone to view.

The indiscriminate bombing of American aircraft killed innocent civilians. Without listing the suffering situation in places such as Changsha and Guilin, just the indiscriminate bombing of residents in Nanshi, Shanghai, which injured hundreds of compatriots, can clearly show the brutality of American aircraft. This aircraft is one of them. Although the British and American enemies boast about their abundant materials and huge numbers, attempting to invade East Asia, the fighting power of Allied Japan will definitely destroy them.

If the 100 million people of Greater East Asia work together to defeat Britain and America, we will surely win victory. The liberation of the Greater East Asia nations and permanent peace are as bright and brilliant as the sun and moon."

After the explanation board, there is the exhibition circle, a total of ten places: (1) Machine guns, a total of eight, the gun barrels are still intact, and there are several bombs, all of which are small. (2) Part of the fuselage, silver-white, has been broken. (3) Engine and wheel leaves. (4) Fuselage and rear fuselage, also broken, but the bullet marks are still clearly visible.

Japanese Prime Minister's Welcoming Address

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The main points of the Japanese Prime Minister's welcoming address are as follows: His Excellency Chairman Wang, whom Japan has always admired, passed away suddenly, causing us immense grief at the loss of this great star. This is not only a loss for the National Government but also a great loss for all countries in East Asia. Following Chairman Wang's passing, while mourning, I eagerly anticipated the immediate emergence of a great successor. Before long, Premier Chen was indeed elected as Acting Chairman to succeed Chairman Wang. Upon hearing this news, I deeply rejoice for the Chinese people and for the entire future of East Asia, and especially celebrate the promising future of China and Japan. As Speaker of the Legislative Yuan and Mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality, Premier Chen used decisive measures to resolve numerous complex situations, complete the development of the National Government, and restore the economic vitality of Shanghai after the recovery of the concessions. I deeply admire Premier Chen's passion and talent. Therefore, I expect that Premier Chen will surely be able to fulfill his newly assumed responsibilities, bringing fortune to the Chinese people and prosperity to the one billion people of East Asia. I firmly believe that Japan and its East Asian allies, through mutual cooperation, will be able to accomplish great things. The war situation grows increasingly critical, and if this war cannot be won, the liberation of East Asia and the resurgence of Asia will never be realized. Currently, the enemy, relying on its vast material resources, is launching aggressive operations centered on the Philippines, attempting to enslave East Asia once more. However, to defend East Asia and its resurgence, even though the enemy possesses significant material resources, we, the one billion people of East Asia, must unite firmly, maintain an unwavering spirit of victory, and fight the enemy to the end. Therefore, under this great cause, I firmly and undoubtedly believe that victory will belong to us. The traditional spirit of sacrifice of the Eastern people is exemplified by the superhuman struggles of the Kamikaze, Manduo, and Kaoru special attack units, which repeatedly attacked the island of Leyte. This is undoubtedly our greatest strength. Furthermore, this spirit is not limited to the army and navy; the people in the rear also deeply understand this great righteousness and are striving in the war with this spirit. We will spare no sacrifice to destroy the Anglo-American forces of aggression and protect East Asia. We believe that the National Government must exert all its efforts to build a new China, and as an ally and a member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, we will spare no effort to provide various forms of assistance.

### Premier Chen's Speech of Thanks

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - The main points of Premier Chen's speech of thanks are as follows: "Our Chairman Wang has been convalescing in your esteemed country since March of this year, and we are deeply moved by the special care and hospitality shown by your government and people. The cadres of the National Government will never forget this. Today, on behalf of our government and people, I extend our boundless gratitude to your government. Following Chairman Wang's passing, we feel extreme grief, and at the same time, we feel an increased sense of responsibility. I issued a statement on November 20th, saying that the policies established by Chairman Wang are the policies that I will follow, and the measures implemented by Chairman Wang during his lifetime are the measures that I will implement today. I and my colleagues in the National Government will certainly carry on Chairman Wang's legacy, cooperate with your esteemed country forever, and share the heavy responsibility to complete Chairman Wang's unfinished work. Moreover, the Greater East Asia War is gradually approaching a decisive stage. Therefore, there may be shifts in the war situation, or the situation may become more pressing. However, the National Government will never waver due to shifts in the war, and will strengthen its resolve due to the urgency of the situation. Because the National Government's participation in the Greater East Asia War is voluntary, as is known to both Chinese and foreign figures and the Chinese people. China's participation in the war is not only to seek its own liberation but also to seek the common liberation of all the nations of Greater East Asia. For us, it is out of righteousness and humanity, and our cooperation with Japan is also out of righteousness and friendship. Therefore, we only know where righteousness lies and know nothing else. Success or failure, advantage or disadvantage, are not things we can predict. Today, at this critical juncture of the war, I dare to solemnly express our determination before you all: the interests and safety of China and Japan are now inseparable. We can only advance bravely based on the resolution that Chairman Wang showed us: 'From sharing joys and sorrows to sharing life and death.'"
