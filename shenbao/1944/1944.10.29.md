### Enemy Transport Fleet Burning in Leyte Gulf, Japanese New Submarines Actively Respond to Air and Sea Operations

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – Japanese air forces are continuously and fiercely attacking enemy ships within the Leyte Gulf in the Philippines, as well as enemy bridgeheads near Tacloban and Tarac, achieving significant results repeatedly. From the night of the 25th to the morning of the 26th, it was determined that 35 enemy ships had been sunk, damaged, or run aground. Additionally, 29 others were bombed and caught fire. Furthermore, in the battle on the 25th, an enemy aircraft carrier was destroyed and rendered inoperable. Approximately 70 of its carrier-based aircraft landed on Tacloban Island and the Tarac bridgehead. Consequently, since the attacks began on the 19th, the enemy's aircraft losses have reached 108. Small enemy ships wandering in the Leyte Gulf, spanning approximately 100 kilometers, are on the verge of collapse under the control of the Japanese air forces. Currently, Japanese aircraft are still sortieing to pursue and employ crash tactics, destroying numerous enemy ships. Additionally, Japanese land forces are repeatedly launching fierce attacks on enemy bridgeheads at Tacloban and Tarac, gradually expanding their advantageous position. Enemy landing forces, witnessing the tragic sight of their support ships being fiercely attacked by Japanese aircraft, have lost almost all will to fight. Philippines Base, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to Japanese air force reconnaissance, on the morning of the 26th, 80 enemy transport ships within Leyte Gulf were unable to escape eastward, merely wandering within the bay, with 27 of them on fire, their smoke visible from afar. Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – Following the recent naval battle off the coast of the Philippines, Japanese submarines have been actively engaged, responding proactively to the operations of the Japanese naval and air forces, achieving significant results. On the 24th, Japanese submarines attacked an enemy transport fleet in the eastern waters of the Philippines, sinking one large transport ship. Subsequently, on the same evening, they attacked another large enemy transport fleet of approximately 20 ships, sinking 12. Furthermore, on the night of the 25th, they attacked enemy aircraft carrier groups, sinking one large aircraft carrier and one destroyer, totaling five ships. In addition to the confirmed sinking of two enemy ships during the attack on the night of the 24th, it is believed that several other enemy ships were sunk, although unconfirmed. Therefore, there is high anticipation for the future activities of Japan's new submarines from all sides.

### Fierce Fighting in Leyte Battle, Japanese Forces Employ Accurate Bombardment

Dozens of Enemy Carrier-Based Aircraft Burned Manila, 28th (Central News Agency) – American forces landing on Leyte Island are attempting to gradually expand their bases westward. The interception of enemy carrier-based aircraft near the landing sites on Leyte Island has not been successful as the Japanese forces have secured air superiority. Furthermore, with damage to the aircraft carriers, the appearance of smaller aircraft has gradually decreased. The enemy forces are eager to seize air superiority, dispatching large B-24 bombers from the rear areas of Morotai and Peleliu, and ordering dozens of carrier-based aircraft to land near Tacloban in an attempt to secure airfields. However, after fierce attacks by Japanese forces, the aircraft were completely burned and destroyed, and several locations at the Tacloban and Tarac airfields were set ablaze to prevent their use by the enemy. At the same time, Japanese land forces have also secured the western highlands of Leyte, employing accurate bombardment. The enemy forces and ships fear Japanese night attacks and dare not turn on lights. Enemy ships within Leyte Gulf are deploying numerous transport ships to cover the reinforcement of landing forces. The defense and offense battle in the Philippines is becoming increasingly fierce. Manila, 28th (Central News Agency) – The American forces landing in Leyte Gulf have suffered repeated defeats, and their morale has greatly declined, showing signs of wavering. They are currently trying to reverse their perilous situation and are continuously reinforcing Leyte Gulf, while also taking advantage of bad weather to carry out supply operations. On the other hand, naval gun bombardments, which had been suspended since the 23rd, resumed on the 26th. American forces landing near Tarac are attempting to expand their bases, gradually invading westward. On the 25th, they reached the vicinity of San Pablo, west of Tarac, and a battle for the airfield there is expected soon. Manila, 28th (Central News Agency) – The American forces landing on Leyte Island, in an attempt to recover their mobilized maximum base air power, are continuing attacks. Meanwhile, in an attempt to respond to the attacks of the Japanese air force with their own air force, they recklessly transferred dozens of carrier-based aircraft to the Tacloban airfield. The Japanese forces launched a preemptive strike against this air force, wiping it out in one fell swoop. At 3:13 PM on the 26th, Japanese aircraft began their attack, repeatedly strafing the dozens of American aircraft on the ground, causing all of them to catch fire and burn. As a result, the American aircraft that landed at great risk have been completely lost. At the same time, the landing airmen and maintenance personnel appear to have been forced to temporarily evacuate.

### U.S. Navy Chief's Broadcast Hints at Defeat

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) – The American side is still engaging in its usual style of false propaganda regarding the naval and air battle between the Japanese and American main fleet in the Philippine Sea, exaggerating the losses on the Japanese side as much as possible. However, such propaganda cannot conceal their weak fighting ability. According to a Washington dispatch, U.S. Navy Secretary Forrestal broadcast on the night of the 27th, stating that the American fleet also suffered considerable losses in this naval battle and that the Japanese navy, although suffering losses, still possesses formidable power, a point that cannot be ignored. These few words alone hint at the American defeat. Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to dispatches from Washington, U.S. naval authorities have announced that at least 17 of the U.S. Navy's entire fleet of 20 battleships are currently in various areas of the Pacific. Furthermore, the battleship California, which was sunk at Pearl Harbor at the start of the war, has been repaired and is participating in combat. Additionally, the two 27,000-ton super cruisers, Alaska and Guam, have also been requisitioned. These ships are 750 feet in length and are equipped with nine 12-inch guns.

### New List of Japanese Cabinet Advisors Announced Yesterday

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – In order to adapt to the decisive battle phase, the Japanese government has decided to establish a cabinet advisory system. Furthermore, it will proceed with the selection of new cabinet advisors. It has now been decided that 12 individuals, including former Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita, will be appointed. The list of cabinet advisors, approved by His Majesty the Emperor after being reported by Prime Minister Koiso, is as follows: Hachiro Arita, Minobu Ono, Nobumasa Suetsugu, Teijiro Toyoda, Yuzuru Yuki, Kamezaburo Yamashita, Yosuke Yatsukawa, Hirotaro Ando, Shinzo Koizumi, Rikitaro Shoriki, Matajiro Koizumi, and Kiyonobu Yoshida.

### National Government Presents Medals to Japanese Diplomats

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) – The National Government, in order to commend the meritorious service of 101 Japanese diplomatic officials stationed in China, has awarded them the Tongguang Medal respectively.

### Japanese Minister of Army Encourages Production and Awards Mitsubishi Factory

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese air force has seized favorable opportunities to continuously and fiercely attack the U.S. Task Force 58 cruising in the eastern waters of Taiwan and the mobile fleet in the eastern waters of the Philippines. The enemy American forces have suffered defeat, and the Japanese forces have achieved great results, as repeatedly announced by the Imperial Headquarters. The achievement of these results is due to the diligent work of the production front. The rear has continuously sent elite bombers to the front lines to meet their needs. The credit for victory should be attributed to this. This proves that Japan's incomparably superior scientific front has surpassed the world. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which is responsible for producing elite bombers, and many other cooperating factories have made significant contributions to the overall war effort. In order to commend these factories, the Japanese Ministry of the Army held an award ceremony at 9:00 AM on the 27th in the First Conference Room of the Ministry of the Army. Minister of the Army Field Marshal Sugiyama awarded a certificate of commendation to Kozo Hara, the managing director representing Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and encouraged them to concentrate all their efforts on production. The representative replied, pledging to exert all their efforts to meet the expectations.

### Various Locations Prepare to Celebrate Two Major Anniversaries

Cooperate with Allied Nations in War Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) – Tomorrow (the 30th) marks the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and the capital will hold a grand celebration ceremony. At 9:00 AM, Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani, will lead his staff to visit the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs and senior officials to express congratulations. At 10:00 AM, a celebration rally for the anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and a capital residents' celebration assembly will be held at the National Assembly Hall, attended by several thousand people, including civil servants, students, military police, and civilians from various government agencies. The ceremony will be extremely grand. At 6:00 PM, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will host a banquet at the International Club for Japanese diplomatic envoys in China. After the banquet, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Propaganda will host a preview of the film "Spring River Flows East" for foreign guests, senior officials of the National Government, and figures from the cultural and media circles to express their congratulations. Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) – Tomorrow (the 30th) marks the anniversary of the signing of the Alliance Treaty, which perfects the war effort and establishes a new era in Sino-Japanese relations, and the 6th of next month marks the anniversary of the declaration of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. At a time when the allied forces are reporting frequent victories on land and sea, we feel even more inspired and confident in these two major anniversaries. All levels of our country are actively preparing to commemorate these two major anniversaries, which have great significance. We deeply know that the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty fully adheres to the teachings of the Founding Father, which showed that all countries in Asia should cooperate with the advanced country of Japan with one heart and one mind, and based on the spirit of Eastern morality, to defeat the utilitarianism of the West. For more than a hundred years, the Anglo-Americans have invaded East Asia without any gaps. It is a matter of course that the countries and nations of East Asia rise up to drive out the Anglo-American invading forces for self-defense and self-preservation. The signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty aims to make the comprehensive cooperation between China and Japan the center of stability in East Asia, thereby uniting the countries and nations of Greater East Asia to work together to strike at the Anglo-Americans and eliminate their invading forces in East Asia. However, to defend East Asia and complete the construction of East Asia, it is necessary to use the total strength of all East Asians, help and cooperate with each other, and strive forward under the same belief to complete it successfully. Therefore, the publication of the highest charter for the construction of East Asia (the Greater East Asia Declaration) is the most powerful expression of the unity of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia to build East Asia and contribute to world peace. This is consistent with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and is the full expression of the Founding Father's forgotten Pan-Asianism. Since the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty one year ago, the relationship between the two countries has become closer and the cooperation system has been strengthened in accordance with the spirit of the treaty. It is firmly believed that with the cooperation between China and Japan as the center, we will be able to unite East Asia and work together for the construction of East Asia's co-prosperity. In the past year, our country, from top to bottom, has been doing its best to contribute to the country and to East Asia. In terms of material things, we have saved all unnecessary consumption and stopped all unnecessary enjoyment in order to enrich the war effort and cooperate in the war. In terms of spirit, we have a deeper understanding and increased belief in the true meaning of the Greater East Asia War. However, what we cannot but say is that the stubbornness of the Chongqing side still wants to delay the war, willingly being used by the Anglo-Americans, and inviting the bad name of a traitor to East Asia. As these two major anniversaries in East Asian history are approaching, we sincerely hope that the insightful people in Chongqing will reflect deeply, stop resisting the war as soon as possible, drive out the Anglo-American forces, and preserve a part of the vitality of the country and the nation to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. In short, at this final juncture of China's rise and fall and East Asia's survival, all of our people and the 1 billion people of East Asia must fight with the same hatred and the same steps to defend the survival of our country and to fight for the liberation of East Asia. Only in this way can the construction of a new world begin and the happiness of all mankind can be achieved.

### Germany Deeply Respects the Splendid Results of the Japanese Army

Goebbels' Broadcast Speech Last Night Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – German Propaganda Minister Goebbels stated in a broadcast on Friday evening that he deeply respects the splendid battle results achieved by our ally, Japan, and its armed soldiers. The Japanese army inflicted a fierce and fatal blow on the American fleet in the naval and air battle off the coasts of Taiwan and the Philippines, causing deep unease among the enemy. Furthermore, in this battle, the Japanese people once again completely eliminated the ambition of Americanism to dominate the Pacific and praised all of Japan's inherent historical traditions. At a time when the determination of life and death and future happiness of both Germany and Japan is near, the German people can only achieve complete victory by working together and fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with the Japanese people. After the news of Japan's victory reached Germany, the entire country rejoiced. We are honored to stand on the same front with the incredibly brave Japanese people. The War Situation Is Half Good, Half Bad for Germany Goebbels went on to say that in the past three months, important events that have fundamentally changed the war situation have occurred. Among them, some are half good and half bad for Germany. The hopes held by the enemy have not yet been achieved, and the German people have not collapsed due to the enemy's general offensive and the activities of political agitators. The road into Germany is still closed. Although the eastern, western, and southern fronts are still in a very tense situation, there is reason to believe that they will soon stabilize. Fighting for Survival, Never Kneeling Although the war is sometimes difficult, the German nation will never cease fighting unless it obtains guarantees of independence and the right to survive. The enemy is trying to force the German people to kneel based on the development of the war, but in addition to the loss of the enemy's manpower and material resources, the enemy also cannot extend the war indefinitely due to internal political reasons. Therefore, the enemy has also realized the need to end the war as quickly as possible, and the losses will continue to increase significantly. In the race against time, the German people have a real chance of victory. If the German people surrender to the enemy, this world will become a hell for the German people. The Eastern Border Defense Is Strong Then, Goebbels discussed the military situation, saying that the German people have given up most of the land they have occupied since 1940, which is a cause for concern for the German people, but the German people have established a solid defense line on the 1939 line of defense. After the Battle of Arnhem, the enemy no longer mentioned advancing into Berlin. The Soviet army launched offensives on all sections of the eastern front in an attempt to gain a decision before winter, but the Soviet army's manpower resources are by no means inexhaustible, so we can be confident that we will eventually overcome the danger from the east. The wholesale betrayal of the Balkans forced the German people to retreat, but fortunately, Hungary was able to return to the German side at the last minute. Not Afraid to Sacrifice to Achieve Victory What the German people should pay the most attention to now is the terrifying air raids, but Germany's new type of aircraft will provide effective resistance to the enemy. Under constant air raids, Germany is still able to increase the production of munitions and can manufacture new types of weapons and make technical improvements. This can be regarded as the strengthening of a powerful factor that is expected to fundamentally change the war situation. The German people will never let their homeland become a hell, nor will they let their women and children be exterminated and their workers exiled to Siberia. The rules for the life of the German people prescribed by the followers of Morgenthau will never be realized. The only answer to the enemy's crazy plan is to achieve final victory at any cost.

### Lieutenant General Wilson Arrives in Moscow

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from Chongqing, the Japanese air force bombed the suburbs of Chengdu three times on the night of the 26th, and Chongqing issued warnings for up to five hours.

### Fierce Fighting Underway for Antwerp

Canadian Forces Land on Beveland Peninsula Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) – The Western Front war remains centered in the Netherlands. The defense and offense battle in the Antwerp area is currently underway. According to German bulletins, German forces are currently fiercely attacking the anti-Axis forces landing on the southern coast of South Beveland Island, behind Antwerp, and have completely thwarted the enemy's attempted advance in the Scheldt area. Bitter street fighting broke out again yesterday near Hertogenbosch. Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – The Havas News Agency reported that a German military spokesman pointed out that Canadian troops landed in Walcheren and three locations in South Beveland, but were repulsed in two places and only managed to establish a bridgehead in one location.

Weekly Review

### Economic Control Plan

— Guang Zhen

The recent serious problem of commodity prices is actually a problem of imbalance between supply and demand, because commodity prices are merely a manifestation of the relationship between supply and demand.  Recently, the authorities have adopted two methods to suppress commodity prices: one is to set price limits; but in reality, price limits are mere formalities, and they are constantly being raised, with some new price limits even being higher than market prices! The second is to contract the currency; however, the first to be affected is only the devaluation of securities. Commodity prices may temporarily stabilize, but they often rise again soon after. As a result, the currency inflates along with commodity prices, which in turn causes commodity prices to continue to rise.  This situation indicates that the problem of commodity prices cannot be solved solely from the perspective of commodity prices themselves or the relationship with currency. In economics, there is a basic principle: if supply exceeds demand, prices fall; if demand exceeds supply, prices rise. Therefore, the problem of commodity prices must be solved from the perspective of the relationship between supply and demand.  In wartime, due to increased military demand, shortages of materials, and hoarding by unscrupulous merchants, the relationship between supply and demand cannot be adjusted naturally. Therefore, it is necessary to implement control, the purpose of which is: 1. To strengthen labor and focus on key production: that is, to increase working hours and intensity, stop the production of non-essential goods, and emphasize the increased production of urgently needed materials. 2. To regulate transportation: due to frequent military transportation and insufficient means of transport, restrict unnecessary transshipment and concentrate on the transport of urgently needed goods. 3. To conserve consumption: for example, restrict entertainment and prohibit brewing, so as to reduce demand. 4. To distribute equally: for example, implement rationing, to suppress hoarding, to equalize enjoyment, and thereby to seek social stability. All of these cannot be achieved by capitalist methods, so it is necessary to adopt a planned and compulsory economic control policy.  As for our country, in order to catch up with industrial backwardness, it is necessary to control not only in wartime but also in peacetime. Because: 1. The evils of the anarchic state of production and distribution under capitalism have long been exposed. Our national capitalism has not yet developed, so there is no need to repeat this mistake. 2. Under laissez-faireism, China can never freely compete with advanced capitalist countries, so it is necessary to implement a comprehensive economic plan in order to develop industry.  However, since our country implemented the control policy, the economic situation has been deteriorating. There are many reasons for this, such as unsound personnel, non-unified powers, too low purchase price limits, improper procurement methods, and delayed and insufficient rationing. In addition, there is a fundamental reason, which is the incompleteness of the control. This can be said from four aspects: 1. Not comprehensive: focusing only on procurement and rationing in the consumption process while neglecting the practice of increasing production. 2. Not universal: the prices of some items that are not subject to control rise daily, eventually affecting the reduction of controlled product production and the rise in black market prices. 3. Comprador nature: procurement and rationing are entrusted to merchants, and merchants collude with corrupt local bullies to exploit producers during procurement, and sell the allocated goods on the black market during rationing, resulting in the allocation of goods that are not available. 4. Lack of power: unable to ensure public security, unable to mobilize funds, unable to command transportation, and government orders cannot be implemented throughout the country, and plans cannot be thoroughly implemented.  If we want to improve the control in the future, the control organization must have political morality, political talent, and political power in order to seek welfare for the country and the people, formulate a comprehensive plan, and enforce it forcefully. This is not something that merchant self-governing bodies can handle. It is best to set up a wise and powerful comprehensive control organization in the government. This organization must be able to directly command finance, finance, production, procurement, transshipment, and distribution, and must be able to directly manage all private enterprises in order to thoroughly implement the entire economic plan.  For example, taking the problem of rice and grain as an example, if we want to suppress the price of rice, we must also suppress the prices of other commodities at the same time, so as not to cause farmers to abandon farming due to losses; therefore, a comprehensive control must be carried out. Secondly, in order to enrich costs and improve cultivation methods, so that farmers can increase production, they must be given material assistance (such as low-interest loans, lending seeds, renting farming tools, and issuing bonuses), and they must be given scientific guidance: this requires the cooperation of finance, industry, agronomy experts, and other aspects. Thirdly, rice should be purchased directly after harvest to save intermediate exploitation, and large-scale transshipment should be carried out to save transportation costs, which requires the ability to mobilize large amounts of funds and command transportation tools. Fourthly, with a fairly accurate estimate of the purchase volume, the rationing volume can also be fairly accurately stipulated. If there is a shortage, mixed grains can be used to stabilize people's livelihood and prevent the black market from running rampant; therefore, procurement, transshipment, and rationing must be managed in a unified manner.  The solutions to other material problems are the same. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a comprehensive planning and strong economic control organization.  This organization, let us tentatively name it the [National Economic Commission] (the current [National Economic Commission] is like a mere formality and cannot bear this important task), and set up full-time standing committee members, and appoint the three ministers of finance, industry, and construction as concurrent committee members. Economic bureaus are set up in provinces and cities, economic sections are set up in counties and districts, and cooperatives are set up in townships. The association must be able to directly command the three departments of finance, industry, and construction, as well as economic bureaus, sections, and cooperatives. The business policies of private factories, companies, and transportation agencies must also be subject to the association's command, but they are still allowed to obtain reasonable profits.  In addition to the standing committee members, the association has the following departments: General Affairs Office, which handles internal affairs of the association and external negotiations; Planning Office, which handles investigation, research, and design of national economic plans; Adjustment Office, which handles production increase guidance, enterprise adjustment, production fund and tool regulation; Procurement Office, which handles procurement and transshipment; Storage and Distribution Office, which handles storage and rationing; Supervision Office, which handles economic security, suppresses the black market, and punishes hoarding. Economic bureaus, sections, and cooperatives handle comprehensive work according to their needs. As for all other economic institutions, they can all be abolished. The system is listed in the following table: National Government Executive Yuan National Economic Commission Standing Committee - Ministry of Finance Ministry of Industry Ministry of Construction General Affairs Office Planning Office Adjustment Office Procurement Office Storage and Distribution Office Supervision Office Provincial and Municipal Economic Bureau County and District Economic Section Township Cooperative  In addition to the three departments of finance, industry, and construction, which can still work in separate offices, the standing committee and its subordinate departments must work in the same office so as to facilitate regular contact and achieve the effect of comprehensive control. As for the location of the association, it is best to set it up in Shanghai, the national economic center.  The chronic diseases of the Chinese economy are deep-rooted. Curing the head when the head aches and curing the feet when the feet ache will not work. Using capitalist methods is even more insufficient to remedy the situation. If we want to improve, we must carry out planned and strong control of the national economy, so that production can be increased, procurement can be effective, and rationing can be truly rational, and then limit consumption and eradicate hoarding, thereby forcing the adjustment of the relationship between supply and demand. However, this kind of work is definitely not something that people who are only good at speculation or taking advantage of others can do well; this kind of work requires a wise and powerful comprehensive control agency, and those in charge must have public morality, professional knowledge, and strong powers.  In order to strengthen the wartime economy and revive the post-war economy, I only make the above suggestions, and I hope that people from all over the country will discuss and promote them in order to improve the national economy and people's livelihood!

Special Issue Celebrating the Victory of the Philippine Sea Battle

### The Japanese Navy Fulfils Its Mission to Defend Greater East Asia and Establishes Great Achievements, Crushing the Enemy's Two-Year Counter-Offensive Attempt

— (Zhi Xin)

According to the accurate announcement of the Japanese General Headquarters, from October 12th, in the naval and air battles on the sea off Taiwan, the eastern sea off the Philippines, and the inner sea of Leyte Gulf in the Philippines, more than 154 American ships have been sunk or destroyed in these 15 days. Large aircraft carriers over 200 meters long, capable of carrying nearly 100 aircraft, as well as battleships with over 1,500 people and equipped with ten heavy artillery pieces, have also sunk in large numbers. Japan has repeatedly stated that if the enemy's two-year counter-offensive approaches, it will definitely give them a decisive blow. This statement was not an empty promise, and it was indeed achieved. The enemy America also knew that approaching Japan would cause damage, but the anxiety to end the war as soon as possible and Roosevelt's ambition to be elected for a fourth term forced them to carry out this irrational operation. The Japanese fleet seized the opportunity and rose up courageously, and the enemy American fleet could not stand it. The Japanese gunners, under the spirit of [one hit is better than a hundred shots, and a hundred artillery pieces are better than one], trained vigorously, so there were simply no missed shells, and the explosives used were the most powerful in the world, so the American ships sank one after another as soon as they met the Japanese ships.

### Enemy American Soldiers Suffer Heavy Losses

America's resources are indeed abundant, but the quality is not high compared to the enemy. Due to the sinking and destruction of as many as 152 ships and fires, the casualties of soldiers must have reached 100,000. The work of naval personnel is very difficult, and it takes at least three years to train a qualified person. And today, their skilled personnel of more than three years have sunk to the bottom of the sea all at once.  It is said that the United States has a population of 130 million, of which 52 million are not of Anglo-Saxon descent, in other words, their parents are foreigners, so there are only 78 million true Americans. This great loss of people must be more painful for the Americans than the loss of warships. Moreover, America's short-term decisive battle is also hopeless. The Japanese Navy has gloriously completed its mission to defend East Asia. The people of Chongqing are the same East Asian people as we are. When they heard the results of the Japanese army, just as Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the country, said that the people of East Asia were overjoyed when Japan won the naval battle in the Sea of Japan, the people of Chongqing, who have been Americanized on the surface, must also feel excited in their hearts.

### Japanese Army Displays Endurance and Fighting Power

Building the Ladder of Victory  History is cyclical. The American Navy, which broke the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay in 1898 and laid the foundation for the occupation of the Philippines, suffered a near-total defeat from the Japanese fleet in the decisive battle inside and outside Leyte Gulf 46 years later, and was forced to flee from the Philippines in defeat. However, it would be somewhat dangerous to regard this so-called sea battle on the sea off the Thief Island as an independent battle. In fact, we should remember that this is just a link in the approximately one-year-long Pacific War that began with the battle in the Gilbert Islands in late November last year. That is, during this year, the battles in the Gilbert, Marshall, Mariana, Admiral, and New Guinea Islands were interrelated and mutually influential, with various causal relationships. Therefore, the victory in this sea battle on the sea off the Philippine Islands is definitely not unrelated to other previous battles. In order to create the victory on the sea off the Philippine Islands, the Japanese soldiers in the Gilbert Islands all died for their country, and the defenders of Saipan, Omiya Island, and Tinian also died one after another. The noble sacrifice that became the cornerstone of this decisive victory, its greatness may not be fully understood by some people. However, all these sacrifices have finally become the ladder to victory, which is now clearly visible before our eyes.

### The Combined Fleet Bides Its Time

It has been about a year since the great battle in the Gilbert Islands, and it really feels like a long battle. During this long year, the Japanese Combined Fleet endured with determination. Especially the Battle of Saipan, when we think of the crisis at that time, we still feel palpitations. At that time, many insightful people also shouted that the Japanese mainland was in danger and advocated that the Combined Fleet come out to attack the American Navy. However, the Combined Fleet persevered even at this time of crisis. Why did the Japanese Combined Fleet persevere and not come out during this year? The reason is very clear. That is, the Japanese Combined Fleet wanted to crush the enemy American fleet on the ocean and make it completely defeated, but its strength was still slightly insufficient. The Combined Fleet itself understood this fact better than anyone else. Therefore, it lured the enemy American fleet into a battlefield that was favorable to the Japanese side, that is, lured it into the sphere of influence of the Japanese base air force, extended the enemy's supply line to the longest, and on the other hand, shortened its own supply line to the shortest, so that the comprehensive strength of the two armies was fully balanced, and they could rise up at once and fight a decisive battle with the enemy. This determination was firm and unwavering during this year. The enemy also understood the basic strategy of the Japanese army, so they took an extremely cautious attitude in the battles unfolding in the Pacific, guarding against the attack of the Japanese Combined Fleet. However, the Japanese Combined Fleet, which finally appeared in this sea battle on the sea off the Philippine Islands, still caused them to suffer a decisive defeat. The reason is that in a true close-range battle between fleets, the American Navy is not a match for the elite Japanese Navy after all.  In short, the Pacific War, which has lasted for a year, has now crossed the highest peak of the decisive battle. The enemy America, which had advanced with great difficulty in the vast Pacific Ocean for more than a year from the Pearl Harbor attack to the Philippine Sea Battle, was instantly overturned by a storm. Its tragic state is not less than Napoleon's expedition to Moscow. What is most impressive in this decisive battle is that Japan won by enduring well. That is, during this year, if there was a lack of endurance in accordance with the basic strategy, then the crown of victory would definitely not be worn on Japan's head today. The importance of the [war of endurance] has now been explained by facts. After this absolute victory, we will never slacken, and we must move forward strongly with the determination that [the war starts today] until the day of final victory.

### Three Outstanding Strengths Are the Decisive Factors in the Victory of the Philippine Sea Battle

Japanese Naval Experts in Shanghai Analyze  The enemy American fleet has been defeated in the recent naval battles off Taiwan and the eastern sea off the Philippines, and the Allied Japanese Navy has achieved an unprecedented victory. I recently had the pleasure of hearing the following remarks from Japanese naval experts in Shanghai:  [The war on the sea off Taiwan and the Philippines has basically come to an end as of the 26th. In the future, it will only be a matter of mopping up the remnants. In this battle, the enemy American fleet has been largely destroyed. If the enemy America dares to make any further moves in the future, it will be a very interesting question. Although we are not arrogant in victory, we still need to be fully prepared. There are three factors in our victory this time:  First, the excellence of tactics, that is, the excellence of fleet operation methods, the excellence of the commander and the operation staff. The Philippines has more than eighty islands of various sizes. We used these islands to lure the enemy American fleet deep into Leyte Gulf in order to annihilate them in one fell swoop. Therefore, in this battle, the enemy fleet entered Leyte Gulf, and we only annihilated them in one fell swoop seven days later. The enemy did not know how to use the terrain at all. Our fleet, once dispatched, had annihilated most of the enemy fleet within thirty-six hours. Therefore, this excellent Japanese tactic can never be understood by Roosevelt and Forrestal. Secondly, our fleet can sail freely in extremely narrow straits. The enemy's dull staff will never be able to develop such a tactic.  Second, the excellence of science. The United States has always boasted of its sophisticated machinery in the world. However, in this battle, when the Japanese fleet fired the first shot, the enemy's largest cruiser was sunk in just two minutes. This shows the excellence of Japanese artillery machinery and the excellence of explosives. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese artillery can sink American ships at any time, which is beyond the reach of the enemy's artillery and mines. The defensive power of the enemy American warships has always been said to be the best in the world, but they were sunk in an instant.  Third, the excellence of the skills of the soldiers. Japanese soldiers are very excellent in all aspects because they have undergone years of intensive training. Compared with the American army, which has only been trained for a few months, there is absolutely no question about the quality and combat skills.  In short, the naval battle between Japan and the enemy American fleet is like a brave man fighting a hooligan. As soon as our army rushed in, the enemy scattered and fled. In this battle, the enemy flagship sent a telegram for help. The telegram for help should definitely use a code, but the enemy was caught off guard and panicked, so they sent it in plain text. When it was sent to the United States, it also reached Japan and the whole world at the same time. This embarrassing situation is tantamount to telling the world: [The American fleet is on the verge of danger].

### Destroy the Arrogant Enemy's Fighting Power and Strive to Increase Aircraft Production

— Li Jun

To build on the victory, we must step up production and transmit the bad news; we must vow to increase production even more. How does the aircraft production that the entire nation is engaged in become the fighting power to destroy the arrogant enemies of Britain and the United States? I will briefly describe its system to clarify the reasons why a large amount of materials is needed.  Immediately after the start of the war, the enemy America put up the slogan [Don't Forget Pearl Harbor] and established an aircraft production posture. Recently, it has finally reached a procedure of producing 10,000 aircraft per month, but this cannot immediately fly to our heads. Regardless of the mission country, having aircraft alone cannot establish a large air force. A large number of aviation personnel equivalent to the number of aircraft must be trained. The so-called aviation personnel are not only pilots, but also communication personnel and reconnaissance personnel. These aviation personnel cannot be trained unless they actually ride in the aircraft.  That is to say, to train a batch of aviation personnel, they must fly in the sky from morning to night. Those of you who are familiar with the actual situation of the aviation education team can definitely imagine how the aircraft itself is consumed and how much fuel is needed under such a rapid cycle.  Transport Unit  Secondly, there is the so-called transport unit, which is the logistics line of the air force. Those who think that the air force is still subordinate may have no idea of the scale of the air transport, but in today's world, where the outcome can be said to be determined solely by the air force, it is self-evident how many rear liaison aircraft are needed behind the aircraft operating on the front line. In the aerial war that has shrunk the earth, its rear still has to rely on sea and land transportation; otherwise, the aircraft cannot be used as an aircraft, just like fish without water and birds without wings. We must never forget the distance and speed of aerial warfare, and we must draw a picture of the earth in our minds and face this line squarely. As for the ground forces, in order to ensure that the fighting power of the front line is brought into full play, its logistics line needs to have the same strength as the front line. The situation is the same in aerial warfare. Judging from foreign examples, it can also be seen from the huge air transport of the same air transport divisions and rear liaison aircraft as the front-line forces.  If the war zone is vast, the necessary amount will increase even more rapidly. It is by no means easy for the enemy America to engage in supply and transport on a 40,000-mile route around the earth. Their ambition is of course hateful, but their efforts must be given considerable respect, even if they are enemies. As the war intensifies, the use of this kind of unit is even more urgent, and we must realize the noisy and chaotic state of affairs like a fire scene. Under certain circumstances, once the strength of the front-line units is advanced, the task of rear supply will be even heavier. The reason for the concern of various countries about transport aircraft lies in this. After all, this unit that is active in the rear is a prerequisite for bringing out the fighting power of the air force.  However, although the records of the combat aircraft, reconnaissance aircraft, and bomber's brave battles are depicted vividly, few people know about the hard work of the transport unit. As a result, the world's perception of aviation is inevitably superficial, which is evidence of a lack of correct understanding of its subtle and organic unity.  Research Institute  The next thing is the research institute. This cannot be underestimated either. From the perspective of the ratio of the aircraft part, it may not be large or unknown, but the necessary research institutes of various countries are, in this era when the technical aspects of various countries are heavily guarded, really huge facilities, and are the absolute amount unrelated to the air force it possesses. Therefore, it is a painful thing for countries with small air force strength to separate a part of their forces for research, but in an era when aviation technology is changing with each passing day, if you only think about today's aviation and not tomorrow's aviation, you will immediately encounter a tragic fate. The enemy America's NACA has hundreds of thousands of personnel, and Germany's VDM has also mobilized hundreds of thousands of technicians. The call to respect technology is definitely not limited to increasing personnel and equipment. The first thing is to absorb the spirit of technology.  Supply Unit  Finally, there is the supply unit, from which the aircraft is transported to domestic and foreign combat units directly facing the enemy (not referring to fighter aircraft). In the process of supply, there is a considerable amount of consumption, which must also be realized. The enemy America departs from the Pacific coast, via Hawaii, Canton Island, and Fiji Island, to the Southwest Pacific, stretching 8,000 kilometers, and its supply is estimated to consume 30%. If it goes around the earth via Africa and India to Chongqing, it is even more difficult. Moreover, this consumption rate is entirely subject to various maritime aviation preparations, so aviation weather, radio communication, and airfield equipment are no less important than the front line.  The aircraft that finally reaches the front-line units in this way are fighting and training at the same time. In the constant dispatch, coupled with intense training other than actual combat, the aircraft is gradually consumed. Just like a piece of ice, even if it is left unused, it will slowly melt. Even without fierce battles, aircraft will be consumed.  What can reduce its consumption rate as much as possible is the repair unit and the repair ability of its own team. Major damage is entrusted to the former, and simple damage is repaired by the team itself. However, due to the convenience of the location and the relationship between repair tools, parts, and materials, sometimes valuable aircraft that are slightly damaged have to be abandoned.  Therefore, all the aircraft of each unit cannot be dispatched at the same time. Only a few percent of them can be dispatched, and this requires careful arrangement of the number of air personnel before they can be dispatched. Sometimes, the aircraft are lined up, but there are no crew members to fly, or the people have been assigned but the aircraft is still being prepared, so not many aircraft are actually dispatched. The enemy American aviation personnel are divided into three shifts for alternate rest. The way to counter this is to improve the design of the equipment and reduce the burden on the crew, and to seriously study aviation medical countermeasures regarding their fatigue.  In this way, it can be seen that the aircraft that are actually active on the front line are only a few percent of the total number coming out of the factory. We should make ten times the effort we are making now to send aircraft to the front line one by one, and at the same time, we should study how to make this pyramid-shaped part effective. Therefore, many problems that have not yet been discussed and many hardships that the world has not paid attention to will soon be brought up as real problems. When we remove the contradictions and unnaturalness in the aviation world, we firmly believe that the fighting power of the aviation will definitely leap forward.

### Congratulations from Various Locations

Mongolian Border Regions Celebrate Great Victory - Central News Agency, Peiping, 29th: Since the Japanese army annihilated the enemy's mobile forces in the sea east of Taiwan, the Mengjiang Asia Development Association, in order to express its celebration and promote the determination of officials and people in the decisive battle, specially ordered its branches in various places to uniformly launch celebration rallies on the 24th. - Central News Agency, Qingdao, 28th: Various Chinese and Japanese groups in Qingdao, in response to the great victory won by the Japanese army in the seas off Taiwan and the Philippines, have recently decided to hold a "Week of Arousing Spirit and Destroying the Enemy" from the 30th of this month to the 6th of November. The Commemorative Meeting for the Declaration of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration will also be held at this time. - Xinmin Association Passes Resolution of Gratitude - Central News Agency, Peiping, 28th: The annual General Assembly of the North China Xinmin Association was held on the 26th. On the 27th, the entire assembly unanimously passed a resolution of gratitude to the Japanese army for their heroic combat. More than ten people, including Vice Chairman Wang and Chen, Director of the Propaganda Bureau of the Xinmin Association, visited the North China Army and the Peiping Naval Attache Office of Japan on behalf of the General Assembly to present a letter of gratitude. At the same time, they also stated that the representatives attending the General Assembly were determined to complete the heavy responsibilities entrusted to them in North China.

### Philippine President Clarifies Determination to Cooperate

Manila, 28th - Central News Agency: The great victory won by the Japanese army this time has made the Philippine people's fighting spirit even more vigorous. On the morning of the 27th, President Laurel specially clarified the Filipinos' determination to destroy the enemy as follows: The greater the victory of the Japanese army, the firmer the belief of our Philippine people that the Republic can be preserved. We must deeply recognize that only Japan is the protector of our country's territory, so we express our heartfelt gratitude to the daring of the Japanese army. At the same time, we should take this great victory as an opportunity to strengthen cooperation so that we can complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War as soon as possible. The victory of Japan is the victory of the Philippines. We must firmly believe that Japan and the Philippines have an inseparable common relationship. We vow to advance bravely toward our righteous future in this decisive battle and fight for the final victory. - Serious Situation on the American Side - Zurich, 28th - Central News Agency: After the American army landed on Leyte Island, it encountered a fierce counterattack, and a naval and air battle unfolded in the eastern Philippines. The Swiss people are extremely concerned about the announcements made by the Japanese General Headquarters and the war situation in East Asia. According to Domei News Agency, in addition to attacking American warships in Leyte Gulf, the Japanese air force is also very active in other waters. The United States is also broadcasting that the naval and air battle in the Philippines has a decisive nature, calling this war the battle that determines the course of the Pacific operations, and the American people attach great importance to the war situation. The Japanese army first annihilated most of its mobile forces in the sea off Taiwan, so it is feared that the American fleet will have difficulty covering MacArthur's operations in the future.

### The Great Victory of the Japanese Army in the Seas off Taiwan and the Philippines Lays the Foundation for the Inevitable Victory of the War

Ambassador Tani and President Chou Issue Statements - Ambassador Tani - Nanking, 28th - Central News Agency: The Allied forces severely damaged the enemy's mobile forces in the sea east of Taiwan and Leyte Gulf in the Philippines, reaping great victories. Mr. Tani Masayuki, the Japanese Ambassador to China, issued a statement on this, saying that after the elite troops of the Japanese army, navy, and air force annihilated and struck the enemy's American mobile forces attacking the sea east of Taiwan, they again engaged and severely damaged the enemy mobile forces attacking the sea east of the Philippines and Leyte Gulf within days, reaping a great victory unprecedented in war. The belief of our 100 million compatriots in the inevitable victory of the war is even more firm. Looking back on the Japanese soldiers, since last year, they have shouldered the belief and heavy responsibility of today's inevitable victory. I express my heartfelt thanks, and at the same time, I pay deep respect to the soldiers who died in the front lines and to my compatriots who have completed the laying of the cornerstone for the construction of Greater East Asia. I am especially pleased that our 100 million people in the rear, especially the residents in China, can deeply understand the government's policies, bury themselves in hard work, and devote all their efforts to their respective posts in order to establish various postures under the decisive battle system. I am convinced that the sincerity of the Japanese people in serving the country is the root of the inevitable victory of Japan, so this great victory should be celebrated even more. At the same time, the sincere cooperation of the Japanese people in the war will be able to exert great power in the future. However, in order to cover up this defeat, the enemy Britain and the United States will attempt to use various schemes to fabricate propaganda and confuse people. At the same time, they will still abandon their ambition to dominate East Asia, but our people already have the belief in inevitable victory and invincibility, which can destroy their attempts, needless to say. I hope that all residents will absolutely trust Japan's inevitable victory in national defense, follow the policies of the authorities, endure all hardships, increase production, and strive to serve the public in order to carry out Japan's inherent traditional spirit. And I deeply hope that all allied nationals residing in Chinese territory will always remember their position as practitioners of the new policy toward China, understand the essence of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, treat people with sincerity, deal with things with morality, and cooperate more closely with Chinese officials and people to strive to complete the Greater East Asia War and the construction of the Greater East Asia enterprise. - President Chou - Nanking, 28th - Central News Agency: The Allied navy's defeat of the enemy American navy in the sea east of the Philippines and the achievement of a glorious victory is the foundation for the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War, and the future of the liberation war jointly undertaken by the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia is becoming clearer and clearer. Therefore, the entire nation is enthusiastically celebrating the victory of the Allied navy. President Chou, the Acting President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, also issued a statement on this yesterday (28th) as follows: The great victory achieved by the Allied navy in fiercely attacking the enemy in the sea east of the Philippines not only caused a major setback to the enemy's counterattack attempt, but also showed the strength of the Japanese army and the consolidation of the defense in the Philippines. Since the enemy America attempted to counterattack, its momentum seemed to have gradually extended westward, but in reality, it only gained one or two isolated islands in the Pacific Ocean, which had absolutely no decisive impact on the overall war situation. Furthermore, judging from the American army's air raid on Taiwan and landing on Leyte Island, it is obvious that they are isolated forces penetrating deep into the enemy's territory. On the contrary, the Japanese army is waiting at leisure and can attack at any time to encircle and annihilate the enemy army, so it is natural that the enemy American army has suffered heavy blows. However, we should sweep away the erroneous idea of blindly worshiping Britain and the United States and believing in the omnipotence of material things, re-recognize the combat strength of the Allied forces, and adhere to the belief in inevitable victory. Do not be arrogant when winning, and do not fall when defeated. The determination of the victory or defeat of the entire world war today does not lie in temporary gains or losses. We must concentrate our total strength with strong determination and indomitable spirit, and then the final victory will surely belong to us. As an Allied nation, in addition to feeling deeply gratified by the great victory of the Japanese army in the sea east of the Philippines and expressing our respect to the soldiers on the front lines, we should also do our best to take on the responsibility of actively strengthening our combat power.

### Details of the Three-Day Naval Battle in the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf

Director of Press Department Kurihara Explains to Foreign Reporters - Tokyo, 28th - Central News Agency: Director of the Naval Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, Colonel Kurihara Etsuzo, met with a group of foreign reporters on the 27th and explained the details of the naval battle in the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf over the three days of the 24th, 25th, and 26th as follows: The Japanese Navy has destroyed Nimitz's right arm in the sea off Taiwan, and now it has thoroughly and severely struck Kingcade's fleet, his left arm, in the sea off the Philippines. The characteristics of this naval battle are, first, the great victory of sinking four aircraft carriers, two cruisers, and one destroyer in the decisive battle in the sea east of Tsushima Island on the morning of the 25th, while the Japanese side suffered no damage. The second is the enemy's attack on Leyte Gulf on the 25th. This is indeed a bold and adventurous tactic. In addition to giving the enemy a great blow, as announced by the General Headquarters, the Japanese side also suffered some losses. Colonel Kurihara further pointed out the fact that the enemy sent out rescue telegrams in the sea battle east of Tsushima Island, saying that the content of the telegrams sent by the enemy was: first, [7:20, the Japanese army is attacking, two powerful Japanese units are still attacking], and second, [The Japanese fleet is attacking me, please rescue immediately, attack with high-speed aircraft carriers quickly]. Such important operational telegrams were sent in clear code, and their embarrassment was even worse than at Pearl Harbor. The colonel also said that the losses to the enemy were the sinking of 210,000 tons (the results of the battle in Leyte Gulf are also included in this), and the destruction of 370,000 tons (the results of the battle in Leyte Gulf are not included in this), with a total of 680,000 tons sunk and destroyed. The casualties are estimated to be around 14,300. Then, a reporter asked, [This seems too few], and the colonel replied that the purpose of the Japanese Navy is not only to kill the enemy, this calculation is only a conservative estimate, and the figures in Leyte Gulf and transport ships are not included. In addition, the airmen who shot down enemy planes are naturally not included in this, so in reality, the enemy's losses may be around 40,000. Director Kurihara also spoke about the relationship between carrier-based air units and base-based air units, pointing out that the [principle of aircraft carrier superiority] advocated by the US Navy has been destroyed by the facts. The colonel said that history has proven that the fortress is always the winner in the war between warships and fortresses. In modern warfare, whether from the sea or land, even if airplanes replace artillery shells, the airplanes flying out from the land base are more powerful than carrier-based aircraft in terms of range, mobility, and destructive power and bombing power. Moreover, the land base as a base is more powerful than aircraft carriers. Therefore, it is a reckless strategy for the enemy to attack the Japanese mainland, Taiwan, the Philippines, etc., which have complete large fortresses and large air bases, from the sea with aircraft carriers. It is natural that the enemy has lost a large number of aircraft carriers this time. The enemy will definitely build more aircraft carriers in the future, but the Japanese army will definitely be able to bury them all on the seabed. Later, Colonel Kurihara further pointed out an extremely noteworthy fact, that is, Japanese army aircraft are carrying out sea attacks everywhere, whether in Taiwan or in the Indian Ocean.

### U.S. Naval Anniversary Address from Minister Matsushima Amidst Utter Defeat - Broadcast to the U.S.

Commander Matsushima, China Fleet Press Officer, Broadcasts to the U.S. - Titled "The Decisive Battle Between Japan and the U.S. Off the Eastern Philippines" - On the 27th, the day of the U.S. Navy's anniversary, Minister Matsushima broadcast a mocking address in which he said:
The World Gazes in This Moment

"Today is the anniversary of the U.S. Navy. On this glorious day, I am truly honored to be able to address Admiral Forrestal and the officers and men of the U.S. Navy from across the ocean. First, I would like to report that the U.S. Pacific Fleet has suffered the tragic fate of being nearly annihilated in the ongoing decisive naval battle between Japan and the U.S. off the eastern Philippines. On this day, the birthday of Theodore Roosevelt, the great naval constructor of the United States, the modern U.S. Navy has reached its end due to the disastrous defeat in Leyte Gulf. That is very unfortunate. It is beyond anyone's expectation that the U.S. Navy, which has wasted precious material resources, has a glorious construction history, and maintains a position of boasting to the world, would have such a dismal ending. We can imagine that the eyes and ears of the world are watching this historic moment. However, the magic of American propaganda broadcasts extremely absurd propaganda. According to a Reuters report from Washington on the 27th: [The U.S. Pacific Fleet has destroyed the Japanese fleet in the naval and air battle off the Philippines in the past three days, sinking more than 26 warships, mainly aircraft carriers and battleships.] It also said: [The report is not very complete, and the fighting seems to be continuing, which is clear.] But the losses announced by the United States are extremely small. This proves that their reports are extremely inaccurate. We should note that the figures in the battle results announced by the United States are very different. In this naval battle, the aircraft carriers, battleships, etc. of the U.S. Navy were attacked by our fleet and sent out coded telegrams to friendly forces for help. All U.S. communication agencies probably received them clearly! On this glorious Navy anniversary, there will naturally be no such tragic cries in the victory claimed by the United States. It is gratifying and commendable that the American public is completely unaware of the truth about the battle results of their own fleet, which was built with great effort.

The historic naval battle off the eastern Philippines has come to an end, and the enemy's defeated remnants seem to be fleeing toward the southeast sea. As a result, the enemy's ground forces of about three divisions landing on Leyte Island are completely cut off from their rear, and our elite air units continue to fiercely attack the fleeing and lagging warships and transport convoys in Leyte Gulf without hesitation. According to the announcement of the General Headquarters at 15:00 on the 27th, it is determined that the enemy has suffered an almost annihilating blow. Furthermore, the three divisions of the U.S. Army that are gradually advancing toward a corner of the Philippines are completely different from the situation on Saipan Island. They are being fiercely bombarded and strafed by our air force overhead, and are in a fragmented state. It is truly the dismal end of the U.S. military.

Account of the Recent Naval Battle

"Now, I would like to give a brief account of the course of this naval battle based on the information I have obtained. The U.S. military's operational plan was to use MacArthur's forces as the basis for capturing the Philippines, while Nimitz's Pacific Fleet provided overall support at sea.

The enemy's forces were deployed in the north and south. The northern force was commanded by Admiral Halsey and was mainly composed of the Third Fleet. The southern force was commanded by Spruance and had a part of the Third Fleet, plus the Fifth Fleet, the Seventh Fleet, and other Australian naval groups, escorting dozens of transport convoys.

After several meetings, it was revealed that the northern force would first inflict great damage on our air bases in Okinawa and Taiwan, and if possible, lure out our Combined Fleet to inflict a fatal blow, and then the southern force would calmly approach the Philippines and carry out a landing operation. During this period, it was also planned to have the 20th Bomber Group cooperate with the mainland at the appropriate time. However, the northern force's operation suffered a great loss in the previous air battle off Taiwan without much strength from our fleet, and it retreated in a panic. In order to rescue the northern force and achieve cooperation, the southern force was desperately trying to act rashly, but it was caught by our air units east of the Philippines and gradually disappeared. However, the vanguard of the enemy's landing forces took the opportunity to invade Leyte Gulf, and on October 20, they finally occupied a corner of the land. However, our Combined Fleet, which was watching the enemy's movements in a corner of the Pacific, suddenly moved out like lightning. Here, the officers and men of our fleet, who had been waiting eagerly, killed the enemy with even greater emotion and tension than experienced by their predecessors in the Battle of Tsushima. This fleet suddenly appeared in its heroic posture on the 24th. First, it launched a fierce attack on the powerful enemy mobile forces in the sea east of the Philippines from dawn. The submarines and air units that were advancing and retreating nearby cooperated to launch a earth-shattering three-dimensional naval and air battle. At this time, it sank four enemy aircraft carriers, two cruisers, and one destroyer. As time went on, battles occurred simultaneously in various places. On the morning of the 25th, the fleet that annihilated the enemy mobile forces in the sea east of the Philippines further突入了 (broke into) Leyte Gulf, where enemy warships and transport convoys were concentrated, from the southern entrance of Leyte Gulf. The [断而行之，鬼神避之] (Decide and act, and even demons will avoid it) legacy of Marshal Togo was glorified without regret, and a sea-to-sea white-blade battle was staged. It also fiercely bombarded the land forces stationed in the Tacloban area, exerting the power of shock tactics. It was truly a magnificent struggle that shocked the heavens and made the ghosts cry, and it inflicted a fatal blow on the enemy. On the 26th, our air units launched fierce raids on the enemy transport convoys and warship groups that were fleeing and lagging behind in the bay. The battle will continue until MacArthur's forces are annihilated. As for the battle results announced today, the number of enemy planes has been greatly reduced. What remains now is to annihilate the three divisions on land. Using this as a trap, we will absorb the enemy's warships here and exert the magic of defeating them one by one, and we will defeat them all in future operations. President Roosevelt will broadcast the following speech from the White House to the Navy on Navy Day, but there is not a single word that specifically mentions this naval battle. Roosevelt said: [Sea power has never been as important as it is today in determining the fate of world history. My navy has been baptized by fire in the most difficult naval battles, but it still shows enormous power. A major chapter in the history of the Pacific naval war remains for us to complete. Undoubtedly, my navy will be able to achieve it.]

President Roosevelt, why hesitate to make a numerical statement on the Philippine naval battle? Most of the officers and men of the U.S. fleet who can hear your statement are lying on glorious beds decorated with coral in the sea near the Philippines, and have become sacrifices for your ambition to dominate the world, the tyranny brought about by the New Deal, and the four-time election of the president. How grateful they should be to spend this year's Christmas at the bottom of the sea! Regarding this point, you should reflect carefully on your cold emotions and the responsibility of your personality. Don't be surprised, since the air battle in the Taiwan waters on the 12th, the U.S. warships sunk and destroyed have reached as many as 193, including 39 aircraft carriers, 10 battleships, and 19 cruisers. No matter how much you try to embellish it, the truth about this loss of the U.S. Navy will soon be exposed. In the meantime, the personnel losses, calculated as 50% for sinking and 20% for destruction, have reached 58,600. The cumulative total since the Battle of Saipan is at least 150,000 dead, and the total number of casualties is no less than 500,000.

A Page of Tragic History

"Philippine naval battle, Philippine naval battle! Our Combined Fleet, which had been lying dormant for two years, suddenly rose up and slaughtered more than 100 enemy American warships. Alas, how fierce, how tragic! But looking back on the past of the Pacific war, what a long and painful history of our forbearance! In the past, our soldiers defending Kwajalein and Roi-Namur died in battle, their voices hoarse and their tears dry, shouting [Not enough planes! Planes, planes!]. In the past, our compatriots on Saipan, even women with high hair, also drank their hatred in an isolated and undisturbed island and embraced each other and died in the sea. Who of our warriors and compatriots in our country who heard these sad reports did not have their hair stand on end in anger? But, even though help was not available, how was our grief and anger? Eating cold water in cold weather, every bit is in my heart. The thought of avenging this hatred someday is deeply engraved on the hearts and minds of our 100 million compatriots. For the enemy American fleet that rampages in the Pacific by relying on material resources, our Combined Fleet has shouldered the national will of our people, and is determined to give it a thorough blow. As soon as the time comes, we will cut it in two with one knife and cut off its arrogant bones. The whole army eagerly awaited the arrival of the divine opportunity, and the divine opportunity finally came. Enduring wind and rain, after two years of research, our Combined Fleet, which has become strong to the extreme, appeared as quickly as a hurricane, caught the enemy fleet in a corner of the coast of the Philippines, and chopped off the heads of the stubborn and unruly with a quick knife, letting it spew out the rotten poisonous juice that disturbs the world. And the 27th, when the General Headquarters announced this decisive battle result of the Philippine naval battle, which will forever be immortal in the history of the world, happened to be the U.S. Navy anniversary, which is truly a coincidence! Alas, the proud will not last long! Our Japanese nation, which has been enduring hardship and struggling until now for the sacred war of liberating the nations of Greater East Asia, although it has fewer material resources than the enemy, has a wise eye and has given us today's victory. This victory is precisely the victory that has been exchanged for the blood and sweat of the unity and effort of the military and civilians. Who is drunk with this victory? Who is lost in this victory? From this day on, we will lie on firewood and taste gall again, and fight resolutely until the day when the enemy America finally kneels down! In this way, the declaration of the nations of Greater East Asia will be realized. China, Manchuria, the Philippines, and even the nations of Thailand, Burma, and Indonesia, in this breeze where the night is fading, hand in hand, regardless of blood, will rise up in the blood sacrifice of the Philippine waters. That pitiful Eastern traitor, Chongqing, should also abandon all black market transactions today and return to the Greater East Asia standard. If you miss today, there will be no second chance. Our 100 million people will never be proud of the results of this decisive battle. Under this decisive victory, we will take a new step toward building Greater East Asia, and at the same time, we will seek more enthusiastic and active cooperation from the 1 billion compatriots of East Asia.

### City Economic Bureau Strives to Suppress and Stabilize Prices, Determined to Investigate Hoarding and Curb Artificial Price Increases

The City Economic Bureau held a tea party yesterday (28th) to report on the bureau's price control efforts, inviting reporters from local Chinese and foreign newspapers. Also present were Wu Songnie, representative of Mayor Chen, Wudao, Director of the Economic Security Office, Pan Bide, Secretary of the City Propaganda Department, and Advisor Ijichi. Director of the Economic Bureau Xu Tianshen first reported and strongly declared the authorities' determination to suppress and stabilize prices and ensure people's livelihood.

Xu Bureau Chief's Address:

[Two weeks ago, I summarized the high prices in the city and spoke about it several times. Regarding the fundamental solutions, I am working with the central government on overall planning and active implementation. Today, I want to report on the emergency measures being taken to suppress and stabilize prices. The price of goods in this city has now reached its peak. There are many reasons for this, but the hoarding and manipulation by profiteers and arbitrary price increases are important factors. For example, warehouses are full of goods, but they are unwilling to sell them adequately, only wanting to wait for a higher price. The sources of pork, beef, chicken, duck, vegetables, and local goods are not lacking, and may even be more abundant than before. Why are they so expensive? Obviously, it is due to manipulation and arbitrary price increases. Today, as the Greater East Asia War reaches its decisive stage, the people in the rear must save on consumption, increase production, stabilize prices in the rear, and consolidate the rear economy, which is the responsibility of everyone. If prices are allowed to rise uncontrollably, it will affect the morale of the front lines, not to mention the livelihood of the entire nation. Therefore, after long preparation and consideration, we have decided to launch economic police forces from today to conduct a comprehensive inspection. This inspection will be carried out in two aspects: one is to investigate warehouses and storage facilities, and the other is to investigate illegal price increases of various daily necessities. The investigation methods for warehouses and storage facilities, as well as the official price list for daily necessities, have been published in the newspapers. Our investigation targets all public and private inventories, and we will simultaneously investigate both Chinese and Western businesses, ensuring that the price increase trend is completely curbed to ensure people's livelihood and consolidate the rear economy. This is the greatest determination of our bureau.]

Secretary-General Wu's Speech:

[If the price problem cannot be solved, many problems cannot be solved. The high prices make life difficult for the general public, especially those on salaries, who cannot maintain their personal lives. The city government, the Economic Bureau, the Economic Security Office, and all parties concerned have discussed solutions to the serious price problem several times. After research by all parties, two main reasons were identified: first, natural causes, and second, artificial causes. The former is due to wartime transportation difficulties, inconvenience of transportation, and reduced supply of materials, etc. The latter is caused by unscrupulous merchants and profiteers hoarding and manipulating prices. The authorities will naturally use various methods to eliminate the natural causes. The artificial causes are a special problem in Shanghai. If the artificial causes cannot be removed, the price problem cannot be solved. Therefore, after repeated discussions by the competent authorities and all parties concerned, it was decided to conduct a general inspection from the 27th of this month to sanction unscrupulous merchants who attempt to make illegal profits, hoping to remove the artificial causes. Although this may not be a very effective method, it is something the authorities must do. It is hoped that the competent authorities will work hard in carrying out this economic inspection, and it is also hoped that the media will provide more assistance so that the price problem in Shanghai can be successfully started to be resolved.]

### Major Victory of Japanese Forces in Taiwan and the Philippines, Secretary-General Wu's Remarks on the Complete Crushing of Enemy's American Counteroffensive Attempt

Following the naval air battle off the coast of Taiwan, the Japanese forces have achieved unprecedented victories in air battles off the coast of Leyte Island in the Philippines and in the sea east of the island. The good news has been received with great excitement by the Chinese and Japanese people here. In this regard, City Government Secretary-General Wu Songbie made the following remarks: We are deeply grateful for the great victories achieved by our ally Japan. All Chinese people share this feeling, which goes without saying.

This time, it will suffer a heavy blow, and its counteroffensive attempt has been crushed by the Japanese forces.

### Mobile Residence Certificates Application Strictly Prohibits Extortion and Obstruction, Residents are Encouraged to Report Any Abuses

In order to ensure that residents deeply understand the procedures for issuing mobile residence certificate application forms in various districts, the head of the Police Bureau Baojia Office, Gu Jiwu, gave a statement to reporters yesterday. Regarding the mobile residence certificate application forms, they have always been distributed by this office to the Baojia shares of the police sub-bureaus in various districts for residents to obtain as needed. However, recently, a small number of residents in some districts have expressed great distress and annoyance about this. This office must make the following statement: There is no charge for obtaining mobile residence certificate application forms. When residents submit the completed forms for processing, the handling fees are also regulated. The handling fee for mobile residence, birth, death, and other matters is five yuan. The handling fee for reissuing a lost residence certificate is ten yuan. Receipts are issued for all of these fees. All income from the Baojia administration is submitted by the sub-bureaus to the bureau and then to the city government each month. This office is in a supervisory and guiding position. In short, the handling fees for residence certificates and mobile certificates have long been established, and since the beginning of implementation, extortion and abuses have been strictly prohibited. However, recently, due to budget constraints, there have been some delays in the printing of the forms needed by this office. In order to meet the urgent needs of residents, this office is making every effort to seek quick remedies and has been distributing the forms needed by the police sub-bureaus in general from September. The General Affairs Office of this bureau is still being urged to print additional forms as soon as possible for the sub-bureaus to collect. However, the Xujiawan district has not yet reported the consumption of paper, and it is assumed that there is still some paper left. All other districts have collected the forms in succession since September, and this office will continue to issue them according to their needs. Therefore, it should not be difficult for residents in various districts to obtain application forms from the bureaus. If any obstruction or extortion is discovered, residents are urged not to be swayed by sentiment and to bravely report it to this office. If there are any concerns, reports can be made anonymously in writing. Do not be easily deceived. If the facts are verified, this office will strictly investigate.

### Traffic Safety Campaign Focuses on Automobile Driving

### Record of a Bloody Battle of Japanese Patrol Boat

On the vast Pacific Ocean

The specially equipped patrol boats, cruising the vast Pacific Ocean to prevent enemy attacks from the sea and air, are the tentacles active on the front line of defending the Japanese homeland. They are just small boats weighing only a hundred tons. In that boundless ocean, they are really a grain of sand in the sea. Their armament is also very weak. Whenever they encounter a strong enemy and fight until they are exhausted, the hardship of the crew is beyond description. One day, a specially equipped patrol boat encountered a new American large submarine hundreds of miles east of Japan. After three hours of bloody battle, it was severely injured and escaped. The following is a record of the sea battle described by a certain captain of the patrol boat.

On a certain day in August, the wind was calm and the sea was clear. It was very hot from the morning. At 8:10, a large submarine suddenly surfaced on the sea four thousand meters to the left. It was the latest American large submarine, probably over two thousand tons. It seemed to despise us and immediately took an offensive stance against us.

Enemy Boat Surfaces

"Enemy submarine surfaced, intends to attack." While sending the telegram to the base, we also ordered full speed ahead to charge towards the submarine. The distance between us instantly narrowed to three thousand meters. We, with the principle of striking first, immediately opened fire with cannons and machine guns. They were shocked and hurriedly submerged. Did they escape? Of course, we would not let them escape easily. We immediately sped to the surface of the water where it sank and launched a depth charge attack. It probably went deep into the sea. We bombarded the water for a while and saw no movement, so we continued sailing, looking for friendly boats to deal with the enemy submarine that was sure to surface again.

The monotonous sound of the engine rumbled on. It was already 10:10. We had not yet met any friendly boats. At this time, at one hundred and twenty degrees to the right, three thousand meters away, the American submarine surfaced again. It was escaping at full speed. We immediately chased after it, but we were not as fast as it, and the distance gradually increased, about four thousand meters apart. At this moment, the enemy suddenly mobilized twelve-inch twin-mounted guns, eight-inch guns, twin-mounted twenty-millimeter machine guns, and seven-point-seven-centimeter machine guns and launched a fierce attack. As a result, pillars of water surged around us, and foam and splashes of water flew together, like a rainstorm. More and more shells fell nearby. We braved the rain of bullets and advanced at full speed. The distance was reduced to three thousand meters. Our boat then spread a smokescreen while firing and continued to advance. The distance became shorter and shorter, from two thousand meters to one thousand meters. We were prepared to ram it with the boat and exert our last strength to advance rapidly. At this time, the enemy boat, seeing that the situation was not good, immediately stopped the attack and turned to escape. Its speed could reach twenty-five knots per hour, much faster than us. Soon, it was four thousand meters away. After they got out of our firing range, they immediately took the offensive.

At this moment, our boat's gunners and machine gunners were killed and wounded one after another, and the deck was covered in blood. Suddenly, an enemy shell hit the mast. A soldier with a severe injury to his right wrist saw that the flag was about to fall, struggled to get up, and ran to the bridge under a hail of machine-gun bullets and raised the flag with one hand. Our boat's combat power gradually weakened in the fierce battle, but our morale rose in inverse proportion. Not long after, after we sent a telegram to dispose of classified documents, the telegraph machine was also destroyed, so we lost the means of contact with the base. Because we did not have enough speed, it was practically impossible to ram it and perish together, so we had to grit our teeth and do our best to inflict damage on the enemy boat. Unfortunately, our guns were also damaged one after another. They arrogantly treated us like a toy. We were angry, but we could not do anything to them.

Hit Enemy Boat

Taking advantage of the enemy's carelessness, we tried our best to get closer and finally approached within a thousand meters. The American submarine was thus greatly embarrassed and hurriedly launched two torpedoes from the stern torpedo tubes and tried to escape. We continued to advance and approached within three hundred meters. We fired a sure-hit shell. Two shells hit the submarine's command tower one after another. Seeing the enemy soldiers fleeing in the hazy smoke, we finally got rid of the bad air we had suffered just now. When the smoke cleared, the eight-inch gun on top of the submarine was bent like toffee. At this time, the shells fired by our boat hit the deck between the submarine turret and the command tower, opening a large hole. The enemy soldiers were in chaos and in a mess. In this way, the submarine could no longer dive, but our losses were also not small. The shells had been used up, and the lifeboats were also damaged by the shells. The only weapons that could still be used were four rifles. We drew our knives and were all prepared to commit suicide after the patrol boat sank. At this time, the enemy's shells also seemed to have been used up. The twelve-inch guns and machine guns were all silent. The enemy soldiers were waving machine guns while hurriedly repairing the deck.

"Catch it!" We shouted loudly, straightened the cloth wrapped around our heads, and prepared for hand-to-hand combat. They hurriedly dropped the mines they were laying and fled at full speed.

Unfortunately, because our boat was not fast, we finally let that submarine escape. (Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, September 24)

### The Decisive Battle of Science

——Mobilization of Technology in Various Countries—— The situation of the war, characterized by a battle of quantity and a battle of science, is becoming increasingly apparent. Therefore, the mobilization of scientists and technicians has become a decisive factor for victory. The warring countries are now desperately concentrating the minds of scientists to explore how to maximize their effectiveness and turn them into combat power. In Japan, various measures to mobilize scientists are gradually getting on track. Recently, the government announced an imperial ordinance on the mobilization of skilled workers to increase aircraft production. The Academic Research Council has also made suggestions to various parties on how to better integrate research with combat and production. The following is a brief overview of the scientific and technological mobilization efforts of the major warring countries:

Germany
Under the absolute command of Marshal Göring, Director of the Four-Year Plan Bureau, he is responsible for all planning and mobilization. Scientific mobilization was also implemented in 1942 based on the Führer's order on the Aviation Research Management Law. Aviation science became the focus of mobilization, with the Academy of Sciences taking the lead. Later, when Speer became Minister of Armaments, the command of the research institute and the authority to mobilize scientists for wartime production were transferred to Speer. A committee chaired by Speer, with representatives from the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as leaders of munitions factories, has recently been reorganized to ensure close cooperation between the front lines and the research institutes. This has led to the successive production of new weapons such as the V1 unmanned aircraft.

Soviet Union
The Soviet research institutions are directly subordinate to the Academy of Sciences and various People's Committees. The main tasks are: the Academy of Sciences engages in basic research, while the committees' institutions focus on applied research. There is also a comprehensive organization to turn these efforts into combat power, serving as a medium for research, adoption, decision-making, and production, with very strong control.

United States
Shortly after the outbreak of war between Germany and Britain in June 1940, the United States began wartime mobilization of technology, organizing the National Defense Research Committee (NDRA). The government appointed various ministers as members, directly under the National Defense Council. This was an organization centered on official and civilian scientists, with Harvard University President Conant as chairman, who engaged in the wartime organization of scientists after taking office. Subsequently, as the war in Europe progressed, this organization was no longer sufficient. Soon, the Emergency Management Office (OEM), the highest advisory body to the President, absorbed the National Defense Research Committee. Members were appointed by representatives of the Army and Navy. Army General Richard Moore and Navy Rear Admiral Pyle also participated in the meeting, implementing close operational coordination and substantively enriching the content. At the same time, the highest command of wartime scientific and technological mobilization in the United States was established.

The following year, to strengthen the control of research, the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) was established under the Emergency Management Office, the research administrative agency with executive power. The Production Research and Development Board (CPRD) was re-established the year before last. This completed and strengthened the comprehensive implementation of guidance administration from research to production. (Dezhong)

### Fighting Spirit of the Warriors of Peleliu Island

On Peleliu Island in the Palau Islands, the Japanese army still secures the airfield. During the day, they hide in their positions and endure, and at night, they send out close-quarters assault squads to infiltrate the enemy's positions and inflict damage, continuing their tenacious defense. On that lush island, full of red hibiscus flowers, the corpses of American soldiers will soon form a landscape. The officers and soldiers of the Japanese Army and Navy will fight bravely until the very end.

I spent some time on Koror Island in the Palau Islands between the spring and summer of this year. From that time on, the Palau Islands were the focus of enemy attention. Since the U.S. task force launched a strong attack at the end of March, Palau has been an important frontline base and has been very active during the Mariana Islands naval and air battle in June. Since then, the enemy has regarded the Palau Islands as a thorn in their side and has harassed them every day. Their advance to Biak Island and other bases in northwestern New Guinea was both in preparation for the Philippines operation and to create a foothold for attacking the Palau Islands. As for their choice of Peleliu Island in the Palau Islands as a landing site, it was because the island had an airfield. If they could seize the island, it could be used as an air base for attacking the Philippines.

The Palau Islands are a string of beautiful coral islands, different from Saipan. They are a group of islands with many small islands and harbors. Koror Island is the center, with Palau Island across the waterway to the north and Peleliu Island to the south. It takes about three hours to reach Peleliu Island from Koror Island by large motorboat. Peleliu Island is a low island typical of coral reefs. The island produces almost nothing, but it is an important aviation base in the South Seas.

After the Battle of the Mariana Islands, the enemy's intention to attack the Philippines became very clear. Therefore, Palau, located next to Mindanao Island in the Philippines, was bound to bear the brunt. This was expected early on. Therefore, the officers and soldiers of the Army and Navy defending the island were full of spirit and boiling with enthusiasm.

Enthusiasm to overwhelm the enemy
"Even if it's just one person, we'll have to take down several enemy soldiers. That's my only thought." When I left the island, a naval officer told me this at parting.

"They will definitely come to attack Peleliu. The blood debt from Saipan will definitely be settled by us!" A soldier stationed on Peleliu Island, whom I knew well, said passionately.

"The people on Saipan did so well, we have to do as well as them!" A Japanese expatriate who remained on the island to assist the military assured me resolutely.

I understood very well how strong the spirit of the soldiers and civilians on the island was to destroy the enemy. Moreover, even in such a tense atmosphere, the soldiers remained calm. During my stay on the island, I never heard them say a word about honorable death or dying in battle. They only wanted to destroy the enemy soldiers, and each person wanted to kill several. However, although they were full of killing intent, they still whistled and sang songs leisurely in their spare time, and engaged in planting yams and pumpkins. I thought of those soldiers who had long anticipated this situation and were working leisurely in the fields, and I understood very well why they were preparing to repel the landing enemy forces, fully expressing the killing intent to wipe out the enemy forces deep in their hearts. They will definitely fight as fiercely as demons! (Kawano Reporting Team Member) (Translated from the September 24th issue of the Mainichi Shimbun)

### Map of the Situation Near the Philippine Islands

The enemy U.S. fleet lurking in the sea east of the Philippines has been almost completely destroyed by relentless attacks by the Japanese Navy and Air Force in recent days. Enemy ships and landing forces in Leyte Gulf have also been reduced to the point of annihilation. The Japanese army is seizing control of the sea and air and continuing the pursuit. Shirakaba

### Under the Moon

— Sang Shen

Tonight, the moon is full, I linger, unable to bear to look; Human feelings are understood as cold, worldly affairs taste bitter and sour; My family is ruined, I am a guest in a foreign land, secretly worried about having no rice to eat; The rivers and mountains are vast and empty, tears fall across the railing. Tonight, the moonlight is like water, permeating my entire small house, as well as the bookshelves, tables, chairs, and bed inside the house... That bone-chilling coldness touched my face; mouth, eyes, nose... dispelling my dreams and fatigue, I suddenly jumped out of bed, pushed open the window lattice, and stepped on the moonlight on the balcony. I leaned on the railing nonchalantly, gazing, gazing; savoring the current night scene, I forgot about time and space, and even the existence of "I."

Silently, I don't know how long I was like this, when I was suddenly attacked by a wave of melancholy, which was mixed with the troubles of the world during the day, and the oppression of life: etc. I didn't even know the tastes of bitterness, spiciness, sourness, and sweetness. I only felt that the wave of emotion rose from the bottom of my heart, rising—I really had no power to suppress it, so I just wanted to vent it. I wrote a poem like the one above, but after reciting it again, I felt that the poem was extremely rough and shallow, and I wanted to tear it up; but at the same time, I thought, it could still reveal some of my current state of mind, so I treasured it and hid it in a diary that I always carried with me.

It must have been late at night, the moon hanging in the mid-sky like a polished little silver coin, pouring out a dim and desolate taste. Under the moonlight, dark shadows flickered, conjuring up tigers, leopards, bears, lions, demons: etc., weaving a gloomy and terrifying world, shrouded in darkness and loneliness. This was something that didn't exist during the day, and in contrast to the daytime's hustle and bustle, noise, heat, and tension, it became another world. But those who were tired of the daytime's complexity and arrogance would rather accept the night's tranquility and loneliness, even though the night was dark and terrifying.

Even those who have the generous and heroic spirit of [Flying Cups to the Moon] by the river, or even the solitude of [Raising a cup to invite the bright moon, facing my shadow, we become three people], would not feel interested. Is it that age has buried my passion? No. Is it that my temporary mood is infected with loneliness? No. What is it? I really don't even know myself! The gentle moonlight is loved by everyone, especially by lovers, who have a special fondness for it, even to the point of becoming thin and tempting. But the moonlight's inspiration aroused in me a wave of melancholy, or even indignation—that was due to the turmoil of the times, and the anxiety about how to spend a series of "tomorrows" in the face of the world's hardships.

I'm not yet thirty, but I'm really on the verge of thirty. The ancients said, [At thirty, one should stand firm], but I have never had a good impression of [standing firm], and I even hate it. [Stand firm on what?] I often sigh like this, or even mock it. In this day and age, talking about life is not about [living], but about suffering, torment, and dying quickly; taking me as an example: how can a little bit of dead salary withstand the crazy, daily-increasing prices? The two words [salary] and [water] really have the meaning of [a cup of water] and [a cartload of firewood], making it impossible for people to think that they can be of any help. Therefore, even my income from working alone is difficult to make ends meet, let alone supporting a family of four? The only solutions at the moment are pawning and borrowing. But pawning has its limits, and borrowing has the risk of being rejected. These are only temporary remedies, and cannot be expected to last forever. When I'm really broke, or when there are so few visitors that "birds can be caught in the net," then I can only die to end my life. I'm not deliberately saying this in such a painful way. There's really no other way. So I'm always worried about this tomorrow!

Now, this house, which is permeated by moonlight, used to have many guests every night, although I dare not say: [The seats are always full of guests, and the wine in the jug is never empty]. But at least a few close friends would come to gather every time—their faces would naturally be illuminated by the moon until they were very familiar. But in recent years, the number of times my friends come has decreased in inverse proportion to the rise in the price index. As of now, apart from my wife and children, I really don't see another person. So I live alone, separated from the group. What is the reason for this? Perhaps someone will ask me this, or perhaps the moon that knows their faces so well will be surprised by their absence and ask me. My answer is very simple: isn't it because of poverty? In recent years, due to the hardships of life, I have had to brazenly borrow money from my friends, one, two... once, twice... so my friends have become disgusted with me, and their feet walk towards other people's homes. Occasionally, when we meet on the road, I can see them avoiding me from afar. Or sometimes, when we bump into each other, we can't talk for more than a few words before they half-escape and half-run away. I understand that they're afraid I'll bring up money again. Money, money, money, life, life, life, so I am humiliated, avoided, and abandoned in a corner of society. The whole world has forgotten me, the whole crowd has forgotten me. There's really no way, what else is there to say!

Therefore, I also doubt my own ability to deal with the world. What is it about myself that is inferior to others? Isn't it the stubbornness left behind by my parents, aloof and arrogant, unwilling to bow my head to others in everything; unwilling to scheme, flatter, and disdaining speculation and windfall gains, and even less willing to be a two-faced person who [begs for pity at night and is arrogant during the day], to the point of being penniless now. I am ridiculed by the current society and have become a big fool in the current society! The current society is a world of money, a society of vanity. Whoever has more money has more ability, a higher status, and receives more respect and honor. But I don't have this ability to make money, what can I do?

Looking back at my wife and children's sound sleep under the moonlight, it is peaceful and sweet. I can't bear to think, and I think so, too, that they are all innocent, but they have encountered an unfortunate life of turmoil and poverty. This responsibility, of course, falls on the shoulders of me, the husband and the father. But in the vast night, in the vast world, where can I find a way out? To open a door to a happy and peaceful life for myself and my wife and children?

The moon has moved westward, casting a white light on the window curtain. The atmosphere of the night is even deeper and more terrifying. It's time for me to go back to my room, but I'm still a little reluctant; suddenly, a hand touched the railing, but felt a cold and wet sensation. It must be raindrops or dew, but there are no clouds in the sky, and the stars are twinkling. So I was surprised to realize that it was my tears, flowing out of my eyes. I lowered my head, cupped my face, and quietly returned to my room, leaving the moon hanging in the western sky, silent, silent...

### Dealing with the World

— Bud

Take other people's experiences as your own, and don't repeat their mistakes. Good things should be thought of in a good way, and bad things must be looked at from a bad perspective.

Prepare for a future in your own mind, and constantly compare your current self with your future self. In this way, you can see the difference between them. If you can eliminate this difference, it will be a clear sign that your ideals have become a reality.

Try to create an orderly life, because if you want to develop, you must first have a serious life. It is better to accumulate a penny from hardship than to obtain millions of gold through speculation, because money earned from hardship will not be misused, and money from speculation will ultimately be difficult to keep for long.

Don't tell people everything you think in your heart. The tone of your voice should be low and pleasant to the ear. Often, how you say something is more important than what you say.

Don't easily promise other people's requests, but once you agree, you must faithfully keep your promise, regardless of how much sacrifice it entails.

Regardless of who did the work, praise good results unreservedly. If criticism is needed, criticize deliberately to give people real benefits, and never show a contemptuous attitude.

Always be happy, put away your pain, and hide your worries and disappointments under a smile.

### Magpie and Crow

— Yang Shinian

...In the southeast corner of my house, there is a very tall and large ginkgo tree. Judging by its trunk, which is so large that four or five people cannot embrace it, it can be known that it must be an old antique from several hundred years ago. As the years go by, the branches and trees become more and more lush, giving it a somewhat gloomy atmosphere. Not to mention timid friends who will have a [suspicious] mentality towards it, even ordinary people are somewhat afraid to approach it because of its imposing size.

...Originally, such a place under lush green trees could be greatly utilized. If a circle of chairs were placed around it, old, young, male, and female could all sit and chat for a while, talking about [Classic of Mountains and Seas], while letting the gusts of breeze carry away the day's hard work. In a rural area without the enjoyment of a modern city, this could be considered a good place to rest. However, due to the villagers' avoidance of it over the years, its surroundings have become a wilderness that no one visits, and the lush branches and leaves have become the habitat of crows and magpies.

...Every day at dawn, before it is fully light, I am awakened by the long cries of crows, but I often refuse to get up. I use the clearest mind in the morning to start thinking about everything. I think about the teachers' stern faces in school, and I think about the sweet hopes for the future. Such wild thoughts continue until a flock of magpies make a noisy sound on my roof, and then I think it's time to get up. Then I wash, have breakfast, and go to school. I am never late, and I am never so early that the school gate is not even open. As long as it rains, the crows and magpies invisibly become my two clocks. When I recall my childhood life in my hometown, I can never forget their loyal service to me for many years. Indeed, I should thank them for giving me so many benefits.

...Is it people's selfish mentality, or an unreasonable prejudice, that always says that crows are bad and magpies are a symbol of happiness? I don't know when this legend originated, and I don't know what mysterious principles are hidden in it, saying that people's happiness is related to birds. Although I have asked older generations who know more than I do, they are just taking it lightly and repeating the rumors like everyone else, and can't explain why. If we talk about their appearance, the general black body, and if we talk about their voices, then the crows' melancholy long cries are certainly not inferior to the magpies' [chirp, chirp] noisy sounds. However, the strange thing is that this unfounded hypothesis can be firmly rooted in the hearts of every countryman and remain unchanged for a long time. I remember that one year, when my father was seriously ill, and this was also told to me by my family afterwards, they said that on that day, many crows gathered on the roof of my house and cried [caw, caw] incessantly. Then my father passed away on that day. Even if the crows could indeed foresee my father's death, then what kind of happiness did those magpies, who constantly flew back and forth in front of my house every day, give me? I don't feel unhappy when I hear the crows' loud cries, and I don't feel overly happy when I hear one or two magpies' low chirps. I just treat them as my natural friends. Indeed, they can break the silence in the remote countryside.

...But as I get older, I no longer have the childlike heart of my childhood. Someone said, [When people reach middle age, they have more worries]. Although I don't have any [amazing] sorrows or any big stimuli, I can't have the same leisure and interest as before. I can no longer hear the crows' and magpies' uneven cries and feel that this is a call from nature, arousing a knowing resonance in my heart. My mind no longer has a stream of inspiration, but is full of the scars of life's urging. I began to curse them for waking me up from my good dreams. They would not let go of these few opportunities for me to catch my breath, and let the burden of life continue to weigh heavily on my shoulders day by day.

...Leaving my hometown, I have unknowingly been away for nearly ten years. In this city, I can't see such tall trees or hear the cries of crows and magpies, which makes the traveler in a foreign land can't help but long for the past. I don't know if the ginkgo tree with its lush branches and leaves is more shady than before, and whether the crows and magpies, who have been separated from me for ten years, are still breaking everyone's dreams in the quiet morning.

### Commentary on Two Exciting Group A Matches in the Shenbao Cup Basketball Tournament

— Bixian

The Shenbao Cup basketball tournament has unfolded in unprecedented grandeur over the past week, especially the match between the Petroleum Team and Zhongbei on Friday, which attracted more attention than expected. Not only were tickets sold out before 6:00 PM, but fans of all kinds stood outside the gate until the end of the match, lingering and unwilling to leave. The authorities deeply apologized for the venue's failure to accommodate a large number of spectators. The following is a record of all the Group A matches of the past week, and comments on the two most noteworthy matches:

Group A Match Results for the Past Week

23rd (Monday) Mingxing won against V Team 30-23 Zhongbei won against Huanan 41-31

25th (Wednesday) Hualian won against Tongren 64-25 Huanan won against Dahua 46-40

27th (Friday) Mingxing won against Renyu 24-21 Petroleum Team won against Zhongbei 45-33

Among the above matches, the most significant ones were Huanan's victory over Dahua and Petroleum Team's victory over Zhongbei, which brought a change in atmosphere to the basketball world. There are rising stars, and the old and weak are being eliminated, which is a good phenomenon. It also makes people understand that in the basketball stage, purely relying on skills without sufficient average stamina is difficult to achieve anything. Let's discuss the disastrous defeat of Dahua against Huanan:

Dahua's Stamina is Inferior and Their Tactics are Flawed

The players of Dahua are mostly well-known figures in the basketball world, such as Lu Zhongen, Xu Wenkui, and Chen Xianglong. However, as they get older, they inevitably have a sense of waning beauty. The team's tactics are man-to-man marking. To use man-to-man marking effectively, sufficient stamina is essential. Players like Lu and Chen can only maintain the situation in the first half at most. Therefore, when a flaw is seen in the second half, a rotation should be used to replace players, so as to block the opponent. At the very least, realizing that their strength is insufficient, they should find a way to switch to zone defense to save energy. Although not the best strategy, it is necessary. Huanan's victory over Dahua was due to their stamina and spirit. Their progress is commendable. However, their tactics are still lacking. After the opponent used man-to-man marking, they only relied on uncertain long shots, especially He Jingui being marked tightly by Zhang Banglun. This is Banglun's success, but also a point where Huanan has not yet succeeded. To break man-to-man marking, speed should be used to change the blocking. He Jingui should not be allowed to simply run around looking for openings. Is this sufficient? It is hoped that the team's coach, Zhang Le, will study further and guide them to the best of their ability, so that Huanan's future will have unlimited glory.

### Petroleum Team's Attacks are Fast and Their Shooting is Remarkably Accurate

Petroleum Team's victory over Zhongbei was by no means a fluke, based on the entire game. Seeing Zhongbei's unfamiliarity, Petroleum Team adopted a fast-paced attack from the start. Zhongbei was unprepared and quickly conceded points, which laid the foundation for the victory. If Petroleum Team had focused on a steady and solid approach, they would not have had such gains at the start, and would not have been able to ultimately win. Zhongbei's skills are not bad, and their endurance is also acceptable. The most significant reason for their failure was their unfamiliarity. Shen Yugong, on whom they relied to score, only scored one goal. This was due to a lack of practice. Otherwise, if Yugong could shoot with great accuracy, hitting seven or eight out of ten shots, then the outcome would have been difficult to predict. Petroleum Team has been trained through hard work, and this harvest is enough to comfort them. The author hopes that they will not be arrogant in victory, continue to work hard, and seek further improvement.

### The Clash of Titans: Wah Luen vs. Wah Nam Tomorrow Night

Among this week's Division A schedule, the Wah Luen vs. Wah Nam match tomorrow night is the most anticipated by fans. The prediction favors Wah Luen for victory. However, the latter, fresh from their victory over Ta Hua, will undoubtedly make improvements for this match. It is hoped that Wah Nam understands how to utilize Ho Kam-kwai, and does not underestimate him or neglect him, for that will lead to greater success.

### The Key to League Friendship: A Discussion of the Battle with the Portuguese Merchants

— Mei Kit

Friendship Athletic Association has reorganized and refreshed its lineup this season, with the addition of the young player Lo Sau-fuk, earning them newfound respect from fans. Today, as they meet the Portuguese Merchants Club in the league, I have high hopes for Friendship Athletic Association, so I offer this brief commentary. The two teams met in the second Welfare Competition, where Friendship Athletic Association won four to two, but this cannot be taken as a definitive result. The previous match for the Portuguese Merchants was their first of the season, and inevitably showed signs of an "early-season slump." Now, after several matches, they are more refined, and Friendship Athletic Association should understand the most important keys to offense and defense. Break the Connection Between So Yok-kao and Sze Tan Often, you can see V. So engrossed in dribbling, while Sze Tan strives to find an opening. When V. So is dribbling, in addition to one person trying to stop him, another should tightly mark Sze Tan. Otherwise, it is extremely dangerous if he finds an opening. Friendship Athletic Association must find a way to thoroughly sever this connection. Secondly, Ku Wing-fuk must tightly mark the active Fuk Wan on the right wing, and must not relax. This person is very effective if given the opportunity, and Afuk should be careful. Lo and Ki-lun Should Pass Closely The Portuguese Merchants' defense, apart from Oliveira, who is indeed intelligent and courageous, has A. Kola Sha as a right midfielder, who relies solely on brute force. Therefore, Lo and Ki-lun should pass closely, and escape this player, in order to have hope of penetrating deep into enemy territory and succeeding. Also, I understand that Ko Bo-cheng has returned to Shanghai and will fill the right wing position, which is ideal. Bo-cheng has speed, so let him sprint, and Victor Taylor and Greenberg will be helpless. This will create opportunities for the unpredictable Hui Man-kwai to find openings, and I believe Ah-kwai will have better shots today.

### The Wah Nam Team with Limitless Potential

The Wah Nam basketball team was initially formed by young people from the Yu Garden Road area, mainly the Lau brothers. It was later renamed the Wah Nam Athletic Association. Recently, it became affiliated with the sports department of the Guangdong Native Place Association in Shanghai. With the leadership of Suet Chung and the enthusiastic guidance of senior sportsman Cheung Lok-chi, their skills have improved rapidly and they have become a strong team. Players Lau Fuk-sin and Li Yin-ching are studying at Fudan University, Lau Fuk-keung is at Nantong University, and Lau Fuk-ki, Tang Kwok-cheung, and Kwan Luk-cheung are at St. John's University. Fuk-ki is also good at drama. Ho Kam-kwai and Li Sui-hung are students who have returned from Japan and are now working for the Public Works Department. Tang Ying-zhen is also studying. They are handsome and promising young men with unlimited potential.

### Gleanings from the World of Sports

Tai Cheung-ling, the leader of Chung Pak, is broad-minded and stout. He arrived at the venue before 6 PM the night before the match with the Swatow team. After having dinner downstairs, he bought dozens of tickets and, standing next to the ticket collector, distributed them to those who came with the team, so that everyone could enter with a ticket. This man is not only enthusiastic about promoting sports but also happy to contribute generously. Ka-yung, Ka-man and Ka-piu have a strong interest in sports. They attend every match of the Shen Bao Cup Division A basketball tournament. They told people that coming to watch the games can increase funding for student aid, which makes them even more interested. After the Swatow team beat Chung Pak, Lin wrote a poem saying: "We must continue to work hard, and dare not be complacent." In fact, Chung Pak neglected practice, so we were able to win. It is said that Cheung Bong-lun's basketball skills are better than his football skills, which is insightful. The Phoenix Cup Basketball Tournament, organized by the Pei Cheng Electrical Factory, is scheduled to hold its closing ceremony today, with three exciting basketball games and awards presented by celebrities. The organizers have also printed a special issue, and a grand occasion is expected. The location is the China Film Studio court on Hua Shan Road. Chow Man, is called "Big Sister" by the members of the All-Star team. Yuen team’s Yim Man is a "sweet girl" on the court, because of her smiling face. (Basketball King)

### Essentials of Basketball Theory (II)

— Leung Siu-on

Basketball, in its initial period, already contained the factors of its great success. It was founded in a school for training YMCA secretaries. After graduating, the secretaries were dispersed to YMCA branches throughout the United States, serving in the gymnasium affairs, and basketball thus became extremely popular throughout the United States. Dr. Gulick, who was enthusiastic about sports, saw the potential of basketball development and proposed to expand the extremely simple rules set by Naismith, which were first adopted by the Amateur Athletic Union of the United States. The following year, universities began basketball training one after another. In 1893, Yale University organized a basketball team, making it the earliest university with a basketball team. In 1900, Senda Abbott at Smith College, pioneered women's basketball. In 1902, the first intercollegiate basketball league came into being. In 1905, the Western United States held a basketball conference. Since then, all middle schools, public education centers, sports organizations, specialized professions, and industrial institutions have practiced basketball. Before long, basketball became widespread, even popular in all countries around the world. Basketball also spread to the East extremely quickly. In the second year of its creation, that is, in 1892, it was introduced to China. Boo Gailey, the basketball center of Princeton University in the United States, first brought basketball to Tianjin. In the same year, Duncan Patton went to India and also introduced basketball to India. In 1900, Lshakawa introduced basketball to Japan. During the Boxer Rebellion, after the Allied forces of the United States entered Beijing, basketball followed the American army and spread to Beiping in our country. In 1916, Charles Siler, a graduate of Kanses "U" University in the United States, revitalized basketball in Tianjin, China, and developed it. Because of gaining the advantage of being ahead of the trend, it is no wonder that Tianjin later became the source of basketball talents in our country. In 1905, the 20th Regiment of the US Army from Kansas was sent to the Philippines, and under the leadership of Fred Funston, basketball also expanded in the Philippines. As for Europe, because the United States sent missionaries and YMCA secretaries to serve in various parts of Europe, within a few years, basketball spread to major cities in Europe. Basketball's ability to spread around the world in a short period of time is unmatched by any other sport, and its value in providing health and entertainment to people in all countries is truly worthy of our praise. The initial basketball rules consisted of only thirteen articles, which were formulated by Naismith in 1892. These rules were then called YMCA rules. Later, at the suggestion of Dr. Gulick, the Amateur Athletic Union expanded them to twenty-two articles. However, the expanded rules, due to different interpretations by various parties, caused confusion and conflict. At the same time, school federations and professional teams each formulated their own common rules, forming a phenomenon of establishing separate factions. This situation did not disappear until the Basketball Rules Joint Committee was successfully organized in 1915. The joint committee was organized by representatives from the Canadian Athletic Association, school federations, and amateur athletic unions. In 1933, the Road Joint Committee agreed to disband. Another successor organization was created, namely the current National Basketball Committee of the United States and Canada. Our country once modified the main points of the American rules and made them the current rules of the International Basketball Association that are being adopted. The Shanghai Western YMCA has always used the American rules, while the Chinese YMCA uses the international rules. It is a pity that teams are often unaware of this point, which often leads to misunderstandings. The Basketball Rules Committee meets every year in September, before the start of the basketball season, to discuss issues such as the retention, abolition, addition and subtraction of rules. Since the Far Eastern Games were discontinued, the international rules have not been modified since 1938 to the present. In 1940, when I completed my studies at Springfield College and was about to return to China, Naismith, the inventor of basketball, was invited to return to his alma mater to give a speech to his old classmates, and I had the opportunity to meet him again. According to what he told me at the time, what he felt most happy about in his life was in 1936, when he was invited to the Berlin Olympics and saw the representative teams from 21 countries participating in the basketball competition, each arranged under the flags of their respective countries, listening to him say a few words of congratulations and congratulations. The first game was China against Japan. The final championship game was the United States against Canada, and Shu Hong from China served as the referee. Later, he was invited to a banquet, attended by 19 old Springfield College students, all of whom were instructors of the basketball teams of various countries. At that time, his inner joy was beyond words. He never imagined that his invention 45 years ago would have such great achievements. He never imagined that basketball would become a movement for establishing friendship between countries today. Naismith unfortunately died of illness in the United States in 1940. However, his spirit and his contributions are forever worthy of admiration by people all over the world.

### Simple Fitness Training Methods (22)

— Written by Tom, Translated by A. Deutsch

Thirty-six: Stationary Running Running or other exercises that require deeper and longer breathing than walking should be practiced daily. In large cities, on the streets, vehicles and pedestrians come and go endlessly, so it is very inconvenient to practice running. The purpose of running is for health and entertainment, but the result may be the opposite. Moreover, running fast in crowds inevitably makes people suspicious, which is also an obstacle to this exercise. However, there is a way to avoid this difficulty, which is what is called stationary running. Lean your body forward, adopting the posture of a sprinter at the starting line. Clench your fists and place them on your chest, swinging your arms, and your hands will swing with them. Close your mouth and breathe through your nose. Run, but do not move out of your upright position. At first, it should be slow, then run faster and faster, then gradually reduce your speed until you stop. It is best to stand outdoors in a ventilated place, or you can stand by the window. Running; stopping; (fifty steps). Note: When your foot lands, silently count a step in your mind. Practice especially about running two hundred steps to five hundred steps. Thirty-seven: Fatigue in the Waist and Back Do scholars also feel fatigue in the waist and back? Are there any special exercises that can relieve this fatigue? Yes, there are. The method is as follows:
