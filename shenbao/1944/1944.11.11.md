### Typhoon Hits Leyte, No Change in Ground Warfare, U.S. Forces in Carigara Isolated

Manila, 10th (Central News Agency) The decisive land battle between Japanese and American forces on Leyte Island has seen no significant changes, with only fierce local battles occurring. The Japanese forces are seizing opportunities to cause the enemy to retreat, and the enemy has also acknowledged the above facts. The gist of their broadcast is as follows: The fighting in the Carigara area is extremely fierce. On the 5th, a portion of the U.S. 24th Infantry Division was surrounded by Japanese forces carrying tanks and vehicles, suffering a fierce attack. As a result, the U.S. forces were isolated. The U.S. forces fought to the last, with only five men escaping.

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from New York, an American war correspondent reported the situation on Leyte on the 9th as follows: Along the Ormoc Highway, a typhoon with winds of 100 miles per hour struck the battlefield today. U.S. military operations and resupply have been affected. Moreover, due to a fierce Japanese offensive, a state of intense combat has developed. Near Pinamopoan, the best front-line units of the Japanese army are attacking U.S. forces, causing significant damage to the U.S. army. Due to the typhoon, the forwardmost U.S. forces are almost cut off from resupply, and they have had to conserve ammunition, with some units reportedly lacking food. The battle situation bulletin of General MacArthur's headquarters on the 9th also stated that although there was a typhoon in that area, the fighting was still extremely fierce, and the Japanese artillery fire was very accurate.

Central Pacific Base, 10th (Central News Agency) On Peleliu Island, enemy forces are gradually reinforcing sandbag positions and advancing towards the Japanese army's positions in the central highlands. The advance is extremely slow, and morale is low. The situation on the island is stagnant, with no changes of any kind.

### Strict Punishment for Malcontents in the Philippines Ordered

Manila, 10th (Central News Agency) Philippine Interior Minister Sison, in his capacity as Acting Commander under the Laurel Martial Law Order, telegraphed martial law commanders in various martial law districts, ordering strict punishment under the martial law order for malcontents who attempt to disrupt, rebel, or engage in actions beneficial to the enemy.

### German Newspaper Praises General Yamashita

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) Following the Japanese Army Ministry's announcement of the appointment of General Tomoyuki Yamashita as the supreme commander of ground forces in the Philippines, the general, renowned for his lightning war on the Malay Peninsula, is deeply admired by the German populace. As a result, the German government and public have high expectations for the general. Various newspapers have carried prominent coverage, especially the "Deutsches Nachrichtenblatt," which published a glowing eulogy on the 9th: "The appointment of General Tomoyuki Yamashita as the supreme commander of the army in the Philippines shows the importance the Japanese high command places on the battle in the Philippines. General Yamashita, the victor in the Malayan campaign and the conqueror of Singapore, is undoubtedly Japan's leading military figure today. The general possesses exceptional leadership and organizational skills, as well as extensive military knowledge and unparalleled foresight. He will surely command decisively and inflict great damage on the enemy."

### Important Speech by Japanese Minister Iguchi "Who is the Aggressor?"

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) Iguchi, the Third Minister of the Japanese Government Information Bureau, stated the following when he met with a group of foreign reporters on the 10th regarding Chairman Stalin's statement during his speech commemorating the 27th anniversary of the revolution, calling Japan an "aggressor nation": "Chairman Stalin called Japan an aggressor nation in his speech commemorating the anniversary of the revolution, but there is nothing in this speech to suggest any change in the Soviet Union's policy towards Japan. Anyone who understands the course of Japanese-American negotiations before the outbreak of war between Japan and the United States will probably not consider Japan an aggressor. The Japanese government has clarified this fact to the Chinese and foreign public through repeated statements and declarations. Japan was compelled to resort to arms under the strong pressure of Britain and the United States. Granting independence to Burma and the Philippines is proof of Japan's liberation of East Asia. The fact that Japan is not an aggressor is even being acknowledged by the enemy countries. For example, British Production Minister Lyttelton stated in his speech on June 20 that it was quite strange how the United States was drawn into the war, saying that the United States provoked Japan, and as a result, Japan had no choice but to attack the United States. Today, the countries and nations of East Asia that have been liberated are gradually gaining their independence and sovereignty, working together for mutual welfare, while Britain and the United States want to re-enslave Burma and the Philippines.

### Eyewitness Account by Air Force Personnel of the Attack on Pearl Harbor

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Military Ministry announced to the entire army yesterday that five brave warriors, including Petty Officer First Class Nishi-kawa, who were posthumously promoted by two ranks, have been constantly engaged in reconnaissance activities throughout the Pacific since the second surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on March 4 of the previous year, making great contributions to the overall war effort. In late August of that year, during the Second Battle of the Solomon Islands, the five warriors were tasked with searching for the enemy and encountered a group of enemy fighters, dying bravely in battle. According to a crew member who personally participated in the Second Surprise Attack on Pearl Harbor, the situation of the operation on that day was as follows: "On that day, all of our preparations were complete. The heavy flying boat floated safely on the waves of the Pacific Ocean, then took off from the water and flew for several hours. As night deepened, it was approaching the fourth of the month, and we were about to approach French Frigate Shoals. At this point, it was difficult to predict when and where the enemy would rise up to meet us, so our tension reached its peak. Soon, French Frigate Shoals appeared before our eyes. Heaven blessed French Frigate Shoals with clear weather as usual, not a cloud in the sky, and a bright moon. When we flew over French Frigate Shoals, we prayed to each other under the moonlight: 'This surprise attack will surely succeed.' When we were about to fly into the airspace over Pearl Harbor, the beams of enemy searchlights slanted and shone upwards, and the number of lights in the sky visibly increased. Countless lights also shone from the surface of the sea in Pearl Harbor Naval Base. The lead flying boat slowly reached the airspace over Pearl Harbor Naval Base and saw the silhouettes of ships accommodated in the East Sea Naval Factory. They immediately dropped huge bombs on them, and intense flames of explosions erupted on the ground. At this time, enemy anti-aircraft guns also successively fired into the sky. When other flying boat units rushed into Pearl Harbor Naval Base, most of the sky was covered by dark clouds. The flying boat units calmly circled once before dropping bombs on the naval factory, making sure they hit their targets. They then flew back slowly. During the three attacks, although the enemy's counterattack was fierce, a gap suddenly opened in the thick clouds in a corner of the sky above the naval base during the third attack. We flew in and dropped bombs as desired, completing our mission and returning slowly. During this operation, the Japanese flying boats suffered no losses, and there was no enemy aircraft counterattack. Our air raid was even more perfect."

Commentary

### Thoughts on Attending the Ninth Advisory Meeting

— Chen Binhe

The Municipal Advisory Committee of this city held its ninth plenary meeting yesterday. Brief news has already been disclosed in various newspapers. I believe it is necessary to provide a more detailed explanation to the citizens. Therefore, based on what I know, I will express my thoughts as follows:

In this meeting, there were two relatively important reports from the municipal government:

(1) Regarding the price of household rice, it has recently been increased from 350 yuan to 500 yuan per dou (unit of dry measure), which is truly a last resort. If calculated according to the purchase cost, it exceeds 500 yuan by a considerable amount. Therefore, the monthly deficit of the municipal government's household rice is quite large. Now, through the efforts of the municipal government and the assistance of the Central Reserve Bank, a solution has been found to make up for the deficit, and there will be no further price increases. At the same time, it is gratifying that the allocation of household rice has been secured for the future, and there will be no further delays. Therefore, the members of the advisory committee and the municipal government at this meeting hope that there will be no price increases during the upcoming National Day and Lunar New Year. The rumors circulating outside about delayed allocations of household rice are all rumors. It is hoped that the citizens understand this and do not panic, lest they be exploited by rice profiteers.

(2) The Municipal Tax Consolidation Committee has achieved some initial results after more than a month of efforts. For example, the recent increase in military and police expenses, although not entirely satisfactory, proves that if consolidation is carried out properly, the results will be considerable, and the municipal finances will gradually become sufficient. However, the citizens must also assist, for example, by not evading tax obligations and reporting tax officials who commit fraud at any time, in order to achieve better results. I think the citizens already realize that if the municipal finances are sufficient, the funding for public security can be increased, and public security will be established accordingly. Then, by fulfilling their tax obligations today, they can ensure local security tomorrow, which is also ensuring their own lives and property.

In addition, the three most important points of discussion were:

(1) Regarding the recovery of the Central Market, Livestock Market, Fish Market, etc., the current business scope of the Central Market is gradually exceeding its boundaries, resulting in numerous malpractices. For example, Chinese medicines and tin foil are also distributed through the Central Market. Secondly, from the perspective of the citizens, the market price of vegetables is gradually increasing artificially, causing suffering to the people. In fact, vegetables are neither within the scope of control nor military supplies, and the management methods should have been changed long ago to adapt to the welfare of the people. Even if a portion is supplied to the military, it will not be hindered after the management methods are changed. It is said that the Allied authorities have repeatedly expressed their intention to return the management, which is certainly a wise move by the Allies. It is hoped that it will be realized as soon as possible. To give an example, there should be a unified method for price management, but in the past, the prices of the Central Market were often handled separately, causing the people a lot of unnecessary suffering. Therefore, we advocate that businesses that can be run independently by the Chinese should be allowed to be run by the Chinese themselves. It is hoped that the municipal government will negotiate for the recovery as soon as possible based on requests from all parties.

(2) Regarding the issue of raising the salaries of public, police, and teaching staff in this city, the advisory committee has repeatedly suggested that the salaries of municipal government employees are too far from the standard of living needs. We know that the municipal government is also very concerned about and attaches great importance to the issue of raising the salaries of its employees, no less than the members of the advisory committee. However, limited by the municipal finances, it can only be adjusted gradually. This time, the advisory committee suggested setting up a "Municipal Government Employee Cost of Living Allowance Adjustment Committee" as soon as possible, which would work with the Municipal Tax Consolidation Committee to reasonably stipulate the amount of the allowance based on the price index of daily necessities, so as to gradually achieve a level where the cost of living allowance is consistent with the cost of living. From the standpoint of the citizens, the municipal government employees are serving the local community, and they should fully bear their living expenses. Even if there is still a shortfall after consolidating taxes, they would be very willing to increase taxes. Therefore, it is hoped that the municipal government will, on the one hand, encourage public servants to serve the local community wholeheartedly and, on the other hand, eliminate redundant personnel as much as possible.

(3) Regarding the issue of increasing the entertainment tax, the short commentary in this newspaper on the 7th advocated increasing the ticket prices for dog racing and jai alai venues, and using all the proceeds for municipal government taxes. The French dog racing venue has even adopted an opposing attitude, which is an extremely unwise move by the French businessmen. We believe that dog racing is unnecessary in the first place. If dog racing must be held, then the entertainment tax must be collected. It is hoped that the municipal government will not hesitate and decisively dispose of the matter to achieve the purpose of collecting taxes.

### Rear Admiral Minato Appointed Japanese Naval Attaché; Lieutenant General Kondo Transferred to Naval General Staff

Lieutenant General Kondo, the current Japanese Naval Attaché in Shanghai, has been transferred to the Naval General Staff on the 7th of this month, and will soon leave Shanghai. Lieutenant General Kondo has served as the Japanese Naval Attaché in Shanghai for one year and two months. He has many close friends among the Chinese people, and is known for his gentle disposition and deep understanding of and sympathy for China. His departure from Shanghai is regretted by all parties.

His successor, Rear Admiral Keijo Minato, assumed office at the Naval Attaché's Office yesterday (the 10th).

Brief Biography of Keijo Minato

Rear Admiral Keijo Minato is 49 years old. He graduated from the Naval Academy in the fifth year of the Taisho era (1916). He has served in China on numerous occasions. From 1932 onwards, he served as a staff officer in the China Fleet. After that, he served as a naval attaché in Shanghai, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other places. At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, he served as the captain of an aircraft carrier, actively participating in the southern front. He then served as the Chief of the Second Section of the Naval Armaments Bureau and as an instructor at the Naval Academy before assuming his current position.

Inaugural Speech

After assuming office, Rear Admiral Keijo Minato delivered a speech to the Japanese residents, saying: "I am pleased to have been transferred to China to serve in this new role during this decisive stage. I have close relations with the fellow residents in various aspects, and I hope for your guidance and assistance in the performance of my duties.

As for the mindset we should have in this decisive situation, it is to strive to overcome any difficulties in order to complete the great task of defeating Britain and the United States. At this critical time, what is especially desired is to be sincere in one's responsibilities and towards others, and to always be calm and unhurried. After the great defeat at Dunkirk, Britain was in a major crisis. At that time, British Home Secretary Morrison told his people: 'Those with courage and enthusiasm will never be defeated.' Although this statement came from the enemy, it should also be remembered by us. To defeat such an enemy, it is necessary to be even more calm and unhurried than them. I hope that everyone can maintain this mindset from beginning to end."

### Three Focus Points on the Western Front: Major Battles Underway, U.S. Troops Crossing the Moselle River Annihilated

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) The situation on the Western Front has become tense again. It is reported that fierce battles are currently unfolding in three war zones: the Western Front, eastern France near the southern wing, the vicinity of Aachen, and the Netherlands at the northernmost wing. Patton's U.S. Third Army has launched a major offensive aimed at the Saar Basin since the morning of the 8th, and has further reinforced three divisions to attack the French border regions of Lorraine and Metz. At the same time, the German resistance is also extremely fierce, thwarting the enemy's operational intentions everywhere, especially in the area northeast of Gottmadingen and west of Chateau-Salins, inflicting heavy losses on the U.S. military. The German counteroffensive in the Aachen area has made the fighting even more intense.

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) Overseas Chinese News Agency: The U.S. military in the southern part of the Western Front has launched a large-scale offensive between the Moselle and Rhine-Marne Canal. Several U.S. divisions in this area have the assistance of air power and artillery, as well as all technical advantages, making the offensive quite strong. The German side had long detected the concentration of elite U.S. troops and was waiting for an opportunity to act. German commanders have already made the necessary preparations, so the resistance is very strong. There have also been troop and ordnance concentrations around Aachen, and a major battle is likely to occur soon. The U.S. military has begun to deploy smoke screens.

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) German News Agency: On Wednesday evening, after a short period of preparatory artillery fire, the U.S. military crossed the Moselle River at three locations in the southern Luxembourg area. At that time, the German army immediately launched a counteroffensive and annihilated the U.S. troops who had crossed the river, with only a small remnant of the enemy fleeing back to the other side of the river.

### Anti-Axis Forces in Italy Launch Offensive

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) The Italian front has recently broken out of its stalemate. The British Eighth Army has launched a large-scale offensive in the eastern Apennine Mountains and the Adriatic Sea, while the U.S. Fifth Army is also preparing for battle.

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) Overseas Chinese News Agency: The British Eighth Army began an offensive in the Adriatic coastal area several days ago in the area north of Cassiano, which is still in full swing, with the Sassena-Forli highway as the focus of contention. The British army has concentrated a large number of troops in the bridgehead west of the Ronco River in that area. The British army first bombarded the area with heavy artillery for a long time before advancing towards Forli. Later, it encountered a strong German counteroffensive and retreated to the Ronco River. The left wing of the British Eighth Army then attempted to break into the plain between Forli and Faenza, but was also thwarted by strong German resistance. It remains to be seen whether the current offensive by the British Eighth Army along the Apennines towards the northwest is intended to cut off the German forces in the Faenza-Bologna line, or is merely to contain the German forces in the eastern corner of the Po Plain.

### Performance of the British New Weapon V-2

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - The German Head of State's headquarters announced at noon on the 9th: The V-2 has continued to bombard London since the 8th.

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the power of the V-2, the German military authorities announced the following on the 9th: (1) It has a greater explosive force than the V-1 and its destructive power is also extremely large. (2) It has a longer flight range than the V-1. (3) The launch site is built extremely cleverly and will never be discovered. (4) It is more accurate than the V-1. The occurrence of the most recent bombing event can prove the accuracy of the V-2 attack. According to British intelligence, the explosions occurring behind the Western Front have caused agitation within the anti-Axis camp, which is also a testament to the power of the V-2. (5) It is still difficult to predict what impact this new weapon will have on the war situation, but the German army will continue to use the new weapon.

### German People Show Perseverance, Will Surely Be Able to Cope with Difficulties - Goebbels Publishes Article

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article in the "German Weekly," stating that the current war can clarify the situation and lay the foundation for the future.

According to the principle of survival of the fittest, the excellent will inevitably survive. The German people have shown their ability to cope with difficulties, and countries lacking this ability will inevitably fall into the depths of darkness. Germany's steadfast virtues are not only due to the stability of the national character, but also to the effectiveness of the state and social institutions.

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports: If the Soviet army on the Eastern Front intends to attack the Königsberg area of East Prussia, the German army under General Riebau will threaten them.

The winter offensive will be launched on the entire line from Memel to the Carpathian Mountains. While the Soviet army attacks East Prussia, it will simultaneously attack Poland. The Soviet Union clearly wants to achieve victory before the arrival of severe winter. The fighting in the central section of the Tisza River is intensifying. Soviet troops are attempting to outflank the German positions southeast of Hongjing, but have been repelled.

Hongjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports: After the authorities urged men in the Pest district to voluntarily evacuate, the situation in Hongjing remains very calm.

### Fierce Street Fighting in Guilin City - Japanese Army Occupies Liuzhou - Continuing to Reinforce Troops,展开 Intense Battle

Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese army base on the Guilin front, the Japanese army's general offensive on Guilin city has become even more desperate.

From the afternoon of that day to the morning of the 10th, the elite Japanese troops, with the close cooperation of the air force and tank units, fought as one, rushing into Guilin city and launching fierce street fighting. The complete fall of Guilin city is imminent.

At 10:00 a.m., they completely occupied Liuzhou city.

Guangxi Front, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army rapid unit attacked Liuzhou County (30 kilometers north of Liuzhou). At 11:20 a.m. on the 9th, they broke into the city and wiped out the Chongqing army. At noon that day, they completely occupied the city.

A part of the unit had already advanced to a point 200 meters in front of the north gate of Guilin city together with tanks and was currently engaged in combat.

Advising the Chongqing Military and Civilians to Cease Fire

Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese army base on the Guangxi front, the Japanese army unit attacking Guilin distributed leaflets to the Chongqing army on the evening of the 8th, explaining the true meaning of this operation and advising them to stop fighting. The general idea was that the purpose of this operation was entirely to destroy the hegemonic attempts of Britain and the United States. Anyone who can exclude cooperation with Britain and the United States, whether Chinese soldiers or civilians, is not our enemy. Therefore, we hope that you will quickly and completely cease fire, and then closely cooperate with Japan to destroy the common enemies, Britain and the United States.

Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese army base outside Guilin city, the Japanese army unit attacking Guilin crossed the Guijiang River on the morning of the 9th, rushed into the streets of Guilin city, and continued to reinforce its troops. On the morning of the 10th, they occupied the Guangxi Provincial Government in the city. Other Japanese army units are also compressing the encirclement line. The Chongqing 31st Army and the 131st Division fled southwest from the south side of Kaojun Road southwest of Guilin and are now surrounded by the Japanese army, engaging in fierce fighting.

Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese army base outside Guilin city, the Japanese army advancing from the north of Guilin broke into the city through the north gate of Guilin at 11:20 a.m. on the 10th and is currently launching a mopping-up operation.

Guilin Surrounded by Three Sides

Guangxi Front, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing army in the middle of the Yujiang and Liujiang Rivers, which was attacked from both sides, has been heavily besieged due to the skillful operations of the Japanese army's southern outflanking unit. Furthermore, due to the compression attack of the Japanese army's follow-up units, it is showing signs of collapse. The vanguard unit of the Japanese army from the Longshanxu area began to advance towards Zhangmuxu (4 kilometers from Longshanxu and Xishuizhou) on the night of the 25th. At dusk on the 6th, they broke into Huangling, the Chongqing army stronghold in front of the area, and also occupied the Chongqing army strongholds such as Pankou (east of Ping'an, about 25 kilometers northwest of Shishixu). At the same time, the Japanese army in the Zhonglixu area captured Shimo (30 kilometers southwest of Laibin) on that day, and began attacking from three sides at dawn on the 7th.

Completing the Encircling Posture of Liuzhou

Guangri Central News Agency reports from a Japanese army front base in Guangxi that after the Japanese army began a general offensive against Guilin city, it launched a fierce battle with the Chongqing 31st Army. At the same time, the Japanese army's fierce attack on Liuzhou became even more intense from the 8th onwards, even more so than the Battle of Hengyang. On the morning of the 8th, the Japanese army occupied Luorong, 25 kilometers northeast of Liuzhou, and launched a fierce attack with another Japanese army unit on the outer defense line of the Chongqing army near Liuzhou, launching a melee. Furthermore, the Japanese army advancing north from South China occupied Xiang County on the 6th and launched a fierce attack on Liuzhou, establishing a posture of attacking from the north and south. The main force of the Chongqing army defending Liuzhou was the 62nd Army and the Independent Tank Regiment, and artillery units were transferred from Nanning to attempt a general counter-offensive. Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi and Fourth War Zone Commander Zhang Fakui personally supervised the battle. Since Guilin and Liuzhou are both bases for the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, it is natural for US aircraft to come to aid in order to continue maintaining the war of resistance. Therefore, the Battle of Liuzhou can be said to be the largest and most intense battle on the mainland this time, and the Japanese army is giving it a heavy blow by fully exerting its strength.

Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the Liuzhou front, the Japanese army, after crossing the Liujiang River near Xiang County, rushed towards Liuzhou all the way, eliminating the stubborn resistance of the Chongqing army. At 4:20 p.m. on the 9th, they broke into the eastern end of the Liuzhou Airport. Then, at 5:00 p.m., they completely occupied it. The Japanese army is currently launching a fierce attack on the troops in the center of the city.

Guangxi Front, 10th (Central News Agency) - On the morning of the 8th, after a certain unit of the Japanese army occupied 雊rong, it further eliminated the resistance of the Chongqing 62nd Army and field artillery units defending Liuzhou near Gaolingtang (8 kilometers northeast of Liuzhou) and Sanbijiang (10 kilometers northeast of Liuzhou) on the morning of the 9th. Fierce battles are underway in the outer defense line of the Chongqing army in the northeastern area of Liuzhou. Another Japanese army unit is approaching Changtangxu (15 kilometers north of Liuzhou) and is currently shrinking the encirclement of Liuzhou.

A Certain Japanese Army Base on the South China Front, 10th (Central News Agency) - After occupying Xiang County on the 6th, the Japanese army's vanguard unit forcibly crossed the Liujiang River and continued to advance to the northwest, and has now reached an area several kilometers away from the river crossing point. Furthermore, the Japanese army units that captured Wuyi broke into Laibin, about 70 kilometers southwest of Liuzhou, at 10:30 a.m. on the 9th, and continued to cross the Wujiang River, securing the highlands and controlling the Chongqing army's retreat route. According to reports, Laibin is the last stronghold of Liuzhou, directly reaching Liuzhou. The Japanese army's northward unit arrived at a certain place at noon on the 9th, crossed the river, and looked back at Liuzhou, advancing fiercely.

Foreign News Reports on the Situation in Guangxi Province

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) - Reuters' correspondent in Chongqing reported on the 9th on the situation in Guangxi Province as follows: "Under the cover of its army, the Japanese army is fiercely attacking the Chongqing army's defense line outside Guilin, and is adopting an encirclement posture in Liuzhou. The attacking Japanese army is currently advancing from the north, east, and south. The northern unit is currently advancing directly towards the city from the 27-kilometer highway north of Liuzhou. The eastern unit is currently pressing towards Luorong, about 27 kilometers northeast of Liuzhou on the Xiang-Gui Railway. The southern unit is currently crossing the Liujiang River and attacking various places south of Liuzhou." Furthermore, the Associated Press correspondent made the following supplementary report: "The Japanese army, which has launched a major offensive directly towards Liuzhou, is advancing west along the Xiang-Gui Railway and has occupied Zhongdu, 48 kilometers northeast of Liuzhou. Here, it is divided into two teams, one team attacking 24 kilometers north of Liuzhou, and the other team killing to 19 kilometers north of Liucheng (17.5 kilometers northwest of Liuzhou). According to the Chongqing military authorities, the Chongqing army has stopped the Japanese army's advance. On the other hand, the Japanese army traveling south along the Xiang-Gui Railway and heading straight for Liuzhou has advanced to the outer defense line of Luorong. The Chongqing military authorities also admitted that the Japanese army is further intensifying pressure from 75 kilometers east of Liuzhou. The Japanese army's westward advance from Wuxuan has also seen progress. This move is clearly the Japanese army's action to prevent the Chongqing army from moving south along the street south of Liuzhou. This unit advanced 24 kilometers and has now reached 19.5 kilometers southwest of Liuzhou."

### Japanese Army in Fuzhou Expands Occupied Area

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Associated Press correspondent in Chongqing, the Chongqing military authorities previously announced that new battles have broken out in the Fuzhou area on the eastern Chinese coast, and the Japanese army is currently expanding the occupied area. The Japanese army advancing west from Fuzhou has reached a point 12 kilometers away from the city and is currently fighting with the Chongqing army.

### Chongqing Protests Too Little Material Assistance

### President Roosevelt Returns to the White House to Govern

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: President Roosevelt returned to the White House today, and the streets were crowded with enthusiastic citizens, cheering with thunderous voices. Representatives from the forty-four Allied countries are gathered at the White House, and representatives from all South American countries except Argentina are also in attendance.

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports: After being elected to a consecutive term as president, President Roosevelt has begun to consider another meeting with Churchill and Stalin and to prepare various issues for submitting domestic policy plans to Congress for discussion. Although the Democratic Party won the election, on the congressional front, apart from a few isolated senators, there will be obstacles to future domestic policy issues and post-war foreign policy plans. Secretary of State Hull may be tired of his job, and his successor may be Stettinius or Wallace. Labor Secretary Perkins may also be replaced.

Three-Headed Conference to be Held Soon

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Associated Press correspondent in Washington: Due to Roosevelt's re-election, the recent talks with Churchill and Stalin can also be confirmed. This conference will likely discuss the speedy concretization of post-war security guarantee mechanisms. The most important of these is political contention, that is, whether the fundamental issues involving US foreign policy and whether the interests of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union can be reconciled to a certain extent will be the focus of discussion. In reality, the interests of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union will tend to conflict.

Stockholm, Sweden, 10th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports: British Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech at Lord Mayor's banquet in London yesterday, expressing dissatisfaction with the slow progress of the war. He called on Roosevelt, Stalin, and himself to hold another meeting immediately, saying that the three major powers must do their best to defeat Germany's determined resistance. The wars in Italy and the Netherlands are only preludes to the future great war, which will last for several months.

Stockholm, Sweden, 10th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: According to American news from Moscow: The Soviet Union expressed great joy after learning of Roosevelt's election victory. The Associated Press stated that Roosevelt is loved by the Soviet Union because Roosevelt will prevent the United States from returning to isolationism. The average Soviet person views Roosevelt as the central figure in the Tehran Conference, and the Soviets are well aware that it was Roosevelt's government that restored US-Soviet relations.

Travel Correspondence

### Interests Away From Home

— Yifei

Reporters living in the city are indeed somewhat spoiled and pampered. In addition, having studied abroad for many years in the past, they have inevitably picked up a trace of Europeanization and become believers in material civilization. Although I am confident that I am definitely not one of those who think "the moon is better abroad," as the saying goes, "habit becomes nature," and "a deep-rooted habit is hard to change." There is indeed some small truth in this.

This time, I, as a reporter, was assigned to Nanhui to investigate the rural economy and social situation, so I had the opportunity to linger in the countryside and interact with the villagers every day. This has led to a change in my mechanical lifestyle of many years. At first, I was very unaccustomed to it, but gradually I became calm and composed. This proves that humans are animals capable of adapting to the environment. I will not count the trivial details, but will provide a few interesting things that have happened during my time away from home to the readers of this newspaper, just to elicit a smile.

Villagers Don't Recognize City Things

Before I left, my friend Xia Jun (who has a badge shop in Taishan Road) gave me a horseshoe-shaped golden pin to wish me success in my work on this trip. In order not to disappoint my dear friend's good intentions and to fulfill my own mission, I inserted it in my lapel to encourage myself. Because the style was exquisite and quite novel, after arriving here, I went to the countryside to talk with farmers about everything for days in order to understand the people's feelings and hidden pain. During each conversation, the villagers paid attention to this little thing, and although I felt very puzzled at the time, I couldn't figure out why, and just thought they were making a fuss over something they rarely saw. Until a few days ago, when I talked about planning to go to several more distant coastal areas for inspection in the near future, a farmer solemnly offered me advice, saying that the治安 was not good in that area, and that I should remove this badge to avoid complications. Only then did I suddenly realize and couldn't help but laugh silently. They had mistaken this for a certificate, which was almost comical, but at the time, their earnest concern was evident in their words, which was touching.

Eggs, Beans, and Mutton, Three Nutrients in One

It's the height of autumn, and people in the city, especially the nouveau riche, are busy planning for the winter tonic that will arrive in a flash, while those who live on salaries are probably unable to keep up with three meals a day, let alone nourishing themselves. Even basic nutrition is out of the question! I am not flaunting the wealth of the rich. To be honest, I am also a member of the latter camp, but because I have always believed in "health is capital" and in the old saying of our Eastern quintessence, "where there's life, there's hope," I always pay attention to my own nutrition within my means. This time when I came to the countryside, due to time and environmental constraints, and because there were no restaurants in the villages, I had to use local materials and ask the temporary host to buy local specialty eggs, soybean milk, and cooked mutton, and cook them together. It can be eaten in an instant, and its taste is truly endless. As for nutrition, I am afraid it is ten times better than any tonics or supplements, but the price is only one-tenth of that of tonics or supplements. This is also an invention and harvest during the trip.

Hard to Find a Free Day in the Midst of Busyness

I have been in Nanhui for a week, visiting farmhouses in the suburbs for days, searching for information, running around all day long. Although it is not without hardship, when I receive the warm and sincere hospitality of the farmers, and when I think of the responsibility of a journalist, I receive a lot of comfort in my spirit, and I have already driven the physical pain out of the clouds without shape. Now that the work in the urban area has come to an end for the time being, I will start a long journey to other places in the near future. For the sake of waiting for my companions, I have a free day to take the opportunity to visit the famous attractions of Nanhui, which is especially gratifying.

Four Dynasties Ginkgo Suffers a Great Calamity

Next to Fuquan Temple in Nanhui City, there is an ancient ginkgo tree from the Song Dynasty. It is more than a dozen 合 tall and more than ten feet long, and the trunk is empty. According to the villagers, when there is thunder and rain, flames sometimes erupt from the gaps, and huge snakes appear. A duel between dragons and tigers once took place. According to what I saw, there are still cat remains stored on the branches. The tree stands proudly, with an extraordinary spirit. According to the giant trees I have seen in the past, apart from the large tree in Robinson Village near Paris (this tree is huge and beautiful, with green leaves providing shade. Small pavilions are built between the branches, with coffee seats for tourists to rest and chat intimately.), this is the second tree. Unfortunately, this tree, which originally soared into the clouds, was easily mistaken as a target by the guerrillas outside the city, so the top branches were all sawn off, and now it has become nothing less than a bald giant. If the big tree knew, it would cry out in protest endlessly. In addition to regretting for the tree, I also feel that "a tree can live for a thousand years, but a person is only dew on the grass," so it is appropriate to strive immediately, so as not to fail this short life.

Two Generations of Grand Bells Sound No More

Just a stone's throw away from the ginkgo tree, there is Fuquan Temple, which is a nunnery. The temple is small but very clean. The courtyard is arranged in an orderly manner, and the Buddha statues are also radiant, and the altar and shrine covers are also spotless. It can be called a pure land of Buddhism, which is not comparable to the broken walls and rubble of the Chenghuang Temple in Shanghai, which is full of desolation. During the visit, all the nuns were working in the farmland in front of the temple, leaving only a young nun with her hair still growing to guard the temple. (According to the customs here, young girls come to the temple to rely on the Buddha, fearing that their six senses have not been purified and will regret it in the future, so they are temporarily allowed to live in the temple with their hair still growing, and they still have the opportunity to return to secular life at any time.) There is a bell in the temple that is as tall as it is big. It is a relic of the Ming Dynasty. I raised a wooden mallet and planned to strike it to test the sound of the bell, but the young nun stopped me, saying that its sound was very loud and could reach tens of miles away. In this time of social unrest and frequent incidents, it is easy to be misunderstood as a beacon fire, so this huge object, which is originally a grand chime, has been silenced by Jin Ren's three restraints, and has been silent for many days. Hearing this, I couldn't help but feel wronged for the grand bell, lamenting that it had suffered the same fate as the ginkgo tree.

### Advisory Committee Suggests Taking Back the Central Market, Changing it to a City-Run Business, and Increasing Entertainment Tax

The Municipal Advisory Committee held its ninth plenary meeting at the City Hall at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. The members present were: Wen, Zhao Jinqing, Lin Kanghou, Chen Bin, Yao Qing San, Chen Ri Ping, Xiang Kangyuan, Dai, Shen Si Liang, Pei Yun, Wu, Zhu Bo Zhong, Guo Shun, Ren, and more than twenty others. Secretary-General Wu of the City Government and the directors of various bureaus and departments also participated, and Mayor Chen also attended in person. Standing Committee Chairman Li Sihao was absent due to illness and was replaced by Lin Kanghou as acting chairman. First, Secretary-General Wu reported on the household rice ration price issue and the preliminary collection of the Municipal Tax Consolidation Committee. (1) Regarding the household rice ration price issue, it should originally be based on the purchase cost price. In order to reduce the burden on the citizens, the city government has found a concrete solution for the difference, so the current period will still be rationed at the original price. (2) The Municipal Tax Consolidation Committee has initially consolidated tax collection and has achieved appropriate results. The city government has allocated the increased revenue for the increased salaries and allowances of the police bureau staff and security team soldiers in October. Next, all the members discussed: (1) Please The city government should take back the central market, livestock market, and fish market as soon as possible and change them to management businesses to seek to suppress the prices of daily necessities for the citizens. The resolution was passed and sent to the two city governments for handling. (2) The resolution was passed to increase the entertainment tax (including dog racing, jai alai, horse racing, etc.) to increase revenue. The suggestion was sent to the city government. The meeting was adjourned at one o'clock.

### Navy Baojia District to Present Aircraft Naming Ceremony Tomorrow

The Naval Baojia authorities, recognizing that the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive phase, and considering the enthusiastic contributions from the people of the district to aircraft donation campaigns over the years, which have amounted to a total of 12,148,092 yuan, have decided to purchase 22 fighter aircraft and present them to the authorities to assist in the war effort.

The spirit of the Naval Garrison District in managing the Baojia has always been the best in the city. This great act of donating funds and aircraft is even more watched and praised by the whole country. Its spirit of cooperating in the Greater East Asia War is worthy of emulation by all East Asian peoples, and it is the most meaningful manifestation of the Shanghai citizens since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The grand occasion at the racecourse can be predicted. However, according to reporters, if it rains tomorrow morning, the ceremony will be postponed. All sectors of society can pay attention to Shanghai Radio (frequency 900) for broadcast news at 8:00 AM.

### "Hua Ci (Chinese Porcelain)" to be Published - Edited by Ding Huikang and Printed by This Newspaper

China has never had a special sales catalog for ancient ceramics, and even fewer detailed records. The China Art Museum and this newspaper, in view of this, have specially invited Mr. Ding Huikang to collect famous porcelain from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties and photograph them into a large volume of ancient porcelain catalogs. The entire book is printed with four-color copperplate and collotype, and the brilliance of the colors and the elegance of the forms are completely true to the original objects. The entire book is printed on heavy-weight charcoal drawing paper, further enhancing its simplicity. Mr. Ye Gongchuo of Panyu wrote in the preface: "The essence of the art of the earth, the originator of the chemical industry of the divine land, has been an example for thousands of years. After many changes, the outflow of important artifacts overseas is countless. The objects preserved in our country are somewhat inferior. To provide materials for artists' research, this is the only way to pass on to future generations." His words can be described as generous. The entire book is now scheduled to be published before the end of this month. Advance orders are only charged 10,000 yuan per copy to cover costs, and with the consent of the editor, half of the proceeds will be donated to the newspaper's student aid fund. This is a unique opportunity to appreciate ancient art and help impoverished students, and it is an indispensable reference classic for researchers and connoisseurs. However, the print run is small, so early reservations are encouraged.

### Large Number of Dachang Stores Fined

The case is still under investigation.

### Shanghai North and West Housing Registration Urgently Pursued

The Municipal Government Housing Management Committee is conducting housing registration for all existing property owners in Shanghai North and West. All houses in the area, except enemy property, must be registered by the owners in Shanghai within the specified time. The registration period is from September 1st to November 30th of this year. Owners in Shanghai must bring their original property certificates to the Shanghai North Office (27 Fusheng Road, 4th floor of the Japanese Resident Group) to apply for registration.

The housing registration area in the Shanghai North District includes the areas under the jurisdiction of the West Hongkou, Hongkou, North Sichuan Road, Tilanqiao, Yangshupu, Yulin Road, and Zhabei police branch bureaus. The Municipal Government has now ordered the branch bureaus to assist in the investigation of housing, and the branch bureaus will issue housing investigation forms to existing owners in Shanghai. After receiving the investigation form, the owners should fill it out accurately and return it to the police branch bureau, which will then submit it to the Housing Management Committee's district offices for reference during registration. The registration deadline is November 30th of this year, and owners in the area should go to register as soon as possible. Otherwise, the committee will consider the owner to be absent and cancel the registration.

### Chief Guo Discusses Police Supervision - Press Conference Held Yesterday

The Municipal Propaganda Office held the 27th press conference at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 10:00 AM yesterday (10th). The director of the Municipal Police Bureau's Supervisory Office, Guo Shaoyi, and the chairman of the Price Review Committee, Xu Tianshen (represented by Secretary Chen Shouyin), attended to report and answer questions from reporters. The report and answers are recorded as follows:

Director Guo's Report

Briefly stated: "The internal organization of this office is divided into three sections: administrative, investigation, and inspection. In addition, a reward and punishment supervision office has been set up, dividing the city into seven supervisory districts and supervising the duties of officers and police in 24 branch bureaus and seven suburban branch bureaus. We strive to be strict and swift in handling matters of merit and demerit of officers and police. Those who have been found to have committed misconduct or have failed to fulfill their duties will be punished impartially and in accordance with regulations, without any favoritism. In addition to dispatching inspectors to inspect the duties of officers and police at any time during the day, as winter defense is approaching, we are assigning inspectors to rotate and check nighttime duties to prevent negligence, and to conduct temporary inspections of the internal affairs of each branch bureau, providing detailed instructions on what should be done and what should be reformed to facilitate improvement. Officers and police who retain, extort, or engage in corrupt behavior will be immediately reported by the inspectors, and the bureau will severely punish them after verification. Moreover, we often receive reports from citizens, which are also verified and severely punished. In addition, inspectors of this office must wear uniforms and badges with the words 'Inspector' on them to facilitate identification when inspecting duties in accordance with regulations. However, because the target is too obvious, when police officers are engaged in improper business, they quickly avoid them upon seeing the arrival of inspectors. Therefore, it is extremely rare to find facts of improper conduct by police officers. Therefore, we plan to form a plainclothes inspectorate in the future to conduct close inspections to rectify police discipline. At the same time, we hope that citizens will report to this office with facts when encountering demands from officers and police. We will definitely handle them strictly in accordance with the law and will not favor anyone. We especially hope that citizens will criticize improper demands and eliminate corruption." After the report, reporters immediately raised the following questions:

Hope to Report Police Extortion

(1) Shen Bao asked: Welcoming the city police, every time they perform their official duties, they blatantly extort bribes in broad daylight, which is visible to all and not uncommon. Shanghai is an international city. Now that the concessions have been recovered and the police management is unified and independent. The police, who bear the important responsibility of maintaining law and order, dare to openly accept bribes in full view of the public. Not only do they make a laughingstock of the international community, but they also make the atmosphere of corruption more intense, and the rules of law are vanished. Has your office heard of this, and please tell us about the strategy of supervision and inspection to dispel the concerns of the public.

(2) Zhonghua Daily asked: Recently, police extortion in the streets has become more and more intensified, especially at the Tianhougong Bridge, where there are often as many as 40 or 50 police officers checking pedestrians and openly demanding money when many passengers from the North Station pass by at night. Has the Supervisory Office heard about this phenomenon, and are there any corrective measures?

(Central News Agency) asked: Although the authorities have repeatedly issued orders and strictly prohibited police officers from extorting money along the way, it is still the same. For example, in the most bustling area for citizens to travel, the Bund from Guangdong Road to Nanjing Road, they blatantly demand money in broad daylight, especially when ships arrive late at night. Such behavior by those who defend the people is enough to disturb the people. Do the authorities see this? What are the sanctions?

Because the content of the above three questions is similar, Director Guo gave a comprehensive answer, saying that the Supervisory Office had heard about the open extortion of police officers and had strictly sanctioned it. An average of 50 people are punished for misconduct every day. The branch bureaus have been repeatedly ordered to strictly restrain their subordinate police officers, and the Supervisory Office will also go to each branch bureau to give spiritual talks. In the future, more inspectors will be dispatched to patrol places such as Tianhougong Bridge. We sincerely hope that citizens will describe the facts in detail and provide their real names when reporting. The Supervisory Office will strictly keep secrets and provide the reporter with various conveniences and guarantees.

Material Review Report

Xu, the director of the Price Review Committee, reported on the recent situation of suppressing prices, and answered two questions raised by the Central News Agency as follows:

(1) What is the effect of the recent work to suppress prices?

(Answer) Since the start of this major price suppression inspection, the general price index in this city has generally stopped rising and fallen back, among which the price drop of paper, western medicine, and chemical industrial raw materials is the most significant. According to general observation, according to the recent price trend, if the suppression is not launched, the price this week will continue to rise by 20%. The difference between the two is more than 40%. However, the prices of rice, grain, oil, coal, meat, vegetables, and local goods, which are most directly related to people's lives, have risen due to the failure to unify jurisdiction, which is particularly noteworthy. Currently, we have suggested a fundamental solution to the central government regarding the two items of rice and coal, and we are also discussing with relevant agencies to unify the evaluation of other vegetables, meat, and local goods, which will soon have a reasonable solution.

(2) After the Price Review Committee announced the price, the Central Market also published a price separately. How will the Price Review Committee deal with this?

(Answer) After this city announced the official price, the Central Market published a different price in the newspaper. The Price Review Committee convened a special meeting on the 4th of this month and invited representatives from the Central Market to attend and explain the reason. The representative of the market stated on the spot that it would cancel the price it had set, and it was resolved that the market’s prices for vegetables, local goods, north-south goods, firewood, etc. shall not be published without being evaluated by the Price Review Committee or approved by the Director.

### The Impact of Actual Commodity Tax Collection on Cotton Fields

— Ye Jinghua

This autumn, Jiangsu Province is changing its land tax collection to actual commodities. Each mu (unit of land area) is taxed at one dou (unit of volume) of white rice. This is the government's decree, and the people should obey it. However, the impact on cotton fields is not in the collection of actual commodities, but in the fact that the actual commodity collected is not cotton, which the cotton fields produce, but white rice, which they do not produce at all. Furthermore, the tax rates do not differentiate between fertile and less fertile land; cotton fields and rice fields are treated the same, which increases the burden on people in cotton-producing areas. I will explain this in two points:

(1) The Impact of Uniform Tax Rates for Rice Fields and Cotton Fields: In the past, land tax rates for rice fields and cotton fields were distinctly different. Generally, the tax rate for rice fields was one and a half times that of cotton fields. This was determined based on the rate of return and was stipulated by the authorities over the years, becoming a tradition to this day. However, this year, it has suddenly and unexpectedly been changed to a uniform tax rate, without distinction, which is truly puzzling. Currently, cotton field owners receive 1,440 yuan in rent per mu, while paying land tax requires one dou of white rice (the current price is 1,100 yuan, and the future is uncertain). If they can collect all the rent, they can barely manage (but it has never been fully collected). Unfortunately, this year's cotton harvest is only a little over 50% (as it is in a corner of Changshu, my hometown), so the rent will inevitably be discounted by 50% or 60%. In this case, the owner will only receive 800 or 900 yuan per mu, which is not enough to pay the land tax even if all of it is used. Moreover, there are other miscellaneous expenses, such as commissions for collectors, accounting fees, and local donations, none of which can be omitted. Therefore, the future of cotton field owners this year is truly unimaginable, which I believe is beyond the authorities' expectations.

(2) The Impact of Paying Land Tax in White Rice for Cotton Fields: Cotton fields only produce cotton, not white rice. The grain for daily consumption in cotton-producing areas relies entirely on transportation from rice-producing areas. If unified control and transportation accidents occur, food shortages can be triggered at any time. Even now, when new rice is on the market, the price is as high as 11,000 yuan per shi (unit of volume). Therefore, it is impossible to collect white rice as land tax from cotton-producing areas, which have always had insufficient grain. Because cotton fields do not produce a single grain of rice, tenant farmers have always rented from landlords for decades, with payments calculated in national currency based on the quality of the harvest. It is absolutely impossible to ask tenant farmers to pay in white rice. Even if the government collects directly from them, it will be futile, because the fundamental problem is that there is no white rice. Thus, the owners collect national currency, but the land tax must be paid in white rice, which will inevitably lead to a mass influx of people to rice-producing areas to compete for rice, driving prices higher. In addition to directly stimulating the rise in rice prices in the producing areas, it will also affect the skyrocketing rice prices in the cotton-producing areas. Moreover, how can owners manage with their limited rent of 800 or 900 yuan per mu to purchase the ever-increasing rice prices? They will also suffer from unscrupulous rice merchants who profit in the middle, as well as various troubles such as transportation difficulties and extortion along the way, which are too numerous to mention, and will also conflict with the laws of the Rice Control Association in the interior. The owners' utter exhaustion may also be beyond the authorities' initial expectations.

The above two points are the impact of collecting white rice as tax on cotton fields. For the current plan, in my humble opinion, since the authorities are collecting "actual commodities," why not collect cotton in cotton-producing areas instead of white rice? This is the first point. Since the tax rates for rice fields and cotton fields have always been different due to different incomes, why not collect taxes at different levels? This is the second point.

Social Services

### The Good Virtue Society Pioneers Free Outpatient Treatment and Medication

The Shanghai Good Virtue Society, located at No. 52, Bin Dai Bridge, Ren Sheng Alley, Xiao Dong Men North, Nanshi, has recently, in addition to its free clinic, expanded its services in consideration of the poor and sick. Starting yesterday, it began providing free outpatient services in the old Eighth District and Hu Nan District. Poor patients in these areas who suffer from serious illnesses, cannot move, or cannot be exposed to the wind can first register at the Society, fill out an outpatient application form, and pay a registration fee of twenty yuan (initial consultation application time is from 9:00 to 10:00 AM, and follow-up consultation application time is from 7:30 to 9:00 AM). The Society will then send staff to investigate and verify the facts, and from 2:00 to 6:00 PM, they will provide outpatient services at the address. Those who cannot afford medication will also receive free medication. Daily outpatient services are temporarily limited to forty-eight people, and registration will be closed when the quota is full. The appointed doctors for the old Eighth District are Qin Bingyi, Wang Yiren, and Lu Xiaochun. The appointed doctors for the Hu Nan District are Gu Renji and Lang Shun. The Society's free outpatient service is a pioneering initiative in Shanghai.

### Charity Sale of "Cough Relief"

Sun Bonan, Guang Sheng, of the Weikang Pharmaceutical Society, wrote: "I am writing to inform you that common people often regard the onset of a cough as a minor ailment and do not pay attention to it, unaware that a persistent cough can easily develop into tuberculosis, which is extremely dangerous. Since the beginning of autumn this year, the climate has been changeable, and many people have contracted this disease. However, patients often cannot afford to buy medicine due to the high price, and suffer greatly. In view of this, our Society, based on a famous doctor's prescription, has specially produced 'Cough Relief' (Cucloin), which is made entirely with American raw materials and is specially designed to treat various coughs, such as bronchitis, phlegmatic asthma, and whooping cough in children. It can dissolve phlegm, relieve coughs, moisten the lungs, and calm asthma. The medicine tastes good, its effect is rapid, and its price is low, making it easy for the poor to purchase. We are sending four dozen bottles for charity sale, each bottle priced at 200 yuan. After deducting the cost of 120 yuan, the remaining 80 yuan will be donated to your organization's medical aid fund to help the poor."

### Master Ren Qi Donates Rubbings of Stone Tablets

We have received twenty-two rubbings of stone tablets donated by Master Ren Zhai, with instructions to sell them for charity to raise money for poverty relief. His benevolence and righteous act are admirable. Among the tablets are "The Monument Commemorating the Propagation of the Nestorian Christian Church in China during the Great Tang Dynasty," "Yao Duo Bo's Sculptures," "Yue Fei's Calligraphy of the First and Second Memorials on Dispatching Troops," the "General's Tablet" of Guangwu, the "Hui Fu Temple Tablet," the "Yun Hui General's Tablet," and rubbings of tablets by He Shaoji, Zuo Zongtang, Mi Fu, Huang Tingjian, and Fei Zhao, all of which are the best of their time. All the items are now available for charity sale at our office. We hope that benevolent gentlemen will actively participate.

Request for School Supplies: The Zhi Shan Volunteer Elementary School has been established for three semesters. In view of the large number of out-of-school children in the Nanshi District, we plan to continue to run a second elementary school in the district. The school site has been found. We are now seeking to purchase school supplies. If you are willing to sell, please send a letter to No. 5, Lane 106, Da Xing Road.

### The China Association for the Protection of Children Calls on All Sectors to Donate Funds, with a Target of Five Million Yuan. This Office Can Also Collect Donations on Behalf.

The China Association for the Protection of Children has been established for over ten years. Since the Incident (likely referring to the Second Sino-Japanese War), it has successively taken in over 10,000 refugee children. Currently, it still provides care for over 300 orphaned and impoverished children. The Association has no endowment fund and relies on donations from all sectors for its daily education and living expenses. Although it raised over two million yuan in February of this year, due to soaring prices, the expenses are enormous and fall far short of the budget, making it increasingly difficult to maintain. In addition to Lin Kanghou and Zhao Jinqing acting as guarantors for a overdraft of 500,000 yuan from the Xinhua Bank and Chen Bin contributing 10,000 yuan for routine expenses, the Association is already in debt to the tune of 800,000 yuan, making it truly unsustainable. Therefore, we have launched a fundraising campaign, earnestly hoping that enthusiastic people from all walks of life, with the spirit of "cherishing our young and extending that to the young of others," will generously donate to save the lives of 300 orphaned and impoverished children. In addition to sending donations directly to the Association, the Social Service Department of this newspaper can also collect donations on its behalf.

Receipt Report

Yan Yutang (raised by Zhao Jinqing), Zhang Buonong (raised by Zhang Xiangwen), each 20,000 yuan; Li Denghui, Chen Shengchao, Yu Huihuo, Liang Guiwenlin (the above two households raised by Zhang Xiangwen), each 10,000 yuan; De Runtang (raised by Pei Yunqing), in memory of Chen Ye (raised by Zhang Xiangwen), each 5,000 yuan; Danish Consul H. Collin 3,000 yuan; Hongxing Printing House, Hongxing Paper Company, Chen Xu Xinsai, Shi Yitang (the above two households raised by Zhang Xiangwen), each 2,000 yuan. The above totals 101,000 yuan. (Collected by the Association itself) Zhan Peilin 30,000 yuan, Sheng Enyi (marriage celebration moved to assistance) 1,000 yuan. 31,000 yuan (Collected by this newspaper on behalf)

### The Fundraising for the Home for the Aged Concludes, Still Hoping for a Continuous Flow of Donations from All Sectors

The fundraising campaign for the Shanghai Home for the Aged, which lasted for a month, has now come to an end. During this fundraising period, we received enthusiastic support from people of all walks of life, who either generously donated, economized and transferred savings, donated materials, or personally visited and observed. Although the results were not as satisfactory as expected, the nuns have already praised the benevolence and boundless gratitude. However, considering the high prices, the cost of rice, fuel, and salaries, although temporary peace can be achieved, it is ultimately difficult to remedy the long-term situation. Therefore, we still hope that benevolent gentlemen will generously donate and actively contribute, so that hundreds of frail and elderly people can be cared for in their final years. This is truly what the nuns sincerely wish and pray for. If you are willing to donate, this office will still collect donations on your behalf and transfer them as soon as they are received.

Charity Sale of Writing Instruments and Stationery for the Home for the Aged

Feng Yi Tang Writing Instrument and Stationery Store wrote: "We are writing to inform you that we have read in your newspaper about the fundraising for the Home for the Aged, which benefits widowers and widows and is of great significance. Our store cherishes the elderly and has compassion. We have decided to hold a charity sale for ten days from the 11th to the 20th of this month at our store at No. 144, Ding'an Road. The proceeds from the sale, after deducting expenses, will be donated to the Home to help with its expenses. We hope that this letter will be published so that all sectors can respond together and achieve the effect of collective effort."
