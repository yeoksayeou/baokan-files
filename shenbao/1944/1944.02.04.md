### Japan's Inevitable Victory Parliament

Since the resumption of the 84th Japanese Parliament on the 21st of last month, heated deliberations have been underway to consolidate the total power of 100 million Japanese citizens and fulfill the mission of a decisive victory. Currently, the budget for ensuring "decisive victory" and various important bills necessary for achieving victory have largely been passed by the parliament. It is expected that after this parliamentary session, following the guidance of the "Resolution to Decisively Win with Consolidated Imperial Belief," it will be possible to further unite the total power of Japan and other East Asian nations to achieve a complete victory in the Greater East Asia War.

In this Japanese Parliament, apart from the budget and diplomatic issues, the most noteworthy points for East Asian nations, especially China in its second year of participation in the war, are primarily related to increasing military production. Prime Minister Tojo stated in his policy address that the strengthening of air power has already reached more than double that of last year, and further production increases are planned; the highest technology and efficiency of Japan's textile industry will be transferred to the aircraft industry. This is entirely in response to the urgent needs of the decisive phase of the Greater East Asia War, as achieving air supremacy is essential to complete the war, allowing for the relentless annihilation of the enemy. This parliamentary session will deliberate on enhancing strategic materials and improving the production system, determining the materials plan for this year. Our China has designated this year as a year of increased production, and its goals should naturally align with the needs of the Greater East Asia War. How to advance our country's industry towards increased efficiency and rational planning under the demands of national defense should be a matter of urgent attention for both the government and the public.

Ensuring the supply of essential food and stabilizing the lives of the people are the foundation of strengthening combat capabilities, making it a central issue of this Japanese Parliament. This year, Japan can ensure an adequate supply of essential food, and Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Yamazaki has announced a food production increase plan, which by the year Showa 21 (Republic of China year 35), including Japan proper, Korea, and Taiwan, rice production will increase by nine million koku compared to the past. Furthermore, the parliamentary report revealed that Manchuria had an exceptionally abundant harvest last year, and the procurement target, as of January 5th, had exceeded the planned amount, so Japan and Manchuria can achieve self-sufficiency in essential food. Our country has always relied on agriculture, but the fish and rice lands of the southeastern provinces have in the past still relied on imported rice, not to mention assisting allied nations with food. However, how to achieve self-sufficiency should be our country's primary task today.

Regarding labor mobilization, encouraging the people to work diligently to complete combat deployment and enhance combat capabilities is, along with the food issue, the focus of Japan's administration this year. Prime Minister Tojo stated clearly in the parliament that the government has full confidence in this, outlining the labor mobilization strategy for this year and unifying the relationship between military and industrial mobilization. Our authorities are vigorously promoting "increased production," but how to mobilize the total power of the people and how to realize a new national wartime life and industrial mobilization are again issues that urgently require the attention of both the government and the public.

From the achievements of this Japanese inevitable victory parliament, we can see that the parliamentarians, bearing the heavy responsibility as representatives of 100 million citizens, enthusiastically put forward proposals and sincerely discussed them, while the government authorities frankly indicated the overall situation, clarified policies, and accepted public opinion, fully demonstrating Japan's concerted effort to advance towards decisive victory. However, looking back at our China, representative bodies have not yet been formally established, and the people's opinions cannot be directly communicated. Compared to our allied nations, we lag behind in mobilizing the masses to cooperate in the decisive battle and in uniting to exert total power. To fulfill our obligations as a participating nation and to adapt to the needs of the decisive battle, how to establish representative bodies as soon as possible, so that officials and the people can work together as one, is something that the government and the public should seriously reflect upon.

### Prices of Major Materials to be Reported Weekly to the Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Industry Orders Various Economic Bureaus to Comply

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Since the promulgation and implementation of the Provisional Regulations for Wartime Price Control, the Ministry of Industry has already instructed various economic bureaus to assess prices for daily necessities and other major materials in accordance with the regulations and strictly comply. In order to supervise its subordinates to actively promote the price policy, it has again telegraphed to the economic bureaus of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Guangdong, Jiangsu-Huai, and the Jiangxi Construction Office, instructing them to explain the categories and qualities of the assessed prices and market prices of major materials for the previous week each week and submit them by telegram for reference, and to compile and distribute them as reference materials for various places.

### Cultural Circles in the Capital Organize a Cultural Association

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) - In order to promote the total cultural power for the decisive battle, the cultural circles in Nanjing have combined various influential cultural organizations to form the Nanjing Cultural Council, which is currently intensifying negotiations to prepare for its establishment. The national bodies participating in this Cultural Council include the Nanjing Literary Research Association, the Jiangnan History and Geography Society, the Zishui Society, the Nanjing Music Association, the Economic Research Association, the Nanjing Broadcasting Drama Troupe, and the recently established Natural Science Research Association, totaling seven national bodies. The Council will be organized by representatives from each association, aiming to establish a powerful force for cultural advancement. The greatest purpose of this Council is to establish close contact with various residents to promote the local decisive battle culture. The individual journals and magazines originally published by various groups will be integrated. The Council will also handle the work of promoting Sino-Japanese cultural exchange with China, and it is expected that various activities after the establishment of the Council will be very active, and its contribution to culture is deeply anticipated.

### US Air Force Arrogance Outrages Chongqing's Military and Civilians, Chongqing Air Force Captain Discusses Recent Developments in Chongqing

Central News Agency report - A certain captain of the Chongqing Air Force expressed great indignation at the arrogant attitude of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, which is overbearing and disregards others. He left Kunming at the end of last December to participate in the peace movement. He recently discussed the recent developments in Chongqing in Shanghai as follows:

Chongqing is now completely under the control of the United States, and concerned people are deeply worried about this. For example, a certain Senator Zhang protested to Chiang Kai-shek, finding it difficult to endure the indiscriminate bombing of the US Air Force, especially during the Changde campaign, which caused enormous losses to the Chongqing side. Zhang demanded that the authorities immediately punish the US Air Force and impeach Chongqing's weak attitude. The Chongqing National Defense Supreme Council, fearing the leak of information, detained Zhang. When Chongqing saw its name listed high on the list when the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union convened a joint declaration in Moscow last October, they were quite pleased. However, this declaration soon became a dead letter, and Chongqing's post-war status was restricted. The pro-German faction in Chongqing had already accused the Moscow conference as a strategy launched by the United States, as the United States has no other way to force Chongqing to resist Japan. Chen Cheng's resignation is widely rumored to be due to dissatisfaction with the tyranny of Britain and the United States, and their contempt for Chongqing. The Chongqing army suffered enormous losses against the Japanese army on the Burmese front. What I consider most virtuous is that the Chongqing Air Force has been subordinated to the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, almost equivalent to disbanding. The Flying Tigers squadron to which I belonged was absorbed by the mixed brigade led by the United States in early November last year, under the command of Saint Nod, completely losing its autonomy.

Currently, the aircraft and military supplies shipped by the United States to Chongqing are almost entirely used by the US Air Force led by Stilwell and the US Air Force led by Saint Nod. Some are supplied in name only, and their purpose is to attempt to force Chongqing to fight. Recently, Chongqing, under the pretext of recovering Burma, recruited tens of thousands of soldiers to India, which is also one of the American conspiracies. According to senior employees of the Bank of China in Guilin, the soldiers in Changde often behaved fiercely after getting drunk, sometimes even breaking into people's homes and committing indecent acts against women and children, causing the people to hate them to the core. Secondly, what we are dissatisfied with is that the troops in the Lingnan area only know how to be officials and get rich, and they do everything from trafficking opium to defrauding money, without any sense of shame. Chongqing officials often do not have enough office expenses, which makes the soldiers' will to resist the war extremely low. In addition, due to insufficient weapons and the fierce attack by the Japanese army, they are already very afraid of fighting. Therefore, one officer even shrank back from the battle, shooting himself in the arms and legs in an attempt to leave the battlefield and go to the rear for recuperation. Currently, soldiers and officers are skeptical about the future of the war, and lower-level cadres have no combat experience. Desertions are common. When I left Chongqing, I heard that the student conscription plan was being implemented. The Chongqing military service system is very poor in its implementation. Soldiers who desert cannot be recaptured. If the number of deserters is reported to the headquarters, the uniforms must be compensated. Therefore, the current military authorities have adopted espionage methods, that is, as soon as they hear that soldiers have deserted, they immediately imprison their superiors. The citizens of Chongqing are not fully aware of the Greater East Asia War because news is blocked. However, intellectuals generally know that this war will be driven by Britain and the United States, and the result will be their sacrifice.

### Cultural Organizations in North China Preparing to Form a Federation

Beijing, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The North China Chinese Cultural Construction Association, the North China Writers Association, the Chinese Cultural Association, the Chinese Journalists Association, the North China Fine Arts Association, and the North China Music Association, six cultural national bodies, are preparing to form a cultural organization federation in order to restore and revive Chinese culture. Representatives from various national bodies held a preparatory meeting at the Japanese Alumni Association at 6:00 PM on the 3rd. After consultation, it was decided to invite the China New Drama Association and the China New Fine Arts Association to participate. The organizational rules and content of the cultural organization federation are based on the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and under the unified ideology, they aim to unite the Chinese cultural circles and create a new path for the cultural circles. The federation's headquarters will be located in Beijing, with branches set up in major cities. The headquarters will have one chairman and one vice-chairman, and three groups will be set up under them: general affairs, planning, and publishing. A general assembly will be held once a year.

### Japanese Naval Air Force Bombards Enemy Convoy, One Large Transport Ship Sunk

A certain Japanese base in the South Pacific, 3rd (Central Sky News Agency) - On January 31st, the Japanese Naval Air Force discovered an enemy convoy near Finschhafen in New Guinea. They immediately launched a fierce bombing attack, sinking one large transport ship. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.

A certain Japanese base in the Southwest Pacific, 3rd (Central News Agency) - At noon on January 31st, five enemy unified B24 aircraft came to attack Murazaki in the Arafura Sea near the Tanimbar Islands. Japanese naval fighters immediately engaged in combat, shooting down two of them. There were no losses on the Japanese side.

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to reports from San Francisco, the Allied Headquarters in the Southwest Pacific announced that on January 31st, Japanese aircraft bombed US positions at Aro and Gloucester Point in New Britain.

### Economic Trends

Coal Rationing

The price of coal has risen to 260 yuan per ton, and it is still not easy to buy. The authorities are making great efforts to implement rationing. However, the rationing is handled by four coal depots in the suburbs. With three million residents going to four coal depots to buy coal, the congestion is imaginable. However, the time for these four coal depots to sell rationed coal is also limited, only three hours a day. As a result, people make a special trip out of the city, often returning empty-handed. Coal is indeed a problem. The authorities are aware of this situation. Therefore, the authorities are working tirelessly to reach an agreement. In addition to rectifying some unscrupulous merchants, Committee Chairman Wang of the Political Committee, Director Luo of the Public Works Bureau, and Mr. Shirashima, the military administrator of the Mentougou Coal Mine Company, have conducted thorough research and have come up with a solution... Some individual vendors in the Mentougou mine have abandoned their personal sentiments and sacrificed their personal mine interests, joining the unified control association. If this association can operate smoothly and citizens can buy coal at the official price, then the coal problem can be considered to be substantially resolved.

Donation of Old Bronze Ware from the Palace Museum

The copper donation movement has reached its final stage. Each household that has already donated two and a half catties must donate another two and a half catties, and the price of scrap copper on the street has soared. Seven or eight yuan can only buy fifty or sixty old copper coins, and most of the copper door knockers in homes have also been removed to make up the number. The most interesting thing is that Director Zhu of the Palace Museum also ordered employees to collect 2,095 catties of scrap copper stored in the museum and sent personnel to donate it to the authorities in a grand manner. According to reports, the copper is unnumbered scrap copper pieces and copperware stored in various places in the museum, which have nothing to do with historical relics.

In wartime, the implementation of controlled economy is the most natural thing. However, because Chinese people have always been scattered and unorganized, they are very unaccustomed to economic control, so it is not implemented so smoothly. It can be said that it is the trend of events, and recently the people of Beijing have gradually become accustomed to it, so the implementation of various controls has followed one after another. Some time ago, cotton was controlled, and the organization began. Recently, a chemical product control agency has been established. The founding meeting of the North China Chemical Products Control Association was held at the Beijing Hotel. From then on, chemical manufactured products will also be officially included in the scope of control.

It takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to nurture people, which is our country's ancient motto. Growing trees is indeed not easy, but no one thought that a tree planted for a few cents ten years ago is now worth so much money. The timber in North China has always come from the Philippines, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Manchuria. In recent years, because the transportation lines have been cut off by the god of war, it is extremely difficult to get timber from abroad, and only Manchuria can provide some assistance. However, the construction in North China has increased a lot in recent years, and wealthy families always prefer to turn their savings into courtyards for some reason. As a result, demand has increased, the supply route is lacking, and some of the timber previously stored has greatly increased in price. Now, even the mahogany used for a piece of glass frame costs forty yuan. There is also an interesting situation, that is, in recent years, due to the sharp rise in food prices, quite a few people have died directly or indirectly from starvation. The increase in the mortality rate is also reflected in the price of coffins, and even the lowest-grade coffin must cost four to five hundred yuan. Yesterday, the reporter was sitting in a rickshaw and talking to a foreign soldier, who said an interesting thing: "Sir, do you think we can just starve to death if we don't have food to eat? We can't even afford to die. The cheapest coffin board costs four or five hundred yuan. Where can we get that from?" (Sent on January 22)

### China and Japan Should Sincerely Cooperate to Promote the Prosperity of Greater East Asia, Vice Minister Answers Question from Representative Akamatsu

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese House of Peers did not hold a plenary session today. The Budget General Meeting and the Yuiku Houin Security Committee were held at 10:00 AM, the Income Tax Law Bill Committee was held at 11:00 AM, the Settlement Committee was held at 1:00 PM in the afternoon, and the Deficit Bill Committee was held at 1:30 PM. The House of Representatives held a plenary session at 1:00 PM this afternoon, passing seven items including litigation costs and Korean private railways. The North China Development and Reserve Fund Expenditure Commitment Case, etc., and the Special Construction Case, ensuring the increase in aquatic products, establishing the overseas fellowship subsidy fund system, security, and establishing three favorable national policies, etc.

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Vice Minister Yamaki of the Japanese Ministry of Greater East Asia answered the question of Representative Tanaka Itoichiro regarding the "Greater East Asia Vertical Railway Construction Plan" at the House of Representatives Settlement Committee on the 3rd. The gist is as follows: Strengthening transportation facilities in the management of Greater East Asia and creating a great artery for Greater East Asia is essential. The government has had a plan for this point for a long time and has implemented sufficient investigations. Especially in the field of maritime transport, it is more urgently felt by all parties. Looking at the countries concerned, in order to promote industrial development or increase transportation capacity, they are also considering the same as Japan. The Japanese government is currently promoting various measures to this end in close liaison with all parties. As for the specific situation, it is difficult to report, but it has made more progress this year than last year, which is gratifying.

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency)

When the Japanese House of Representatives Settlement Committee met on the 3rd, it discussed the question of Akamatsu Torashichi: What impact does Japan's new policy toward China have on the general public of China and Japanese residents in China? What about the security, food, and price issues in North China? Vice Minister Yamaki of the Greater East Asia Ministry answered that the general public of China now fully understands Japan's new policy toward China and is cooperating with Japan in their respective positions. The maintenance of security and the food problem are both urgent tasks from the perspective of stabilizing people's livelihoods. The National Government has made great efforts in this regard. The key to solving the price problem lies in the development of light industry and the smooth exchange of materials between cities and agricultural areas. Vice Minister Yamaki answered as follows:

China-Japan Relations Are Clearer

Since the implementation of the new policy toward China last January, Japan has gradually implemented the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality, so the general public of China has gradually understood Japan's position of righteousness. According to the Chinese government authorities and intellectuals, they have gradually thoroughly understood Japan's true intentions. As for the general public, because they are in wartime, their lives may be threatened and restricted to a certain extent, but they have not been directly affected. Moreover, Japan has been implementing what is agreed upon in the treaties, such as the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality. The Chinese side has gradually understood Japan's sincerity in this regard. Recently, the Chinese people's trust in Japan's intentions has increased even more. Since the conclusion of the China-Japan Alliance Treaty at the end of last October, Japan's relations with China have become clearer. Since the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was issued, Japan's intentions have been expressed to the countries of Greater East Asia and the world. In the future, the impact on the general public will be great. The abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions have had a considerable impact on the Chinese people. The Japanese in China have also thoroughly understood the significance of Japan's new policy toward China, and to this day, they have a more thorough understanding. China and Japan should sincerely cooperate to promote the relationship between China and Japan and the prosperity of Greater East Asia. This is not the same as the deceptive policies of Britain and the United States in the past, nor is it Japan's intention to monopolize any benefits. It is a matter of being on an equal footing and respecting each other to enhance friendship.

Joint Efforts to Establish Security

The Chinese and Japanese authorities are currently making the greatest efforts to establish security. The Japanese military is making even greater efforts in this regard. From the perspective of stabilizing people's livelihoods, maintaining security, enhancing combat capabilities, and developing resources, solving the food problem is the most important thing. Therefore, we are now aiming to achieve self-sufficiency in food as much as possible and are implementing various production increase plans, as well as thoroughly handling specific purchase methods. At the same time, we are importing as much food as possible from Manchuria or various southern regions. Regarding the actual situation of agriculture in North China, considerable efforts are being made in areas such as the improvement of farmland water conservancy facilities, the popularization of seeds, the improvement of cultivation methods, the prevention of insect pests, and the training of technical personnel. The most successful of these is the well-digging method. This method has been encouraged since two or three years ago, and at the same time, the improvement of soil quality has been promoted. Although there has recently been a shortage of fertilizers and seeds, most of them are still sufficient. In addition, the dredging of canals and the construction of tree planting projects are also being started to increase food production. Based on this food production increase outline, the National Government has launched a production increase movement. Recently, Japanese experts such as Dr. Nasu have been studying all practical problems. Other measures such as the development of lake shores and the reclamation of saline land are also being advocated to establish security.

Importing Food to Suppress Prices

Regarding the issue of importing food from Manchuria, a plan has been established this year to increase the amount considerably compared to last year. There are also considerable plans for importing food from various southern regions. Regarding the "price problem," since the outbreak of the war, due to the cessation of imports from abroad and the influence of the world economy, prices have risen significantly. However, the National Government is making every effort to implement various policies to suppress price increases and striving to establish fair prices. Regarding increasing production, the main thing is to seek to have light industries and other industries largely operated by China. Also, regarding the purchase of materials, due to the shortage of materials, it is difficult to proceed smoothly. However, recognizing the importance of materials, the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth was implemented last year. Light industrial products, such as matches, which are daily necessities, are indispensable for rural areas, so production must be increased in order to smooth the exchange of materials between rural and urban areas. This is also an important key to solving the price problem, and the Chinese side is continuing to work hard in this direction. In short, in order to be good at the current situation, increasing combat capabilities lies in the active cooperation between China and Japan.

### Japanese Forces in Northern Burma Repeatedly Launch Counterattacks, Stilwell Admits that Operations are Difficult

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing army stationed in India, driven by the US military, is currently building a new highway to replace the Burma Road, attempting to advance to the Fuhsien area, but it is often attacked by the Japanese army and has suffered heavy losses. Stilwell, the commander of the US army stationed in India, also admitted that the Japanese army's counterattacks are tenacious. One day, he pointed out the difficulty of operations in that area, saying: "The Chinese army in the Hukawng Valley is attempting to advance to northern Burma, while the Japanese army is trying to prevent the Chinese army from building a new highway. Their counterattacks are quite fierce. Although the number of operations is not as high as in Europe, considering the difficulties of the terrain and dense forests, the operations in that area can be said to be extremely fierce."

### Japan's Population Problem Under the Decisive Battle: Minister Koizumi's Answer to Congressional Inquiries

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Labor and Pension Insurance Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives held a meeting on the afternoon of the 3rd. Representative Tsunekichi Yamazaki questioned how the population problem would be addressed under the decisive battle. Minister Koizumi replied as follows: The increase in Japan's population is extremely rapid and has already attracted the attention of people around the world. It is widely believed by foreigners that the population will decrease during the fourth and fifth years of the war. However, in Japan, during the fourth and fifth years after the start of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the birth rate was approximately 2.2 million, with a natural increase of over one million. To this day, Japan has exceeded one million in natural increase twice, a feat that is unmatched by other countries, which is truly gratifying. The population trend today is generally like this. If we create a population structure chart based on gender and age, it can be shown as a pyramid-shaped population diagram. Conversely, the foundation of population growth in the United States (including blacks) is extremely alarming. Since the year before last, its foundation has been deteriorating, and this is especially evident among the white population. The English have poor physical condition, appearing as a small, obese middle section, shaped like a wine bottle. The foundation of the German population also suffered from the impact of the World War. However, since the Nazi Party took power thirteen years ago, due to vigorously promoting population policies, the situation has improved considerably. However, during this war, the Germans, since last year, have had the same shortcomings as the Soviets. Only Japan has not been affected by this. However, since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the impact of the youth and prime-age men going to war will not only be a problem now but will also become a major problem in the future. Therefore, we must seek countermeasures from all aspects.

### Generous Treatment of Enemy Nationals in China by Japan

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - During a session of the Budget Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives on the 1st, Representative Sakuzo Ide asked about the treatment of enemy nationals detained by Japan in China. (According to Mr. Ide, who visited various enemy national detention camps in China last autumn, he inquired whether the treatment was more favorable than the treatment of detained Japanese by enemy countries.) Vice-Minister Yamamoto replied that the treatment of enemy nationals detained in China initially did not adopt a group living approach, but since January of last year, a group living approach has gradually been implemented. The specific measures for the treatment of detained Japanese expatriates by enemy countries have not yet been investigated. In some aspects, our treatment of detained enemy nationals in China may be more favorable than the treatment of detained Japanese expatriates by enemy countries. However, the current government, in light of the current situation, is carefully considering the treatment of enemy nationals to avoid affecting Japanese expatriates detained abroad, so that the enemy can know that Japan is a righteous and moral international nation.

### Japanese Government Decides to Establish an Embassy in Croatia

Zagreb, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Havas News Agency reports: The Japanese government has decided to establish an embassy in Croatia. The Croatian people expressed their welcome, considering it a new development in Japanese-Croatian relations.

### Head of Overseas Chinese Association Pays Respects to Philippine President

Manila, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the independence of the Philippines, the Overseas Chinese in Manila, in the name of the Overseas Chinese community, have fully cooperated in the construction of the new Philippine islands. Now, Mr. Xunlai Wu, head of the Philippine Overseas Chinese Association, specially paid respects to Philippine President Laurel on the morning of the 3rd and expressed the determination of the Overseas Chinese to fully cooperate with the Philippine government in all aspects of security, economy, and society in the future.

### Ambassador Cai Pei Makes a Statement

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Our Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Cai Pei, visited His Imperial Highness Prince Mikasa at his residence at 4:00 PM on the 3rd to express his gratitude. They spoke for a long time before he took his leave.

Therefore, our government and the public deeply appreciate His Highness's enthusiasm. We are extremely pleased that His Highness has been honorably transferred to become a staff officer in the General Staff Office of the Army. We firmly believe that Sino-Japanese relations will be further promoted in the future, and the Greater East Asia War can be completed at an early date.

### Agricultural Production Increase Conference Scheduled to Be Held

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Construction, and the Ministry of Industry will jointly convene an agricultural production increase conference for various provinces and cities, scheduled to be held at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association on February 9th and 10th. As the conference is approaching, the three ministries held the first preparatory meeting at the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce on Baixia Road on the afternoon of February 2nd at 3:00 PM. Attendees included Mr. Xiaobiao Yin and Mr. Shian Zhou, Department Directors from the Ministry of Food, Mr. Fusheng Wang, a Technical Supervisor, Mr. Yumin Tong and Mr. Youyi Zhong, Counselors, and Mr. Shouqian Shen, Mr. Qianyuan Guo, and Mr. Zongwen Zou, Section Chiefs.

Representatives from various provinces and cities should report to the preparatory office at the Ministry of Food one day in advance. At that time, the heads of various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan and senior officials and advisors from allied nations will be invited to provide guidance. This conference will make a significant contribution to the future of agricultural production increase.

### India's Independence Sentiment is Rising, and Britain is Anxious and Uneasy; Strategic Propaganda Only Leads to Mental Fatigue and Ineffectiveness

Central News Agency, Shanghai - Since last year, the anti-Axis powers have been constantly propagating post-war management issues, with the aim of attempting to lure neutral countries in Europe as an insidious strategy solely for the benefit of Britain and the United States. In particular, this post-war management is premised on the victory of the anti-Axis powers, arbitrarily engaging in self-serving propaganda, causing those who understand the true content to secretly laugh. Britain and the United States harbor the ambition to lure weak neutral countries into their own camp, attempting to reduce the burden of fighting against the Axis powers without bloodshed. This can be clearly seen from the previous Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, where the name of Korea was listed to urge it to engage in resistance against Japan. Recently, Britain has been increasingly explicit in its external propaganda regarding the Indian issue after the war. According to a Washington telegram on the 27th, the British Ambassador to the United States, Halifax, stated in a speech at the American Geographical Society that Britain would not interfere with India's desire to sever ties with the British Empire after the war. However, as the situation in the Burma war is deteriorating, and the Provisional Government of Free India has already been established, Halifax's statement cannot provide any reversal for India. Furthermore, India has long suffered from British oppression, and an unprecedented famine is currently occurring. Britain has still failed to take any concrete and effective measures. Therefore, the Indian people, seeing their weak and unparalleled state, have long been unable to trust them. Subjectively, this statement is nothing more than an admission that they have no ability to assist India, attempting to escape their responsibility. Objectively, it is because they recognize that India's independence sentiment is extremely surging and cannot be suppressed, fearing revenge in the future, and thus preparing to retreat early. As the situation in India becomes increasingly tense, Britain's anxiety is even greater. To prevent any uprising, they have specially dispatched a unit of British West African border troops to India. According to their propaganda, the African border troops are the world's best forest warriors. Britain has specially subjected these border troops to several months of jungle living to prove their excellence. However, it remains to be seen how these animal-like African soldiers will perform in the future. What cannot be ignored is that Britain is constantly carrying out various strategies and propaganda, driving people of color to confront the Japanese army, while attempting to avoid war themselves.

### Churchill Warns the Nation

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a report from London: In a letter to the candidate for the Brighton constituency, British Prime Minister Churchill warned the nation not to harbor unfounded optimism and cautioned against unrealistic beliefs in various aspects of Britain's strength, assuming that the end of the war is imminent. Informed sources believe that this is a timely warning. Once the second front launches a fierce battle, it is expected that the British people should better prepare themselves to cope with the shocks, sacrifices, and casualties in the largest and most dangerous war in history.

### British King Receives US Air Force Commander

Amsterdam, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a report from London today: Yesterday, British King George VI received US Air Force Commander General Spaatz and Deputy Commander Eaker at Buckingham Palace.

### Fierce German Resistance, Cannon Fire Heard in Rome; Strength of Both Sides Reaches 250,000

Rome, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Havas News Agency Special Correspondent Vilmeron stated today: The sound of cannon fire heard in Rome is getting louder, indicating that the front line is not far away. Since Tuesday, the eleventh day after the anti-Axis forces landed in Anzio, the sound of cannon fire from both the German and anti-Axis forces can be heard indoors. However, although the war has approached, there has not been much change in the external appearance of Rome.

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - It has been ten days since the anti-Axis forces landed in Anzio, and the war seems to be intensifying. According to reports from the German front line, the anti-Axis forces have mobilized 750,000 tons of ships, gathering troops, tanks, artillery, bullets, fuel, and food at the Anzio beachhead. The German forces are also continuously reinforcing, and the combined strength of the two armies now facing each other is approximately 250,000. The German authorities also acknowledge that the strength of the anti-Axis forces on this front is substantial. Marshal Kesselring has also reinforced the Anzio encirclement with astonishing agility. The main force advancing on the shortest route between Anzio and Rome is the American troops. According to Reuters, their vanguard has reached Campoleone, only twelve miles from Rome, and is under heavy attack by the German forces. The fighting south of Cisterna is also very fierce, with powerful German tank units being quite active. The naval gun fire from the anti-Axis forces is said to have stopped, indicating that the landing operation seems to have been completed and the battlefield has moved outside the range of naval gun fire. According to the Associated Press: The US Fifth Army units in the Cassino sector are launching a breakthrough attack on the Gustav Line over several miles, while the German forces are still bravely resisting from their mountain positions a few miles north of the city of Cassino.

### Italian City of Bologna Suffers a Horrific Air Raid

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a report from Rome: The anti-Axis air force once again carried out a horrific bombing of the city of Bologna on the 1st, causing numerous civilian casualties and extensive damage to residential areas. The former buildings of the University of Bologna and the Burcarli Church were destroyed, and the Church of San Giovanni and the Basilica of San Petronio were also heavily damaged.

### Spain Expresses Determination to Maintain Neutrality; Britain and the United States Plan to Continue Applying Pressure

Madrid, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to Havas News Agency: The Falangist Party organ "Arriba" forcefully stated yesterday that Spain is determined to strictly adhere to neutrality "at any cost." It stated that the economic pressure exerted by the anti-Axis powers, such as the embargo on oil to Spain, will not cause Spain to abandon its policy of strict neutrality. Spain is prepared to cope with the new situation and is seeking to overcome the difficulties caused by the oil embargo. The Spanish people are willing to maintain the integrity of the country at any cost and can therefore endure the restrictions imposed on them. We firmly believe that there are no problems between Spain and the belligerent nations that cannot be resolved through normal diplomatic channels. The newspaper stated that friendship as strong as Spain's cannot be obtained by coercive means.

Lisbon, Central News Agency, 3rd - According to a United Press International report from London: Responsible circles in London believe in the rumors that Spain is about to sever ties with the Axis powers, but also believe that General Franco may be forced to resign due to the threat of Britain and the United States suspending the supply of food and kerosene. British diplomatic personnel expect Foreign Secretary Eden to soon state in the House of Commons whether Britain and the United States will continue to exert pressure to force Franco to abandon his neutral policy and join the anti-Axis alliance, or form a government that Britain and the United States can control.

### Soviet Union Adopts a Local System for National Defense and Foreign Affairs; This Move Has Two Major Implications

Moscow, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov attended the tenth session of the Supreme Soviet on the 1st, explaining in detail the reasons for creating National Defense and Foreign Affairs Committees in the constituent republics of the Union and requesting its passage. After four hours of discussion, the assembly unanimously passed the resolution. From now on, each republic of the Union will have an independent Foreign Affairs Committee, with the authority to independently establish diplomatic relations with foreign countries and conclude treaties. They will also have the freedom to independently build their armed forces and secede from the Soviet Union. This move seems to revise Articles 14, 17, and 18 of the Stalin Constitution, which was enacted in December 1936.

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov clarified the new policy of granting defense and diplomatic rights to the federal republics at the Supreme Soviet on the 1st. He explained that the Soviet army is fighting to liberate the three Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) and the Montville Republic. This move by the Soviet Union has two major implications: first, it indicates a significant change in the structure of the Union; second, it reveals the Soviet Union's intention to incorporate the three Baltic states and Czechoslovakia (whose exiled government had concluded a 20-year mutual assistance treaty with the Soviet Union) into its territory. From now on, the federal republics will have much broader powers than ever before. From this, it can be further discerned that the Soviet government is seeking to develop a coalition with countries with socialist leanings, harboring ulterior motives. In his speech, Molotov revealed the Soviet Union's intention to incorporate the three Baltic states into Soviet territory, as the three countries had once been annexed by the Soviet Union. As for the so-called Montville Republic, it undoubtedly refers to Czechoslovakia, led by Benes. The Soviet Union wants to incorporate even Czechoslovakia, which has never joined the Union, extending from Poland along the Baltic coast to Czechoslovakia. The Soviet Union also wants to annex it. Relations between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union have already been strained due to the Soviet-Polish border issue, and this move by the Soviet Union will undoubtedly have a considerable impact on British and American feelings towards the Soviet Union. Molotov's speech about the Soviet Union heading towards a new national union system contains the possibility of a head-on collision with the new international organization discussed by Britain and the United States after the war. It is expected that the relations between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union will become more complicated due to this move by the Soviet Union.

Summary of Molotov's Speech

Stockholm, Sweden, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - TASS, the official Soviet news agency, reports: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a speech on the reorganization of the National Defense and Foreign Affairs Committees at the Supreme Soviet. The main points are as follows: The Soviet Foreign Minister stated that the Red Army was previously the army of the entire Soviet Union and was not composed of separate units from the Soviet republics. The Soviet government now proposes to establish armies for each republic of the Soviet Union as part of the Red Army. Therefore, the Soviet Federation should establish a National Defense Committee to adapt to the new organization. Although there have long been units of various nationalities in the Red Army, such as the Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian, Georgian, Armenian, and other armies, from today onwards, all people of the Soviet Union have their appropriate place in the Red Army, and Soviet legislation has long imposed no restrictions on the conscription of troops from various states. However, there is still some time before conscription is implemented throughout the Soviet Union. The Soviet people's love for the Red Army has gradually grown during the course of this war, and everyone knows that the Red Army is now fighting to liberate Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Moldova, and the Karelian-Finnish Republic. Furthermore, the Red Army is not only liberating millions of people of its own nationalities but is also fighting for the freedom of democratic countries. The change in the constitution has shown that the friendship of the Soviet people is increasing, which is seen as strengthening the authority of the Soviet Union in both the East and the West. The Soviet Union's international government relations have always been handled centrally by the Federation's committees, and the government now proposes to authorize the republics to open up direct relations with foreign countries and negotiate treaties. Therefore, each Soviet state must establish its own Foreign Affairs Committee, and from the Federation's committees to separate Foreign Affairs Committees, the Soviet Union's desire for Pan-Slavic relations is gradually increasing. Not only does the Soviet Union have good relations with Europe, but it also maintains good friendship with the United States. Discussing the Soviet-Czech Pact, the Soviet Foreign Minister stated that this is proof of the continued improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and European countries and establishes the foundation for post-war cooperation and the maintenance of peace between the Soviet Union and democratic countries. Discussing the expansion of the international political relations of the Soviet states, he stated that due to the economic and cultural needs of each state, the existing Pan-Soviet overseas representatives could not meet these needs. The way to meet them is to establish direct relations between each state and foreign countries, which will strengthen the Soviet Union's relations with foreign countries.

Strengthening the Post-War Diplomatic Position

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - After the Soviet Union granted diplomatic powers to its sixteen republics, a considerable reaction seems to have arisen within the United States, and some are even advocating granting diplomatic powers to each continent to counter the Soviet Union. According to an Associated Press report from Moscow, after the Soviet Union took this measure, its diplomatic position in Europe will be significantly strengthened. It is believed that the Soviet Union will not only be able to send sixteen representatives to join the League of Nations, but also be able to send the same number of representatives to participate in various anti-Axis conferences, so its impact is extremely great. According to an Associated Press report from Washington, this move by the Soviet Union is mainly aimed at Britain.

### Tank Battle on the Estonian Border; German Army Successfully Avoids Engagement Strategically

Stockholm, Sweden, 3rd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Combined front-line news from the northern front of the Eastern Front: After the German army retreated from the city of Kingisepp, the Soviet army, pursuing the German army, arrived at the western bank of the Luga River on the 2nd. Via Klooga, they have reached the Estonian border and are currently attempting to advance to Narva in one fell swoop along the north and south of the Tallinn railway. However, the German army is holding the city of Kehra, making efforts to stop the Soviet army. A fierce mechanized battle is unfolding on the Estonian border. Detailed battle conditions on that front have not yet been determined. However, according to an Associated Press report from Moscow, a major event will occur within 24 hours. Furthermore, the Soviet army, aiming for Luga, has reached the Luga-Pskov highway 40 kilometers north of Luga. They have been stopped by the German army at Finskaya. Furthermore, although the Soviet army's attack from the Padereka area, 60 kilometers west of Novgorod, has strengthened the pressure on Luga, the German army has avoided the sharp edge of the Soviet army by using retreat tactics. Furthermore, the Soviet army's attempt to encircle and annihilate the German army in the area north of Lake Ilmen seems to have failed.

### The Foundation for Resolving the Sino-Japanese Problem

The Greater East Asia War, welcoming 1944 as the year of the decisive battle, aims to expel the European and American aggression forces that have shackled East Asia for a century and lay the foundation for the true independence and autonomy of each allied nation in order to liberate Greater East Asia. However, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, which was issued last November with the participation of representatives from each allied nation, more fully expressed the highest principle of this war objective. Simultaneously with the issuance of this declaration, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was concluded, which can be regarded as the key to the liberation of Greater East Asia. The solution to the Sino-Japanese problem was more clearly defined.

The entanglement between China and Japan began around the Sino-Japanese Treaty of 1871 and the Ganghwa Treaty of 1876. It grew through the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, the Boxer Rebellion, and the Russo-Japanese War, and eventually developed into the Jian Island issue, the Fakumen incident, the Anfeng Railway issue, the Nanjing Incident, the Twenty-One Demands, the May Fourth Movement, etc. Numerous fierce struggles were repeatedly re-enacted. Finally, through the May 30th Incident and the Jinan Incident, it developed into the September 18th Incident, the January 28th Incident, the July 7th Incident, and the August 13th Incident. From the perspective of the stage of mutual opposition and struggle, it shifted from Korea to Manchuria, then to North China, and finally expanded to the entire territory of China, so the nature of the opposition between the two countries became increasingly fierce.

Just as Britain used cannon fire to force China to open its doors, in 1845, the Dutch letter foreshadowed the same impending danger for Japan. The focus of Japanese diplomacy during the Meiji era was on how to lift the oppression of Europe and the United States and build a modernized nation. China, having already suffered from British cannon fire and concluded humiliating treaties, was also spontaneously developing this demand. The Taiping Rebellion is the best example. The long and tragic conflict between China and Japan arose from the struggle of both countries to escape the oppression of advanced European and American countries. The reason why the conflict between China and Japan became infighting and became so acute was the deeply rooted special rights of Europe and the United States in the Far East. For the Sino-Japanese negotiations in 1871, it was claimed that the mediation of European and American countries was needed, and attempts were made to interfere. The Sino-Japanese opposition in Korea was entirely caused by the illegal recognition of Korea as a Chinese territory by the Anglo-Korean and German-Korean treaties. Later, the southward expansion of Tsarist Russia further sharpened the Sino-Japanese opposition. The Kachin Treaty, the Triple Intervention, the conspiracy of the Four-Power Loan Group, the US intervention in the Manchurian issue, the Washington Treaty, the Nine-Power Treaty, the League of Nations, British and American economic aid to China, currency reform, the Silver Agreement, and the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation all had the European and American powers interfering in the Far East behind the scenes, and finally led the two major nations of China and Japan to a point where war was inevitable.

From this historical perspective, it is absolutely impossible for China and Japan to resolve their conflict by simply engaging in mutual killing and fighting within Asia. Unless the external forces manipulating the interior of Asia are resolved, it will not be possible to resolve the complicated Sino-Japanese opposition. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to unite all the Eastern countries oppressed by external forces and engage in a common struggle.

The Allied nations formed by the Greater East Asia Declaration are engaged in the Greater East Asia War, which has such a historical mission. Therefore, the resolution of the China issue and the independence and autonomy of the Far Eastern countries all depend on the victory of this war, otherwise there is no solution. On the occasion of welcoming this year of the decisive battle, this is the realization that every East Asian person should have.

### The National Government's Price Control Policy Moves Forward

The reasonable suppression of prices is the key to stabilizing public sentiment and the biggest issue in wartime economic construction. On the other hand, it also significantly affects Japan's war economy in promoting Greater East Asia trade, and great concern is held for its success.

The National Government has long attempted to promote a vigorous price control policy from both the commodity and currency aspects. At the Central Political Conference on the 13th, the "Temporary Regulations for Wartime Price Management" were approved, to be implemented shortly. These regulations are designed to adapt to changing circumstances, revising existing temporary measures, and establishing price review committees in major cities. Each committee will decide prices appropriately based on local conditions, granting autonomous powers to local trade associations to ensure smooth exchange of goods across regions, thereby suppressing prices. This is expected to be of great benefit to stabilizing public sentiment and restoring the economy.

The high prices in Central China today are not necessarily due to currency inflation. Before the war, the currency circulating in the current Reserve Note area was estimated at about 700 million yuan. Currently, the amount of Reserve Notes issued is extremely small compared to the rate of price increases. Therefore, the price increases in Central China are not due to excess currency, but rather can be seen as due to the imbalance of goods and psychological effects. When goods are unevenly distributed and exchanges are obstructed, prices naturally rise, and currency inflates accordingly. This is the characteristic of price increases in Central China. Therefore, to say that price increases in Central China are due to currency inflation is to mistake the cause for the effect.

Therefore, the solution to the price problem requires efforts on the commodity side. Around the time of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the price control policy implemented by the Shanghai Municipal Council was effective in the area of major foods such as rice and wheat. However, it did not achieve much in the control of general prices. The main reason was that it only specified official prices without regulating supply and demand relationships, that is, it did not take radical measures to suppress prices. Now that it is increasingly difficult to import goods from the outside, the smooth exchange of goods located in various places is even more necessary. If the exchange of goods is smooth, it can also stimulate production and indirectly increase the power of currency. The economy of the New China can obviously return to stability.

Price control policies can only produce effects if they are comprehensively and universally promoted from both the commodity and currency aspects. However, this is not something that the government can do alone. Close cooperation with the people is necessary. The regulations announced this time give local trade associations autonomous powers, allowing them to pour out their creativity and enthusiasm, which is a sign that the price control policy has taken a step forward, and great expectations are likely to be held.

### Transport of Rice Flour and Rice Products Limited to Eight Kilograms; Otherwise, Treated as Smuggling of Grain

Central News Agency reports: The Rice and Grain Control Committee believes that rice and grain control is originally intended to regulate the people's food supply. The collection, transportation, and supply should be handled in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations for the Management of Rice Transportation and Sales in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui" promulgated by the central government to maintain the people's food supply and respect the law. It has been found that some merchants and people are manufacturing and transporting large quantities of rice flour and rice products (such as New Year cakes and zongzi) in order to avoid the crackdown on the aforementioned regulations, which has a significant indirect impact on rice and grain control. The matter has been resolved by the third meeting of the committee. In the future, all transports of rice flour and products, regardless of name or purpose, shall be subject to the aforementioned regulations, with a limit of eight kilograms. Exceeding this limit shall be treated as smuggling of grain and shall be cracked down on in accordance with the law. In addition to reporting to the Executive Yuan for record, a letter has also been sent to the municipal government to notify and implement it. The municipal government has approved the letter and notified its subordinates to implement it accordingly.

Meeting Postponed

The Rice and Grain Control Committee, in order to review the past and promote future work, originally scheduled to hold a joint meeting starting on the 7th of this month, with the date scheduled for three days, and the attendees were department heads and above of the committee and the directors of offices in various regions. As the inspection teams dispatched by the committee to various regions recently will not be able to complete their tasks until after one week, and the inspection situation must also be reported in detail before the meeting for reference, the committee has decided to postpone the meeting to February 15. A telegram has been sent to the offices in various regions and a letter has been sent to each attendee.

### 26th Period Cigarette Ration Reduced

Although the rationing association has repeatedly tried to reform the method of cigarette distribution, it has still not been able to get on the right track. Cigarette scalpers continue to be active, and the number of cigarette vendors is increasing daily. Legitimate smokers cannot buy cigarettes, and they all deeply hope that the Bureau can implement proper methods and severely crack down on cigarette vendors. It is reported that the China Tobacco Rationing Association has now started the 26th period cigarette rationing. The rationing quantity of each grade in this period has been reduced. Grade A is 13,671 yuan, 1 jiao and 3 fen; Grade B is 7,165 yuan, 9 jiao and 8 fen; Grade C is 34,241 yuan, 1 jiao and 5 fen; and Grade D is 1,884 yuan, 5 jiao and 5 fen. The price remains unchanged.

### The Boiled Water Industry Association Requests an Extension of Water Usage Limit; Please Forward Instructions to the Water Plant to Maintain Business

Since the French Concession Water and Electricity Company implemented water and electricity usage limits in January, all boiled water shops in the area have been penalized for exceeding the tap water usage limit. The Shanghai Special Municipality Boiled Water Industry Association, according to the request of its members, plans to forward a report to the Shanghai Special Municipality Food Bureau, Social Welfare Bureau, and Economic Section of the First District Public Office today, requesting that the French Concession Water Company cancel the tap water usage limit for boiled water shops from this month onwards, in order to continue business. The original text is recorded as follows:

Water Shop Usage Has Always Been High

According to letters from members such as Xingfa and Yile, "We have found that our businesses primarily sell hot water. The raw materials needed on weekdays are tap water, coal, and coal slag. Shanghai has been affected by the current situation. The source of coal is not smooth, and our situation is extremely difficult. Unexpectedly, the French Concession Water Company has again limited tap water usage starting in January of this year, which is like a bolt from the blue. We have found that the daily water usage of boiled water shops has always been higher than that of other users.

Special Extension of Water Usage Limit Should Be Granted

At a time when there is a coal shortage and the public's need for boiled water is increasing sharply, if the monthly water usage of boiled water shops is treated the same as that of residents, all businesses will be forced to close. At that time, four major social problems will follow, affecting society and the people's livelihood greatly. We have always admired your association for your pain and have repeatedly tried to solve our difficulties. Therefore, we have jointly requested that you forward a report to the competent authorities to understand our situation and extend our water usage limit to alleviate our difficulties and maintain our business."

Forward Instructions to the Water Plant to Consider Granting an Extension

"Based on this, we have found that the claims of the industry are indeed true. If relief is not given, the future is unimaginable. Therefore, we have submitted this report to your bureau (office) to ask you to consider the difficulties of the industry and immediately forward instructions to the French Concession Water Company to consider extending the water usage limit for boiled water shops. We hope that you will approve it, as it will benefit both the public and the industry." Yesterday, a reporter from Shanghai News Agency learned from the owners of the boiled water shops that they are all small businesses that have always abided by the law. Although flat-price coal has not yet arrived, they are following orders. However, they hope that the authorities will provide sincere relief.

### Remembering Mr. Shen Meisou's Calligraphy

— Cai Chengsheng

Mr. Shen Zipei of Jiaxing, also known as Meisou, was well-versed in various books and had a noble character. He was a scholar of the Qing Dynasty. His calligraphy is purely in the square-pen style, strange and unrestrained, like dragons soaring and phoenixes dancing, with thousands of changes, indescribable. Every stroke is a wonderful truth. In one piece, the characters are different in shape and the lines are different in state. They lean left and look up right, bend right and extend left, each to the extreme. He created a strange style that no ancient calligrapher had, and he can be said to surpass the ancients by far, not to mention those who come after. It can be said that his art has reached the point of transformation. Mr. Shen loved to read ancient steles, and he read all the stones with words in history. With extensive research and deep brewing, he was able to gather thousands of changes at the tip of his wrist for his use. In his later years, his calligraphy started with Huang Shizhai, traced back to Zhong Yao and Suo Jing, and incorporated the cursive script of Zhang Zhi, melting them into one furnace, vigorously correcting the rounded, weak, and stereotyped habits of calligraphers in the past. Mr. Shen was a learned man who deeply understood the meaning of "calligraphy values change, not similarity," and he valued individuality and feared dependence, so he was able to form his own style. When he studied Bao Anwu in his middle age, although he got both form and spirit, he was ashamed to be a slave to others, so he only wrote in ordinary letters and colophons, and never made large-scale works. The screens and couplets of Mr. Shen that we usually see almost never have the appearance of Anwu, which is clear evidence. Mr. Shen knew that he would not be able to excel if he did not break through the model of Anwu. Commentators say that Mr. Shen studied Anwu in his middle age and Shizhai in his later years, as if Mr. Shen only learned from one school before reaching this superb level. In fact, Anwu is nothing. In his later years, his learning from Shizhai was only to learn his method, and it cannot be said that he imitated his style. Sha Wenruo Meng Hai, in his "On Calligraphy in the Past Three Hundred Years," said: "... and it is impossible to talk about promoting and expanding it. It was not until the late Qing Dynasty that a master came out, that is, Shen Huizhi... Later, I don't know how he suddenly understood the secret of calligraphy like a Buddhist disciple, and he took Huang Daozhou and Ni Yuanlu as his models in his later years. He did not use the dead ink method of others, but used the skills of these two schools on Zhong Yao and Suo Jing's lifetime, so there were more changes, twists and turns, and strange interests. ..." This is a true statement. To say that Mr. Shen only studied Shizhai is still too shallow to understand Mr. Shen completely. After the change of dynasties, Mr. Shen avoided Shanghai and began to set his price for calligraphy. After only a few years, he passed away, so there are fewer of his works handed down. Now, even a piece of paper or a single word is as precious as a treasure. At the same time as Mr. Shen, there were some who were famous for their calligraphy, and there were many who sought it, but their names disappeared after their death. This is because they were purely stealing fame and had no real learning to last for thousands of years. Only Mr. Shen, in a short period of time, revealed his brilliance and enjoyed his fame alone. It is known that the fame before death is not reliable, and it is by no means a fluke that Mr. Shen enjoys his fame after death. Mr. Shen was ill for more than two months. Ten hours before his death, he was still lucid and wrote several pairs of couplets. His brush was full of ink, and his spirit was full of energy. It was not like the writing of a sick person. His endowment was so great that ordinary people could not reach it. Today, this couplet is still kept by his son, Ci Hu Jun. Famous figures such as Zheng Haizang, Zhu Guwei, and Kang Nanhai, more than thirty people in total, inscribed on the four edges of the couplet, which is truly precious. I love Mr. Shen's calligraphy as much as my life. I have seen a lot of it in the past twenty years, so I will record one or two to tell those who love Mr. Shen's calligraphy.

### Fee Collection Method for Applying for Residence Permits

There has always been a fee collection method for residents of this city applying for residence permits. It is heard that the Baojia Bureau, in view of the soaring prices and in order to limit re-applications and avoid wasting paper, has submitted a request to the authorities for a slight increase in the amount of fees. The regulations are as follows: Each new residence permit costs 5 yuan in national currency. Each migration and death report costs 5 yuan in national currency. Re-application for a residence permit costs 10 yuan in national currency per card. No other fees will be collected. This method has been implemented since this month.

### Residence Permits for Naturalized Foreigners Issued by the Foreign Affairs Section

Regarding the issue of residence permits for naturalized foreigners, according to news from the Baojia authorities to the Central News Agency reporter, it has been found that naturalized foreigners have obtained Chinese nationality and should be issued the same residence permits as Chinese people to fulfill the reality of naturalization. The Baojia authorities found that the investigation of naturalized foreigners' Baojia affairs has always been handled by the Foreign Affairs Section of the Special Higher Police Department of the First Police Bureau. In order to facilitate the work, in the future, the issuance of residence permits for naturalized foreigners will also be issued by the Foreign Affairs Section of the Special Higher Police Department.

### Prices of Meat and Vegetable Dishes Rise Frequently

Among them, the price of pork has risen even more, far exceeding the price limit set by the authorities, which directly affects people's livelihood greatly. The relevant authorities are paying close attention to this and will implement strict suppression work as soon as appropriate measures are set.

### Tonight, Xiqing Basketball Hualian vs. Amateur; Shandan Team vs. Huaying

The main program of the Xiqing Basketball League tonight is the Grade A Hualian vs. Amateur. Starting at 6:15 pm, Grade B Rongchan vs. Lianqing, Maoling vs. Three Police, and Grade A Shandan Team vs. Huaying. Although Shandan has a hard-working spirit, their demeanor seems to lack generosity. It is hoped that the players of Shandan will thoroughly correct their past mistakes. Huaying's basketball skills are gradually entering a prosperous state, and the teamwork of the whole team can be called tacit. The final match, Hualian vs. Amateur, Hualian has a record of nine wins in nine games, and they have a good grasp of the championship. Only the two passes of Amateur and Huaying remain. It is expected that they will be able to pass safely. The order tonight is as follows:

Rongchan—Lianqing (B2) 6:15 pm, Maoling—Three Police (B3) 7:10 pm, Shandan Team—Huaying (Grade A) 8:00 pm, Amateur—Hualian (Grade A) 9:00 pm.

Economic Commentary

### Revitalizing Light Industry

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - It is reported that Japanese Minister for Greater East Asia, Aoki, stated on the 2nd, during the budget meeting of the House of Peers, in response to questions from Assemblyman Sakatani Yuko: "Revitalizing light industry is also an urgent task at present. To stabilize the people's livelihood, in addition to food, it is also necessary to ensure daily necessities. Japan is determined to make its utmost efforts to assist China in revitalizing light industry."

In this year of increased production, in addition to promoting agricultural products, revitalizing light industry is a key step in the increased production process. Taking Shanghai, China, as an example, although it is known as the center of China's industrial activity, many factories in Shanghai have either suspended or reduced production due to a lack of raw materials, power restrictions, and issues with workers' food supplies, resulting in a state of industrial decline. Consequently, the shortage of light industrial daily necessities has become a natural phenomenon. Even more serious is the difficulty in solving the unemployment problem, which creates an overpopulation that only consumes but does not produce, further exacerbating the current economic crisis.

From the perspectives of the shortage of daily necessities and the increase in unemployed vagrants, revitalizing light industry is indeed an urgent policy measure. Especially in this year of increased production, now that the Allied country Japan has begun to return factories in stages, it is appropriate to redouble efforts to restore various light industries. As for the solution, it is necessary to rely on Japan's technical cooperation. However, in terms of raw materials, power, and workers' food supplies, it is also necessary to rely on the cooperation of the Allied countries to smoothly promote the revitalization of various light industries. This is undeniable.

### Customs Duties on Goods Transported by Merchants Should Be Based on Customs Valuation; Business Control Committee Notifies Its Members

The National Commercial Control General Assembly has specifically written to the Joint Association of Japanese and Chinese Merchants, stating that customs duties on goods transported by merchants should be based on customs valuation and that disputes should not arise due to differences with the Association's valuation. It has been found that the value of goods written on the permits issued by the Business Control Committee often differs from the customs valuation, leading to frequent disputes among merchants. According to customs regulations, for goods with permits from the Business Control Committee, customs officials do not inquire about the value written on the permit, regardless of whether it is higher or lower than the customs valuation. As long as the name, trademark, and quantity of the goods are consistent with what is written on the permit, the goods are released. Therefore, even if the value of goods written on the permits issued by the Association differs from the customs valuation, merchants should pay taxes based on the customs valuation and should not dispute the matter due to differences with the value written by the Association. After receiving the order, the Joint Associations have notified their members to comply accordingly.

### Navy

—Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

Military Class (10)

This disturbance finally reached the ears of the senior elders in the capital. It is said that the elders have already begun negotiations with the Tokyo authorities.

Zhenren finally couldn't bear it anymore and wrote a letter to the principal. The full text is still preserved. In short, it is a passionate letter, with only one difference from other petitions: it also expresses sympathy for the students of Yizhong who have lost their principal. While our own aspirations must be thoroughly realized, the students of Yizhong who have lost their "father" also deserve sympathy. We hope that a good principal will come soon—that's the gist of it.

Expressing sympathy to a school that is constantly fighting with satchels on one side and black medical bags on the other is proof that Zhenren is a "good boy." He was like this since elementary school, and even after he became an adult, he was still a big "good boy." However, although he is an admirable young man, he does not have the so-called great heroic demeanor. At least, until he decided to take action, no one paid attention to him—

The urgent issue of the principal's transfer was soon resolved. Thanks to the appropriate measures taken by the prefectural governor, he was able to remain in Nichu. Cheers resounded throughout the school. From that day on, the people of the military class began their hard work again under the lights of the high and clear autumn night.

(11)

The final hurdle is finally approaching. It was very cold in Kagoshima when they were giving lectures on the biographies of righteous people at Jian'ershe. From that night until the naval academy's academic examination, there were less than ten days left.

Peiren studied late into the night in that small, attic-like room on the second floor. Although the dim light was bright on the desk, the portrait of Saigo Nanshu that Zhen'ichiro-niisan hung on the wall was so dim that even his eyebrows could not be distinguished. Only the two words "必勝" (certain victory) written on white paper could still be vaguely seen.

After ten o'clock, his sister, Matsuko, brought a brazier with burning flames and coarse tea. "Thank you, I don't need the brazier." He only left a cup of hot tea. In this place, boys originally didn't use braziers, but that custom has gradually been abolished recently.

Half of the candidates had already been eliminated during the physical examination, and most of the people would fail the academic examination. No matter how talented, no one had confidence in this examination. Zhenren could only waver between the Greater Saigo's doctrine of "doing one's best and waiting for destiny" and Major Kikuchi's doctrine of "decide and act, and even ghosts and gods will avoid you." In the end, he still had to sit at his desk and work hard.

December 20th finally arrived. The examination hall was in the auditorium of Zhenren's alma mater.

Day 1: Algebra, English. Day 2: Geometry, Physics, Chemistry. Day 3: Japanese History, Japanese, Classical Chinese, Composition. Day 4: Oral examination.

On the night before the first day, he deliberately didn't study and went to bed early. The next morning, he felt very calm. When he arrived at school, he saw a mountain of candidates, each looking like a talented genius. He gradually felt uneasy. Soon, according to the examiner's instructions, he entered the examination hall. He found his semi-body photo and the covered examination paper on the desk with his number. When everyone was seated, the hall became silent.

"Start!" Such a loud command was issued. This voice echoed in Peiren's heart, his pulse beat erratically, and while listening to the sound of his own heartbeat, he turned over the exam paper.

English in the morning and algebra in the afternoon—both were his favorite subjects, but now he was no longer confident. He could only concentrate on writing the answers.

"If the examination results are particularly poor, further participation in the examination will be suspended." This was written in the applicant's guide. The results of each day were announced on the same day.

That evening, Zhenren and his friends from the military class went to see the notice board. Only Zhenren and Kumazawa's numbers were not crossed out with red lines.

The second day also passed safely. The third day also passed easily. The fourth day was the oral examination, which was easy. That night, Zhenren fell into a dream as if he were drunk.

National Forum

### Reorganizing the Baojia Self-Defense System

— Donglai

The so-called Baojia Self-Defense Corps was originally a good method for the public to govern and defend themselves. If it is managed properly, both the government and the people will benefit. If it is not managed properly, problems will arise. This is certainly not the original intention of the government in establishing the Baojia Self-Defense Corps.

Shanghai has been running the Baojia Self-Defense Corps for two years now. Although it cannot be said to have made great achievements, it does help to make up for the inadequacy of the police force, which can be seen everywhere. However, there are also many complaints about the guard duty of the Self-Defense Corps. This cannot but be blamed on the lack of knowledge of some Baojia chiefs and their abuse of power. Therefore, the current Baojia chiefs must be strictly screened to remove corrupt elements and given rigorous training. Then the complaints can be silenced, and the development of the Self-Defense Corps will naturally become even greater. This point should be paid attention to by the governing authorities.

Now that the prices of everything are soaring, who does not feel the pain except for the speculative nouveau riche? The people, in order to struggle for a living, have to work hard to maintain their livelihoods. However, because of the guard duty issue, they are forced to temporarily suspend their work, which has a considerable impact on their income. This is by no means a good government system. In ancient times, spring hunting, summer plowing, autumn gathering, and winter hunting were all used to teach the people during agricultural work. This kind of intention was very good, that is, to prevent the people from hindering their production. Now, forcing the people to serve in the Self-Defense Corps during their work hours has already violated the ancient precepts of the former kings. Because the people have no choice but to suffer, they discuss it with the Baojia chiefs, and the corrupt Baojia chiefs do not follow the government's intentions, but offer various pretexts to provide the people with considerable convenience. For example, some people who work outside during the day are forced to stand guard during the day, and some people who work at night are forced to stand guard at night, as if their orders are absolute and there is no room for negotiation. Their purpose in doing so is to take the opportunity to extort money and force people to hire someone to take their place. According to the government's regulations, all civil servants, doctors, teachers, and students can be exempted from service in the Self-Defense Corps, but some people follow the orders, and many people disregard the orders. All this is hoped that the responsible authorities will make earnest rectification, then the people will be very fortunate!

Community Service

### Fuxing Hospital Specially Establishes Economic Wards

Fuxing Hospital, located at 536 Chang Le Road (formerly Rue Bourgeat), spares no effort in its work to help the poor and sick. In addition to continuing to provide charitable outpatient services and dispensing medicine, it has recently, in view of the rising prices, found that ordinary poor patients often suffer from disease because they are limited by their finances and have no ability to seek medical treatment, thus delaying treatment. Therefore, in accordance with the principle of "from the society, for the society," the surplus of the hospital's business income is allocated to help poor patients with hospitalization and medical expenses, and special civilian wards are established. Only fifty yuan is charged per day, including meals and medical expenses. All poor patients who wish to receive economic hospitalization and treatment can go to the hospital for treatment. If they are indeed poor, they can also apply to the hospital for completely free treatment. In addition, the hospital's charitable outpatient internal medicine (no smoking cessation department) is open every Tuesday and Thursday from 10:00 am to 11:30 am; surgery, trauma, orthopedics, ENT, and dermatology (no venereal disease department) are open every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm; obstetrics examination is open every Saturday from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm. The registration fee and medicine fee are completely waived.

### Free Schools and Scholarship Assistance
