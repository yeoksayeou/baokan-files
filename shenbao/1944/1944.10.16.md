### On the Eve of the Decisive Battle

Q: Regarding the enemy American air raids on Taiwan, what is the current status of the battle, and please provide details.

A: Regarding the enemy aircraft raids on Taiwan, the battle situation has been reported daily in the news, as announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters. The enemy aircraft began their raids on the morning of the 12th. Allied air forces immediately engaged them, searching for the enemy aircraft's departure points and the location of enemy mobile forces. As a result, enemy fleets were discovered in the waters east of Taiwan. Repeated and intense attacks were launched, resulting in the sinking of seven enemy aircraft carriers, one destroyer, the destruction of two aircraft carriers, one battleship, one cruiser, and eleven ships of unknown type. The pursuit and attack are still ongoing.

Q: Judging from the size of the enemy's naval and air forces deployed this time, it seems to be a large-scale, desperate gamble, isn't it?

A: The enemy deployed 3,000 aircraft to attack the entire island of Taiwan. The scale is indeed the largest since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War. The enemy fleet is the Pacific Third Fleet, commanded by Halsey, also known as Task Force 58. At the same time, the enemy's most powerful and elite forces in the Pacific Fleet are completely concentrated in this mobile task force. Therefore, this battle can be seen as the prelude to a decisive battle. Consequently, the Allied air forces do not consider engaging enemy aircraft as the most important task, but rather, searching for and discovering the location of the enemy mobile task force as the primary mission. Once discovered, they will exert all efforts to inflict a fatal blow, fundamentally destroying the enemy's main force in the Pacific. Based on this objective, the Allied land and sea forces are working together to search, and judging from the results obtained, they have completed a portion of their mission. Secondly, with the enemy deploying as many as 3,000 aircraft, the mobile task force cannot stray far, but rather adopts a shuttle formation, appearing and disappearing to the left and right, attempting to evade Japanese searches. However, the Japanese forces are continuously searching, and as a result, it is difficult for them to escape. Therefore, it can be known that the complete annihilation of the enemy mobile task force is a predetermined fate.

Q: In that case, isn't the enemy's military action equivalent to moths flying into a flame, seeking their own destruction?

A: Indeed, the enemy's move appears to be a reckless gamble. However, the enemy Americans decided on this action with a plan and strategy. Because Taiwan is Japan's largest stronghold, with the Japanese mainland to the east, the Chinese mainland to the west, and the Philippines to the south, Japan has built its most powerful air force here. Therefore, the enemy, using the violence of 3,000 aircraft, attempts to destroy Japan's air power in Taiwan in one fell swoop, gain air supremacy, and then carry out the Philippine offensive, so that the west can be relieved of the war in mainland China and the east can launch air raids on the Japanese mainland. However, the Allied Japanese have made thorough preparations. Even if the enemy Americans use greater forces, they will surely be destroyed. Moreover, the enemy has now deployed its most elite main force, which has already suffered a fatal blow. The stage of decline and exhaustion is not far off.

Q: But then, what is the ultimate motivation behind the enemy Americans' willingness to exert all their strength? And what is the likely future trend of the war situation?

A: The enemy Americans' all-out effort in this battle is, first and foremost, driven by Roosevelt's attempt to secure a fourth term as president, risking obtaining news of victory to win popular support. Secondly, the anti-war sentiment is widespread among the enemy's population, forcing them to risk using news of victory to regain public confidence. The failure of Roosevelt's adventurous strategy has already been demonstrated by the facts. We can pay attention to several more points regarding the significance of this battle of Taiwan: First, the enemy Americans' boasting of their strong military power and their disparagement of the weakness of the Japanese air force have now been shattered without attack. Second, the enemy Americans' perception of cutting off the connection between the Japanese mainland and the southern regions as extremely easy is now known to be quite difficult. At the same time, the attempt to approach mainland China, although it cannot be completely crushed, has already given the enemy the feeling that it cannot be done. Third, Roosevelt's attempt to use the spoils of war to succeed in a fourth election has now been thwarted. If Roosevelt succeeds in a fourth election, the American people will inevitably suffer more and greater bloodshed. Fourth, the small victories of Saipan, Tinian, and Miyakojima in the past were used by the enemy Americans to deceive the world, claiming that the Japanese military was incompetent. It has now been proven that the enemy Americans' past propaganda was completely false.

### Elite Japanese Naval Forces Deployed; Enemy Ships Annihilated East of Taiwan; Cumulative Sinking and Destruction Reaches 23 Vessels in Recent Days

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3 PM on the 15th: The enemy mobile task force east of Taiwan has been retreating eastward for days since the 14th. Japanese forces have repeatedly attacked them intensely, and the results are expanding. As of now, the confirmed results (including those previously announced) are as follows: Seven aircraft carriers sunk, one destroyer sunk. (Note) Three vessels previously announced as "type unknown" have now been identified as three aircraft carriers. Two aircraft carriers destroyed, one battleship, one cruiser, and eleven other vessels of unknown type.

### Enemy American Giant Aircraft Carriers Sunk

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3 PM on the 15th that Japanese forces, through repeated and intense attacks on the enemy mobile task force east of Taiwan, have sunk or destroyed nine enemy aircraft carriers, sunk one destroyer, destroyed one battleship and one cruiser each, and achieved a major victory of eleven vessels of unknown type. This announced number is the result of the Imperial Headquarters' confirmation of the battles on the 12th and 13th. The pursuit and annihilation of the main force of the retreating enemy mobile task force continues to unfold as of the 15th. On the 14th, one specially equipped aircraft carrier and one battleship were sunk, and one large aircraft carrier was heavily damaged and one large ship was burned, which was already determined earlier. It is expected that the enemy mobile task force is likely in a state of complete annihilation. It was also announced that in addition to the base air force, Japanese forces have also deployed fleets. The Japanese Imperial Navy, enduring and waiting for the opportune moment, is now continuing to capture the superior enemy mobile task force and launch a major annihilation battle. Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The elite forces of the Japanese Imperial Navy, since the night of the 12th, have repeatedly attacked the main force of the U.S. Navy Pacific Fleet's Task Force 58 east of Taiwan. The American fleet has completely lost its offensive power, but from 7 PM to 9 PM on the 14th, it launched two more wave attacks on various parts of Taiwan. After that, it quickly gathered its air forces, attempting to rescue the crew members on the sinking aircraft carriers, and began to flee around 11 AM. The results are as follows: The Japanese Navy has destroyed or sunk a total of 23 American ships. On the morning of the 14th, it also repelled the fleeing American mobile task force, and the expansion of the results is highly anticipated.

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The enemy American mobile task force's large-scale deployment this time, attempting to attack the Japanese rear, has suffered heavy damage after being fiercely attacked by the Japanese air force, as announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters. While the enemy ships were fleeing in panic, the Japanese fleet swarmed in, launching a large-scale annihilation attack by sea and air together. As a result, this enemy mobile fleet, attempting to land in the Philippines and Taiwan, was ultimately severely struck by the Japanese Navy and fell into a crisis of collapse. According to reports, the enemy's main force was deployed this time due to Roosevelt's political motives before the fourth election, implementing this reckless operation. Now that the enemy's attempt has suffered a major defeat, Japan's operations in the Pacific have begun to shift to the first stage of offense. It is feared that Roosevelt and other American leaders will suffer this first major defeat since Pearl Harbor. However, the Japanese Navy, which has already shifted to the offensive, will continue to actively deploy operations, so the enemy will inevitably reveal its weaknesses. As for the American public, they will stare in stunned silence, standing before the facts of defeat.

### U.S. Task Force 58's Offensive Collapses

Minister Matsushima Discusses the Results East of Taiwan Central News Agency Report - Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet Press Department stationed in China issued the following statement on the 15th regarding the Japanese Navy's great victory of sinking and destroying 23 enemy ships east of Taiwan: The fierce naval and air battle east of Taiwan is the greatest in history. The comprehensive results obtained by Japan in completely annihilating the 18th Mobile Task Force are the sinking of seven aircraft carriers, one destroyer, the destruction of two aircraft carriers, one battleship, one cruiser, and eleven vessels of unknown type. Such a glorious victory will shock the world.

### Fortress Taiwan, a Key Stronghold

The enemy Americans' Nimitz offensive, attempting to extend their ambitions of aggression towards the divine nation of Japan's southern, has now been defeated by our inevitable and deadly attacks, collapsing entirely and staging an all-out retreat, presenting an ugly spectacle. The enemy mobile task force discovered east of Taiwan, a portion of which was the one that attacked Okinawa ten days earlier, was joined by a main force, likely commanded by Third Fleet Commander Halsey. The total strength is not yet known, but it is estimated to be about four aircraft carrier groups, with one group consisting of two to three aircraft carriers, one to two battleships and cruisers, and four to six destroyers, totaling about 28 to 36 vessels. According to the results announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 15th, seven were sunk and fifteen were destroyed, totaling twenty-three. It can be seen that the enemy is almost on the verge of annihilation. This is truly the main force of all enemy attacking forces in the Pacific since the Battle of Bougainville, having suffered a tragic blow, just as the enemy said, "Friday the 13th was the most terrible battle" has been realized. The fierce battle

### Spanning Four Days and Nights

The Japanese air force, fighting with a spirit of certain death and daring, and the various units responsible for defending Taiwan's airspace and ground, as well as the civil defense air raid units, how they fought can be imagined. The enemy's attack on Taiwan this time can be seen as a precursor to the Philippine operation. On the one hand, because the terrain of the Philippines is complex and the Japanese defenses are like iron walls, making it difficult to start, they took Taiwan as the direction of attack. This point can also be clearly seen. The enemy, using Saipan as an intermediate base, attempted to attack key points in the south, based on what they have said repeatedly: "Discovering a shortcut to mainland China." However, they were met with a fierce counterattack from the elite Japanese forces. The main force of their vaunted Task Force 58 has been annihilated. The enemy is extremely anxious about our strategic posture in the Greater East Asia region, which is being strengthened against Japan. The enemy's search for a shortcut to mainland China prompted this reckless attack, which can be imagined. More specifically, U.S. President Roosevelt's attempt to achieve some decisive victory before the election caused a major setback in the U.S. Navy's Pacific strategy. Now, the Empire's war guidance policy, based on a grand concept of a continental north-south operation and a clean-up operation along the southeast coast of China, is being steadily unfolded with close cooperation between the army and navy.

### Shattering the Anglo-American

Coordination from Chongqing and other anti-Axis camps. Judging from the situation, the United States cannot rest easy either. The complete inclusion of the enemy in our strategy is due to the fierce fighting of the soldiers on the front lines, which has led to this great victory. This enemy fleet annihilation battle, like the continental operation, is a perfect example of land and sea cooperation, which we are especially grateful for. Especially the army and air force in the air force, bravely fighting with torpedoes, is truly an overture to a decisive battle between land and sea in the Pacific Ocean war. However, the enemy will inevitably have various counterattacks in the future, such as self-destructive air raids by B-29 aircraft. However, the enemy's foolish actions will not be affected by our strategic posture for protecting East Asia. The one billion people of Greater East Asia should trust Japan's strong war power, and with confidence and hope, strive to strengthen our war power to achieve final victory.

### U.S. Flagship Commander Mitchell Killed in Action

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The enemy American powerful mobile task force launched an attack on the waters east of Taiwan, suffering heavy damage on the 12th and 13th, losing many aircraft carriers, including one super-heavy aircraft carrier. This ship appears to be the flagship of the enemy American mobile task force, and Commander Mitchell is thought to be among those on board. The waters near the battlefield on the 12th and 13th were stormy, making rescue operations extremely difficult. If Mitchell is like the other soldiers, he had no choice but to join the waves. It is feared that he is no longer alive.

### Admiral Nomura Discusses the Taiwan Operation

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - Privy Councilor Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura recently issued a statement on the great victory in the waters off Taiwan. The gist of his statement is that this operation can be said to be based on Nimitz's plan, with a strong Halpin-like operational style. Halpin is a model of adventurous advancement, with a hunt-and-strike approach. This time, the arrogant enemy has suffered a heavy blow. However, it is not possible to believe that Japan has shifted to a superior offensive just because the enemy is confused. This kind of view is a warning against criticizing the results of this battle. Although the results of this battle are great, Nimitz's Pacific offensive will continue. We must firmly recognize that their operational plans to recapture the Philippines and block southern resources have not changed, and we must know that we have not yet dealt the enemy a decisive blow. The enemy army did not challenge the Japanese fleet, but instead adopted a cowardly tactic of interdicting the supply lines, intending to avoid losses as much as possible and make the Japanese army lose its will to fight. Some admit that the enemy army is anxious because Roosevelt's election is approaching, but this is not the case. The enemy army's will to fight is by no means so superficial, but rather they possess a strong will to fight, and this point must be faced squarely.

### Enemy Aircraft Attack Manila, Eighteen Shot Down

Manila, 15th (Central News Agency) - At about 10:30 AM on the 15th, a combined squadron of about 60 enemy carrier-based fighters and bombers attacked the Manila area.

### Guilin's Fall Imminent; Fierce Fighting in Pingnan Area

Guangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army is advancing like a whirlwind, and the fall of Guilin is imminent. The last strongholds of the Chongqing army defending the southwest are now only Liuzhou and Nanning. They are now making every effort to fortify Liuzhou and actively defend Nanning. Also, the Japanese army has seized control of both sides of the Xijiang River and is heading straight for Pingnan, forming a rapid westward advance. The Chongqing side stated in a broadcast on the 11th that after the Japanese army occupied Pingnan, they divided their forces into two routes, pointing to Guiping and advancing fiercely to the southwest. At present, they are fighting fiercely with the Chongqing army ten kilometers away from that area. According to reports, Pingnan is 350 kilometers away from Nanning. After breaking through this treacherous area, it becomes a flat area of rolling hills.

### Chongqing Confesses Fall of Guiping

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington, the Chongqing Headquarters announced on the night of the 14th that Guiping, a key point in southern Guangxi Province, fell after street fighting on the morning of the 13th. Guangzhou, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from Chongqing, the Chongqing Military Council announced on the night of the 13th that the Japanese army had broken into Guiping County on the morning of the 12th. At the same time, it also admitted that Fuzhou in Fujian Province had been occupied by the Japanese army.

### Chaotic Situation in Chongqing Regime

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from New York, the American Foreign Policy Association released an article on the 13th, fully exposing the chaotic internal situation of the Chongqing regime. The main points are as follows: The Chongqing army has suffered repeated defeats on the mainland China front, which is due to the lack of weapons. The upper class of the Chongqing regime is very corrupt politically and is dedicated to internal strife. On the other hand, the people of Chongqing generally do not want to serve in the army because of the Chongqing side's plan to complete the war. Therefore, the Chongqing authorities sent troops to various places to forcibly conscript people who were unwilling to serve in the army. However, only one out of twenty of the soldiers recruited from these people who were sent to the front lines, which is a common situation. As for the Chinese farmers, they deeply resent the heavy taxes of the Chongqing regime, so after they were rescued by the Japanese army and escaped the evil policies of the Chongqing side, they actively cooperated with the Japanese army. This action is also one of the reasons for the defeat of the Chongqing army.

### Goering Urges Germans to Make Greater Sacrifices

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports: Yesterday, General Goering inspected German bases and troops, and visited a munitions factory in central Germany. He then gave a speech to the workers of the factory, the gist of which is as follows: The enemy's hope of defeating Germany this month has become a pipe dream. It is a great honor and sufficient proof of the great strength of the German people that the world's greatest powers cannot defeat the German nation. Even if the enemy concentrates all its efforts to attack, it will not be able to win. General Goering warned the Germans not to think that the victory of the anti-Axis powers could prevent the communists from ruling the Germans, and not to believe deeply in the differences of opinion among the enemies, because they all agree on annihilating Germany. General Goering also cited the growing power of the Communist Party in the occupied areas of the anti-Axis powers as an example, urging the Germans to work hard to avoid destruction, saying that both the front and the rear must make greater sacrifices. Today, the Germans are not defending the lands of other countries. The whole world will know how the Germans defend their country. He is confident that the Germans will succeed with unwavering will.

Trench Warfare Unfolds Near Aachen Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Reuters war correspondent Amsgaard: After a counterattack on the Western Front, the German army recaptured Mountain No. 62 at the foot of the Forêt Mountains. The mountain is located near the village of La Bresse, fourteen kilometers southwest of Gérardmer. It was captured by the Third Algerian Infantry Division on Friday afternoon.

The German army launched a counterattack on Friday afternoon and recaptured the mountain before dusk, inflicting heavy losses on the Algerian army. The two sides engaged in street fighting in the villages around the Moselotte valley. The enemy suffered heavy casualties.

The remaining American troops were completely annihilated after close combat. Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - The German Supreme Headquarters announced on the 14th: In Aachen, trench warfare is unfolding. Although the American army has repeatedly attacked with powerful tank units, it has not made much progress due to the brave resistance of the German grenadiers. Fierce offensive and defensive battles are unfolding south of Belgrade. Moreover, in the Narew River bridgehead north of Warsaw, the Soviet army attempted to break through the German positions under extremely fierce artillery fire and air cover, but ultimately failed.

The western part of the battle is still in the hands of the German army.

### Radio Broadcast Exchange Between Japanese Prime Minister and Philippine President

Based on Treaty, Determined to Fully Support Philippines Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) At 7:20 PM on the 14th, Japanese Prime Minister Koiso and Philippine President Laurel exchanged radio broadcasts. Prime Minister Koiso's speech, in essence, was as follows: The independence of the Philippines is bestowed upon the eighteen million Filipinos through centuries of unwavering efforts and struggles, and is bought with the blood of many martyrs. We deeply admire and sympathize with their determination to sacrifice for national liberation and their pure spirit of Eastern cooperation. With the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Empire not only expelled American forces from the Philippines but also actively assisted its independence. This was our objective. A year ago today, the declaration of Philippine independence was due to the years of struggle and construction by the Filipino people, and also to the courageous battles of the Japanese army, which defeated American forces and laid the foundation for independence, which is quite commendable. On this first anniversary, I am sincerely delighted. In the year since the Philippines' independence, under the leadership of the honorable President Laurel, it has moved towards the construction of a new nation. Not only the Japanese Empire but also various countries in Greater East Asia and European Axis countries have shown full sympathy and offered blessings to the development of the Philippines. However, Britain and America are now obliterating the independence of the Philippines, shouting to reclaim it, and beginning to massacre innocent civilians. Therefore, the Philippines finally rose up on September 23rd and declared war on Britain and America. Based on the alliance treaty, the Japanese Empire has decided to use all its strength to support the independence of the Philippines and will never allow the Philippines to be dominated by the United States again. The Empire has this belief, so its assistance to the Philippines is not for any price.

### Speech by Ba Maw

Rangoon, 15th (Central News Agency) Burmese national representative Ba Maw, taking the 14th as the first anniversary of Philippine independence, delivered a congratulatory speech on that day. Its main point was that the Republic of the Philippines rose up courageously and engaged in war to defend its independence. Therefore, at this time, the first anniversary of Philippine independence has special significance and a sacred mission. It is hoped that the Philippines will achieve success in the war, so that national freedom and honor, as well as the life of the nation, can be preserved in freedom and independence.

### Congratulatory Message Broadcasted by Thai Prime Minister

Bangkok, 15th (Central News Agency) On the first anniversary of Philippine independence, Thai Prime Minister Apaiwong exchanged congratulatory messages via radio broadcast. The main points were as follows: The people of Thailand were overjoyed when the people of the Philippines achieved the great cause of national independence, because the Philippines and Thailand maintain good neighborly relations and are both Asian countries. In the name of the Thai people, I sincerely wish the Philippines prosperity and development.

### Statement by Minister Iguchi

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) Iguchi, the Third Minister of the Japanese Information Bureau, issued a statement on the first anniversary of Philippine independence as follows: In the past, the policy implemented by the United States towards the Philippines fundamentally denied the full development of its people's lives, only making it a market for the disposal of surplus goods from the United States. Only when the Filipino people expressed their rejection of this did the United States recognize its independence in 1946, but this was merely a political maneuver. Now that the Philippines has realized its long-cherished wish for independence, the United States still ignores this fact and has invaded again, attempting to restore its position of oppression and domination. At this point, it can be proven that the United States' recognition of its independence was definitely not genuine. Today, the Republic of the Philippines has been independent for a year. Under the wise leadership of President Laurel, the Filipino people have unanimously completed the great task of reforming the spirit of the Greater East Asian nations and, to defend their homeland and resist the aggression of Anglo-American imperialism, have declared war on the United States and Britain after preparing for war. The Filipino people, with their own bravery, have stripped off the disguise of the American imperialists, exposing them to the world as aggressors who violate sacred independence. The peace in East Asia, as symbolized by Philippine independence, is precisely the goal of Japan's war based on the principle of self-preservation and self-defense. The Japanese people, knowing that the independence and defense of the Philippines are related to their own destiny, eagerly hope to cooperate in the war against the United States to achieve the glory of victory.

Representatives from All Sectors of Youth Enthusiastically Participated To complete the Greater East Asia Liberation War and strive for final victory, the Shanghai China Construction Youth Corps specially mobilized the Chinese youth of this city to hold a China Youth General Mobilization Conference at the Da Guangming Cinema on Jing'an Temple Road at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 15th). The conference ceremony was solemn and grand, and youth from all sectors of the city enthusiastically attended. In addition to speeches by Chen Binhe, the president of this newspaper, and others, there were also speeches by youth representatives from various sectors, which were particularly enthusiastic. Details are recorded as follows:

### Conference Situation

The venue was set up inside the Da Guangming Cinema. Two national flags with a blue sky, white sun, and red ground were hung high in the center. The layout was simple and solemn. The ceremony began on time. After everyone performed the rituals, Chairman Li Fang, the envoy, first reported the significance of the meeting, roughly saying: [In the past, East Asia suffered from the aggression of Anglo-American empires. The late Premier advocated revolution and the Pan-Asianism, calling on all Asians to unite and strive for freedom and independence. Allied Japan, in order to achieve the independence and integrity of East Asia, opened the prelude to the Greater East Asia War, shedding blood and sweat on the front and rear lines. After our Chinese youth joined the war, in this great era, we should unite, mobilize, go all out, work hard, and complete the final victory of Greater East Asia.] Following speeches by Chen Binhe, president of Shen Bao, and Xu Tieshan, representatives from various sectors such as news, new year students, vocational youth, and industry, including Ren Yunpeng, Fang Kangnian, and Yao Wenzhun, gave speeches with high spirits, determined to move forward to complete the victory goal of the Greater East Asia Holy War. Then, Chairman Li Fang, the envoy, delivered a closing speech, expressing deep gratitude to the visiting guests for taking the time to participate. Finally, the Hua Ying film company's famous film "Long Live the Teacher" was shown, and the ceremony concluded. During the conference, the Hua Ying company also specially sent a cameraman to the scene to shoot newsreels, and the police and gendarmerie dispatched personnel to maintain order.

### Chen Binhe's Speech

Chen Binhe's speech roughly stated: Fellow young friends, I am a news reporter. In recent years, I have never dared to give speeches to young people, because I still feel inadequate myself! Today, I invited Mr. Li Sihao to attend the meeting and give a speech, but Mr. Li was unable to attend due to other matters, so he appointed me to represent him at the meeting. Currently, everyone knows that we are in the decisive autumn of the Greater East Asia War, and China is a member of the participating countries. May I ask, how much strength does our country have? How much strength does society have? I feel very ashamed! Why is it that our country's state and society have no strength, and most people are selfish, depressed, and irresponsible to the state and society? I feel that China's future is very dangerous. What I hope for is the young friends. The construction of China in ten or twenty years will actually be the responsibility of the youth. We must inject new youth blood into the old Chinese body. I find that youth has two characteristics: first, every youth has super purity and a sense of justice, right is right, and wrong is wrong. Second, young people's thoughts are progressive, and they all promote the spirit of justice and striving for the country—but even with these two characteristics, it is still not enough. I hope that every youth will absorb a lot of knowledge and exercise their bodies. We must enrich our knowledge and strengthen our characteristics to resolutely struggle with the environment when we participate in the general mobilization. To participate in the construction general mobilization, we must exercise our bodies, be sincerely united, and go all out to complete the Greater East Asia Youth.

Since January 16 of this year, the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance has started collecting special wartime consumption taxes on retail goods and banquets and hotels in fifteen important areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces, and the two special municipalities of Beijing and Shanghai. Through supervision and gradual promotion, tax revenue has been increasing daily. Since May of this year, the increase in revenue has been even greater. Especially in the recent two months, the average monthly total tax revenue has reached around 300 million yuan. In order to prevent merchants and citizens from taking advantage of loopholes to conceal and encroach on withheld taxes and to prevent those involved from colluding and engaging in malfeasance, the department has submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to implement a voucher-based tax payment system. That is, the tax department will print a type of special consumption tax stamp, graded by amount, and issue it to various factories and shops. For any retail transaction that should pay a certain amount of special consumption tax, the relevant shop will issue a ticket and affix the special tax stamp as proof. It is reported that this special tax voucher-based tax payment system is in preparation and should be realized soon.

### Strengthened Lighting Control for Tricycles, Rickshaws, etc.

To Avoid Obstructing Air Defense Originally, there were strict regulations on lighting control for ordinary vehicles when alert warnings and air raid warnings were issued, and the intended purpose has been gradually achieved. However, the lighting control for tricycles, rickshaws, etc., which were omitted in the regulations, is not thorough enough, which is extremely obstructive to air defense. In view of this, the Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters has specially included tricycles and rickshaws in the category of ordinary vehicles, and issued a notice and a statement from the authorities on the 14th, in order to improve the lighting control of such vehicles.

### Re-examining the Chongqing Regime – Part 1

— Yoshida Tosuke

Looking at something beautiful is the same as looking at something true. – Matthew Arnold

Q: According to a Chongqing dispatch on the 28th, an English-language evening paper stated: [Within the next few months, the Chongqing regime will undergo a decisive reorganization]. Is this possible?

A: Based on the recent situation, the possibility of a political change in Chongqing is quite high. The reasons cited by the English-language evening paper are:

1.  The National Political Council, which desires for liberals within the Chongqing regime to ascend to the political stage, has recently increased its criticisms and suggestions towards the Chongqing regime.
2.  In order to shoulder the responsibility of the war, American public opinion increasingly believes that the Chongqing regime needs to be reorganized.

This [criticism is specifically directed at He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Affairs and Chief of the General Staff, and Kong Xiangxi, the Minister of Finance]. Simultaneously, a Guangdong telegram on the 27th stated: Chiang Kai-shek convened an emergency secret meeting in Chongqing on the 21st to discuss whether to rely on one's own strength to resist Japan or to wait for the American offensive against Japan. However, all those attending the meeting echoed Chiang Kai-shek's idea that a general counter-offensive should be launched when the United States launches an offensive against Japan. The more Chiang Kai-shek relies on the United States, the greater the possibility of the reorganization of the Chongqing regime desired by the United States, which is a natural principle.

Q: What exactly are the reasons for such a situation to occur? In your article "[Observations on the Chongqing Regime]," you never mentioned the possibility of such a situation occurring. What is the reason for this?

A: My writing on "[Observations on the Chongqing Regime]" was based on the objective situation before the Guangxi campaign. I believe that the Guangxi campaign, in terms of Japan's relationship with Chongqing, will have significant political implications that even the military authorities do not understand.

The Hunan campaign followed by the Guangxi campaign, as well as the northern response operations in the south, completely isolated Chongqing's Third War Area and Seventh War Area from the central government. Restoring the logistical supply of these two war areas is not an easy task for Chongqing. Chongqing has never thought that it could achieve this goal on its own. Therefore, the national essence faction led by Chiang Kai-shek is well aware of the consequences and has no choice but to hope for American troops to land in China and for large-scale weapons assistance. The United States is trumpeting the so-called "[Nimitz Offensive]" strategy, which is to land on the Chinese coast, but the enemy also knows how difficult and costly it would be to land on Chinese soil and confront the main force of the stubborn Japanese army. Therefore, the United States initially did not intend to take the risk of a large-scale landing on Chinese soil to confront the main force of the stubborn Japanese army. Even if they dared to do so, the landing troops could only serve as a supervisory team for the Chongqing army in the Third War Area and the Seventh War Area. However, before the start of the Guangxi campaign, Chiang Kai-shek, for the sake of China's future, did not hope for this. I believe that Chiang Kai-shek's intention was only to obtain a steady stream of heavy weapons and aircraft from the United States, and that China alone could handle the situation with ease. However, today, the situation has changed drastically, and Chiang Kai-shek cannot help but hope for American troops to land or for a large amount of military assistance that has never been seen before. This change in the war situation naturally has a great impact on the political aspect. Chiang Kai-shek can no longer say whether he is willing or unwilling, and now he has to consider the democratization of the Chongqing regime demanded by the United States. The Chongqing regime has already passed a series of democratic bills, such as the protection of human rights and the relaxation of censorship, but the United States is not satisfied with this pretentious democratic stance. The United States believes that if the Chongqing regime itself is not democratized, no matter how democratized the laws are, there will always be "[foot-dragging]" in the implementation of the laws. However, the serious United States does not have the courage to replace Chiang Kai-shek, the central figure of the national essence faction. In any case, Chiang Kai-shek is still considered the culmination of China's various complex forces, and in all respects, he is a unified symbol of wartime China. Therefore, even if the United States is dissatisfied with Chiang Kai-shek, it cannot let someone else take his place. Therefore, the American attack naturally falls on He Yingqin and Kong Xiangxi, Chiang Kai-shek's right-hand men. The United States is well aware that Chiang Kai-shek's partners are the soul of "[autocratic politics]" and the mortal enemies of democratic republic. He Yingqin and Kong Xiangxi are loyal partners in implementing Chiang Kai-shek's policies, so Chiang Kai-shek always wants to rescue them, but in the face of public scrutiny, he can only sigh helplessly. The reorganization of the Chongqing regime may take place within these few months. According to the current situation, no conclusion can be drawn yet.

Q: If the reorganization is realized and the pro-British and American faction replaces the national essence faction and gains leadership of the Chongqing government, would that be the "[decline of the national essence faction]?"

A: Your view is obviously a Japanese perspective. The national essence faction is by no means so easy to decline. To understand this, it is necessary to first study the essence of Chiang Kai-shek's autocracy. Chiang Kai-shek, this authoritarian, cannot be compared to authoritarians like Stalin and Hitler. Behind Stalin and Hitler, there is the organic and unified will of the ruling class. The source of their power comes from the unity and organization of the will of the ruling class. Stalin and Hitler's decisions were implemented universally in every corner of the country through their respective political parties. So what is behind Chiang Kai-shek? Can the Kuomintang represent the unified will of the Chinese ruling class? It is absolutely impossible. In addition to the Kuomintang, the Chinese ruling class also includes the National Socialist Party, the China Youth Party, the Third Party, etc. Of course, the power and harmony of these parties are far behind the Kuomintang, but there are always all kinds of political parties in China. The organization of the Kuomintang itself is also extremely loose and cannot be compared with the unity of the Soviet Communist Party or the German Nazi Party. Moreover, there are still many politicians in the Kuomintang who do not participate in any group. These facts are enough to prove that the will of the Chinese ruling class represented by Chiang Kai-shek is extremely lacking in unity and organic nature. In this regard, Chiang Kai-shek is not only unable to compare with Hitler and Stalin, but is also in a very pitiful environment. But Chiang Kai-shek is using this environment to establish his autocratic politics. Precisely because the will of the ruling class is not unified, Chiang Kai-shek uses the opposition of various factions to establish his own power on the balance of various factions. Only in this respect does Chiang Kai-shek have completely different and unique methods from Stalin and Hitler. Initially, he established his own position on the balance of power between the right-wing Hu Hanmin and the left-wing Wang Jingwei, so he will never ignore this. Even if there is a so-called "[political change]," and the national essence faction like He Yingqin and Kong Xiangxi can be replaced by pro-British and American figures, the power of He Yingqin and Kong Xiangxi will never be lost completely. At the same time, they will definitely try their best to preserve and prepare for a new balance of power to cover their comeback. This is by no means the decline of the national essence faction, and do not forget that Chiang Kai-shek himself is the central figure of the national essence faction.

Q: According to what you said, it seems that Chiang Kai-shek is not an "[autocratic dictator]." Isn't this completely contrary to common sense in China?

A: What I said is not wrong. When people say that Chiang Kai-shek is not a big dictator, they always like to compare him unconditionally to Hitler and Stalin. This makes it easy to have misconceptions about the essence of Chiang Kai-shek's regime. Hitler and Stalin represent the unified and organic will of the ruling class, so they have very agile decision-making power. Yesterday, mortal enemies who were fighting to the death can shake hands and call each other partners today! Yesterday's partners can fight each other today. But Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship cannot be as arbitrary as Hitler, secretly ambushing yesterday's friends and launching a war against the Soviet Union. This is because Chiang Kai-shek, even though he looks very autocratic on the outside, his autocracy is not based on the organized and unified will of the ruling class, but on the scattered and contradictory will of the ruling class. Therefore, he will never have the political decisiveness of Hitler and Stalin. The enlightened members of the Kuomintang

know this shortcoming of the Chongqing regime like the back of their hand. The so-called slogan of "[one government, one party, one leader]," to be honest, is a movement to unify and organize the will of the ruling class behind Chiang Kai-shek.
