### Difficulties in Public Health

In the third session of the East Asia Medical Association Conference last month, Health Minister Sa Runzhi spoke on "Public Health Administration Plans and Medical Education Issues," pointing out three difficulties in currently undertaking public health endeavors: factionalism preventing sincere cooperation; lack of talent not meeting needs; and an annual budget of only over a hundred million yuan, insufficient for proper application. Regarding these three points, he offered several management suggestions.

There were originally no factions in China's new academic circles. The reason for the creation of factions in new medicine is entirely due to British and American colonial-style education. The hospitals and medical schools established by the British and Americans in China invariably had, at their core, the commercial goal of promoting British and American goods. This led to the creation of terms like "British-American faction," "German-Japanese faction," and "Franco-Belgian faction," using economic power to manipulate medical groups and monopolize medical undertakings. At one point, they even used political power, attempting to overthrow everything and exclusively dominate China. Some blind Chinese people echoed and utilized this, using it as an opportunity for personal advancement and wealth. China's public health endeavors should be based on the standpoint of the Chinese people, but in the past, Chinese public health endeavors often carried the meaning of British and American aggression. This is undeniable. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, most of the enemy hospitals and medical schools have been handed over to the Chinese government for management. At the same time, all future courses will be taught in the national language. In this way, the fundamental reason for British and American aggression is removed, and the country's use of talent no longer distinguishes between factions. With practical learning as the standard, the problem of medical factions will naturally cease to exist. Medical technology is universal and inherently without factions. Chinese medical talents serve the Chinese people, and naturally, they are all united.

In the past, our country has felt a lack of medical talent. We have repeatedly made statements in light of the Allied nations' special emphasis on medical school education. Because when it comes to public health endeavors, when it comes to medical care, if the problem of personnel is not resolved, everything else is simply out of the question. Medical education is an urgent issue at present. The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education must unite to formulate a plan to train a certain number of doctors and nurses in the coming years. These doctors and nurses must be used by the state and not be like private practitioners. At the same time, methods for further education should be sought for existing talent, either by establishing research institutes at the central level or by sending them to Japan for advanced studies, with the government bearing all expenses, stipulating that they must serve the country. We hope that the expansion and increase of national medical education institutions will ensure that those educated do not only consider their personal livelihood interests but aim to serve the people. In this way, the country cultivates a talent, and the country has a use for that talent.

Regarding the Ministry of Health's budget, the national central agency has only over one million yuan. This amount was already insufficient before the war. Based on current purchasing power, it is feared that even the equipment for a single laboratory cannot be afforded. We deeply believe this is a national regret. During wartime, the country's human and material resources must be protected and increased. The most important method of protecting human resources lies in public health, because during wartime, more people die from disease than from direct combat. Combat is unavoidable, but disease can be eliminated. Therefore, during wartime, the country's work in eliminating disease in the rear is sufficient to increase the fighting power at the front. All belligerent countries pay close attention to this, and Allied Japan is a prime example. Therefore, an increase in the Ministry of Health's budget must be realized immediately. However, the Ministry of Health's budget should be spent on operations, not on administration, so that it will have a real effect on protecting the nation's livelihood.

### Imphal Offensive and Defensive Battle Currently Unfolding Heroically - Japanese Aircraft Bomb Artillery Positions

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 12th: With the rainy season having arrived, the enemy forces, relying solely on air routes for supplies, have become increasingly panicked in recent days. Currently, fierce battles are unfolding between Japanese and British forces in the hills surrounding Imphal, so the daily artillery fire is thunderous, which is quite terrible. The Japanese army has completed the encirclement of the enemy's circular defensive line within a 30-kilometer radius of Imphal, while the enemy forces are only fiercely attacking the Japanese army with artillery fire, like trapped beasts. Both sides are now engaged in a heroic offensive and defensive battle, so Imphal has now fallen into a decisive battle state.

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 12th: The fighter squadron of the Japanese air force in Burma flew to the skies over Palel on the morning of the 11th and carried out low-altitude bombing of enemy artillery positions entrenched in Ailan and Sabam, dealing a devastating blow to the enemy's main force. Several hours later, they made contact with ten enemy high-speed aircraft over Palel and engaged in fierce aerial combat, shooting down one of them, and the enemy aircraft were defeated. Furthermore, on the way back, they discovered three enemy North American bombers attempting to attack a certain base and pursued them, shooting down one of them in the Arakan Mountains, 12 kilometers west of Shebao. One was unconfirmed. In this battle, one Japanese aircraft self-destructed.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 12th: The Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters announced on the 11th that the Japanese army had launched an attack in the Palel highway area and had withdrawn from the position after fierce resistance from the Anti-Axis forces.

### Funeral of Marshal Koga Held Solemnly Yesterday - Prime Minister Tojo Personally Offered Incense and Paid Respects

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th: The naval funeral of the late Japanese Navy Admiral Marshal Koga was solemnly held today at Tsukiji Hongwanji Temple. Marshal Koga was a general revered by the Japanese people. In order to express their condolences, the citizens of Tokyo flew flags at half-mast at every house on this day. The streets through which the spirit of the Marshal passed were filled with welcoming citizens. Therefore, the funeral procession of Marshal Koga's spirit arrived in front of Hongwanji Temple at 12:25 amidst the worship of thousands of people and the melodious sound of military music. On the street in front of the magnificent and great Hongwanji Temple, demobilized soldiers, various branch associations, schools, agencies, and groups were lined up. At both ends of the street, it was crowded with tens of thousands of citizens waiting to pay their respects, with no sound at all. Listening carefully, there were often faint weeping sounds in the crowd. The expression on everyone's face was full of mourning, solemnity, and indignation. At 12:50, the Imperial Family, government officials, and various guests arrived at the venue one after another. Dignified honor guards were lined up outdoors. On the altar in front of the venue, the spirit and portrait of the late Marshal Koga were placed. In front of the spirit were flowers and offerings bestowed by the Empress Dowager and both Their Majesties the Emperor and Empress. Various medals of the Marshal were displayed on the table, and many flowers offered by officials and guests were also arranged around it, further decorating the venue solemnly and grandly under the illumination of mercury lamps. At 1:00 PM, the chief mourner, Marshal Koga's wife, relatives, Naval Minister Shimada, members of the funeral committee, those accompanying the coffin, and those carrying the Marshal's sword, medals, and commemorative badges, as well as Prime Minister Tojo and other cabinet ministers, officials, and guests, took their seats in order, and the ceremony began. First, everyone stood in silence. After the Imperial Envoy, representing the Imperial Family, offered the Imperial salute, Naval Minister Shimada and other officials delivered eulogies. The honor guards raised their guns in salute, then chanted sutras. Then, Naval Minister Shimada, the bereaved family, and relatives offered incense and paid their respects. At 1:45 PM, Prime Minister Tojo, representing the 100 million Japanese people, offered incense to the spirit of the Marshal. At the same time, the honor guards outside simultaneously raised their guns and fired three salutes into the air. Three wisps of white cloud immediately appeared in the blue sky. At this time, all the Japanese people across the country also silently prayed and paid their respects to the spirit of Marshal Koga in their own homes, factories, and streets. From 2:00 PM, joint worship by various groups, schools, and citizens began. Tens of thousands of citizens immediately and automatically formed orderly lines, and gradually went to the spirit to offer incense and pay their respects. The funeral venue of Marshal Koga was also filled with feelings of grief and determination. When each citizen paid their respects to the spirit of the Marshal, they seemed to be vowing, "We will not rest until we have destroyed Britain and America."

### Warriors of the Indian National Army Talk About Their Impressions of Participating in the War - Fighting for Liberation as Friends with the Japanese Army

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 12th: Warriors of the Indian National Army held a symposium recently at a certain Japanese army base in Arakan. A reporter personally heard their statements about their impressions of the old battles and their distant ideals, and also had a Q&A session with them as follows:

Japanese Army's Skillful Tactics Lead to Victory. Question: Gentlemen of the National Army, after this joint operation with the Japanese Army Assault Unit, and after this life together, what are your feelings about the differences between the Japanese and British armies? Please have Captain A express his opinion. (A) The British army often starts with the winning code and the basic principles of combat, but the Japanese Army Assault Unit's combat principles do not take this as an example. For example, maintaining and communicating connections are cleverly used as sharp tools, but the Japanese army can often gain physiological advantages due to the advancement of tactics. For example, in this assault unit operation, they first thoroughly understood the enemy's weaknesses, and then launched an attack on the enemy's flanks and rear, thus completing the great mission in less than two days. The enemy's rear base and communication lines were also completely cut off without leakage. After six days of difficult and dangerous mountain roads, the enemy was finally defeated. Therefore, the morale of the Japanese army is even more旺盛. If the British army is compared with the Japanese army, it is like the difference between heaven and earth.

Never Stop Until the Goal Is Achieved. What are your impressions after participating in this operation? (B) All of us in the National Army deeply understand the purpose of liberation and its greatness. The entire army swore that they would never stop fighting until the goal of liberation and independence was achieved. We regard returning to the rear as a kind of shame. This is the first time we have fought side by side with the Japanese army. We sincerely admire the lofty spirit and firm will of the Japanese army. (C) The Japanese army's quiet and swift marching, the strictness of military discipline, and the greatness of their spirit of obedience are most admirable. During combat, even if food is interrupted, their fighting spirit does not diminish slightly. "Sacrificing the small self, loving the country, and regarding death as returning home," the Japanese army deserves these few words. (D) Japanese officers and soldiers always carry happiness and joy in their conversations, and their morale is the same. The Japanese army may not have a meal for several days, but their protection of the wounded and sick soldiers and their marching and combat are still the same as usual. Moreover, the Japanese army has always maintained confidence in victory.

Protecting the Wounded and Sick Soldiers Is a Duty That Should Be Fulfilled. Question: Lieutenant D once took care of a large number of Japanese wounded and sick soldiers during the Xinzeva operation, enduring all kinds of hardships and completing a great mission. Please briefly express the situation and your feelings at that time. (D) There is really no hardship to speak of. The Japanese people are sacrificing themselves and fighting everywhere for the liberation of Greater East Asia. We Indians pray for victory for our motherland and for Greater East Asia. Protecting Japanese wounded and sick soldiers is a duty that should be fulfilled. Even if we die in battle, we can win the gratitude of 400 million compatriots. This is really a great undertaking. Although Japanese soldiers are injured, they still often say "Go to the front line to kill the enemy, kill the enemy." I really admire this. Question: Captain, what were your impressions when you first commanded the National Army as a commander? (A) The difficulties encountered by the National Army in this operation were expected, so I was very worried about the completion of the mission. As a result, we were able to achieve results beyond expectations, and I believe that the future must be bright.

Sacrificing the Small Self Can Lead to Victory. Question: Do you think that you have gained a lot of valuable experience participating in this operation? (B) After this battle, the National Army has increased several times in spirit. At the same time, we have gained a lot of practical and valuable experience from the Japanese army. We used to think that it would be difficult to complete the operation without rear support, but after this operation, we completely overturned this idea. After all, the army does not only fight with material things, but also relies heavily on spirit. (D) The enemy has no such strong fighting spirit. As soon as they are hit, they abandon their armor and weapons and are in a terrible state. Even if our food is cut off, we can fight like the Japanese army, and we will never lose our fighting spirit due to a slight blow. (G) I now understand that whether it is a commander or a soldier, if they are willing to sacrifice the small self, they can win. For example, the several times that food was cut off during this operation, we finally completed the mission after considerable endurance. This is the best example.

The God of Victory Is Always by Our Side. (D) Soldiers of an independent country only know how to kill themselves to achieve benevolence. We are independent Indian soldiers with a spirit of sacrifice. We want to be friends with the brave Japanese soldiers. If we do not achieve victory, we will never be able to return home. I believe that the God of Victory is always by our side.

### Burma Formally Appoints Special Investigation Team to Inspect China, Japan, Manchukuo, and Thailand

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 12th: The Chief Administrator of Burma's Bhamo recently believed that Burma's independence was recent, and in order to seek sound development in the future, to take on the responsibility of a member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, to benefit the strengthening of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, he specially appointed Dr. Ba Han, Chairman of the Legal Review Committee, as the chief member of the Special Investigation Team, leading the team to inspect China, Japan, Manchukuo, Thailand and other countries in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. This matter was formally announced on the 11th. According to the plan, the dispatch of the Special Investigation Team was decided after careful consideration by the Bhamo national representative after returning from attending the Greater East Asia Conference last November. There are two purposes: first, in view of the fact that Burma's political, economic, and administrative aspects all need to be promoted in the most scientific and efficient way during wartime, it is planned to establish a planning institute, and the dispatch of the investigation team will serve as preparation for the establishment of the government's central authority. Second, to change the situation in various countries of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and to have cordial talks with the leaders of various countries, to promote friendly relations between the countries and to strengthen the ties between the Co-Prosperity Sphere. The dispatch of the investigation team as goodwill ambassadors has great significance in Burma. Regarding the dispatch of investigation teams to foreign countries, except for the so-called inspection team to France during the Mindon Dynasty in the past, this is the first time in Burma. Therefore, the Burmese government has high expectations for it. As for the content of the investigation, there are more than 200 items in 11 departments, including national planning, land irrigation, resource labor, agriculture, industry, trade, credit, finance, and education. According to the committee's announcement, in addition to the aforementioned committee members, there are two other committee members, namely Dai Shaozha and Wei Jingnian. When they were formally appointed on the 11th, Bhamo also announced that the special investigation of Bici was the first of its kind in Burma, and its significance was profound and great. The task of the investigation team is to conduct in-depth research on the construction status of Japan and other East Asian countries, especially administrative planning and wartime production. The investigation is about how the Greater East Asian countries exchange experts. The kind of agreement is even more about how to strengthen cooperation among the Greater East Asian countries during the wartime. In short, the purpose of this investigation is to establish a closer relationship between Burma and the Greater East Asian countries, and to bear the task of a goodwill ambassador.

### Central Reserve Bank Restricts Lending - Defines Scope and Target - And Divides Areas to Determine Collateralized Lending Limits

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th: In order to assist the government in stabilizing prices and promote production, the Central Reserve Bank has formulated measures to restrict lending. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. It is now known that the bank, in its capacity as a national bank, is supervising financial institutions to work together to eliminate the trend of speculation and hoarding, and to encourage production enterprises. It is gradually contracting general commercial lending, so that the funds of various industries can be balanced and adjusted. Based on this principle, it has recently adjusted its business policy, defining the scope and target of lending, and dividing areas for lending and not lending, which will be implemented from today. The detailed measures are as follows:

Inter-bank lending necessary to regulate the market. (Divided into two parts.) (A) Operational lending adopts an absolute collateral system, deliberates on the actual situation of each industry, determines the limit, and after each industry obtains the loan, it will be used in industry and commerce at any time, or retained for its own emergency use. (B) Production loans are based on the principle of re-mortgaging, and the limit will be determined separately in accordance with the previous regulations. The selection of this lending, the borrower's purpose, collateral, the quantity of raw materials purchased, the production situation, product sales, inventory quantity, and production capacity must be thoroughly investigated and supervised. If it is found that the borrower has suspended production or is not used for direct production departments, it can be recovered or rejected at any time. Various special loans under the national government agencies or national policy. The above loans cannot be undertaken by ordinary financial institutions, and are generally directly undertaken by the Central Reserve Bank.

In addition, the Central Reserve Bank has temporarily divided the locations where it has branches into areas for lending and not lending, depending on the establishment of financial institutions. The regulations are as follows: Nanjing, Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou are areas where ordinary commercial loans are not made. If there is a need for operational lending between industries and they provide collateral goods for re-mortgaging, the original cargo owner should be a formal business. However, the lending limit for each business and the types of collateral must also be strictly determined. As for production loans, they are all undertaken by the industry and trade and re-mortgaged to the Central Reserve Bank. If the funds that the industry cannot undertake are not available, the Central Reserve Bank may temporarily directly lend them. Ningbo, Bengbu, Wuhu, Zhenjiang, Changshu, Yangzhou, Taixian, Nantong, Anqing, Jiaxing, Songjiang, Taicang, Kunshan, Xiashi, Shaoxing, Yuyao, and Zhenhai are areas where ordinary commercial loans can be temporarily made, but lending is not a fixed business. In addition to production loans, if it is necessary to undertake business mortgage loans, the lending limit for each business and the types of collateral must still be carefully investigated in advance and reasonably determined to prevent hoarding. Hankou, Wuchang, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Xuzhou, Haizhou, Lianyungang, Suqian, and Huaiyin are absolutely not making loans unless specially approved.

### Japan's Imperial Headquarters Announces: War Situation in Central China; Focus of Conflict Shifts to the Funiu Mountains

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:40 PM on the 12th: Japanese forces in Central China, after launching an offensive from the vicinity of Xinyang on May 1st, began advancing north. By the 9th, they had successfully linked up with Japanese forces advancing south from the area formerly of Xuchang in North China. Japanese forces operating in the western region of the Pinghan Railway, after annihilating the main force of Tang Enbo's army southeast of Luoyang, are currently continuing their offensive. Since the commencement of this operation and up to May 6th, the primary confirmed results are as follows: Enemy forces suffered losses of 19,500 dead left behind, 4,031 captured, and captured various artillery pieces totaling 101 and approximately 7,000 firearms. Japanese casualties amounted to 213 dead.

Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) – Japanese forces converged between Suiping and Zhumadian on the 10th. After only three weeks of fighting, over 200 li of railway between Luoyang and Xinyang is now under Japanese control. Currently, there are approximately 100,000 to 150,000 of Chiang's troops in the Zhengzhou and Luoyang areas; however, they have been fragmented into four or five pieces. It is quite astonishing to observers that the combat power of Tang Enbo's army, regarded as the most elite unit under Chiang's command, is so weak. This also serves as concrete evidence of the declining combat strength of Chongqing. The focus of military operations has shifted to the Funiu Mountains south of Luoyang, where the main enemy forces are engaged in fierce battles around Lushan. The Chongqing side claims that the Japanese operation aims to open the Beijing-Hankou Railway. As Luoyang is now in an encirclement situation, the direction in which the elite Japanese troops will turn is something we should wait and see.

Japanese Forces Occupy Areas Along the Railway Line

Xinzheng, 12th (Central News Agency) – After crossing the Yellow River, the main force of the Japanese army in North China launched a large-scale annihilation campaign against Tang Enbo's troops in the Funiu Mountains on both sides of the Pinghan Railway. Another strong force of the Japanese army is rapidly pursuing the defeated Chongqing troops along the Longhai Railway, advancing south along the Pinghan Railway, and quickly crossing major and minor rivers. By the evening of the 4th, they had approached Yanling, a city garrisoned by the First Division of the 19th Army (Gu Xijiu) of the 19th Army Group of Chongqing troops, and the Third Cavalry Division under He Zhuguo of the 50th Army Group, totaling approximately 7,000 men. The enemy used a tributary of the Ying River outside the city as their only defense, putting up fierce resistance. The Japanese army outflanked the Chongqing troops from the east and launched a fierce attack on the morning of the 5th, inflicting heavy damage and occupying the city. They then quickly advanced south from the Henan Plain, rapidly occupying Suiping, which was defended by the Third Cavalry Division of the Chongqing army, and further advancing south. The vanguard units converged with the elite Japanese troops in Central China in Queshan on the 9th. Consequently, an area of 80 kilometers along the Ping-Han Railway has fallen under Japanese control.

Japanese Aircraft Bomb Chongqing Troops on the Longhai Railway

2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the front line in Henan on the 12th, the Japanese air force has been dispatching aircraft to the front lines every day to assist the ground forces in their operations. On the morning of the 11th, they bombed four trucks of the Chongqing side retreating westward from the western section of the Longhai Railway (near Mianchi), and also bombed four locomotives. The troops and supplies carried on these vehicles were completely destroyed, and their rear transport routes were severed. After achieving their objectives, the Japanese aircraft safely returned to base.

Chongqing Eagerly Awaits Anglo-American Aid

This Standard Central News Agency report from Chongqing states that the failure of the Henan operation has dealt a severe blow to Chongqing. Chongqing has repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction due to the continuous progress of Japanese operations and the insufficient aid from Britain and America. A Chongqing dispatch from the Associated Press on the 10th stated that Chongqing plans to reduce wartime difficulties as the war enters its eighth year on July 7th, and therefore appeals to the anti-Axis countries for rapid assistance, the gist of which is as follows: Without weapons for the troops, there can be no victory in war. In the Henan operation, the Japanese army mobilized its most elite troops and employed numerous military tanks and armored vehicles in their operations. The Chongqing army, lacking sufficient equipment, not only cannot fight them but also requires a great deal of time to travel on foot. The Chongqing army and the people have paid a great price for this and are still continuing to do so. Now is truly the time for the anti-Axis countries to increase weapons and aid to solve our difficulties. Chongqing also knows that anti-Axis aid relies solely on air transport, so we request the anti-Axis countries to provide more transport aircraft to deliver supplies.

Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) – According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing government attributed the cause of their defeat to a lack of military equipment when responding to reporters. The main points of their discussion are as follows: Even if the Chongqing army receives any rigorous training, it is still difficult to hope for victory with a lack of military equipment. Therefore, we can only hope that the anti-Axis powers will constantly supply us with military equipment.

### Youth Model Corps; Returned Students from Japan Violate National Policy; Sent to Agricultural Youth Training Center for Internship

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) – The Third Detachment of the New Movement Central Youth Model Corps, which sent twelve members to study in Japan last year, has now graduated and returned to China, arriving in Nanjing on April 22nd.

As a result of the interception by German fighter formations and the cooperation of ground fire, several American four-engine bombers were shot down.

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) – According to a Huitong News Agency report, German war correspondent Weiss, who became famous for his reports on the Italian war, recently discussed the question of whether the anti-Axis powers' offensive in Europe is a bluff or will become a reality. He said, in short, that judging from the fact that British and American aircraft are bombing the people of their former countries, it is no longer a bluff. As for the German military authorities, they have long taken precautionary measures against their attack and are also eager for it to launch an attack. The attack may be imminent, as the weather in May is becoming stable. However, our troops guarding the Atlantic Wall are all waiting calmly, ready to fight them to the death. The enemy's bluffs or psychological warfare tactics will never succeed.

Although there has been no communication with the Soviet Union yet, it is generally known that the Balkans are regarded as a "Soviet sphere of influence."

### Turkey Halts Chrome Ore Exports; Germany States Position

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) – According to a Huitong News Agency report, the German public bulletin last night stated that the Turkish government's cessation of chrome supply to Germany violates the existing treaty between the two countries. The German government's attitude on this matter has been communicated to the Turkish government by Ambassador Papen to Turkey.

### Overview of Economic Development in North China

North China is a military base for the Greater East Asia War, and its mission is becoming increasingly important as the war intensifies. However, various materials necessary for increasing production and transportation of important materials are becoming increasingly scarce. How to overcome this limping situation and lead to victory in construction is the new task of the 19th fiscal year in North China. In order to meet this absolute requirement, the North China Development Company has decided on the development business policy for the 19th fiscal year and is currently negotiating with the central authorities in Tokyo, which will be formally decided soon. The focus of this year's economic development policy in North China is light metal industry and steelmaking, followed by increased production of coal and iron ore.

Steelmaking Business In the 18th fiscal year, the focus of the steelmaking business was to complete the construction of the specially established smelting furnace transferred from Japan, which has largely completed 90% of the planned work. The focus of this year is to fully complete this specially established smelting furnace and to start construction.

Preparations for the steelmaking business and plans for increasing the production of iron ore, its raw material, have also been decided. In the 18th fiscal year, the actual production of iron ore in North China and Mongolia was about 70% of the planned amount, which cannot be said to be a good result. This is due to insufficient materials and technology. In order to solve this problem this year, an understanding has been reached between the Manchuria Industrial Company and the North China Development Company. The capital, technology, and capital of Manchuria will be introduced into the company, making the alliance between North China and Manchuria even closer.

Light Metal Industry Regarding the light metal industry, the North China Light Metal Industry Company is at its center, and local preparations are proceeding according to plan. If the machinery ordered from Japan can arrive as scheduled, products can be launched within this year. On-site production of aluminum and increased production of its raw material, alum shale, are also the focus of this year. This production increase plan has been implemented since February, and power and labor are sufficient, implementing the government's production increase orders.

Raw Material Coal Next, speaking of coal, the driving force of all heavy industries. There has been no significant increase in quantity compared to last year, but considering the lack of materials and other reasons, the training for the 19th fiscal year may not be a satisfactory achievement. The center of this plan lies in ensuring the planned quantity and preparing new coal storage facilities, for which a considerable amount of funds has been released in the budget. In addition, the increased production plan, or the use of cyanide to develop chemical industries, and the preparation of coal liquefaction projects are also important business policies for this year.

Funds and Labor The above is an overview of this economic development. To promote these plans, approximately 100,000 yuan is required. Half of it can be handled locally. Regarding the labor problem, North China is originally a very abundant place for labor, but recently very few laborers have gone to Manchuria, and because mechanization is not progressing rapidly, the more urgent the production increase order is, the greater the ratio of labor is needed. Therefore, in this year's development budget, the labor cost is quite large. The previously laissez-faire labor policy has now become a new issue, which is caused by the increase in the power of the Chinese Communist Party. It has become one of the new difficulties in the economic development of North China and should not be ignored. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun of April 22)

### Consultation Committee Invites Press to Study People's Livelihood Issues; Actively Discussing and Drafting a Plan to Adjust People's Livelihood

In order to communicate opinions between officials and the people, the Municipal Government of this city established a Municipal Affairs Consultation Committee, which was formally established on the 1st. The committee believes that issues related to the people's livelihood are of utmost importance and is reportedly conducting intensive research to prepare a proposal. The Municipal Government specifically invited reporters from various newspapers in the city yesterday to introduce the standing committee members of the Consultation Committee and to conduct various cordial discussions. Those present from the Municipal Government were Secretary-General Wu Songgao and Director of the Food Bureau Feng You. Those present from the Consultation Committee were Chairman of the Standing Committee Li Sihao and Standing Committee members Lin Kanghou, Xiang Kangyuan, Chen Ribing, Shen Siliang, Chen Binsu, and Wu Yunzhai (absent due to official business). More than 20 reporters from various newspapers attended. First, Secretary-General Wu delivered a speech of introduction, briefly stating: After the establishment of the Consultation Committee, this is the first time we are meeting with the press today. We hope to take this opportunity to exchange opinions and strengthen relationships. We hope that everyone present will freely express your opinions.

### Mr. Lin Kanghou Reports on Committee Affairs

Standing Committee Member Lin Kanghou then reported on the general situation of the Consultation Committee's work. He briefly stated: Secretary-General Wu has just explained the purpose of the meeting. The establishment of the Consultation Committee is undoubtedly expected by both officials and the people. It is a welcome phenomenon that the Municipal Government is organizing a consultation committee to adopt public opinion and study and improve administrative policies through consultation. However, the work of the Consultation Committee is extremely large. The most urgent issues at present are the most important issues related to the people's livelihood, namely food and fuel. Therefore, a special Subcommittee on Daily Necessities has been organized to discuss and study them. The proposed points are divided into two parts: 1. The entire food issue; 2. The Shanghai food issue. The results of the research will be submitted to the Mayor for approval before being announced and implemented. After the establishment of the Consultation Committee, it is planned to first select the most important issues at present and organize five committees: Finance, Education, Rural Areas, Public Security, and Daily Necessities. Begin to research and assist the Municipal Government in carrying out reforms. The Standing Committee will convene once a week, and the plenary meeting of the Consultation Committee will be held once a month. In the future, it is hoped that the press will provide more honest suggestions. If you have any opinions, you can submit them to the committee in writing or orally. In addition, in order to receive citizens' opinions on municipal administration, the committee has set up a "Citizens' Opinion Box." We hope that citizens will provide honest suggestions and statements. Detailed methods will be formulated and announced separately. Standing Committee members must be present at the meeting to work from 3:00 PM every Monday and Friday. The consultation committee members are all volunteers, and the staff members are concurrently held by the staff members of the First District Public Office. In addition to stationery and paper, there are no other expenses.

### List of Committee Members

Members of the Daily Necessities Committee: Li Sihao, Wu Yunqi, Chen Bin, Jin Xiongbai, Xiang Kangyuan, Feng Bingnan, Yuan Deng, Lin Kanghou, Dai Ren, Shan Chen Ribing, Tang Shoumin, Yan Huiqing, Zhu Boquan, Shen Siliang, Fu Heng, Shao Puqing, Lin Kanghou, Chen Ribing, Zhao Zhengping, Zhu Boquan, Dai Zhou Zuomin, Chen Ribing, Chen Bin, Yunqing, Yao Qingsan, Li Quanshi, Wu Zhenxiu, Fu Heng, Li Sihao, Shen Siliang, Wu Chen Bin, Xiang Kangquan, Guo Shun, Wen Ting, Lin Kanghou, Wu Qi, Jin Xiongbai, Wen Ting, Zhao Ren Shan, Tang Shoumin, Zhao Zhengping

### Opinions Raised on Food Issues

Mr. Jiang Yunzhang of the China Daily then raised an opinion, saying: Recently, the black market for food has become more fierce again. Does the authorities have any methods to suppress it in order to stabilize the people's minds? Secretary-General Wu, Director Feng, and Committee Chairman Li Sihao expressed their opinions one after another. The general idea is as follows: The issue of food is very important. The difficulties in the past lie in procurement and transportation. The Economic Department of the First District Public Office and the Municipal Food Bureau only take charge of distribution work. Now, the Municipal Government and the Subcommittee on Daily Necessities of the Consultation Committee are focusing on this issue to study stopgap measures and fundamental solutions. As a result of the research, a relatively rapid and easy-to-implement plan has been obtained. At the same time, the local authorities have agreed to provide full assistance. Therefore, the food issue will be reasonably adjusted in the near future.

### Mr. Chen Binsu Summarizes the Conclusions

Finally, Standing Committee Member Chen Binsu summarized the conclusions of the opinions of all those present as follows:

I believe that there are about five issues that Shanghai should pay more attention to at present:

First is the issue of the people's livelihood;

Second is the issue of public security;

Third is the issue of finance;

Fourth is the issue of the current situation in the suburbs;

Fifth is the issue of education.

In terms of the issue of the people's livelihood, food and fuel, which are daily necessities, are the most important. It is undeniable that the past rice grain control has not worked. We cannot follow the old ways and should talk about reform. In the process of reform, we should pay attention to the following points:

Do not forget the wartime, because in the wartime environment, we must implement a control policy. But at the same time, we must take into account the suitability for China's national conditions and the people's sentiments.

The more simple the control method, the better.

Corruption in government-run institutions must be eliminated; and merchants who seek exorbitant profits must also be prevented.

The Chinese and Japanese authorities must obtain full cooperation.

At the same time, citizens should also cooperate with the authorities.

In addition, citizens certainly hope that the authorities will implement reforms as soon as possible. But in a negative way, citizens must also be more frugal. For example, people in Japan eat brown rice, and if people grind rice into white rice, they are regarded as violating the law and punished. In the Hongkou area of this city, high-end Japanese restaurants have closed, which indicates wartime frugality. Because wartime life is gradually becoming difficult, it is inevitable. We must emulate the practical frugality of the Japanese people.

As for the fuel issue, the lack of coal is very serious, so electricity has been restricted again and again. However, contradictory phenomena such as all-night mahjong, the electricity consumption of electric refrigerators, and the electricity consumption of entertainment venues, hotels, etc. should be banned even when coal is abundant, let alone at a time when electricity is restricted. On the one hand, we certainly demand that the authorities quickly transport coal to solve the fuel panic; on the other hand, the citizens also strive to conserve and avoid waste to overcome the difficulties.

### Central China Water and Electricity Company Intensifies Electricity Conservation; Limited Quantity Reduced by Another 20% on the 21st

In order to intensify electricity conservation, the Central China Water and Electricity Company has specifically stipulated that the Shanghai area will start from the 21st of this month, and other areas will start from June 1st, as a period to emphasize consumption conservation for a period of three months. To all electricity consumers, regardless of their nationality or whether they are military or civilian, we urge them to earnestly conserve electricity and not exceed the limited quantity. The target amount is temporarily reduced by another 20% based on the current limit. However, because we trust the consumer's determination to fight, we do not use the previous mechanical correction method, but instead rely on the consumer's self-awareness and cooperation. If consumers are not sincere in responding to this movement and cannot achieve the expected results, then the company may have to launch a comprehensive strengthening of consumption restrictions, such as limiting power supply time and partial power supply. As for the implementation method, under the guidance of the Consulate General, the Municipal Government, etc., the purpose of this movement will be conveyed to fellow citizens through various neighborhood protection groups, Baojia organizations, and the Industrial Cooperative Association, and newspapers, movies, radio and other propaganda agencies will be mobilized to thoroughly understand the consumer. At the same time, a survey team will be set up to conduct on-site surveys of the reduction status of each user, and those with excellent results will be rewarded with electricity bill discounts, while those with poor results will be punished with power outages. As for the company, it will strive to plan business rationalization, prevent losses in power generation and supply, and study and implement reasonable adjustments to the consumption limit in order to complete this electricity conservation movement. Aokiyoshitaro, Vice President of Central China Water and Electricity Company, also issued a statement, hoping that citizens will work together based on the above principles.

French Power Company Issues Third Notice

According to a reporter's investigation, the Shanghai French Tramway and Electric Lighting Company, in order to conserve water and electricity, issued a third notice yesterday: "In order to organize water and electricity business, this company issued a notice to users on April 29 and 30, urging them to pay attention to this matter. However, all electricity consumption still greatly exceeds the limit. Therefore, this company will not notify all users who exceed the limit in the future and will directly suspend the supply of water and electricity as a sanction. Moreover, due to environmental governance, this company has to re-examine the original set limit, and the reduced quantity will be notified separately by letter. This notice is hereby issued."

### The Fifteen Banks in This City Loan Funds for Cocoon Collection

Totaling Fifty Million Yuan

Due to the upcoming season for spring cocoons, the China Silk Corporation and silk factories in Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Wuxi, and other places require funds for large-scale purchase of spring cocoons. They jointly approached the banking sector in this city for cocoon collection loans. After several rounds of negotiations, fifteen banks in this city, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Real Estate Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Tianlu Bank, Guohua Bank, and Huaxing Bank, have organized a cocoon collection loan syndicate, establishing a fifty million yuan loan. The China Silk Corporation will borrow twenty-five million yuan, and the silk factories in Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Wuxi, and other places will borrow twenty-five million yuan. When the loans are issued, the Silk Industry Association will provide certification. The banks will handle the loans by accepting banker's acceptances, with an interest rate of 1%. The Central Reserve Bank has agreed to handle discounting, with a discount interest rate of 1.2%. The loan term is three months per period.

### Wartime Consumption Special Tax to Be Universally Implemented on a Regular Basis, Collected by Branch Offices Starting on the 16th

The Tax Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance has been ordered to implement the wartime consumption special tax, starting from January 16th of this year, in fifteen cities and counties, including Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Wujin, Danyang, Changshu, Suhu, Bengbu, Yangzhou, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Shaoxing, and Ningbo. The tax will be levied on retail goods and banquets/hotels. The tax rate for ordinary goods is 4% of the value, and for luxury goods, it is 10% of the value. As for the consumption special tax on banquets and hotels, it is 15% of the total revenue. Except for the tax revenue in the first district and old eight districts of Shanghai, which is entrusted to the municipal government for collection, the consumption special tax in other areas will be collected by the local tax branch offices under the administration, and the revenue will be reported and transferred to the treasury on a monthly basis. In recent months, the tax revenue has been very good. It is now learned that, in order to increase tax revenue, the administration has already submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Finance to universally implement the consumption special tax on retail goods and banquets/hotels in all counties and towns, as well as rural areas, of the three provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, in addition to the counties and towns where the consumption special tax has already been implemented, starting from May 16th of this year. All consumption special taxes previously levied by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance will be transferred to the local tax authorities under the administration for collection starting from the 16th. If there are any tax authorities that have not been established in various regions, the administration may entrust the provincial, municipal, and county governments to collect them. It is reported that tax authorities have already been established in the three provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as in towns and rural areas.

### Domestic Postal Rates Increased, Effective from the 16th, International Postal Rates Also Being Revised

On the 10th of this month, the 46th Supreme National Defense Conference approved the Ministry of Industries' request to increase domestic postal rates by 200%. The postal authorities in this city have decided to implement it starting on the 16th of this month. All domestic postal rates will be charged according to the newly revised prices. This price increase, except for the revision of international postal rates which is still under application, increases other types of postal rates by approximately two to three times.

### The U.S. Navy's Strategic Offensive Is Destined to Be a Bubble, Analysis of General Trends by Minister Matsushima

At a reception for Chinese reporters held by the Press Department of the Japanese Fleet in China yesterday at 3:00 PM, Minister Matsushima delivered a speech on the strategic offensive of the U.S. Navy. The following is a record:

Forced by the Situation to Launch an Offensive

The strategic offensive of the U.S. Navy is gradually approaching. On May 10th, Admiral Kinkaid, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied U.S. Fleet in the Kinmen area, Admiral Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet, and Admiral Halsey, Commander-in-Chief of the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Forces, held an operational conference. The result of the conference was to decide to prepare to use the U.S. fleet to destroy the Japanese fleet from now on, which is becoming increasingly obvious. The reason for the enemy's active counteroffensive can be assumed to be that their domestic situation is urgent, and they must actively counterattack.

Production Capacity Shows a Decline

First, the U.S. production capacity has reached its saturation point, and recently there has been a decline. Recently, Wilson, Chairman of the U.S. Aviation Planning Committee, announced that U.S. aircraft production in April was lower than in March. Aircraft production in March was 8,340, and in April it decreased significantly.

The U.S. has never announced the losses of the navy since the start of the war. Recently, due to repeated requests from the American people, the U.S. government began to announce them. However, the numbers announced by the U.S. are far from those announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters. Based on factual judgments, the number of losses announced is less than half of the actual number. The reason for not announcing it for a long time is nothing more than to conceal the magnitude of the actual losses in order to reduce public concern. The U.S. has always claimed to maintain price parity, but now it feels a lack of supplies, and there is panic over wartime life. The number of labor strikes in the United States is recorded on the left:

Dreaming of Success with Reckless Actions

Second, Roosevelt's presidential election is approaching in July. Because the re-election period is approaching, he is rushing to counterattack, hoping to succeed in one fell swoop. The U.S. has always concealed the actual situation of the war and only adopted the so-called "reckless tiger crossing the river" tactics. Therefore, the U.S. military has exposed many shortcomings in the first few battles. The enemy believes that the most important front line is from New Guinea to the Philippines, and then from the Philippines to the Luo Nan-Guangdong area. Now they are transporting as much naval, land, and air force as possible, preparing to destroy the Japanese army. In modern warfare, the distance between the battlefield and the supply base is extremely important due to transportation relations, especially since the United States relies solely on material power for combat. With such difficulties, it is self-evident that they cannot win. The Japanese side has ample strength and is waiting in full force for the enemy to attack the inner line. It has confidence and is not worried.

On the 10th of this month, a Philadelphia telegraph reported that Harold Meson, who planned to assassinate Roosevelt on the 9th, has been arrested.

Conspiracy Lies Fall Apart

Recently, the U.S. has been conducting propaganda in Shanghai, creating various rumors, such as: Marshal Koga committed suicide, alienating Japanese-German and Japanese-Soviet relations, strengthening British and American forces, weakening Japanese pressure, and annihilating Japan. The following are answers to the above rumors:

There is no need to explain the reason for Marshal Koga's death. In short, anyone who commits suicide must have a weak heart. How can a person with a weak will take on the responsibility of a general? This kind of rumor was created by Chongqing and falls apart by itself.

Regarding Japanese-Soviet relations, especially the closeness of Japanese-Soviet relations, the signing of the previous Oshima-Hirota Soviet-Japanese Fishery Agreement and the concession of oil and mineral rights both prove the closeness of Japanese-Soviet relations.

Regarding the strength of the British and American forces, according to Wilson, the U.S. production in April decreased compared to March. Its strength can be imagined. On the contrary, Japan is using the production of China and various southern regions. This year, the production of ships has exceeded five or six times the previous amount.

Regarding the annihilation of Japan, the Japanese people have always held the spirit of "fighting to the last ditch." Rather than "retreating to await death," it is better to "advance to overcome." This kind of rumor will only encourage the Japanese people's hatred and anger.

### Appeal to the Authorities of the Fourth District to Rectify the Rationing Agencies

— Yale

All citizens residing in the Fourth District express dissatisfaction when talking about the rationing situation in the local township office. For example, citizens who have newly moved into the district, after completing the household registration procedures and obtaining the residence permit, the household registration must have been reported by the neighborhood chief long ago. Then, logically, the ration coupons for household items, such as rice, flour, oil, and soap, should be issued in the shortest possible time, just like in the first and second districts. However, citizens in the Fourth District have to wait another two or three months, or even half a year, after moving in before they can receive the rationed items. Moreover, items like household sugar are further delayed. The author lives in the Fourth District and has also been affected by this. Although there are many bad neighborhood chiefs, the chief of my neighborhood is honest and upright, and praised by the citizens. He should not be embezzling the rations. Whether the township office is embezzling the public's needs is unknown, but people are talking about it, indicating that there must be abuses. I hope the authorities will pay attention to rectification to prevent unscrupulous people from increasing the burden and anger of the citizens.

Leaving aside the past situation, let's take the recent distribution of household soap as an example. The Fourth District began distributing the second batch of household soap on the 6th of this month. The price of the Scissors brand soap was set at 38 yuan, which is 6.5 yuan higher per bar than the same brand of soap recently distributed in the First District. The notice issued by the township office at the entrance of the distributor stated that it was due to cost factors. However, the prices of other rationed items are exactly the same as those in the First District. Since they are all under the same rationing agency in Shanghai, it is reasonable for the prices of rationed items to be uniform.

In recent years, the authorities have spared no effort in issuing price limits for various items. Why is it that the price of rationed items under the unified control agency is instead allowed to increase? Moreover, the soap distributed on the same day in the Fourth District and the First District differed greatly in price, which is deeply puzzling to the citizens. I sincerely hope that the authorities will uphold their credibility and gain the support of the people.

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

From the next day onwards, Tatsuo stayed at the painter's house in the city, serving as an apprentice. He swept the courtyard, heated the bathwater, went out to buy things, and delivered and picked up items.

After a month, he discovered that the painter, who seemed extremely indifferent, was the most affectionate person. At the same time, he also understood that the painter's wife was a self-willed woman with mental problems. Because she had no children, the wife often wore extremely fashionable Western clothes and went out. However, every time she went out, she always asked Tatsuo to shine her shoes, which made Tatsuo feel uncomfortable.

(Damn it, shining shoes for a woman is unlucky for ten thousand years.)

The temper of a Kagoshima man flared up. However, at that time, for the sake of learning, he had to swallow his anger.

He only focused on practicing sketching. He meticulously sketched everything he saw with charcoal and pencil. When he had accumulated a considerable number, he sent them to the painter for criticism.

"The most important thing is sketching. Work hard!"

Apart from this, there were no other comments. However, Ichiki recognized that Tatsuo had artistic talent. This could also be seen from Ichiki's facial expressions.

After this, Tatsuo truly felt the fun of art. Even when he saw an apple or a blade of grass, he couldn't help but want to draw them. He finally obtained his teacher's permission and began to play with oil paints.

The first still life he drew, he felt in his heart, would definitely be scolded. However, when he took it to Ichiki, he was praised instead, who said:

"Humph, the colors are very well applied."

One day, Tatsuo and Ichiki went on a sketching trip together. It was his responsibility to carry the luggage and equipment. However, after arriving at the destination, he could also set up his easel not far from his teacher.

"Your paintings, in terms of being more skilled, are quite interesting. People generally say that I have the skill of a master, but you are even more skilled than me!"

Ichiki looked at the paintings that Tatsuo had drawn and said this kindly.

From Tatsuo's perspective, he could not feel the difference between skill and novelty. He was not yet able to understand the trends in the art world. He was simply painting the beauty he saw in his eyes as it was.

Since Ichiki began to seriously guide him, Tatsuo's paintings have been steadily improving. When the teacher was not at home, he could also use the painting room. So he unfolded the huge canvas and began to paint. However, the more diligent he was, the more Ichiki's wife disliked him. This was because he could not take care of the apprentice's tasks.

In the spring of the second year, due to his wife's suggestion, Tatsuo had to leave Ichiki's house. The wife found another apprentice, and the painter Ichiki also found another job for Tatsuo.

Social Service

### Exchanging Labor for Reward to Donate to Children in Need

To Whom It May Concern: My friend, Mrs. So-and-so, is a kind and virtuous lady who is devoted to public welfare. She usually not only encourages good deeds but also willingly helps the poor. In the past, she donated a large amount of money without using her name to help orphans and widows. Recently, she has been working hard to promote the products of a certain factory, hoping to achieve her wish of "contributing both effort and money." This sum of 900 yuan, which is the "reward" she earned for her "labor" – the commission for March – is now specifically donated to your organization to be used as assistance for needy children. Please issue a receipt in the name of "anonymous commission" so that it can be kept for safekeeping. Sincerely, Jin Yiqi

Note: The purpose of our organization's aid fund for needy children is to rescue helpless children and give them opportunities to learn skills so that they can become self-reliant and useful members of society. Now, an anonymous lady donates 900 yuan earned through her labor as aid for needy children. Her kindness, compassion, and dedication to public welfare are worthy of promotion in society. We sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will emulate the anonymous lady's righteous act, not hesitate to take responsibility, and contribute enthusiastically.
