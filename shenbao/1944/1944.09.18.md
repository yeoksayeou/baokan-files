### Thoughts After a Candid Discussion on the Current Situation of Cities, Counties, and Districts

— Chen Binhe

The Municipal Advisory Committee of this city, in order to understand the local situation of the various counties and districts under its jurisdiction, hosted the administrative inspectors of the First and Second Districts and the county magistrates of each county at noon yesterday in Shanghai. During the meeting, in addition to listening to reports on the actual situation of each county, they also fully exchanged opinions. I also participated in the meeting, and I would like to express my thoughts after the candid discussion as follows: In the past, we had deep expectations for the establishment of model districts in the seven counties under this city. Our opinion was that the seven counties are the periphery of the urban area of this city. If the periphery is unstable, the urban area cannot be secure alone. Only when everything in the periphery is on track can the deteriorated environment in the suburbs of Shanghai be changed, and the security of the entire Shanghai can be protected. We also proposed four guidelines for promoting the model districts in the seven counties on the eve of the merger of municipal agencies: First, establish the administrative system of each county and district. Second, improve the administrative personnel of each county and district. Third, reorganize the financial revenue and expenditure of each county. Fourth, maintain the security of each county and district. The conclusion of this candid discussion with the actual administrative authorities of each county is that security and finance are the two major problems. If security cannot be established, the reorganization of finance will be difficult to achieve. If finance cannot be sufficient, security will be difficult to establish as desired. Security relies on funding to be established, and finance relies on guarantees for collection. The two are closely related and must be discussed and resolved at the same time. In terms of the security of each county, generally speaking, this year's situation is more serious than last year because prices have risen repeatedly, and the cost of living has become higher, while the treatment of security teams and police officers who bear the security task is too meager. For example, the monthly salary of each security team member is only 350 yuan and three dou of rice, and the monthly salary of a police officer is 90 yuan and two and a half dou of rice. The office expenses of a security battalion are only 1,500 yuan per month, but in reality, they are at least 100,000 yuan. The huge amount of local supplies is still outside. In terms of efficiency, the number of people in each squadron is insufficient, firearms are insufficient, and the security force is extremely weak. The county magistrate originally served concurrently as the battalion commander of the security team, but only had the title without the actual power of command. Therefore, in name, the military and political powers of each county are unified, but in fact, the administrative power and the security power are separated. In terms of the finances of each county, because security cannot be established, financial tax revenue cannot be collected fully. Some of it is plundered by bandits, which can establish a permanent foothold. This is the biggest obstacle to the establishment of security. The treatment of civil servants is also too meager. The monthly salary of a section member is only about 2,000 yuan, which is difficult to maintain for personal life, and it is not enough to talk about raising honesty. Moreover, the monthly office expenses of the county government are far from sufficient, with a regulation of only 4,000 yuan. For example, the water bill for the Nanhui County Government alone requires 6,000 yuan per month (most of Nanhui drinks rainwater), and the gap between the budget and actual expenditure is too far. Secondly, educational funding is particularly scarce. Before the incident, it accounted for about 20% of the total administrative expenses, but now it is only 7%. Recently, educational funding has not been received since April. The blockade management of each county has all disadvantages and no advantages, and its harm is greater than that of the likin tax, which is insufficient to prevent bandits but more than enough to disturb the people. It is heard that the staff of the inspection posts at each blockade are of mixed character. Some of the personnel from the gambling platforms in the southern city went to work there after the gambling platforms were closed. The complexity of the personnel can be imagined. The above-mentioned shortcomings should be remedied urgently. In short, the first is to establish security, and the second is to reorganize finance. The starting point is to improve the authority of the county magistrate. Recently, after the district office was changed to the county government, the authority of the county magistrates of each county has not yet been established and divided. The agencies set up by the various bureaus and offices of the municipal government in each district should be abolished immediately and merged into the county government, so that the county magistrate has the entire administrative power that matches the name. Secondly, the principle of the financial income of each county should be to use it locally. The Shanghai urban area does not actually need to take it from the counties. On the contrary, it should designate funds every year to subsidize the necessary expenses of each county for security, education, and construction. Finally, there are still many local situations that are inconvenient to publish here, and that we cannot imagine. In the future, we must recognize that only by strengthening the periphery first can the urban area obtain true peace and security. If Shanghai's position cannot be established, there is no need to talk about the security of the peace zone, let alone lavishly talk about cooperating in the Greater East Asia War. We should not talk about theories in the future, but focus on practical work. Now that the commissioners of the two districts and the county magistrates of each county have expressed their efforts in their respective positions, then, as long as the municipal authorities lead properly and the citizens give full assistance, it can be expected that the seven counties will become model districts, and the entire Shanghai will become a national model district, which is not hopeless.

### Fierce Fighting Continues at the Southwestern End of Peleliu Island, Enemy Casualties Reach 5,000, and 60 Ships Sunk

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese military base in the central Pacific reported on the 17th: The Japanese troops on Peleliu Island have been fiercely attacking the enemy forces occupying the southwestern end of the island since midnight on the 15th. The enemy forces have gradually strengthened their forces since then, and some of them have invaded the island's airfield, where fierce fighting is currently taking place. It is expected that the enemy forces attempting to land on Peleliu Island are about one division, driving 150 tanks. As of the 16th, the Japanese military's achievements, in addition to injuring 5,110 enemy soldiers, also included sinking 60 enemy landing craft and setting fire to or destroying 50 enemy tanks.

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a central Pacific base on the 17th: A moving enemy cruiser suddenly struck a mine in the waters off the northern end of the Palau Islands on the morning of the 16th. A large explosion occurred, and it sank immediately.

### Enemy Landings on Palau and Morotai

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - A powerful American mobile unit has appeared in the waters west of the Western Caroline Islands since the 6th. American air forces have also been carrying out large-scale bombings of Palau, Yap, Halmahera in the Moluccas, and various parts of the Philippines for days. At dawn on the 15th, American forces used 40 transport ships, large and small, to approach within 15 kilometers of Peleliu Island in the Palau Islands. Around 6:00 a.m., they released landing craft and amphibious tanks to approach the shore. Then, around 8:00 a.m., they boarded about 300 landing craft and rushed straight to the southwestern shore of Peleliu from the front of the atoll, and began landing operations all at once. When the vanguard of the American landing force reached the atoll area, several boats and amphibious tanks struck laid mines and were immediately sunk, causing temporary chaos. After reorganizing their forces, they attacked the shore. Before and after the landing, the American mobile unit used fierce naval artillery fire to bombard the area around Peleliu and used a large number of naval aircraft to bomb and cover the landing operation. The Japanese garrison on the island took advantage of the landing of the American vanguard around 8:00 a.m. to launch a fierce ambush near the coast for about two hours. Around 10:00 a.m., they had completely repelled the landing force of about one division. Around 2:00 p.m., the American forces attempted to land again using a large number of landing craft, but were repelled due to the Japanese army's fierce attack near the coast. However, the American forces still sent a group of amphibious tanks to force a landing, and fierce fighting is currently unfolding in the area near the coast. It is difficult for the American forces to continue to carry out fierce naval artillery fire and bombing like rain in that area, but the Japanese garrison is still fighting bravely with strong fighting spirit. As for Morotai Island north of Halmahera Island, American forces also landed on the south coast on the morning of the 15th around 8:00 a.m., under the cover of a powerful mobile unit, with more than 50 small transport ships. The Japanese troops on the island are currently carrying out an ambush with a small number of troops, but some of the American forces have secured a base on the south coast.

### Japanese Government Launches Strong National Movement

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Koiso explained the six major decisive battle measures at the 85th Diet session and is actively preparing to realize them. Now, the Japanese government has launched a strong national movement in order to thoroughly implement these measures and to unleash the maximum determination of 100 million people. For example, State Minister Ogata has taken office as Vice President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. The recent changes in the leadership of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and various movement groups, as well as the reorganization of the lineup of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society's new President Kobayashi, are all manifestations of the Japanese 100 million people launching a national movement to win. The concrete direction of the movement is currently being carefully considered.

### Graduation Ceremony Held at Pharmaceutical Training Institute

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - Fifty-seven students from the seventh and eighth classes of the Nanjing Pharmaceutical Training Institute held a graduation ceremony at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Peace Hall at 9:00 a.m. on the 17th. Chairman Chu Minyi delivered a speech.

### Anti-Axis Forces Advance Deep into Siegfried Line, Fierce Fighting Southeast of Aachen

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: American troops northwest of Trier (Trier, located in southwestern Germany, near Luxembourg), having crossed the Saar River and advancing towards Bitburg, have engaged in fierce combat with German troops. American forces are concentrating land and air forces southeast and south of Aachen. Fierce fighting has broken out south of Stolberg, with German troops inflicting heavy casualties on the Anti-Axis forces. The Anti-Axis forces are concentrating their forces in the areas of Hasselt, Maastricht, and Metz, and will launch new offensives in each of these areas. Furthermore, German official war reports state that the American offensive in the Aachen area has been contained.

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Supreme Headquarters of the Anti-Axis Forces in Western Europe announced on the 16th that the vanguard of the American First Army had bypassed Aachen and advanced to the Siegfried Line. At the same time, the headquarters emphasized that these American forces have not yet completely breached the line.

### German Troops Withdraw from Southwestern Netherlands

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Maritime News Agency reports: All German troops from the coast of Flandre to southwestern Netherlands have completed their withdrawal. Only some rear guard units are still resisting the advance of the Anti-Axis forces along the Leopold Canal. The pressing Canadian First Army will likely not attempt to cross the wide Scheldt Estuary, but will move its main force to the confluence of the Albert Canal and the Scheldt River. This will allow the Anti-Axis forces to concentrate in Antwerp and Aachen, otherwise it would be difficult for the British Second Army and the American First Army there to concentrate their attack on the industrial area of the Rhineland. In the fighting of recent days, American and British forces have made more progress.

### German Defensive Battles Successful on Northern Sector of Eastern Front

Situation in Warsaw Also Improves

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Maritime News Agency reports: Although Soviet forces broke through in several places on the first day of the battle of Latvia, the German defensive battle has also achieved great success. The Soviets, with a large army of forty divisions, hoped to defeat the German Northern Army at Riga in one fell swoop, but have failed. The Soviet army launched an offensive from within the horseshoe-shaped area, attempting to drive the German army to the Gulf of Riga and annihilate it. Currently, the Soviet army has made no progress whether through encirclement or frontal attack. The German army retains a large and vital force sufficient to contain the Soviet offensive. Soviet troops who have broken through the German defense line are being annihilated. It is expected that the battle in the Baltic region will continue for several days. The situation northeast of Warsaw has also improved. There is no sign of the Soviet vanguard at the Raczymin bridgehead. The German army destroyed bridges over the Vistula River to prevent the enemy from breaking into Warsaw from Praga. Fierce fighting continues east of the Baskieter Pass. After clearing the enemy south of Sanok and annihilating the enemy south of Krosno, the Soviet army attacked again on Friday but was repelled.

### Ningbo Highway Officially Open to Traffic

Hangzhou, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Hangzhou-Ningbo Highway is a vital transportation route in eastern Zhejiang. After the incident, it was in a state of disrepair. The counties were indifferent due to financial difficulties and a lack of transportation. As a result, it has not been restored to this day. The general public considers the Shanghai route as the only way to travel. Recently, the number of sailing vessels has decreased, making it even more inconvenient for travelers. Therefore, the demand for the restoration of traffic on the highway is particularly urgent. Previously, the Hangzhou authorities invited wealthy merchants to raise 30 million gold to organize a guild. Now, the Administrative Inspectorate of the Sixth District of Zhejiang is requesting the assistance of the Central China Railway Company to allocate five passenger cars and one truck from other districts. It has now officially opened to traffic.

### Finnish Foreign Minister, Chief Negotiator for Peace Talks, Heads to Soviet Capital

### Turkey Appoints New Foreign Minister with Clear Pro-Soviet Stance

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Maritime News Agency reports: Turkish former Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu, who resigned two months ago, has now been replaced by President Inönü with Mr. Kacar as the new Foreign Minister. The former Foreign Minister was an advocate of a neutral policy. Since his resignation, relations with Germany have deteriorated. The Turkish President was very willing to wait for the development of the situation before appointing a new Foreign Minister, so he ordered Prime Minister Saracoğlu to temporarily serve as Foreign Minister. Since the dramatic changes in the Balkan situation and the approach of Soviet troops to the Turkish border, the Turkish government's pro-Soviet stance has become more definite. The Turkish government is eager to conclude a new agreement with the Soviet Union, but negotiations broke down earlier this month. It is difficult to predict whether it can have a satisfactory outcome.

### Quebec Conference Concludes, Britain and America Issue Joint Communique

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Maritime News Agency reports: The joint communique issued by Roosevelt and Churchill after the Quebec Conference was read yesterday at a press conference in Washington. It stated that [Roosevelt and Churchill could not definitively announce the end of the European war. The end of the European war must come before the launch of the Pacific offensive. Regarding the Pacific offensive, Roosevelt and Churchill also failed to state anything. In short, the decision of this conference is related to any point in the progress of the European and Asian wars.] According to the Associated Press, Prime Minister Churchill officially agreed to send British land, sea, and air forces to participate in the Pacific War after the end of the European war. The communique after the Quebec Conference also stated that the establishment of a commander-in-chief of the Pacific Theater was not discussed at the meeting. The Pacific war zone is too vast, and it is better to establish command by region. The attitude of the people attending this Quebec conference was more sincere than in any previous conference. This communique only described military issues and did not involve political events.

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports that the Quebec government officially announced yesterday that British Prime Minister Churchill has decided to return to London from Quebec, and the remaining issues will be left to the future. The location for future negotiations will be selected. Before returning home, the Prime Minister's whereabouts will be kept secret. President Roosevelt's actions will also be kept secret. Previously, it was rumored that Churchill would visit Washington after the Quebec Conference.

### Anti-Axis Security Conference, British, American, and Soviet Talks Conclude

### Intense Street Fighting in Aachen, Northern Italy

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) - Reports that the American First Army is engaging in street fighting with German troops in northern Aachen.

### Returning from the Soviet Union

The German-Soviet war is a historical experiment on the Russian people's national capacity and the strength of their system. The Russians' nervous endurance, tolerance of hardship, obedience, and other national characteristics have been fully revealed in the trenches of the front lines, the fierce street battles, and the national life of the rear, through more than three years of war. In addition, the political style of crude lines, shamelessness, and the meticulous implementation of resolute decisions have also been fully exposed. Once Hitler's troops crossed the border and began their advance into Soviet territory, they raised the banner of defending the righteousness and autonomy of aggression, shook hands with British and American financial capital, and dispatched diplomatic envoys to approach small allied countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Greece. The Soviets’ diplomatic maneuvering was such that, in the meeting on the eve of the anniversary of the revolution, November 6, 1941, when German troops were pressing within 60 kilometers of Moscow's suburbs, Stalin shouted: "Thus, the enemy's attempted organization of an anti-Soviet crusade is doomed to failure!"

### Stalin Personally Takes the Lead

Within days of the outbreak of war, the organization of the State Defense Committee was announced. This was a dictatorial organ that held all absolute power over military and political affairs. Stalin, in his position as its leader, assumed the supreme responsibility for directing the war and stood at the forefront of its criticism. In other words, Stalin exposed himself fully to the nation and the world immediately after the outbreak of the war. After the outbreak of war, the Soviet Union immediately implemented the following emergency measures as wartime economic countermeasures. 1. All materials, labor, and finance were completely transformed to launch a complete wartime economy. 2. Enterprises and laborers were withdrawn from the east, and efforts were made to quickly start work in new locations. 3. A rapid development of agricultural production was urgently planned in the eastern regions to compensate for the temporary loss of territory in the western regions. 4. In terms of fundamental improvements in enterprise management, efforts were made to improve the management of enterprises with military significance and to strengthen labor regulations. Newspapers say that this was made possible by the planning of the Soviet economy and the decisive implementation of policies. The Soviet newspapermen are quite proud of this.

### Industry Moves East

The transition from peacetime industry to a wartime economy – the mobilization of labor, the strengthening of labor regulations, etc. – are of course what any belligerent country should implement. The Soviet government was able to implement these measures within two or three months of the outbreak of war. Moreover, the Soviet method of transferring enterprises and laborers to the east is worthy of close attention. On the one hand, large-scale battles were being fought, and troops and weapons were continuously transported to the front lines. The railway transportation system was doing its utmost to complete this enormous task. At the same time, increased factory equipment and laborers were being transferred to the interior. This was truly a great undertaking, something humanity had not yet experienced. When German troops reached the right bank of the Dnieper River, the freight cars loaded with evacuation materials from the Cha Pulochki aircraft factory were piled up like mountains, but within days, they were completely transported to the east. After the initial encirclement of Leningrad, the main components were transported by air. As the enemy approached the outskirts of Moscow, hundreds of factories were on trains between the Volga and the Urals, and between the Urals and Central Asia. Even as the German troops advanced like a whirlwind, workers continued to work in the factories until, in the most urgent situation, they hurriedly dismantled the most essential machinery, loaded it onto trucks and ships, and transported it eastward. The records in the Soviet newspapers vividly depict this scene. How were the factories that were evacuated in the nick of time, even as they came into contact with the enemy's front-line troops, to be set up in new locations? (Translated by Xiang from the Asahi Shimbun, August 21st)

### Public Association News

○Cake and Steamed Bread Industry The Shanghai Special City Cake and Steamed Bread and Fried Food Industry Association recently found that some members have arbitrarily increased the selling price of sesame cakes and fried dough sticks. The association yesterday sent personnel to various districts to express concern and advise the members. At a time when the unified distribution mechanism is being implemented, and at a time when the unified distribution of flour bran is being implemented, and the Flour and Bran Distribution Office is sending personnel to investigate the flour owed by major merchants in various industries, the industry should be patient and not take any out-of-bounds actions to avoid criticism from all sectors. ○Construction Industry The Shanghai Municipal Construction Industry Association held a re-election meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Association on Xizang Road at 3 pm the day before yesterday. More than 200 representatives of various agencies and members attended.

### Weekly Market Conditions

The market conditions of Shanghai's financial and industrial and commercial sectors generally revolved around stability last week. However, people's minds are still focused on changes in the international situation. Therefore, the supply of gold exceeded demand, and the market price fell significantly. The price of silver was flat. Stock prices were lower than the previous week due to tight funds and the imminent Mid-Autumn Festival, with more sellers than buyers and a lack of demand. Market conditions in various industries were stable but rising. This was mostly due to the impact of electricity restrictions, which reduced factory productivity, leading to a continuous demand for daily necessities, making it difficult to suppress market prices. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will pay close attention to this matter.

### French Tram Company Still Raises Prices Despite Authorities' Orders

The French Tram Company in the Eighth District of this city disregarded the law and arbitrarily raised prices by 150% of the original price on the 15th, which stimulated the soaring of general prices, causing public outcry. The Municipal Public Works Bureau, in view of the importance of public utilities, issued an order to stop the price increase. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency personally went to the field to investigate this matter and found that the fares of all lines of vehicles belonging to the company were still being sold at increased prices, ignoring the official orders and the people's livelihood. This is truly reckless. It is hoped that the authorities will take further decisive measures to maintain the government's credibility and alleviate the people's suffering.

### A Letter

— Li Shiyu

Comrade XX County: I am delighted to learn of your appointment as County Magistrate and offer my deepest congratulations. If we were to meet, as usual, I should say, "Congratulations, congratulations!" You have been promoted, especially to be the "Hundred League Marquis" County Magistrate. I don't know why I should congratulate you; it seems I should express my joy without being mundane! In fact, congratulations and joy are in order. No one wants to be an official in Beijing. A local official, a "parent of the people," a County Magistrate, in the old days of the Qing Dynasty, could not be appointed unless he was a successful candidate in the imperial examinations. Since the Republic of China, which person with connections does not want to get a County Magistrate position? In recent years, the situation in the counties has been very complicated. Good people cannot do it, and bad people cannot do it well, creating a chaotic situation that confuses people's minds. Now, the central government is raising the authority, status, and treatment of County Magistrates, setting qualifications for County Magistrates, assessing the performance of County Magistrates, and increasing county funding, all of which show the importance attached to county administration. The value of County Magistrates seems to be rising again. You, old friend, have been frustrated for a long time and often complained. Now you can be considered to have emerged from the crowd. I am sure that you will have a new achievement when you can put your talent to use. I will wait and see! To put it bluntly, I have high hopes for you. You are now a "new noble," and your social engagements must be very busy! In the past, each bureau and section, and even each division, of the Provincial or Municipal Government wanted to "take advantage" of the new County Magistrate. When a new County Magistrate is announced, everyone will scramble to find out his background. If your connections are not strong, you will still be treated the same way. If you don't "buy it" — invite them to dinner or send gifts — then you will be in trouble. Perhaps you will run into walls everywhere. Your official business will either be delayed for a while or deliberately find fault and be "rejected." They always think that the County Magistrate has ways, and in fact, they really do have ways. Everyone taking a little oil is not a big deal, but unknowingly this creates a cause-and-effect relationship for the County Magistrate to find ways. In order to socialize, or rather, to cope, you have to find ways. Otherwise, the budget will not be approved, and the report will be rejected, and you will not be able to bear the suffering! It is strange that a County Magistrate with flexible hands and eyes has no way of getting things done. "Spending money to get things done" really forces people to do bad things. I am not teaching you to do the same. Although this is a common thing in the past or present, it is best if we can not go along with the crowd and create a unique example. I know that you did not use capital to get your position as County Magistrate. I hope you don't have to pay those taxes to the checkpoints, don't invite them to dinner, and don't send gifts, so as not to squeeze the people again. As for those bureaus and sections, you can be polite to them. If you are clean as water and work hard, they may be embarrassed to extort you. If you scrape and exploit a lot, then don't blame them for wanting to take advantage. Who doesn't want to take advantage of oil, to be specific, the County Magistrate thinks it is painful to deal with the environment, and people also think it is painful, but if you are a clean official, you are not afraid of being difficult for others. If you are a corrupt official, don't blame others for making things difficult for you. I hope that Lao Shi will be honest and just, and work hard on construction. Obstacles are imaginable. To break obstacles, don't compromise. You will definitely break through all difficulties and achieve light. I am not unaware of the environment, but I am saying some irresponsible things. In fact, the more you compromise with the environment, the more difficult it will be to get through. There are two paths in front of you: one is to go along with the crowd, and the other is to be tough and do things toughly. Which way to go is up to you! The environment in the counties is also very bad now, but it also depends on human effort. I often hear County Magistrates say that it is difficult to deal with certain teams and agencies, and there are many restrictions. In fact, it is not entirely true. As far as I know, most of them are self-inflicted. Since ancient times, "people who respect themselves will be respected by others" and "people will regret themselves before others regret them." If the County Magistrate maintains his dignity and does not do things that are despised by others, they will naturally respect you. I have seen County Magistrates who are very pretentious and arrogant, traveling in cars, going in and out with bodyguards, calling it socializing, and always deducting military rice, always adding surcharges to the land tax, not repairing roads, suspending schools, and always extorting a lot from the people when they encounter lawsuits. There are even more ugly things that we cannot imagine. These things cannot be hidden from the eyes and ears of the world. What teams and agencies are not blind or deaf? They can see and hear, so how can they look up to you! Alas, they have lost the face of the Chinese people, and they are still cursing others for being wrong. God knows, if you do bad things and still want to avoid being criticized, and still want people to allow you to proceed smoothly, how can there be such a good deal! Old friend, when you take office, you must maintain your dignity, and people will look up to you. If you want them not to interfere with you, you can only do everything well, so that they have no way to criticize you. You can also make an agreement in advance: we all have common goals, we all have common rules, and we all have a common understanding of the truth. We jointly abide by the rules, obey the truth, and move towards the common goals. For example, ensuring public security, increasing production, and rectifying thoughts. We are on the road to construction, not being selfish and wholeheartedly working hard, working as a County Magistrate for the advancement of county administration, not working as a County Magistrate to get rich. If we can work diligently and selflessly, even if we encounter difficulties, we will try to overcome them. If it is really impossible, we would rather leave than continue to live shamelessly. There will definitely be a day when it will work. I offer you the principle of dealing with them. You must be tough, tough enough not to conflict, and you must be gentle, gentle enough not to lose your position. Scholars can be killed but not humiliated. Don't lose the demeanor of a great citizen. I guarantee that you will get through it, or even get their respect and cooperation! There are also those local bullies and gentry, who are also obstacles to the implementation of county administration. Throughout the history of various counties, there have been many factions among the gentry and merchants. When a new County Magistrate comes, he is either surrounded by one faction or surrounded by another faction. They threaten and entice you, putting you in a trap, selling out the interests of the people, and destroying your reputation. They profit from it. This is all because the County Magistrate took advantage and was fooled. They are extremely bad. They let you eat your fill, and then they pull you down. That is, they wait until you have evidence of corruption, and then they threaten you, use your weaknesses, and do whatever they want. At that time, you will become their prisoner, listening to their manipulation. Friends, do you still remember the slogan "Down with the local bullies and gentry" during the Northern Expedition? The words are still in our ears. Now, "where there is land, there must be bullies, and where there is gentry, there must be badness." There is a proliferation of local bullies and gentry in the counties. How should the revolutionary comrades who have become County Magistrates deal with this? Collude with them or overthrow them? Please weigh the matter carefully! Speaking of construction, there are really myriad aspects, which cannot be described in detail in a short letter. I think there is a prerequisite issue that should be noted, that is, there should be a plan for the work, and there should be organization and training for the people. This is also a small experience I have gained in my work over the years, and I offer it for your reference. A newly appointed County Magistrate should know the area of this county, how much land there is, how many people there are, what the level of education is, how many people have received certain education, how many have not received education, what the folk customs are, what materials are produced, how much is the financial income, and how much is the financial expenditure. How many schools are there, how many kilometers of roads are there, and even the rivers and mountains should be understood clearly. Then you can plan production and consumption, and engage in various constructions. As for people, whether they are public officials or people, they will not have strength without organization and training. There must be strict organization and strict training in order to exert great power. Before the incident, Jiangxi Province combined education, cultivation, and defense into one, and the officials and people were united as one. The foundation of county administration was quite solid. After the incident, there were many bandits in various counties, and it seemed difficult to promote county administration. In fact, it is also a matter of method. May I ask, aren't bandits also good people in the past? Even now, they are not necessarily not good people. I often hear people say "winning the hearts of the people." The hearts of the people are inclined to good governance. If we truly love the people and share their joys and sorrows, do not squeeze them, do not oppress them, and lead them to produce for consumption, sweat for construction, for themselves, for our locality, and for our country, in short, as long as you do not only care about the interests of the County Magistrate and forget the interests of the people, then all the people will not be able to leave you, rely on you, and trust you, and all construction can be completed smoothly. Construction is to determine the methods, steps, and time within the reach of human and material resources, and to plan in an orderly manner. Use organized and trained public officials to be responsible for promoting the people of the entire county. County Magistrates, do not sit in the office only taking care of official business, or attending meetings, or socializing. You should inspect, supervise, and check for errors and omissions, reward and punish clearly, be close to the virtuous and stay away from the bad, and often go to the countryside to live with the farmers. For example, when repairing roads and building bridges, you must personally supervise. You must personally visit schools, and you must also especially promote rural hygiene. National health is very important. Daily necessities from the city should be transported to the countryside without going through merchants. They should be uniformly transported and sold by the public, and the county's raw materials should be exchanged for the city's goods. This can not only facilitate the farmers, but also benefit the city. If the profits are used as various administrative construction expenses, they will definitely be very sufficient. In short, the land of a county, the people of a county, the officials, police, and soldiers of a county, all human and material resources are living and developing in a planned, organized, and trained manner, and of course there will be progress and light. We study local administration and issue publications, aiming to lead practice with theory and use practice to verify and clarify theory. We bring together the County Magistrate comrades who are responsible for actual administration and organize the County Administration Research Committee of our society. I hope you will participate, so I have written a messy set of words, not afraid of being crude, but still feel that there are many things to say. We will talk about it later. Stop writing.
