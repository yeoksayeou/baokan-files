### Decisive Political Battle

[To obtain certain victory, the first thing is to believe in certain victory. Without the belief in certain victory, obtaining certain victory is probably impossible in the world.] This is what the elder Mr. Tokutomi Sohō, a senior figure in the Japanese press, said in his book [Essential Reader for a Victorious Nation]. At this stage of the decisive battle concerning the survival of the Greater East Asian race, every participating nation should jointly believe in certain victory and firmly establish the belief in certain victory, in order to achieve certain victory and complete the task of the national liberation war. We are a member of the participating nations in the Greater East Asia War, so we naturally cannot be an exception.

However, firmly believing in certain victory is only half the guarantee of achieving it. At the same time, we need the practice of certain victory work even more. With belief but without the corresponding practical work, this belief will not be realized. Only with work and without a firm belief, when encountering environmental changes, the work is very easy to slack off, and it is equally difficult to complete the goal. Therefore, on the one hand, we must firmly believe in certain victory, and on the other hand, we must practice certain victory work, fully cooperating with the belief.

How do we practice certain victory work? In the current situation and environment, the most urgent thing is [Decisive Political Battle]—the refining of politics to meet the needs of a decisive battle. We proposed [On Certain Victory Politics] in our editorial on August 29, saying: [Good politics is a guarantee of obtaining certain victory]. Now we say [Decisive Political Battle] is not only the passive clarity of politics but also the active adaptation to the needs of a decisive battle.

To promote decisive political battle, the first thing is to firmly believe in certain victory because [certain victory] is our central belief today, and there is absolutely no room for hesitation or wavering. Secondly, we must have the spirit to dare to innovate. The decisive battle stage is so tense that we must not be satisfied with maintaining the status quo because maintaining the status quo today means retrogression tomorrow. For example, if we find bad phenomena in local politics, we must quickly and thoroughly reform them. If we are not quick, problems will accumulate over time and be difficult to reverse. If we are not thorough, then trivial efforts will be of no help. Also, if we find that a certain plan or facility work does not match the expected results or is even the opposite, and is not suitable for China's national conditions and popular sentiments, even if it is a suggestion from an allied country, we should immediately raise it and earnestly discuss reform, so that its consequences will not be detrimental to China's national economy and people's livelihood, and even more detrimental to the cooperation in the war. In short, at the current decisive stage, the only requirement for any facility is that it is beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, and even more beneficial to the Greater East Asia War.

In addition, the point of using people based on their talents is truly the only way to political progress, especially in decisive political battles. Zhuge Liang said in his Memorial on Dispatching the Army: [Drawing near virtuous ministers and keeping petty men at a distance was the reason why the Former Han prospered; drawing near petty men and keeping virtuous ministers at a distance was the reason why the Later Han declined.] Whether in ancient or modern times, in China or abroad, when talented people are used well, the politics are good; when inferior people are used, the politics are corrupt, without exception. This time, the National Government has made partial adjustments to central and local officials. We believe that this is only a job change and has nothing to do with using people based on their talents. We cannot help but wonder whether those who have not achieved results in politics in location A will have results after being transferred to location B? Those who have not achieved results in their official positions in location A will have results after being transferred to official positions in location B? For more than ten years, the changes in personnel in politics have always fallen into the rut of a revolving lantern. The people who are transferred back and forth are too familiar in the eyes of the people. We can't help but wonder: First, do these people have a belief in certain victory? Second, do they have the perseverance to take on decisive political battle? Third, do they have the spirit of hard work and practical work?

Finally, for the establishment of decisive political battle, we hope that the authorities will pay special attention to using people based on their talents, not only focusing on the transfer of central figures but also attracting truly talented people from the opposition, and ensuring that the right people are in the right jobs, so as to refresh the public's eyes and ears and achieve decisive political battle.

### Japanese Air Force Skillfully Night Raids Enemy Fleet in Palau Area, Sinking and Destroying Fifty Boats and Fifteen Tanks

Central News Agency from a Japanese base in the central Pacific, 21st dispatch. A part of the Japanese air force skillfully approached the enemy fleet gathered in the Palau area and bombed and destroyed a destroyer on the evening of the 18th. By the morning of the 18th, a total of 30 enemy boats had been sunk, and 20 enemy boats and 15 tanks had been destroyed.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st dispatch. According to a dispatch from a base in the central Pacific, the Japanese air force rushed to attack the enemy landing forces on Peleliu Island on the evening of the 18th, causing their positions to catch fire, and destroyed a large enemy transport ship near the Cosol Strait.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th dispatch. According to a dispatch from a base in the central Pacific, about 80 enemy planes attacked Palau Island on the 19th. From the 6th to the 14th, a total of about 1,680 enemy planes attacked the Palau area, about 1,320 attacked the Peleliu area, and about 500 attacked Yap, totaling about 3,500. The Japanese army shot down 107 planes, and 48 planes were severely damaged.

### Peleliu Japanese Troops Fight Hard and Repulse the Enemy

Central News Agency from a base in the central Pacific, 21st dispatch. Enemy troops have landed on Peleliu Island, but the powerful force of about one division that they have deployed has been severely damaged by the fierce attack of the Japanese garrison. Therefore, after sweeping Peleliu Island, the enemy troops abandoned their attempt to invade Palau, but the enemy is still actively reinforcing. The Japanese side is continuing to engage in melee attacks against this superior enemy. On the afternoon of the 18th, the enemy, under the cover of naval gun fire, attempted to break through the southern part of the central highlands with dozens of tanks, but after being attacked by Japanese artillery, most of their tanks were destroyed. However, on the morning of the 19th, the enemy again attacked that area repeatedly with a large force, so the Japanese army engaged in fierce fighting with them. After three hours, the enemy was again severely damaged and collapsed. The enemy who attacked this time is now in a state of chaos, and their tanks have also suffered considerable damage. However, it is undeniable that the enemy's firepower is quantitatively overwhelming the Japanese army.

Central News Agency from a base in the central Pacific, 21st dispatch. The Japanese army on Peleliu Island is still guarding the area north of the island's airfield (i.e., the central highlands area), and is also responding to the fierce attacks of the artillery units, continuously night-raiding the enemy forces, inflicting heavy damage on their main force. Although the enemy army has repeatedly strengthened artillery fire and reinforced tanks in an attempt to penetrate the Japanese army's central highlands positions, they have not succeeded.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st dispatch. According to a dispatch from a Japanese base in the central Pacific, the Japanese army on Peleliu Island has been making a brave defense since the enemy landed, and has been adding melee attacks to the enemy forces at any time. From the time of the engagement on the 16th to the morning of the 19th, there have been as many as seven large-scale attacks, and the enemy forces have suffered a loss of 3,200 people. From the time the enemy forces attempted to land on Peleliu Island to the morning of the 19th, the losses suffered have actually reached more than 8,700. Therefore, the battle situation on the island is more tragic than that on Ōmiya Island and Saipan Island.

### Japanese Troops Fight Valiantly on Angaur Island

Central News Agency from a base in the central Pacific, 21st dispatch. The enemy forces that landed on Angaur Island set up a bridgehead on the northeast end of the island on the 17th, and heavily shelled the Japanese army's positions on the 17th and 18th. However, the Japanese army still fought bravely. As of 7:00 p.m. on the 17th, the Japanese garrison had achieved the following results: ○ Sunk about 30 enemy boats and destroyed more than 20 boats. ○ Destroyed 15 tanks.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st dispatch. According to a dispatch from the central Pacific, the enemy forces landing on Angaur Island have suffered heavy losses due to repeated fierce attacks by the Japanese army. Therefore, they have gradually increased their forces. On the 19th, the enemy forces arrived at a location one kilometer away from a city in the central and western part of the island. The Japanese garrison immediately ambushed them near the lighthouse highlands, inflicting heavy damage on them and repelling them.

### Two American Planes Shot Down Near Zhaoqing

Central News Agency from a Chinese front line base, 21st dispatch. Five US-Chongqing P-51 aircraft attacked the suburbs of the Japanese army's first-line troops west of Zhaoqing at around 10:00 a.m. on the 19th, and were shot down and destroyed by Japanese fighter planes.

### Japanese General Ugaki Visits Commander Okabe

Central News Agency, Beijing, 21st dispatch. Japanese General Ugaki visited Mr. Okabe, the supreme commander of the Japanese North China Area Army, on the 20th for cordial talks and attended a reception banquet.

### German and Soviet Troops Both Enter Finland

Central News Agency, Berlin, 21st dispatch. German News Agency reports: The commander-in-chief of the German mountain troops announced this morning that the German troops in the far north theater have entered Finnish territory. Finland, which has been protected by the German army for three years, has become a decisive battleground. Since the Soviet army has crossed the Finnish border, this move by the German army is a strategic necessity. The Finnish side hoped that the great enemy of Europe would stop advancing at the Finnish border, but this hope has become a bubble, and the result is that the villages in Finland have become war zones. The German army cannot be held responsible for this unfortunate event because the Soviet-Finnish armistice negotiations have endangered Germany's security, and the German army should implement countermeasures.

### Hitler Goes to the Western Front to Personally Direct Operations

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 21st dispatch. The focus of the Western Front has shifted to the northern region, and the anti-Axis forces have concentrated air force units to launch an intense offensive and defensive war. The German army is resisting bravely, and the anti-Axis forces are having difficulty making progress. According to an Associated Press frontline dispatch, Chief Hitler has personally gone to the front line to direct the German army, which is firmly defending the area from the Dutch border to the Saar Valley. It seems that V-1 missiles will be used. On the 19th, the US army positions on the banks of the Maas River suffered great damage. According to Berlin intelligence, the German army launched a large-scale counterattack in the area south of Aachen. The US army advancing from Vogesel and from the Ping area toward Strasbourg was stopped. According to a United Press frontline dispatch, the US army in the Nancy-Metz area and the Belfort-Gep area is facing fierce resistance from the German army.

### Director Kurihara Discusses Favorable Progress of the War Situation

The Importance of Air Combat is Also Increasing

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st dispatch. Navy Press Director Colonel Kurihara gave a lecture on the 20th evening at the Central Air Warfare Lecture Hall in Hibiya Public Hall here, titled [The Greater East Asia War and Airplanes], discussing the favorable progress of the war situation and the enrichment of aviation personnel. The main points are as follows: The main weapon in the Greater East Asia War is undoubtedly the airplane, because in this war, only the airplane has exerted the greatest effectiveness, and this is also a characteristic of this war. The activity of airplanes has the same effectiveness on land and sea, especially in naval battles. If air supremacy cannot be ensured, then sea supremacy will inevitably be lost, and the battle will fall into an unfavorable position. Today, the enemy's attacks are becoming more and more imminent on the Japanese mainland. As the battlefield gradually approaches the mainland, the importance of air combat is also increasing. At present, most of the Japanese airfields have been completely prepared, and the supply of military supplies and fuel necessary for air combat is becoming more favorable due to the shortening of the supply line. Due to the shortening of the battle line, the cooperation of the army and navy air forces is becoming increasingly close, and the number of pilots and crew members is also increasing. They are now being deployed in various air bases and mobile naval units, waiting for the maturation of the battle opportunity.

### Japanese Army in South China Enters Yunfu City

Vanguard Nine Miles from Guilin

Central News Agency from the South China Front, 21st dispatch. The powerful Japanese troops advancing westward along the south bank of the West River crossed the Xinxing River, a tributary of the West River, near Tongzhou at noon on the 17th and advanced about four kilometers. At dawn on the 19th, they surrounded Yunfu County, the stronghold of the Chongqing 158th Division. The right-wing troops of the Japanese army successively occupied Tongyouyuan, Chucheng, Dayuanchuan, Luosha and other places, and the left-wing troops also successively occupied Jumenzhen, Huanggang, Dashanjiao and other key points. Pressing on Yunfu from both sides, a vanguard unit had broken into Yunfu County at noon on the 19th, and then the various troops also rushed into the city and continued to pursue the Chongqing army that was fleeing westward. One part of them had reached an area ten kilometers southwest of Yunfu. According to reports, Yunfu County is garrisoned by the Chongqing 158th Division, with division commander Liu Dongcai and other officers, to guard the Zhaoqing area. However, under the fierce offensive of the Japanese army, about 1,200 Chongqing troops have begun to retreat since the 17th. According to aircraft reconnaissance, the Chongqing army is currently retreating in several places between Yunfu and Luoding.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 21st dispatch. The Japanese army advancing on Guilin in South China has approached the city, and the vanguard of the left-wing troops has also reached within nine miles of Guilin.

### Japanese Army's Attack on Hengyang and Guilin Creates Brilliant Achievements

Spokesman Sanda's Speech

Central News Agency dispatch. Lieutenant Colonel Sanda, press director of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, who has been responsible for guiding news reporting and propaganda at a certain base on the front line since the Japanese army launched the Hunan operation, arrived in Shanghai on the 20th. Yesterday, he specially met with a group of reporters to explain in detail the achievements of this operation and the current war situation in the Guilin area. The main points of Mr. Sanda's speech are as follows: ○ Until the fall of Hengyang, due to the enemy's thorough destruction of transportation routes and the activity of the US-Chongqing air force, the Japanese army found it quite difficult to supply. At the same time, the officers and soldiers had no choice but to display the

### self-denying

spirit of Kumen. Almost all of the enemy troops in Hengyang were from Hunan, so they resisted fiercely based on the concept of loving their homeland, which made the Japanese army's combat conditions unfavorable everywhere. Fortunately, although it was the hot season, there were no cases of illness in the army, and the officers and soldiers were able to do their best to create brilliant achievements. ○ The current offensive operation in the Guilin area is slightly smoother than the previous operation in Hengyang. The Japanese army is now continuing to

### rapidly advance.

According to intelligence, Guilin is already extremely shaken, and the US-Chongqing air force has begun to destroy various facilities and retreat. From this, it can be understood that the enemy, especially the US-Chongqing air force, is becoming more and more active as the Japanese army penetrates deeper into southwestern China. At the same time, it is expected that monsters such as the American-style Chongqing army or the American ground army will appear in the future. The guiding spirit of the Japanese army in combat has always been to practice the original declaration. Although it is the Chongqing army, those who

### do not resist

are not regarded as enemies, because the Japanese army's combat goal is to drive out the British and American enemies who are invading East Asia. The enemy's combat power in the Wenzhou operation is extremely weak, so the progress is very fast. ○ As mentioned above, it is assumed that the US military, in addition to the air force, will also have ground troops appearing on the mainland, this assumption, although it is merely a prediction, however we cannot afford to let our guard down. Regarding this kind of US ground troop support to Chongqing, the Chongqing Propaganda Minister Liang Han Cao

### expressed a welcome

said that it was no less than a savior for China. However, we believe that the Chongqing side needs to deeply reflect on this issue. If the United States sends a large number of ground troops to the mainland and can win, causing Japan to retreat, will the United States really treat Chongqing as a friend at that time, allowing China to achieve glorious independence? The cunning British and Americans have been exploiting China for hundreds of years. One cannot believe that the Chongqing people have forgotten their hatred or are expressing gratitude. The British and Americans of a century ago attempted to turn China into a colony. To this day, their methods

### remain unchanged,

gradually seizing control of some of the Chongqing authorities' leaders, and then plotting to dominate all of China. And today, their air force is even more unscrupulous, seizing the command of operations as its own. In fact, the enemy America has already regarded China as a colony. It is Britain and America who are destroying China's unification. It is Britain and America who are the common enemy of China and Japan. Looking at the European and Pacific war situations, the momentum of the American counteroffensive is becoming more and more intense. We should not allow the enemy to have room to encroach on the mainland, and further ensure a complete and solid posture, so that China can firmly defend itself as the China of East Asia.

### Japanese Army Ministry Presents the Loyalty and Heroism of the Guards in La Meng and Tengchong

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st dispatch. The Japanese garrisons in La Meng and Tengchong have been fighting fiercely in the Myanmar area for a long time. During that time, they inflicted heavy damage on the Chongqing army in the Yunnan area, and their contribution to the overall operation of the Japanese army was also extremely great. Now, after fulfilling their mission, both garrisons have finally gloriously sacrificed their lives. This news was announced by the Japanese General Headquarters on the 20th. The great achievements of these two garrisons are truly enough to shock heaven and earth and move ghosts and gods. In the past, the supreme commander of the Japanese Southern Army and the supreme commander of the Japanese Army in Myanmar awarded them certificates to commend their merits and encourage them. After this glorious sacrifice, the Japanese Army Ministry also presented their glorious situation to the Japanese Emperor, and the Ministry issued an order as follows: Announcement of the Japanese Army Ministry on September 20, Showa 19 (1944): The great achievements of the Japanese garrisons in La Meng and Tengchong were previously awarded certificates of commendation by the supreme commander of the Southern Army and the supreme commander of the Japanese Army in Myanmar. Now, in view of the glorious sacrifice of these two garrisons, we hereby present their loyalty and heroism to the Emperor.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st dispatch. Since the Japanese army launched an offensive on Imphal, Britain and the United States have been deeply concerned that the defensive posture of the anti-Axis forces in East India will collapse. Therefore, they requested the Chongqing side to dispatch the Yunnan Expeditionary Force to attack from the front of the Nu River to threaten the Japanese rear, and at the same time attempted to open up the Ledo Road. In mid-May, sixteen divisions of the Chongqing army in the Yunnan area crossed the Nu River in force, forming a situation of confrontation with the Japanese army. Since then, the decisive battle on the Nu River front has begun. As a result, in the La Meng and Tengchong areas, the Japanese army finally gloriously sacrificed all of its members, but the initiative for the entire operation on the Nu River front is still in the hands of the Japanese army, and the Chongqing army's attempt to open up the Ledo Road has ultimately failed. The war situation in various places since the Chongqing army launched its counteroffensive until now is as follows:

### The Course of Battle in La Meng and Tengchong

The La Meng garrison resisted the offensive of the Chongqing army with a very small force. From beginning to end, it has lasted for more than 100 days. On September 7, due to being outnumbered, the entire army gloriously sacrificed their lives. The attacking Chongqing army had six divisions under the command of the 11th Group Army, whose number was 60 times that of the Japanese garrison. The Japanese army in Tengchong, under the siege of five divisions of the Chongqing 20th Group Army, fought against them for a total of two months. During that time, they did not allow the 20-fold Chongqing army to invade an inch of land. Therefore, in the second half of the Chongqing army's siege, because it had no effect, they adopted the same tunneling tactics as in a fortress attack, that is, digging tunnels to the city walls. As a result, the city walls and gates were completely destroyed, and they invaded the city. After that, both sides engaged in a glorious bayonet battle and hand grenade battle. In the end, only a dozen Japanese soldiers were left, but they still fought bravely alone until the 14th, when they all died in battle. Jiang Jieshi was deeply moved and instructed the entire army, saying that although the Chongqing army on the Nu River front had excellent equipment and a large force, they still failed to make favorable progress in the attack and achieve the expected results. On the contrary, the Japanese armies in La Meng and Tengchong fought to the last man, still regarding death as homecoming and completing their mission. This is truly a lesson for our soldiers. In the future, the Chongqing army must take the spirit of the Japanese army's glorious struggle as a model.

The Japanese army in the Nengleng area fought for more than two months under the siege of several times the number of Chongqing troops. Then, the main force of the Japanese army gathered around Longling. On September 3, they launched an offensive inside and outside, and on the 10th, they finally lifted the siege. They then turned from the west side to encircle the six or seven divisions of the Chongqing army in the area, giving them a thorough blow and causing them to retreat eastward. The Japanese army is now steadily pressing on them.

### The Japanese Army Takes the Initiative on the Nu River Front

Since mid-May, the Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force has mobilized a large force of sixteen divisions to launch an offensive, but it has been blocked by the fierce fighting of the Japanese army. At present, the overall war situation on the Nu River is gradually becoming unfavorable to the Chongqing side. Britain and the United States originally had high expectations, but they were greatly disappointed. Recently, they even expressed dissatisfaction with Jiang Jieshi. In fact, Jiang Jieshi also despised the British and American supervisors, and even dispatched the secretly hidden 200th Division to the front line to change the war situation, but this was also defeated and fled east of Longling by the elite Japanese army near Longling. Thus, under the initiative of the Japanese army on the Nu River front, a new development is being seen, and the Chongqing side's attempt to break through the Ledo Road has ultimately failed. Since the Chongqing army began its offensive in mid-May until today, the damage inflicted on the Chongqing army by the various Japanese units, as announced by the Japanese General Headquarters, has totaled 73,000 people. By division, one division, the 39th Division, has been annihilated. Five divisions, the 76th, 28th, 87th and Honorary Divisions, and the 2nd Reserve Division have been routed and severely damaged (damage is more than two-thirds). Six divisions, the 198th, 116th, 3rd, 80th, 103rd and 88th Divisions, have been routed (damage is more than one-third). Four divisions, the 130th, 9th, 200th and Newly Formed 33rd Divisions, have suffered considerable damage. Only one of the Chongqing side's sixteen divisions has not suffered any damage.

### Japanese Army in Longling Expands War Results

Central News Agency from a certain Japanese frontline base, 21st dispatch. Since the Japanese army in the Longling area lifted the siege of the Chongqing army, it has been rapidly progressing with a powerful posture and is currently encircling the Chongqing army, expanding its war results step by step. The war situation in that area has improved, which not only strikes the Ledo Road, but also has a great impact on other aspects. Next, with the Japanese army's securing of Longling, the Chongqing army's strategic line connecting Tengchong, Longling, and La Meng is each feeling isolated. In particular, in the Tengchong area, the five divisions of the Chongqing army have lost their rear supply route, and their strategic intention has failed. According to reports, the Chongqing army's current goal of invasion is to open up the Burma Road, so it has a plan to correspond to the progress of the North Burma front and move south into the interior of Myanmar, which should not be ignored. Therefore, the Chongqing army has focused its greatest strength on Longling, the road to recapturing the Ledo Road, gathering a large army composed of nine divisions in that area, and launching repeated counterattacks for more than two months. However, now with the launch of the new offensive by the Japanese army, not to mention the Yunnan-Burma Road, the opening of the Ledo Road is also facing a major crisis. Speaking of the equipment of the Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force, it is mostly American-style and is the elite of the Chongqing army. However, since the start of the war, in more than four months, the bodies discarded alone have reached more than 30,000. Due to the great annihilation battle of the 11th Group Army near Longling, its casualties and losses will certainly increase even more.

### Trip to Nanhui

— Hua

Having returned from Qingpu and rested briefly, I set off again on a trip to Nanhui. Nanhui County is bordered by Chuansha to the north, Fengxian to the south, the East Sea to the east, and the Huangpu River to the west. The people are mostly simple and honest, with Puzhen being the center of transportation and commerce in the county, making it relatively prosperous, hence the nickname "Little Shanghai."

On the Shanghai-Nanhui Road

The route from Shanghai to Nanhui involves crossing the river from the Dongchang Dock at the 16th Bund, then purchasing a ticket at the Dongya Bus Station. The fare is 300 yuan, and the bus departs at 8:15 AM. Traveling south from Dongchang Road to the Zhangjiabang checkpoint, passengers are required to get off the bus for inspection. Further south, we reach Baiyunjing, where there is another checkpoint. Slightly south of that, the bus turns east and runs parallel to the railway (commonly known as the "small train") that travels between Zhoujiadu and Zhoupu Town. After passing the Sanlintang checkpoint, we encountered the train coming from Zhoupu. The speed at which it travels is even slower than Shanghai's trams. It is said that there are concerns about derailments, so travelers are willing to pay four times the price to take the bus, not only for convenience but also for safety. After traveling east for about an hour, we arrived in Zhoupu. Although the streets are not very wide, they are quite neat and the townscape is lively. I checked into the Zhoupu Hotel and, after resting briefly, went for a stroll in the nearby suburbs.

Rice Harvest

Traveling west from Zhoupu to Chuanjiazhai, a village where many people share the surname Chuan, I inquired about this year's harvest. It was said that: [The local rice crop is divided into two types: "early" and "late." The early rice that is harvested first is called "first rice," and the later harvested is called "second rice." The late rice is called "third rice." The yield of the first rice is over 90%, but the quantity is extremely small because it is not very resistant to waterlogging, so very few farmers plant it here, accounting for only about 15% of the total. The second rice is about the same, but the yield is around 50% to 70%. The harvesting period for the first rice is around the Major Heat solar term, the second rice is after the Autumn Equinox, and the third rice is around September. The poorer yield of the first rice is due to the severe drought in summer and the heavy wind and rain before harvest. If the wind and rain and the drought could be switched around in time, the first rice would surely have a bumper harvest. Fortunately, there is more late rice (i.e., third rice) here, and given the recent weather, a bumper harvest is expected this year.]

However, the tax burden is truly heavy on our people. In addition to the regular tax, the various kinds of arbitrary fees that cannot even be named, when totaled annually, are several times the amount of the regular tax. Moreover, they are mostly of an irregular nature. Once collected, they must be paid immediately. If there is even a slight delay, collectors will arrive one after another!

A Glimpse of Zhoupu

The night market in Zhoupu used to be quite prosperous. When the lights were lit, everything in the night market, such as restaurants, hotels, and theaters, was extraordinarily lively, continuing until 3 or 4 AM, especially when gambling dens were not yet prohibited. However, since the establishment of the Administrative Inspector's Office and the strict enforcement of prohibitions, the night market has plummeted. At night, due to air defense measures, there are no lights on the streets, but the sound of mahjong tiles being shuffled can be heard from afar. Hotels even explicitly charge five yuan per set for renting mahjong tiles, indicating that gambling is still rampant.

Next to Zhoupu Park is the County Second Middle School and its attached elementary school, with a total of about 400 students. The middle school has only over 120 students. There are also two private middle schools, Shidai and Yaguang. Teachers' salaries seem to be better in private schools than in the county school because private schools often have a board of directors to support them, while the County Second Middle School receives only 7,000 yuan in monthly subsidies from the county government. With eight teachers, that averages less than 1,000 yuan per person. Tuition is mostly calculated in terms of rice. At the county school, each person pays about 1.5 dou of rice, while private schools charge slightly more. However, some are allowed to pay in cash at a discounted rate. One can imagine how meager their lives must be!

Nanhui County as a whole has one large security team, divided into nine squadrons. The county magistrate concurrently serves as the team leader. They are stationed in the urban area and important towns such as Datuan, Xinchang, and Zhoupu. Allied forces have also sent a garrison to jointly maintain public order. The security team soldiers receive only a little over 300 yuan a month in salary, which, along with the rewards from the sale of confiscated controlled goods from the checkpoints, amounts to at most about 700 yuan. How can they make a living with the current cost of living?

Public order is an important issue, but the security team responsible for maintaining it receives such meager compensation. This naturally creates a problem for public order. At the same time, the lives of the security team members cannot be allowed to stagnate because of this. Therefore, adjusting salaries and maintaining public order must be solved together.

### Confiscated Hidden Rice to Be Appropriately Punished, with Confiscated Portions Under the Control of the Rice Allocation Committee

The Municipal Commodity Allocation Office previously handled the registration of rice inventory. However, it was found that a considerable number of people failed to report or reported past the deadline. After a thorough investigation by the Economic Security Office, those who concealed their rice were deemed to have hidden it privately and were subject to punishment and seizure. In consideration of the hardships of the people, penalties were meted out according to the severity of the case, with some amounts being confiscated. It is understood that most of the cases have now been completed, and notices of punishment have been issued, indicating the quantity to be confiscated. If there are any doubts, a report can be submitted to the office within three days, otherwise the order will be enforced. The cases will be handed over to the Rice Allocation Committee for transport and distribution. However, the amount that is sealed and returned must not be used without authorization and must be unsealed by personnel from the office.

### Doubled Sugar Ration for Each Household, General Sale from Tomorrow, Buy Eight Ounces of Sugar with Ration Coupon

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, considering the approach of the Mid-Autumn Festival, has had the fifteenth-period per capita sugar ration approved by the authorities to be increased to meet the needs, scheduled to begin general sales on September 23rd. The association has notified all retailers and households, with the following points: ○ All sugar retailers in each district (former First District, Nanshi, Zhabei, Zhabei Sixth District, Xuhua Lane, Longcao Town, City Center, Pudong South, Pudong North, etc.) will begin general sales on September 23rd. The validity period of the sugar purchase certificate is until October 2nd; it will be invalid after the deadline. ○ For the purchase certificates for Chinese residents in the former First District, the authorities have stipulated that the No. 18 comprehensive allocation coupon be used (same for boat dwellers, hut dwellers, and Indian residents). Each designated retailer should mark the number of the sugar coupon on its door. Each household can purchase sugar against the coupon number. For the convenience of households, the office has specially printed lists of addresses and coupon numbers of the retailers and distributed them to the stores. If a household is unsure of the address of the retailer for their coupon, they can inquire at any designated sugar retail store nearby, and the store must not refuse. ○ For households purchasing sugar in the districts formerly under the Food Bureau, use the No. 16 sugar purchase certificate issued by the former Food Bureau. ○ Each sugar purchase certificate entitles Chinese residents to purchase eight liang (ounces) of granulated or white sugar (same for boat dwellers, hut dwellers, and Indian residents) for 64 yuan in national currency, including the cost of the sugar purchase certificate. Retail surcharges are waived. Households must bring their own containers to purchase sugar; additional fees will be charged for packaging.

### Police Bureau Cracks Down on Police Officers Clinging to Streetcars

Since the number of streetcars running on each route in the city has decreased, passengers are crowded and often cannot board after waiting for a long time. However, some police personnel take advantage of their official positions to arbitrarily cling to the streetcars while they travel, which is quite inappropriate. The Municipal Police Headquarters has long issued orders to strictly crack down on this behavior. However, it has been found that over time, the regulations are being ignored and mutually disregarded. Mr. Guo Shaoyi of the headquarters' inspection body specifically ordered the chief inspectors of each district yesterday to instruct all inspectors to strictly crack down on and prohibit the aforementioned behavior in their respective jurisdictions.

If Indian residents in the city wish to deposit money in the bank, they can entrust the branch to forward the deposits on their behalf.

### Daily Necessities Control Association Implements Production Management to Control Raw Materials and Suppress Market Prices

Currently, due to the lack of sources of raw materials for soap, candles, and matches, the production of manufactured goods is decreasing daily. Past control measures have mostly been aimed at manufactured goods, while raw materials have often not been effectively controlled, causing prices to rise daily and making it impossible to suppress them. In view of this situation, the Daily Necessities Control Association will manage the raw materials for soap, candles, and matches to increase production and suppress prices. It is understood that the plan will concentrate manpower and financial resources to handle the purchase, transportation, distribution, and manufacturing of raw materials for soap, candles, and matches in a coordinated manner, according to government regulations, to ensure increased production, uniform quality of manufactured goods, and reduced production costs, thereby lowering costs and suppressing market prices. It is further heard that some of the raw materials for soap, candles, and matches were imported. Now that the sources are scarce, the association is using scientific methods to research a substitute to provide supplies.

### Special Rice Allocation Will Not Be Issued to Unregistered Schools

Special allocation rice for teachers and staff is being actively handled by the Municipal Education Bureau in conjunction with the Commodity Allocation Office.

The Education Bureau now stipulates that all unregistered schools must complete registration procedures within one month, otherwise they will not be able to obtain allocation rice.

### Press Conference to Be Held Tomorrow

### Western Shanghai Houses to Be Registered by Deadline

With the approval of the Municipal Government, the Owners Not-in-Residence Land and Housing Management Committee of the city previously began conducting a housing survey and registration in the western Shanghai area, starting in September and ending at the end of November. The scope of the survey is temporarily limited to the jurisdictions of the Changning Road, Huashan Road, and Xujiahui police substations. The survey work has been ordered by the Municipal Government to be assisted by the relevant bureaus. All homeowners in the area must bring their property ownership documents to the West Shanghai Office of the Committee at 1258 Yuyuan Road to apply for registration within the deadline. Failure to do so will be deemed as non-residence, and takeover will be enforced in accordance with the law. Furthermore, those currently occupying ownerless houses in the area must apply to the office for rental procedures before the end of October. Otherwise, once discovered or reported, in addition to being ordered to move out, they will be fined ten months' rent at the current rental price, with 50% of the fine being awarded to the informant as a reward.

### Exemption of Embroidery Products from Luxury Goods Tax Not Approved by Ministry of Finance

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously resolved at a members' meeting to request that embroidery products be taxed at 4% and exempted from being listed as luxury goods in order to maintain the livelihood of embroidery workers. The Ministry of Finance has now issued a response stating that since embroidery products are not daily necessities for the people, the consumption tax rate that should be levied has already been approved and promulgated by the Ministry. The request should not be considered.

### Second Phase of Epidemic Prevention Injections Ends This Month, Epidemic Prevention Committee Holds Six Meetings

The sixth meeting of the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee was held on the 20th of this month. Those attending included Vice Chairman Yuan Junchang, Standing Committee members Chen Yidao, Chen Yeqin, Rao Youji, Counselor Nagai, Major General Shibata Toshio, Technician Matsuba, Director Tashiro, Major Motoyama Shigeo, Lieutenant Colonel Onodera Yoshio, and others. Chairman Yuan Junchang first reported the number of people receiving the second phase of cholera prevention injections. From August 1st to September 19th, a total of 1,685,763 people were injected. He also stated that since the committee implemented cholera prevention injections on May 1st, the first phase ended at the end of July, and the second phase began on August 1st. So far, there have been no confirmed cases of cholera. Based on past experience, the weather will become cooler, and there is unlikely to be any further outbreak. However, in order to be cautious and to ensure the peace of mind of the citizens of the city, the committee plans to end the third phase of mandatory injections by the end of this month. It has ordered epidemic prevention personnel to strengthen their work to ensure that citizens receive a second injection before the end. Standing Committee member Matsuba then reported that he had received a telegram from Ambassador Sawazawa in North China stating that people from Central and South China who wish to travel to North China must carry a cholera prevention certificate valid for three months. Checks will be carried out at Pukou and Xuzhou. Those who do not carry a certificate will not be allowed to pass. He urged the citizens of the city who wish to travel to North China to pay close attention, otherwise they may encounter difficulties along the way. The chairman then reported that a type of Shanghai disease (Dengue Fever) has recently been prevalent in the city. The occurrence of this disease is mostly due to mosquito bites. Although the disease is not very serious, it is easily transmitted and can cause other complications. The Health Bureau is currently making every effort to step up mosquito eradication work and hopes that the public will actively kill mosquitoes and avoid frequenting public places to prevent transmission.

### Air Defense Authorities Organize Air Defense Training Class

In order to actively cultivate air defense cadres, the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters and the Police Bureau's Baojia and Police Defense Sections are jointly organizing an air defense training class. The three authorities plan to nominate internal leaders, hire teachers, and stipulate training subjects. Once the training venue is selected, outstanding members of the self-defense corps and police officers selected by the Police Bureau will be mixed and organized. After completing the training, they will be trained into strong cadres.

### Hongen and Public Relief Hospitals Admit Chinese for Treatment

The Hongen Hospital on Chang'an Road (formerly Avenue Haig) in the city, during the era of the former Municipal Council, admitted Chinese patients to the first and second class wards, but its third class ordinary wards did not admit Chinese patients. After the recovery of the concessions last year, the hospital's board of directors was reorganized. The Municipal Health Authorities recently stated that the fees for the third class ordinary wards of the hospital are not too expensive. At a time when medicine is in short supply, it is necessary to open the wards to admit Chinese patients. Therefore, from today onwards, the third class wards will be opened as much as possible to accommodate Chinese patients. Furthermore, the Public Relief Hospital on North Suzhou Road is of similar nature and scale to Hongen Hospital and has free venereal disease and lung disease departments. In the past, it was only limited to foreign patients, but since the reorganization, it has widely accepted Chinese patients, and free treatment is provided equally to Chinese and foreign patients. It is hoped that patients among the citizens can contact these two hospitals, and they will be accommodated and treated as much as possible.

### Integrity and Honesty, Remuneration Used to Support Education

At a time when the world is deteriorating, people's hearts are not as they used to be, and there are many dark secrets in all levels of society, it is admirable to find that the head of a certain institution has high ideals and does not take ill-gotten gains. Reading the letter from Mr. Wu Zhongyin, we can get a glimpse of the situation. The letter says: [Sir, I am enclosing a check for 20,000 yuan as a scholarship fund for your newspaper. The source of the funds is worth mentioning. A friend recently entrusted me to provide a certain convenience to the head of a certain institution in a certain matter and handed over a bank draft for 20,000 yuan as a token of gratitude to the head of the institution. However, Mr. So-and-so, the head of the institution, handled the matter impartially. Anything that was not outside the scope of the rules could be handled in accordance with the regulations. He refused to accept any undue reward. Mr. So-and-so's integrity and self-respect are truly admirable and inspire unlimited respect in this era of declining political morality. I am using this money to do good deeds to thank Mr. So-and-so for his integrity, which I think readers will also be happy to hear about.]

### The Educational Characteristics of the Former Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Children's Schools ○

— Ueno Taichu

Ugly. Stipulating a fixed amount for daily hospitalization fees.

Yin. Stipulating necessary surgery fees.

Mao. Stipulating fixed amounts for medical expenses for family members (wife and children), maternity allowances for wives, or stipulating special nursing fees and medical consultation fees, etc. - limited to those with employment certificates. The above fees, except for medical consultation fees, which are paid twice a year to the doctor designated by the employee, are not paid on a regular basis. Payment is only made after application and approval when necessary.

(Various benefits other than salary and various allowances, etc., have been proportionally increased since the Incident based on the Municipal Council's Statistics Section's cost of living index - see monthly bulletin)

Fifth, Free Vaccination and Injections for Employees

In addition to annual smallpox vaccinations and anti-rabies injections, teachers and staff must receive a typhoid fever vaccination (three injections over three consecutive weeks) from the Health Department every three years. This vaccination is compulsory and is usually given free of charge by doctors visiting the school.

Sixth, Free Hiring of Substitute Teachers

If a teacher or staff member takes sick leave and provides documentation from hospitals such as Tongren, Renji, or the Red Cross, the school can hire a substitute teacher, with the substitute's fees being fully covered by the Municipal Council. The person taking sick leave also continues to receive their original salary. There was a female teacher who suffered from tuberculosis and took a year of sick leave, and her illness and recovery did not affect her job in any way. This is rare in schools in China.

Seventh, Many Opportunities for Further Study

This is not very obvious in middle schools, but primary school teachers and staff, under the guidance of Chinese educators, have made considerable achievements, such as:

A. Assigning teachers and staff holiday assignments and research topics.

B. Holding holiday lectures and subject-specific seminars for teachers and staff.

C. Demonstration and discussion sessions on teaching methods for each subject.

D. Collaboratively compiling and publishing natural science, French conversation, and kindergarten textbooks.

E. The writing of the Elementary School Teacher Magazine was mostly done by the teachers and staff of each school, which was very popular for a time.

Characteristics of the Students

Due to various traditional reasons, most people in Shanghai send their children to take the entrance exams for the Municipal Council schools every semester, creating a problem of too few seats and too many applicants. The general characteristics are:

○ Student Selection Situation

Whether it is middle school or elementary school, the new student exams every year cause great difficulty. One week before the end of each semester, the director of the Municipal Council announces the exam dates and registration procedures for each school. As a result, students flock to apply, and no fees are charged. The exam date is set for the day after the end of the semester (usually July 1st and December 17th). On average, the number of admitted students accounts for about one-fifth of the total number of applicants. Sometimes, registration has to be limited. It is remembered that at a certain school registration, children had a dispute over application forms. At that time, there was no queuing system, and the chaotic situation can be imagined. Also, the parents of students at a certain school waited outside the school from midnight to get application forms, which shows the eagerness for their children to enter the school. Under this kind of strict selection situation, the quality of students is not a big problem.

○ General School Spirit

Whether it is a boys' school or a girls' school, the students can be described as pure. Although the Chinese Children's Middle School has a slight tendency to study by rote and hold on to books, it does not fall into shadow and dullness. Elementary schools emphasize health and service and have the slogan "Personality First, Health First," which seems to be more lively. Girls' middle schools are especially able to avoid the current extravagant habits. It is remembered that Principal Liang of the Girls' Middle School gave a speech to the students at a farewell meeting, hoping that the students would always preserve the school's spirit, namely:

○ Simplicity, not being flashy, not dressing up.

○ Sincerity, not hypocrisy, not lying.

○ Teachers and students being close, living together, and never knowing what a riot is.

The above three points are ensured by facts, so they are specifically mentioned.
