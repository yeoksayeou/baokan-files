### The Significance of Cultivating Practical Industrial and Commercial Talents

— Tang Shoumin

Since ancient times, the prosperity and decline of a nation's fortunes, and the success or failure of its undertakings, have invariably been linked to the waxing and waning of talent. Thus, gaining talent leads to prosperity, and losing talent leads to decline, a timeless adage. In the political sphere, there are countless examples, requiring no further enumeration. Even in the realm of social enterprises, based on my decades of experience in the business world, any industry that secures talented individuals can expect success, regardless of the initial difficulties, limited capital, rudimentary equipment, or narrow scope. Moreover, it can be expanded and glorified, never fleeting like a short-lived bloom. This principle holds true in every instance. Therefore, when friends and relatives seek my advice on establishing a business, I invariably offer "securing talent" as the primary contribution.

As for the methods of securing talent, within an organization, they consist of setting standards and earnestly seeking qualified individuals. However, for society as a whole, it is necessary to cultivate talent according to the needs, only then can talents emerge in abundance and supply be inexhaustible. For many years, an extreme contradiction has existed in society. On one hand, every enterprise feels unable to find suitable talent to complete a sound cadre. Yet, on the other hand, the number of unemployed people in society increases year by year. Consequently, one often hears the slogan "graduation equals unemployment." This must be attributed to the lack of connection between educational institutions and enterprises, as well as the lack of thorough consideration and appropriate guidance when young students pursue further education.

The underdevelopment of various industries in our country is not solely a matter of capital, but also a matter of talent, especially the lack of practical talent, which affects the rationalization of any industry. Practical talent does not require profound academic theories, but rather a thorough understanding and comprehension of the work being handled, and the ability to carry it out effectively. Furthermore, each industry has different characteristics, and practical talent must be individually trained to meet each specific need. The Management Department of National Jiaotong University was established based on this very principle. Therefore, when graduates of the Management Department are assigned to various railways, they can achieve considerable accomplishments, and the railway administration can see improvements. This is a prime example of how cultivating practical talent can best assist in the development of an enterprise.

Industry, commerce, and finance are the backbone of China's economic construction, but if we want industry, commerce, and finance to flourish, we must first pay attention to enriching the internal ranks with practical talent. In recent years, I have repeatedly exchanged views on this matter with leaders in the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors, and they all share the same sentiment. Moreover, this ideal is now becoming a reality. The China Business College, initiated and established by the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors, was founded with this very purpose in mind. Our greatest objective in establishing this school is to create professional youth and correct the past phenomenon of graduation equaling unemployment. At the same time, we also hope to improve the efficiency of work in the general industry and reduce unnecessary losses to the national economy.

The above are the hopes of a few of us. Whether the results will be as satisfactory as we anticipate, and whether there are any aspects of our methods that should be corrected, we still hope that enthusiastic individuals will provide much criticism and guidance.

Regarding the school's operational policies, China Business College has also determined several points in response to the current situation: First, in addition to intellectual education, we also pay attention to personality cultivation and physical health. Second, the curriculum adopts a focus on key subjects, and any course deemed not very important for employment will be omitted rather than included superficially, to avoid wasting students' energy. Third, cultivate a spirit of perseverance and develop habits of hard work. Fourth, reduce tuition fees and provide more free scholarships so that outstanding young people are not turned away due to family financial problems. Our greatest hope is that the entire society can respond to our methods, each according to their needs, each doing their best, and establishing various specialized schools of different types. We believe that the result of this effort will ultimately be not only helping others, but also helping ourselves.

### The House of Peers Will Fully Cooperate to Realize Various Policies Earlier; A National Movement Will Be Launched After the End of the Diet Session

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - With the imminent convocation of the Extraordinary Diet, the various factions of the House of Peers have carefully considered how to expedite the implementation of various government decisive battle policies and to fully cooperate in actively promoting them. They have decided on two concrete policies: To deliberate on the most essential and indispensable policies during wartime, to focus on arguments, and to ensure that the people gain a proper understanding of them, so as to take comprehensive measures to uplift the spirit of war. The activities of existing research committees will actively assist the government's decisive battle policies. At the same time, individual Diet members will also engage in encouraging overall war power and promoting the realization of policies. The focus of the above two issues is, on the one hand, to rapidly implement decisive battle production increase policies to supply the needs of front-line soldiers, and on the other hand, to ensure food supplies in order to strengthen post-war production. Therefore, more than ten authorities within the research committee have been specially selected to form an iron ore investigation team to decide on reviewing various countermeasures. Furthermore, meetings of various factions to discuss the order of Diet operations will be held after the government decides to submit bills. This Diet session is regarded as an excellent opportunity for the Koiso Cabinet to declare its determination to complete the war under national armament to both domestic and foreign audiences, so it is hoped that its operation will be perfect.

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial Rule Assistance Association held a standing general affairs meeting at its headquarters on the afternoon of the 18th. First, President Kobayashi reported on the discussions with Prime Minister Koiso on the 16th regarding the operation of the Extraordinary Diet. Then, Minister of Practical Affairs Takahashi proposed that because of the increasing gravity of the war situation, the significance of this Extraordinary Diet is particularly significant. The government needs to clarify the policy direction at home and abroad, and the people's determination to complete the war will also be demonstrated, and the war situation will be clarified. Therefore, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association will take this opportunity to strongly launch a national movement united as one after the end of the Diet session. For this purpose, when deliberating on bills, public opinion will be reflected in the Diet, and at the same time, the government will be requested to incorporate this into the policy and realize it. In addition, with this as a prerequisite, all Diet members of each department will be mobilized and dispatched to various places to investigate local conditions and trends of public opinion, and based on these results, use them as materials for proposals in the Diet. Later, it was decided that the Imperial Rule Assistance Association would immediately launch a decisive battle national movement.

### Japan's Aircraft Production Is Progressing Smoothly, All Technical Personnel Have Been Mobilized

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - In light of the progress of the war situation, the Japanese government, in order to solve the problem of the shortage of technical personnel in various factories, has temporarily mobilized technical personnel from government offices, public and private schools, and testing and research institutes as emergency countermeasures. Therefore, the increase in aircraft production is now progressing smoothly. Furthermore, the Extraordinary Diet of the Koiso Cabinet will be held in early next month, taking this opportunity to clarify the determination to complete the war and the concrete measures under the decisive battle. Therefore, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association has already drafted the "Emergency Policy Outline." The House of Peers Investigation Committee has also formulated "Emergency Labor Countermeasures" and is preparing to submit them at the opening of the Extraordinary Diet. According to the Imperial Rule Assistance Association's demands, activities related to both food and political warfare, ensuring military supplies and food production, and establishing a sure-win domestic system are all required.

### Japan's Post-War Research Group Held a Regular Meeting Yesterday

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - Since Mr. Toshio Shiratori, the former ambassador to Italy, took office as the chairman of the Japan Post-War Management Research Committee, he has actively gathered authorities from all walks of life to engage in research work. On the 18th, a regular meeting was held at the Imperial Hotel here, and the draft of "Principles for Establishing a New World Order" was passed. From now on, the following three principles will be implemented to promote Pan-Asianism and counter the American policy of the strong preying on the weak and dominating the world: To implement good-neighborly friendship and joint defense to counter the Anglo-American imperialist policy of distant alliances and near attacks. To implement economic reciprocity and cultural exchange to counter Anglo-American economic monopoly and self-righteous culture. As for the specific countermeasures, the world will be divided into several national groups, such as East Asia, Europe, South America, and North America after the war. Among the countries constituting this national group and between national groups, the principles of joint defense and reciprocal economy will be further implemented. Each national group will be composed of independent countries bordering each other and having a population of 5 million. In each national group, the constituent countries will negotiate and guide the country. The guiding country should be responsible for promoting good-neighborly friendship, joint defense, and reciprocal economy among the countries within the national group and other group members. Disputes among the constituent countries or national groups should be resolved jointly by countries or groups other than the country or group in question. After the above proposal is finalized and submitted to the government for further review, the implementation method will be promoted immediately.

### Pearl Buck Discusses Chongqing-U.S. Relations, Criticizes Erroneous U.S. Policies

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) - American Sinologist Pearl Buck recently published an article entitled "America's Last Chance in China," in which she vehemently attacked the erroneous American policies towards China and India. She stated that the United States has recently sown the seeds of a major Asian war in China and India because the United States, under the guidance of Britain, has intensified the suspicions and distrust of the Chinese. Currently, China harbors increasing resentment towards the United States, which is due to the fact that the United States is essentially adopting its consistent American style towards China. Young American journalists often criticize China, which has a history of thousands of years, with the new American standards, thus Chongqing is subjected to criticism. Furthermore, encouraging such criticism is truly baffling. Moreover, due to Chongqing's

corruption and degeneration

Americans regard it as unqualified to receive American aid. In conclusion, Chongqing, like India, must first unify itself before it is qualified to receive aid, thus causing a new hatred among millions of Chinese people. Pearl Buck further cited four common questions Americans have regarding Chongqing: (1) Is Chongqing heading towards dictatorship? (2) Can the people surrounding Chiang Kai-shek support him in heading towards dictatorship? (3) Can the Chongqing army be democratic under Chiang Kai-shek's leadership? (4) Can Chongqing give an affirmative explanation to the third question? Later, she elaborated that, in short, the entire China is currently in a state of war. Those who cannot understand China's materials cannot understand China's tendencies. The United States is now being

indifferent

Therefore, Chongqing will inevitably become more estranged day by day. Among the things that the Chinese people will never forget, one is that Chongqing intended to assist the British and Americans in dealing with the Vietnam issue, but was rejected. Later, it proposed to assist the British and Americans in dealing with the Burma event, but was again put aside due to being too late. Second, the loss of the Burma Road had a profound impact on Chongqing, but few Americans recognized its importance. Third, the American troops stationed in the Chongqing area, with very few exceptions, were mostly arrogant, so they did not receive the benefits of the American Lend-Lease Act. Fifth, the United States spent heavily on constructing many air bases in the interior of China, but has not yet repaid a single cent. Sixth, the Americans residing in the Chongqing area are mostly arrogant and rude. From all these facts, one can imagine where the space for American friendship with China lies.

### Burmese Buddhist League Condemns Anglo-American Atrocities

Rangoon, 19th (Central News Agency) - The inhumane behavior of the Anglo-American armies in Chongqing, who have massacred innocent people and destroyed and bombed hospitals, schools, and temples, is too numerous to list in this war. Currently, enemy troops in the northern part of Burma are destroying temples and civilian houses through guerrilla activities. Recently, an incident occurred near Myitkyina where a monk's robe was trampled, causing extreme indignation among the residents. The Burmese Buddhist League, in response to this atrocity, issued a directive on the 17th and held a united Buddhist support conference in Rangoon, passing three resolutions: The Chongqing-English-Americans are the enemies of Burma. When they fled from Burma in defeat, they destroyed Buddhist pagodas and religious buildings without leaving anything behind, and plundered objects from temples. Buddhists vow to fight them to the end. When the British ruled Burma, they used all kinds of cunning to promote Christianity, making Burmese people hostile to Buddhism. From now on, Burmese people vow to unite under the same faith. Regarding acts of destroying Buddhist pagodas and other sacred religious objects, this conference will collect and record this information and demand compensation for the losses when the war ends victoriously.

### Heavy Casualties on Chongqing-India Air Route

Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - New York dispatch: Life magazine in its recent publication carried photographs of the Chongqing-India air route, explaining the heavy sacrifices suffered on the Chongqing-India air route. It is claimed that the Chongqing air route is no different from a route from the sky to hell, because the routes it passes through are all sparsely populated mountainous areas. The Chongqing government has always strictly prohibited the publication of information about the situation on this route, but in the past two years, the number of American Air Force personnel who died tragically on this air route is unknown. In this war, the sacrifices suffered on this air route are more than any other non-combat air route. At the same time, the losses of combat air units on this route are also considerable.

On Thursday, the anti-Axis forces landed a large number of tanks, concentrated between Saint-Raphaël and Hyeres Bay, so it is expected that the enemy's first general offensive towards the interior will depart from that point. From there, the highway along Saint-Raphaël to Aix-en-Provence will encircle Mont Maure and attack the Toulon fortress on the northern side. It is also expected that the anti-Axis forces will attack the east side of Toulon along the coastal highway.

China Front

After the Japanese army captured Hengyang, they are now continuing to advance on Hengyang, approaching the Chongqing army.

The Chongqing army, under the cover of artillery, began its attack, and the two armies are currently engaged in fierce fighting. In early August, the Chongqing army suffered 2,148 casualties on the Nu River front. On the night of August 9, the Japanese garrison in La Meng, with a raiding team, penetrated deep into the Chongqing army's positions, destroying two mountain guns, two mortars, and three heavy machine guns.

Central Pacific

In the area of the Mariana Islands, on Saipan and Tinian Islands, the land battles have lasted for two sentences. The Japanese garrison is concentrated in the southern part of the island to resist the enemy, launching fierce attacks on the American army and inflicting great damage. The Japanese side has also suffered some damage. In recent times, they have continued to fight fiercely in various locations. On the nights of the 15th, 16th, and 17th, they used enemy naval vessel flares to continue to fiercely attack the American army's positions. On Omiya Island, after more than two sentences of fierce fighting, the front line is still in a state of intense combat. The Japanese army in that area is overcoming various difficulties and continuing to fight tenaciously. As for the Marshall Islands, the American army has not taken any action in that area. Furthermore, in the Caroline Islands area, on the 13th, 23 American large aircraft attacked Truk. On the same day, four American large aircraft were also spotted on Rul Island, but they were eventually repelled by Japanese fighter squadrons and anti-aircraft artillery units.

Japanese Army Sinks Enemy Ships off Sabang Island in the Indian Ocean

Southwest Pacific, Japanese Base, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) The British Indian Ocean Fleet attacked Sabang Island with a powerful naval force on the morning of July 25. The details have been released by the Japanese General Headquarters. The Japanese army's air defense units sank two enemy destroyers, one submarine, and severely damaged another destroyer, as well as shooting down several enemy aircraft. At 8:30 AM on the same morning, enemy aircraft suddenly appeared in the sky. Japanese army positions and naval units unleashed a fierce barrage of fire, causing several enemy aircraft to be hit and forced to retreat in disarray. Instantly, four enemy destroyers patrolling the sea approached the port of Sabang. The Japanese naval vessels launched torpedoes at them. The enemy adopted a close-quarters strategy, only causing slight damage to Japanese vessels. The enemy destroyers and the cruiser group anchored north of Sabang opened fire on the Japanese. Japanese artillery units and aircraft responded in kind. One enemy ship was hit with a large shell and began to list. Prior to this, the elite army's ground units had also prepared for enemy landings, responding with deadly fire to the enemy's heavy artillery bombardment. Although enemy aircraft attempted to observe the impact points, due to the enemy's poor artillery skills, not a single shell hit the Japanese army's positions. After the Japanese army's brave artillery fire, the enemy destroyers, whose stubborn counterattacks were losing momentum, gradually showed signs of distress. Japanese torpedo boats, like a whirlwind, broke into the enemy fleet and engaged in close combat with its first vessel. At the same time, artillery fire also began to bombard the enemy, and the stern of the ship was hit by a torpedo, causing the enemy fleet to split. The torpedoed enemy ship fled in panic, and the Japanese batteries opened fire, surrounding the enemy ship and causing it to sink. At this time, a staff officer shouted, "Sank one enemy ship!" Furthermore, Japanese aircraft discovered a large enemy submarine southwest of Sabang Island. The submarine surfaced to rescue downed aviators parachuting to the sea. Japanese aircraft bombed it, with the first bomb destroying the submarine's command structure and the second hitting its bow. The engagement lasted for one hour, with the enemy's naval guns firing for a total of forty-five minutes, which was extremely fierce. However, with the concerted efforts of the Japanese army, navy, and air force, the enemy ship was completely repelled.

The total amount of wheat purchased in various cities and counties in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces has reached approximately one million bags, which have been transported to designated warehouses and entrusted to flour mills for processing. It is now known that the committee manages a total of forty-three flour mills in various regions of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, all of which have started production. The supply of household flour is extremely abundant. The distribution of flour mills entrusted by the committee is as follows: Shanghai has Fufeng, Fuxin No. 2 Mill, No. 7 Mill, No. 8 Mill, Huafeng Heji, Three-One Mill, No. 2 Mill, No. 3 Mill, No. 4 Mill, No. 5 Mill, Dongfu, Huayou, Qiangshen, and other twelve mills; Suzhou has Taihe, Dahua, Xinfeng, Sanfeng, and other four mills; Wuxi has Guangfeng, Zengfeng, Shunfeng, Dafeng, Anfeng, Minfeng, Huaxin, Huayou Daxin, Huayou Dafeng, Huayou Dafeng Old Mill, Huayou Jiucheng, and other eleven mills; Changzhou has Dingfeng, Zhaofeng No. 1 Mill, Guangfeng, Xinzhaofeng No. 2 Mill, Hengyi, Zhaofeng No. 3 Mill, Dade, Zhaofeng No. 4 Mill, Yingfeng, Zhaofeng No. 5 Mill, Baofeng, Chengyu, and other eight mills; Zhenjiang has Zhenjiang Mill; Yangzhou has Yangzhou Mingji Mill; Taizhou has Taifeng Mill; Nanjing has Pufeng, Youheng, and other two mills; Wuhu has Huayou Yifeng Mill; Bengbu has Baoxing, Xinfeng, and other two mills.

However, the opium dens that were ordered to close have recently been secretly reopened. Some opium dens are secretly resuming business. It is hoped that the authorities will adhere to the principle of eradicating drugs completely and strictly prohibit them.

### Sharp Increase in Oil Prices, Urgent Need to Curb It

Household oil in this city will soon be distributed, but the price of cooking oil has suddenly risen sharply since the 18th. The general public is suffering an unbearable burden. Yesterday, reporters learned from relevant sources that the reason for the sharp increase in cooking oil prices is not only due to the 60% increase in the price of household oil distribution compared to before. It is due to transportation difficulties, reduced supply, reduced production by major oil mills in this city due to electricity rationing, and increased demand due to the use of vegetable oil for lighting by the general public and various entertainment venues, cafes, and hotels in this city after the implementation of the ban on electric lights after 11 PM. However, cooking oil is one of the most important necessities of life for citizens and is closely related to people's livelihood. It is hoped that the authorities will, on the one hand, curb illegal transactions by unscrupulous merchants and lower prices, and on the other hand, actively dredge the supply channels to ensure the distribution of household oil in each period to benefit people's livelihood. At the same time, citizens must conserve automatically.

### Vehicle Air Defense Equipment Inspection Extended for Five Days; Severe Penalties for Late Inspections

The Shanghai Special City Police Department, in accordance with the announcement of the Shanghai Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force Command, to adapt to the air defense system, implemented inspections of automobile, truck, and motorcycle lighting equipment and siren sound control. The original regulations stipulated that the period would be from the 7th to the 18th of this month, and now it has expired. It is now learned that the bureau, in view of the fact that vehicles were still being repaired or for other reasons during the inspection period, resulting in some vehicles not being inspected in time, has extended the inspection date by five days, from the 21st to the 25th of this month. All vehicles that have not been inspected must be driven to the racecourse for inspection within five days. Late inspections will be subject to severe penalties.

Chief Inspector Inspects Branches

The Shanghai

Police

Department's

Inspection Office has strengthened its internal structure. Chief Guo, in order to better understand the actual situation of the police administration in each branch and to make improvements and corrections, personally inspected each branch. In addition to reviewing files in each section, he also convened section chiefs to speak.

Police Department Revises Holiday Regulations

The Shanghai

Police

Department's

holiday regulations used to include Saturday afternoons off in addition to commemorative holidays and Sundays. Now that the police administration is unified and directly under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Government, the holiday regulations should be in accordance with the Municipal Government's regulations. The Saturday afternoon holiday should be canceled and business should be conducted as usual. This will be implemented starting next week. As for the various branches, the original regulations will still apply. Regardless of holidays, except for senior police officers, shifts must still be worked.

Special High Office Established in Nanshi

The Municipal

Police

Bureau,

in order to strengthen the special high work in the city, has established a special high Nanshi office at the original site of the Second Police Bureau on Penglai Road in Nanshi. The position of director of the office is concurrently held by Chen Liang, deputy section chief of the special high section. It has now officially started operations.

Reader's Scholarship News

### People from All Walks of Life Continue to Donate; Mr. Luo Hongyi Has Raised 200,000 Yuan

The scholarship fund of this newspaper has recently received deep concern from people from all walks of life, and donations have continued. This makes the colleagues even more excited. Although sweating at work, there is still a residual sweetness! Yesterday, we received a letter from all the students of Chengyi Middle School, calling on all sectors of society for the poor and out-of-school children. The original letter said: "The holidays are coming to an end, and every happy student is busy preparing for school, full of infinite hope. However, those poor and out-of-school students, limited to watching them happy, what about themselves? Only sadness, hesitation, worry, and disappointment; no way to borrow, no way to beg, is it that the opportunity to study should disappear in fate? In the past few days, I have only seen the newspaper, one after another, the lament of out-of-school, the pleading of the unsuccessful, and the constant complaints, revealing endless sadness between the lines! We are in this situation, and no one can hold back tears of sympathy. Therefore, in the sweltering heat, we are running around to solicit donations, responding to the newspaper's scholarship donation campaign: and we will hold a charity performance of "Thunderstorm" at the Lanxin Theater on August 23 to thank all sectors of society. We have also added special honorary seats. Anyone who donates 1,000 yuan to the newspaper will receive one ticket. We beg all sectors of society to donate generously. Our performance is of course shallow and thin, not enough to watch. However, we are doing this to save those out-of-school students who are still wandering and waiting to be rescued. We beg

all sectors of society to embrace the universal kindness of "not only treating one's own children as children"

and open up your compassionate hearts,

and rescue them more! Chengyi Middle School

all the students beg to borrow a corner of the newspaper, to

call on all sectors of society!"

### The Eyes of a Bat

— by Tōyū Yoshida

In the summer evenings, bats fly around "squeaking". The Chinese consider them auspicious animals,

because the pronunciation of the words "bat" and "fortune" in Chinese are the same. The two characters for "bat" do not have the dog radical,

but the insect radical, truly befitting of this pitiable animal. When people mention them, they fearfully

peek with their small eyes—so small that they cannot be seen without a microscope—amongst the velvet-like soft fur.

Perhaps everyone has doubted it once: how can such small eyes fly swiftly and catch mosquitoes

in such a dark sky? To answer this question, a German

zoologist came up with an experimental method. He strung thin threads

horizontally and vertically in a dark room, punctured the bat's eyes with needles, and released it. But strangely, even though the blinded bat flew

horizontally, vertically, and up and down in the dark room, it never touched the thin threads. Therefore, he believed that bats must have some other very sensitive sense besides their eyes. So, based on this assumption, he continued to bury

himself in research, and as a result, he discovered that the nerves within the bat's skin are very developed. Even a slight change in air vibration can be felt during flight, and it is dodged

accordingly. In this view, the entire body of the bat

is limited like a large eye. The bat is just like a master of Japanese Kendo, who can feel the wind caused by a sword being slashed from behind, and thus skillfully dodges it and escapes danger. The animal that possesses this kind of keen sensitivity is the bat. Some ignorant people, without understanding the "divine intention in creating things" which bestows the ability to survive upon individual

creatures, only see the bat's small eyes, and then

mock its poor eyesight and difficulty in moving.

I believe that many "Sinologists"

who previously ridiculed the Chinese

for being foolish have made the same mistake as those who mock "the eyes of a bat."

According to foreign perspectives, the general knowledge level of Chinese people is very low. It is doubtful

whether such a nation has spirit. The famous Sinologist Arthur

H. Smith (an American missionary) once

judged the characteristic of the Chinese to be

"intellectual turbidity." He

explained:

"The difference between intelligence and ignorance, wealth and poverty, is the most extreme in China.

The super-rich and the abjectly poor, the highly educated and the illiterate, such polar opposites,

live on the same land. Countless millions of impoverished

and ignorant people have such narrow horizons

that their minds, whether subjectively willing or

not, are deeply mired in 'intellectual confusion.'

They are indeed frogs in a well. They have never traveled

ten miles from their birthplace. They know nothing

about the lives of people outside of those around them.

The instinctual curiosity that is common to all peoples seems

to have hibernated or become fatigued in most of these people.

Many Chinese, even if they know that foreigners have come to live within a mile

of their homes, never want

to ask where the foreigner came from, what their name is,

or what their intentions are. They certainly

know how to fight for survival, but know nothing else besides that. They have no idea

whether the soul that most people believe in

has three, one, or none.

They consider such things, which have nothing to do with the price of the five grains, to be impractical

theories. They...are what Westerners call 'pragmatists,'

that is, their lives are simply

composed of the pleasures of the palate and the purse. This is the result of the extremely active human power

, and therefore they are materialists. They understand nothing

except what they see and hear with their own eyes and ears, and they have absolutely no

notions of idealism or anything like that. They think of life as a series of facts, and also a series of painful

facts. If they transcend facts, then they are also atheists, also theists, and also

agnostics. Although they sometimes kneel and pray, they do not know

to whom they are kneeling and praying. Although they offer sacrifices, they do not know

to whom they are offering sacrifices. Their

only purpose is to satisfy their religious

instincts, and they do not care about anything else."

However, the Chinese who possess this seemingly

intellectually confused state had not received guidance from the government before 1937. Naturally, they were also not particularly

aware that Shanghai would become a battlefield based on the analysis of the world situation.

Therefore, most of them moved away from the Hongkou district. On the surface, the lives of these Chinese, who seem to be composed of the simple "pleasures of the palate and the purse,"

have continued to maintain the world's

oldest culture to this day, and in this world

where the competition for survival is the most intense, they will in some sense become a new world-class power.

Seeing this fact, the Chinese definitely have an instinctual

awareness that we do not understand. This is just like how bats use the sensation of their skin instead of their eyes to see things. The Chinese perhaps perceive things using a special sense that is completely different from what we call "reason."

But then, what exactly is this sense itself?

Confucius once said to Zigong:

"Be a gentleman and not a petty man." Gu Hongming explained this sentence by saying: "If you want to be a great scholar, don't forget to become a gentleman with sensibility. In order to be a great scholar, don't be a foolish person." Here, Confucius emphasized possessing

knowledge with sensibility, rather than mere knowledge.

Knowledge with sensibility is not knowledge that can be known simply from books, but is knowledge that is dissolved into one's own life and has a real sense. It is this point that, once known, gives knowledge that seems so impossible to be non-impulsive. That is to say,

Confucius often emphasized knowledge with emotion, that is, knowledge accompanied by practice. Confucius said, "The gentleman wishes to be slow in his words, but diligent in his actions," and also said, "The superior man is ashamed of his words exceeding his deeds." Confucius even told

his disciple Zilu, who was a man of action, that "If you have heard something but have not been able to put it into practice, then you should fear hearing it again." When externally given knowledge is combined with internal experience, it then has a real sense. When one experience in the mind

contradicts another experience, then a person has doubts. A person wants to explain this doubt, and then becomes troubled. This is the relationship that seeks knowledge. At this time, if the teacher gives knowledge with appropriate explanations, then the two previously contradictory experiences in the mind are reconciled and consistent. Then one obtains the knowledge of the true sense that is combined with experience. Confucius

valued this rational kind of vexation when acquiring knowledge with a real sense.

Therefore, Confucius said, "If one does not say, 'What shall I do? What shall I do?' I can really do nothing with him!" and in another place said, "To learn without thinking is labor lost; to think without learning is perilous." The "thinking" mentioned here is the vexation of knowledge that I am talking about. Confucius certainly said at first, "Thinking is of no value; learning is better," but pure learning is absolutely not sufficient. If knowledge vexation does not occur at the same time as learning, then knowledge will not become something with a real sense; that is, it will become what Confucius called "bewilderment." Conversely, if there is merely knowledge vexation without learning, then there will be no progress; that is, one will fall into what Confucius called "peril." Therefore, Confucius often emphasized to the Chinese knowledge with a real sense and a mind with sensibility. A mind without sensibility is what the Germans call a "stone head" (Stein Kopf), which can best express sensible knowledge or knowledge with a real sense. The most concrete expression of sensible knowledge or knowledge with a real sense is the knowledge of children. What children know is also real to them at the same time. The reason why children know about ghosts and monsters is because they believe that ghosts and monsters actually threaten them. Gu Hongming's saying that the Chinese are a people with a "child's psychology" also refers to this point.

Based on this perspective, Hongming

explains the Chinese as follows:

"The Chinese to this day

lead a child's life, a life of the heart.

(A life of the heart). Therefore, in terms of nationhood,

the Chinese are certainly an ancient nation, but

to this day they are still a childish nation.

But what is especially important is that this childish nation, which leads

a life of the heart, has many

primitive forms in its practical life, but

has the mental power and rationality that primitive nations cannot have.

(A power of mind and rationality).

Under the guidance of this mental power and rationality, the Chinese

can smoothly solve the difficult and complex problems

of social life, government, and civilization...

What I especially want to

point out here is that the admirable characteristic

of the Chinese is actually not

that the Chinese simply lead a life of the heart,

because all primitive nations also

lead a life of the heart. At the same time, as far as

I know, the European Christians of the Middle Ages also

lived a life of the heart.

Matthew Arnold said: 'The poetry of medieval Christianity

is formed by the heart and imagination.'

However, what I especially want to point out is that the admirable characteristic of the Chinese

is that the Chinese both

lead a life of the heart and a life of childhood, while also holding

the mental power and rationality that medieval Christians and other primitive

nations do not have.

In other words, the amazing characteristic of the Chinese

is that they are a grown-up nation,

a rationally mature nation, and a nation with such a long history,

but they still lead a life of the heart and a life of childhood to this day.

Therefore, some people say that China is a nation that has stopped growing and developing, but

in reality, the Chinese are definitely not

becoming an aging nation. In short, the amazing characteristic of the

Chinese nation is that its people know the secret of permanently maintaining youth."

What was pointed out earlier by Arthur

H. Smith, as well as many other foreigners,

that cannot be discovered in China— precisely because it cannot be discovered, and

they completely cannot understand the Chinese and

their culture— to be honest,

this is the characteristic of the Chinese.

To repeat, the Chinese are "

a people with the minds of adults and the psychology of children." This means that

the Chinese are a people who understand things with their minds,

and perceive things with their emotions.

The Chinese's perception is just like

children perceive adults they like and

adults they dislike at a glance.

This is not by reasoning,

but by the power of "sensibility." Therefore,

the Chinese cannot be said to be a people with sharp

"sensibility." Arthur H. Smith says that the Chinese's way of thinking

lacks exactness (Want of exactness). This may be true, but the Chinese

are a people who think more with their hearts than with their heads.

As for the heart, let us use Gu Hongming's

words again: "It is

a very sensitive and delicate organ.

It is not a solid and strict machine like the brain. Therefore, the heart's

thinking cannot be as accurate as the brain's thinking.

If saying this is wrong, then at the very least it can be said

that it is extremely difficult for the heart to think correctly.

What the Chinese use for writing is not a fountain pen or a pencil,

but a writing brush. But it can also be said

that only the writing brush is a symbol of the Chinese heart.

It is certainly very difficult to write and paint with a writing brush,

but once one is proficient in its use, it can express

beauty and charm that a fountain pen cannot express."

In the Chinese language, there has never been a term

equal to logic. Logic may be something that must be thought with the head, but for

the Chinese who think with their hearts, it is not entirely

necessary. Those who think with their hearts do not use logic as a weapon, but

use the delicacy of emotion and the

sensitivity as weapons. Just like the bats with such small

eyes possess the mysterious sense of being able to fly and catch small mosquitoes in the dark sky, the Chinese

have the agile sensitivity and refinement of the heart, through which they have been able to pass through the world's fierce survival

competition process for five thousand years. This is a great

achievement.

Many foreigners have overlooked this

step, so they think that the Chinese are a people with weak thinking power and are easily deceived. Since the late Qing Dynasty, when the Chinese

longed for the modernization of their country,

foreigners all rushed forward—even arguing— wanting to help

China modernize. Some lent funds for

railway construction, some established

churches, opened hospitals, some established

schools to educate Chinese children, and so on.

All of this was necessary for China's modernization.

Foreigners say that the Chinese should express their gratitude

to them for these many forms of assistance. However,

the Chinese, who do not think with their heads but with their hearts, have been extremely astute observers. As Arthur H. Smith admitted,

"The Chinese only firmly believe that they

themselves want to reform the Chinese Empire, and

do not recognize that the great powers' reforms of China

are driven by higher ideals."

The Chinese, here too, have reached the same conclusion

that accurate thinking can reach due to their sharp

sensibility. The Chinese certainly cannot accurately

know that the foreigners' assistance will

result in China becoming "meat on the chopping block,"

but they can accurately sense this little by little.

To this point, I would like to make a conclusion.

Currently, Japan is recognizing the freedom, independence, and equality of China.

The concept of the Japanese government recognizing the freedom, independence, and equality of China

means that individual Japanese people must recognize that individual Chinese people are the people of an equal

and independent nation. As for whether

individual Japanese people sincerely and earnestly think this way

and whether there is sincerity in this national policy,

the Chinese with strong sensibility can immediately

sense it with their hearts. The "benevolence" (ren) in Confucius' saying that "clever words and a flattering appearance are seldom associated with true benevolence"

refers to sincerity in human relationships. Clever words and a flattering appearance without sincerity

cannot get through with the Chinese.

The other day, I published

an article in the Shen Bao entitled "Making a Big Deal out of a Small Issue,"

and pointed out a certain mistaken notion of the Japanese. Then, someone dogmatically questioned me, saying: "Family matters should not be aired in public. Why don't you conceal the Japanese people's wrongdoing towards the Chinese and instead publish it to the Chinese?" But I believe: Why

can we only sing the praises of the Japanese people

to the Chinese, with whom we have sworn to live and die together,

and not expose the Japanese people's arrogance?

Every Japanese person still needs to ask themselves in the quiet of the night, whether they are maintaining

what degree of faithfulness to the slogan of "living and dying together."

This is the idea that "the superior man is ashamed of his words exceeding his deeds." A gentleman also has times when his "words" exceed his "deeds."

We have long since made our "words," but now the problem lies in

how to make our "deeds" catch up with our "words."

I have no doubt that if every Japanese person

can have this kind of self-reflection in practice, then

the hearts of the Chinese with strong sensibility will definitely

sensitively sense this. Because

the Chinese do not want to hear

the grand and magnificent Great East Asia theory made by the Japanese,

but want to feel with their hearts the sincerity that is expressed in practice. (Translated by Lu)

Yesterday you came to my place, saw that slip of paper pressed under my glass cup, and couldn't help but smile. I asked you what you were smiling at, and you just glared at me without answering. Leaning against the table, your two eyes wide, you gazed at the white clouds outside the window, lost in thought. The room was so quiet that we could hear each other's heartbeats. I quietly walked up from behind, grabbed your hand, and held it tightly. You immediately struggled free, a blush rising on your face, and fled to the window like a bird. The sunlight poured over you, and in the glow of the sunset, you looked even more beautiful and charming.

"How are you now?" you asked, turning your face to me.

"Jumping out of the love trap, breaking free from economic control, that is a celestial being in heaven, a living Buddha on earth." This slip of paper was clipped from a magazine. I had even specially added a few words myself: "I am very self-aware. Although I am poor, I am not so poor as to be controlled by economics. As for love, I am well aware of my insufficient conditions and dare not venture in rashly. Since I haven't entered the door, naturally there is no need to jump out." So my life before was as calm as stagnant water. Although I occasionally felt bored, I still managed to get through it safely. But since you stepped into my circle of life, I can no longer suppress my feelings. You threw a small stone into my life, and the calm water surface immediately rippled.

"How are you now?"

I knew you were asking me on purpose, with a playful smile, like a spring flower basking in the warm sunshine. You asked so abruptly that I was stunned. What should I answer you? Today, as I pondered alone, I came up with an answer:

"I am human! How do you expect me to jump out?"

One night,

we came out

from watching a play,

I walked you

home, walking

under the gray-yellow lamplight, our two shadows stretched long. The autumn wind blew, and we felt a chill. You leaned very close to me, but neither of us spoke. However, our two hearts were already melting together. I suddenly asked you:

"Will you always be by my side?"

Although it was just a soft question, it broke the silence. You didn't answer me, and the air around us solidified again. Only the phoenix tree leaves trembled in the autumn wind, rustling. After a while, you said:

"You don't believe it?"

I wanted to say something, but you were already home.

To tell

the truth, I

don't quite

believe it.

It's not that I doubt you, but I'm afraid that I have no future and will ruin you. In terms of your beauty and education, I am too far apart. I have never worn a square hat and have been mixing in society for many years, with nothing but empty hands. I will never make big money or get rich. I feel it is wrong and almost cruel to get so close to you. So sometimes, although my heart wants to stand closer to you, I remember, "Don't ruin her!" My heart immediately sinks. Lately, even the courage to ask you to go to the theater together has disappeared. Speaking of going to the theater, last month we went to see "Six Records of a Floating Life." The protagonist, Luo Tuo, has a detached personality, is not good at managing things, and does not value money or possessions. Although Yun is a gentle and considerate woman, the joy of conjugal life is greatly reduced when they lack rice and firewood. Their lives are full of hardship, and their old age is even more miserable, enduring the torment of life in hunger and cold. Isn't such a tragic experience enough to warn me? This story deeply wounded my heart. Walking out of the theater, the tear stains seemed not yet dry. I wanted to tell you directly, "Let me stay away from you!" In fact, that is the only way for you to be happy. But somehow, I couldn't bring myself to say it.

You are a young

lady growing

up in Shanghai.

I think you

must be well

aware of the environment in Shanghai. You know that Shanghai has become more and more extravagant in recent years. Everyone has a greedy desire for material pleasures. I don't underestimate you, but I don't regard you as a superhuman, thinking that there is not even a hint of vanity or ambition in you. In fact, are you really wrong? The one who is wrong is me. I think if I had money in my hands, wouldn't everything be okay? It's just a pity that I lack money. This problem will naturally not be serious during courtship. Even if our pockets are empty today, we don't have to go to the cinema or other expensive places. We can wander on the streets for half a day and still feel deeply in love without feeling tired. But we can't just focus on the present, right? Many tragedies are caused by thinking too little about the future. If we close our eyes and imagine, our stomachs empty, our bodies cold, how will we spend our days? The tragedy in "Six Records of a Floating Life" should be a good comparison.

You still seem young and innocent, and your family environment is not bad, so you can't imagine these things at all, or perhaps you wouldn't understand even if I told you. Today I don't intend to write about it here. I'm afraid you'll misunderstand and hurt your heart, but this is indeed what I've been holding in my heart for months.

Today you still came

to my place.

I didn't greet

you as warmly

as before. I want to stay away from you. You might be unhappy. Your expression didn't look very good, but this is fortunate for you.

You will understand what I mean, won't you?

### Childhood Memories: Fragments of a Childhood Life

— Hu Yi

"Spring goes and autumn comes. The wandering son is saddened by his drifting life. When I recall my brother, the scenes seem like yesterday..." As I slowly and softly recited this poem, I happened to glimpse that the weeping willows outside the window had sprouted tender green buds at some point. It seemed that the Creator was indicating that it was now the season of red peach blossoms and yellow rapeseed flowers again.

The past is worth savoring. Every time I reach this season, I can't help but recall a touching story from my childhood!

It was probably the year I turned six!

It was also a spring

day with a gentle breeze and

bright sunshine. My younger sister and I were sent by

our mother to our grandfather's

house in our hometown, because we wanted a change of environment.

Because we had never

lived with our grandfather,

we were very unfamiliar and distant from him. You could say

that we didn't know him at all.

The first time we saw him, my

mother took my little hand, walked up to him,

and told me to call him "Grandpa."

At that time, I opened my eyes wide,

staring blankly at him, feeling

everything was strange and fearful.

My grandfather smiled

broadly, picked me up and

sat me on his knee.

His dry hands stroked

my cheeks, and he asked me very

concerned:

"Big baby, are you

tired? Are you tired at all?"

This gentle and

loving voice echoed in my ears.

I, who usually didn't like calling people,

actually obediently said to him:

"Grandpa! I'm a little hungry."

He was very happy to hear me speak,

looked up at my mother, and said

very proudly, as if praising:

"This child is so clever!" As he spoke,

he picked me up and took me

to get some cake to eat. Although it was

the first time I met my grandfather, he

gave me a deep and loving impression.

My grandfather's love for us can be said

to be meticulous. Every morning, he

personally went to the market, and came

back carrying a basket full of things we loved

to eat: big prawns, live

crucian carp, as well as fat chickens, eggs,

and tender green bamboo shoots.

And—there were so many delicious things!

My grandfather not only paid attention to our

diet, but also cared about our

health. He wanted our lives to be

regular. He would wake us up

every day before the sun even rose,

helped us with washing up, eat

snacks, and take our hands to

the back garden to watch the sunrise. At that time, he

told us where the sun rose

from and where it set, and pointed to the

ever-changing morning glow, asking us to

distinguish its colors. I remember that

at that time my sister often confused purple and blue.

It's really funny when I think about it now.

The setting sun dragged its weary steps,

slowly rolling down the mountain, and the breeze carried

a hint of coolness. The sky was scattered

with blood-red evening clouds.

In the embrace of that beautiful, book-like

nature, my grandfather took

my sister and me, strolling slowly along the

stream. Along the way, he told us

about farming knowledge and interesting

stories. Sometimes he would squat on the

path in the fields, pick some green

grass, and tell us that it was alfalfa,

or point to a pile of dark

little animals in the river, telling us that

they were tadpoles. The afterglow of the setting sun gradually

disappeared as we talked and walked.

In addition to strolling twice a day,

he instructed the family not to

let the two children run out of the

gate, because there were many stray dogs in the countryside,

and there were small rivers winding everywhere.

The children were always worried

without adults.

One afternoon, the weather was exceptionally

clear, and the sun was particularly

warm. My grandfather had been

invited to a neighbor's house for dinner in the morning. My grandmother and aunt

were busy making glutinous rice balls in the kitchen.

At that time, my sister and I were playing

upstairs, feeling very lonely and bored.

There were several pairs of

small birds on the willow branches outside the window, chirping

and chattering non-stop.

We were attracted by this clear

and pleasant sound, and we unanimously

climbed onto a table by the window,

eagerly staring at those fearless

little birds. Suddenly, my

sister pulled my skirt.

"What's the matter?" I turned

around and asked her.

"Sister! Look!" My

sister extended a finger, smiling

and softly answering. I followed the

direction she was pointing, and saw four or five

girls of our age

playing by the bridge in the field.

One was squatting on the ground, two were standing

next to her, watching the water, and

several others were clapping their hands and jumping. A burst

of silver bell-like laughter traveled to

my ears on the wind. I was so happy that I couldn't help but

open my mouth and laugh with them.

"Sister!" My sister pulled me

again.

"What!" I was a little distracted,

my full attention turned to the

bridge.

"Shall we go over there?"

My sister drew closer to my ear

and asked timidly.

"Okay!...No, if Grandpa

knows..."

"Grandpa's not home!

Let's sneak out quietly, and come back in a little

while!" My sister confidently

offered her plan. My heart was

moved, and we both climbed down from the table,

 tiptoed down the stairs, walked out of

the gate, and ran straight to the bridge.

Looking closely, it turned out

that the girl squatting on the ground

was the oldest one, who everyone called

Sister Qing. We also followed suit. Her hand

held a fishing net, and there

was a big fish jumping in the net.

The four children next to her were all so happy

that they danced. Sister Qing used skillful

movements to lower the bamboo pole,

and reached into the net with her other hand to take out the fish,

taking out at least one at a time. Before long, the wooden

bucket was already filled with three or four fish. Just as

we were enjoying the scene, my sister pulled

my skirt again:

"Sister, let's go back!"

"Wait a little longer, what's the rush!"

I was a little reluctant to leave.

Sister Qing was casting the net again and again,

and the bucket was almost full.

Suddenly, she shouted, "Look!"

As she spoke, she used force to lift the net.

I thought: this fish must be especially

big, and I couldn't help but be happy for her.

She reached out with a smile to grab the fish.

Probably because the fish was too big, she

couldn't hold back the fish's

jump with one small hand, and it slipped

out of her hand. At that time, my sister happened to be standing next to her, and the big fish happened to jump onto my sister's

face. My sister was startled

and took two steps back. Who knew there was

a small stream behind her. My sister slipped

and fell into the water.

The group of smiling children

were instantly frightened and dumbfounded.

Sister Qing was older than us

after all, and she regained her senses. She quickly stood

up and told everyone to go down the stone steps

and pull my sister up. Fortunately, the

water there was shallow, so she didn't drown, but

she was covered in mud.

My sister looked at me with a crying and laughing

expression. As for me,

I was so scared that I was speechless,

watching them pull my sister up,

wipe the mud off her face and body, but

I was too scared to say a word.

My grandfather didn't allow us to run around by ourselves,

for fear that children would be curious

and like to take risks, which could easily lead to accidents.

This was his experience!

Sports

### Summer Swimming Sports

Swimming, as a sport in Shanghai, has always seemed to be primarily for entertainment, rarely producing good results, and this is mainly due to the environment. However, the general athletes of Guangdong and Hong Kong, two aquatic regions, benefit from the climate, so talents have emerged throughout history. I still remember that in the 6th National Games aquatic competitions, regardless of men's or women's championships, they were all seized by the Guangdong team, whose talents were average. Hong Kong relied on outstanding individuals such as Chen Zhenxing and Yang Xiuqiong to win the men's and women's individual championships. Among them, the beauty and grace of the mermaid Yang Xiuqiong swept the entire society, while on the men's side in Shanghai, only Liang Weisheng and Shi Bogen barely managed to win a few points. Although there were six women participating on the women's side, they all failed to win any medals, which is enough to prove Shanghai's lack of attention to this sport.

This summer, Shanghai has very few opportunities to practice swimming

This summer, the only

swimming pool in Shanghai open to the public

is the Hongkou Swimming Pool.

Because of this, the pool is even

more crowded every day, with only

the atmosphere of just soaking

in the water. And apart from

the China Youth once having a

non-official scrimmage, no other

competitions have been held,

which is regrettable. I have learned that the

Municipal Sports Association will hold the Chinese Open

Swimming Competition on the 30th of this month at the

East Asia Gymnasium Swimming Pool. The news

is quite exciting. However, the pool room

in the pavilion is narrow and cannot accommodate many spectators,

which is a shortcoming. And this competition

will be the only official competition

this season.

The Chinese Open Competition will be held on the 30th of this month

The Shanghai Municipal Sports Association

organized the 33rd Annual China-Eight Swimming Championship

Competition. The venue is the East Asia

Gymnasium Swimming Pool on Jing'an Temple Road. Registration

is open from the 16th to the 26th of this month.

The registration fee is 50 yuan per person, along with

a deposit of 200 yuan. Those who participate in the

competition will have their deposit returned, otherwise

it will be confiscated. The registration office is at 749 Jing'an Temple Road

(Jing'an Building), Room 306. The competition date is the 30th of this month.

Each athlete can participate in a maximum of

three events (excluding diving), and four participants will be selected for each item.

Scoring is based on 5.3.2.1.,

and the top three will be awarded gold, silver, and bronze medals.

Divided into men's and women's groups, the one with

the most total points in each group will be the individual champion of that group.

Each will be awarded a silver shield. The competition

items are recorded as follows:

Men's Group: 50-yard

Freestyle, 100-yard Freestyle,

400-yard Freestyle, 100-yard

Backstroke, 200-yard Breaststroke,

Fancy Diving.

Women's Group: 50-yard

Freestyle, 50-yard Backstroke,

100-yard Freestyle, 100-yard Breaststroke.

There are many enthusiasts in Shanghai, and it is

expected that registrants will be enthusiastic, so the

results will surely be wonderful, and the grand occasion can

be predicted.

The Sino-French Friendship Match was Extremely Heated

The Sino-French Friendship

Competition between the China Youth Association's

China Youth Swimming Team and the French Association

was held on August 11th at 5:30 PM

at the Sichuan Road China Youth Swimming Pool.

No tickets were sold, and entry was by invitation. The audience

filled the room, and the atmosphere was unusually lively.

The green water in the pool was

crystal clear, and the swimming was in progress,

making one feel refreshed.

Many experts joined this time.

The Chinese included Wen Jingling, Wang Zhongcheng, and Yang Enshou,

while the French had H. Balaran and Li Aoni,

all of whom are currently famous masters in Shanghai.

The referee was Mr. Jie Zhaoan, and the secretary was Mr. Chen Baolin.

The competition began at 5:30, and

each swimming hero competed fiercely

amidst the warm applause of the audience.

The French Association

won the first victory. H. Balaran's performance was outstanding,

winning both the 60-yard freestyle and

100-yard freestyle championships. Wen Weiling

finished fourth in the 100-yard freestyle,

and the 400-yard freestyle was also defeated by the Frenchman Li Aoni.

As for Wang Zhongcheng winning the 100-yard backstroke championship, Yang Enshou

won the 200-yard breaststroke championship, winning

thunderous applause from the entire audience, bringing

glory to the Chinese. There were a total of three relay races.

The China Youth team won the 160-yard breaststroke relay and the 120-yard medley relay. However, the French Association

won the final 160-yard four-person freestyle relay.

The champion of fancy diving was Wang Anxiang of the China Youth team, and the runner-up was Qi Nanyang.

The performance of Wang and Qi was exceptionally brilliant.

The French Association's Mai Aoli was left behind, sighing

that he was inferior. In addition to the various competitions, there were also various ancient swimming and modern swimming performances. The final result of the competition

was that the China Youth team won with 62 points to 55.

### Star Team Leader Zhou Wenji Talks About Basketball Tactics

— Jie Mei

Miss Zhou

Wenji, the director

of the Star

Perfume Factory,

is shrewd and capable,

and has long been

renowned in the

industrial world.

The Star Basketball

Team is organized

by the factory's colleagues, with Zhou serving as the team leader.

Therefore, it has repeatedly overcome strong enemies and achieved remarkable results.

Recently, the Beiping Sports Friends Team went south

to fight. Although the main players were absent, they unfortunately

failed. However, their unrelenting spirit is commendable. The reporter

was sent to Shanghai to investigate the matter. Zhou

spoke eloquently and

insightfully, as recorded below:

"The Sports Friends Team won the first

three of the four matches in Shanghai, but lost to

Hualian in the last one. In terms of individual skills

, the Sports Friends Team and the Hualian Team

are comparable. Guo Yaochen and Guo Yongen's

dribbling is fast and agile, and Chang Ying's shooting

is accurate and beautiful. However, their tactics

are rigid and easily exploited,

unlike Hualian's ability to adapt to changes. The players

of Hualian are well-trained and can use their intelligence

to win. They are calm in the face of battle and never

get flustered. When Sports Friends meets them, they have a feeling

of 'unfathomable depth.' The outcome

is determined by this. Nowadays, basketball competitions

have progressed to the stage of 'battle of wits.'

Success depends on surprising and ingenious tactics.

Showy techniques can win applause, but are of no practical use.

This time, the Sports Friends Team came to Shanghai, making

us believe even more in the importance of basketball tactics. In recent years,

the various teams in Shanghai have been able to understand

this point and have definitely made a lot of progress compared to before.

However, there are still not many players with outstanding

individual skills. I hope that in the future, they can also put in

hard work in terms of skills, so that tactics and skills

can advance at the same time. Then the improvement of the basketball level

can definitely be predicted. Our team

was established not long ago. Fortunately, we have received guidance

from advanced sports figures and encouragement from the sports world.

Looking at the past achievements, they are still unsatisfactory.

We now plan to hire a good coach and continue

training, hoping to become an excellent

team. And recently we have established a Star

miniature soccer team, hoping that all sectors will give us advice!"

### This Morning's Softball Semi-Finals: Panda Takes on the Philippine Community, Meanwhile Western Youth Battles the Portuguese Business Red Team

— Miao Shan

Since this newspaper began

reporting on and advocating for

softball, the nation has gradually paid more

attention. Last Sunday, Panda was originally scheduled to

fight the Portuguese Business Red team, and Chinese fans

all flocked to the location, filling it completely.

Unfortunately, due to continuous rain, the field

became waterlogged and the game had to be postponed, causing

thousands of fans to travel back and forth in vain. The authorities deeply

expressed their regret. Today (the 20th),

starting at 9:45 AM, there will be two important and exciting matches

at Jiaozhou Park. The first match will feature the strong Chinese team Panda (P

audas) against the Philippine community's EU.Kni

ghts. The second match will be between Western Youth (Y.

Cubs) and the Portuguese Business Red team (Lusir

ano Reds). These four teams have

never been defeated in the league, and each holds

great ambitions. Therefore, today's matches are nothing short of

a decisive battle, and the winner will have the hope of reaching the championship

finals. Therefore, today, fans

can witness the nimble style of our Chinese team, and

at the same time, they can also witness the skills of various Western teams. If the weather cooperates, and the field

is not flooded, then these two exciting

matches will definitely take place as scheduled.

Sports Miscellany

After the conclusion of the

Volleyball League's Women's Group A, only Group B

competition is currently ongoing. It is rumored that there may be a

charity match in the near future. The Men's group will most likely be

the Group A champion Yuehua team against a mixed team.

The mixed team will be composed of the elite players from the Huaying White team. The Women's team is still under discussion.

Regarding the teams for the next season's Football League Group A,

there may be changes. There is a possibility of increasing

the number of teams. (Quietly)
