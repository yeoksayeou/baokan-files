### The Japanese Air Force Continues Fierce Attacks, Sinking Seventeen Ships; Ground Forces Break into the Broon Airfield

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 9th: The Japanese Air Force, attacking enemy ships near Ormoc, Leyte Island, sank one small cruiser and two destroyers in the waters off Bapa on December 7th, and shot down ten enemy aircraft over Ormoc. In this operation, thirteen Japanese aircraft did not return after self-destruction.

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 9th: (1) Japanese ground forces in the western Broon area of Leyte Island broke into enemy lines on the morning of the 6th. That night, in coordination with the Kōchi airborne troops, they broke into the northern and southern enemy airfields of Broon, and are engaged in combat with local enemy forces. It seems that the Kōchi airborne troops who broke into other enemy airfields have achieved great results. (2) On the morning of December 7th, an enemy division began landing near Alvera on the west coast of Leyte Island. The Japanese air force immediately dispatched aircraft to attack enemy ships, while ground forces also engaged the enemy in fierce battles. Among the battle results obtained by the air force, the following have been confirmed: the special attack squads "Gokoku" and "Ichiyu" sank one large transport ship, destroyed and set fire to two large transport ships, two ships of unknown type, and other air force units sank one transport ship, destroyed three destroyers, one large transport ship, and numerous landing craft. (3) The Japanese special attack squad "Kinno" attacked enemy ships in Leyte Gulf on December 7th, sinking one battleship and three transport ships.

Philippine Base, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese "Kamikaze" special attack squadron fiercely attacked the US fleet west of Leyte Island on the 8th. One cruiser and two destroyers were hit and exploded, sinking. Simultaneously, other units of the Kamikaze squadron continued their attacks accordingly, but no reports of results have been received yet.

Japanese Military Base in the Philippines, 9th (Central News Agency) – The US forces in Leyte, with reinforcements, are rapidly advancing from Biankara Bay towards Ormoc, but due to the fierce resistance of the enemy's 32nd and 24th divisions in the Managaran area, their attempts have been thwarted. Furthermore, the enemy's 7th, 96th, and 1st Mechanized Divisions, who were planning to advance from the east coast of Leyte towards the western highlands of Haro and Tagami, were completely stopped on the night of the 6th by the courageous surprise attacks of the Japanese ground forces in coordination with airborne troops. Due to the weakening of combat power, the enemy forces in Leyte as a whole are increasingly anxious. As a result, the enemy forces have dispatched a part of the 7th Division from Bapa to Damraan, using every means to try to establish an advantage in Ormoc Bay, but the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on this northward-moving enemy force at Damraan on the 7th. The enemy vanguard has been blocked in that area, but in order to gain an advantageous battle line, the enemy is currently landing amphibious tanks and other equipment in that area, desperately trying to reverse the decline.

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) – Commander MacWhorter announced on the 8th: (1) In the naval and air battle fought in Ormoc Bay on the 7th, one US destroyer and one small transport ship were sunk by Japanese air force torpedoes. (2) A squadron of Japanese dive bombers sank one medium-sized US cargo ship in the Mindanao Sea.

Details of Fierce Attacks by Various Japanese Special Attack Squadrons on American Ships

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – After the Japanese Kōchi parachute troops infiltrated the enemy airfield on Leyte, the battle on Leyte Island became even more intense. Before this heroic feat, Japanese special attack squads launched a large-scale operation on the 5th, fiercely attacking enemy ship groups patrolling around Leyte. In addition to the results of the "Ishiwatari" squad announced on the 7th, which sank one ship, it has now been confirmed that one aircraft from the "Manto" squadron sank an enemy cruiser, and three aircraft from the "Ichiyu" squadron sank three transport ships. On this day alone, the Japanese air force sank or destroyed eleven enemy ships. The course of their struggle is generally as follows: One aircraft from the "Manto" squadron bravely plunged into the enemy fleet in Leyte Gulf, and made a courageous direct impact on the heart of a large enemy warship or cruiser. The enemy ship immediately reverberated with a loud bang and began to catch fire and list, it is presumed that it soon sank. Three aircraft from the "Tesshin" squadron were searching for enemy ships east of Leyte Gulf when they suddenly discovered a transport convoy west of Saar Island protected by escort ships. The three aircraft used floating clouds, braved intense enemy anti-aircraft fire, and rushed into the enemy airspace, forming a single-file formation and simultaneously breaking into the convoy. At this time, the Japanese escort aircraft gradually engaged the enemy interceptors in fierce battles, so they were unable to confirm the battle results, only imprinting the moment of the Japanese aircraft's charge into their eyes. Also, in this operation, one Japanese escort fighter was lost and never returned. On the 7th, they attacked enemy ships in Leyte Gulf for about an hour, although the battle results were not confirmed. Later, according to reports from naval units, three aircraft from the "Ichiyu" squadron each made a dive-bombing attack on an enemy transport convoy, certainly sinking three enemy ships.

### Japanese Army in Burma with Strict Defenses - Commander Kimura Speaks

Rangoon, 9th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Kimura, the supreme commander of the Japanese army in Burma, made the following statement on the occasion of the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War: Since last year, the enemy has been trying to open the land transportation route between China and India with the Allied forces of Britain, America, and Chiang Kai-shek, while also attempting to sacrifice the Indian people and recapture Burma. In addition, they have strengthened the Indian Ocean Fleet and want to invade from the sea, but because the Japanese army in Burma has strict defenses, the enemy's attempts have failed. The domestic strength of Burma has recently become increasingly solid, the Provisional Government of Free India is also actively replenishing its combat power, and the morale of the Japanese Expeditionary Force is becoming more and more high. The unwavering belief in victory is becoming more and more firm. With this strong spirit, we will surely make Burma as solid as a rock. At the same time, we will also do our best to assist the Provisional Government of Free India in achieving its long-cherished wish. Now, before the enemy implements a general counterattack, we will boldly adopt an offensive posture, in order to permanently remove the presence of Britain and America from East Asia. To achieve this goal, the three countries of Japan, Burma, and India must work together with one heart and mind, believing in and supporting each other, and fighting forward together with the spirit of daring to die.

### Inheriting the Fighting Spirit of Our Predecessors to Defend the Philippines - General Yamashita Broadcasts to the Nation

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – General Tomoyuki Yamashita, the supreme commander of the Japanese army in the front lines of Leyte, who commands the three armed forces with both loyalty and bravery, gave a special broadcast to the country from the front lines of smoke and gunfire on the evening of the 8th. The main content is as follows: Recently, in the decisive battles off the coast of Taiwan, the eastern sea of the Philippines, and Leyte Island, as well as the attacks on Morotai and Saipan, our army, navy, and air force have achieved great results, which is extremely gratifying. Our army was able to achieve such results with a small number of troops against an enemy that relies on material resources and superior mobility. The reason is that we have inherited our traditional spirit of fighting to the death. The Japanese people must continue to uphold this spirit in the future. At the same time, I will also uphold this spirit and move forward to accomplish the task of annihilating the enemy. For example, when our side collides a fighter piloted by one person with a B-29, which is known as an aerial fortress, it is one against ten; when one aircraft collides with an enemy aircraft carrier or battleship, it is one against a thousand or ten thousand. The magnitude of its effect is unparalleled. If we can move forward with this spirit and defeat the enemy who relies on material resources, it is not difficult. For example, in the fierce battle of Peleliu Island, it has been two months since the enemy has been continuously attacking with several divisions, but they have suffered heavy losses, which is really due to the spirit of collision of our army. My task is to defend the Philippines. In the future, we will certainly achieve great victories, and we will constantly cultivate this spirit to make it even better. Although the Philippines was only a limited island country in the Pacific in the past, it is a large island comparatively speaking, and it has the freedom to turn left and right. I will absolutely inherit the fighting spirit left by my predecessors and use all my strength to defeat the enemy.

Weekly Commentary

### Expectations for the Fourth Year of the Greater East Asia War

The third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War has passed, and we are now entering the fourth year of the war. As we reflect on the third anniversary and begin the fourth year, it seems that we must raise several feelings and experiences as indicators for our efforts in the fourth year.

The first is the feeling and experience of the importance of production warfare outside of the operations on the battlefield. The enemy America intends to overwhelm others with its huge productivity, but our ally Japan, not willing to fall behind, has been catching up rapidly in recent years, striving to increase production with aircraft as the center, and has achieved great results, thereby being able to meet the needs of front-line operations and destroy the stubborn enemy. In order to thoroughly destroy the ambitions of the enemy America, we must make even more special efforts in this regard in the future.

The second is the feeling of the greatness of popular strength, both on the battlefield and in production. The heroic feats and spirit of sacrifice of the Allied soldiers fighting on the front lines and the Japanese expatriates in the Allied war zones are all due to the great display of popular strength. And the rapid surge in military production in Allied Japan is also based on the great popular strength. China should also emulate the Allies in leveraging huge popular strength.

The third is the feeling of the great decisiveness of political operations. The ability of Allied Japan to leverage such popular and material strength is largely due to sound political guidance. Conversely, the reason why many things in China still cannot be perfected and the people's livelihood is difficult is very related to unsound politics. Therefore, improving politics is the key to unleashing China's power.

However, among the above three points, the most basic object we should strive for seems to be still the first point, the enhancement of production. The most important goals of leveraging popular strength and politics are to promote production development, so as to help the Allies contribute to the Greater East Asia War with more economic power. And in reality, the important responsibility that China should and can bear in the Great East Asia War is to provide material resources.

China is rich in resources and abundant in material resources. If we can further develop them and mobilize them more rationally, we believe that it will be of great assistance to the production war in the Greater East Asia War. However, regrettably, we feel that our past efforts have not been enough. Chairman Wang once instructed that this year is the year of production, calling on us to engage in increasing production. In fact, have we completely done it? Looking at recent production, some have not only not increased, but have also shown a trend of decline. We are really too ashamed. Now that the fourth year of the Greater East Asia War has begun, how should we redouble our efforts to make up for the shortcomings of the past few years and fully enhance the production war assistance in the Greater East Asia War?

In the past, we seemed to focus too much on the surface and neglected practice. There were only empty production committees, research meetings, discussion meetings, and representative conferences, etc. Although there were many motions and large plans, most of them were empty and unrealistic, said but not acted, and ultimately ended up on paper. What was really done was too little. In the future, we must be realistic and seek truth from facts, emphasizing practice rather than simply perfunctory on the surface. When formulating plans, we must consider what can be done, and the plans that can be done must be thoroughly implemented.

We had better define the fourth year of the Greater East Asia War as the year of increasing production practice. We should seek a real increase in production. The object of increasing production should naturally be military needs first, but with such poor civil needs now, increasing civil needs production is also an urgent matter. May the Chinese and Japanese authorities pay attention to this together.

### Grand Commemorations Held Across the Country on the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Arousing Public Sentiment to the Utmost

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Yesterday (the 8th) was the day of the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. At this time when the war situation has entered the decisive stage, the arrival of this anniversary is of great and profound significance.

### Minister of Intelligence Kishi Delivers Speech: The Essence of the Greater East Asia War

At the Mass Rally in the Capital

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Kishi, Minister of Intelligence of the Japanese Embassy in China, delivered a speech entitled "The Essence of the Greater East Asia War" at the "Sino-Japanese People's Joint Decisive Battle Rally" on the 9th. The main points are as follows: Japan's determination to complete the Greater East Asia War has been stated in the declaration of war, and the goals that the Greater East Asia War must achieve have also been clearly stated in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. I need not elaborate further. Japan is repelling the ambitions of Britain and America to dominate East Asia and restoring its original appearance, so it resolutely carried out the Meiji Restoration.

The Japanese nation's determination to create the driving force for this Meiji Restoration 80 years ago has been constantly expanding its scale until the Greater East Asia War. The historical and moral forces that the material concepts of Britain and America cannot calculate have repeatedly been in this kind of power, which has formed the main body of Japan's war effort. Among them are the spirit of the Kamikaze Special Attack Force and the spirit of all the soldiers dying on Az Island and Saipan. This spirit is regarded as extremely ordinary by the Japanese, but it is an incomprehensible mystery in the eyes of Britain and America.

What exactly is America's war goal? America's material prosperity is all derived from the exploitation of the East Asian nations. Therefore, once the East Asian nations, with Japan as the forerunner, gain liberation, America's willful enjoyment of material life will be denied. Therefore, no matter what, they want to sacrifice other nations to maintain it. This

American war goal

is also America's war intention. The current war situation in the Leyte Island area is extremely important, but now the Japanese army's encirclement has gradually been completed on that island, and the American army's supply line will be cut off. Furthermore, because Japanese paratroopers forcibly landed and attacked the enemy camp, the enemy army is in a state of isolation and helplessness, and can only surrender or be annihilated. Therefore, today is a great opportunity to destroy the arrogant enemy. We, the Greater East Asian nations, are determined to gather all our strength to complete the war to defend East Asia and liberate East Asia, which is also today. As for Britain, it is almost

Becoming an American vassal

Britain itself knows that its war goal of maintaining its own hegemony cannot be achieved by jointly waging war with the United States. Britain's worries and distress are also here. For example, the Indian issue is the center of its worries. As for the Chongqing side's cry for resistance, what can be expected of it? Assuming that the so-called final victory of the Chongqing side can be obtained, what benefit will the Chinese nation have? The national destinies of China, India, and Japan are fundamentally inseparable. The revival of China can not only arouse India's awareness, but also ensure Japan's development, that is, the defense force of Greater East Asia, is absolutely necessary in the premise and in the conclusion. This is the historical inevitability of Asian nations. Although the Chongqing and Communist parties continue to chant the anti-Japanese national united front, their cooperation and conflict continue to arise, so it is not surprising that their state of confusion as to whether they are cooperating or conflicting is confusing. If we want to say the essence of the Greater East Asia War, it is to

Ask the tiger to give up its teeth

Because thinking that the tiger has teeth is equal to denying the existence of the tiger, it is equal to asking the tiger to give up its teeth. It goes without saying that this matter cannot be successfully achieved merely by compromise or negotiation. Looking at the former, Britain and America have not only exploited India and Malaya, but also want to place China under their control. The latter advocates the Monroe Doctrine to reject other countries' right to speak on the American continent, and on the one hand, it seized the Philippines from Spain, annexed it regardless of the Filipinos' will, and under the name of open door and equal opportunity, it wants to fulfill its ambitions towards China. Therefore, for the dignity and progress of mankind, it is determined to break this irrationality. That is why Japan declared war on Britain and America. It is impossible to say to the tiger with reason or to pour out sincerity, to regard the carnivorous tiger as a herbivore. Therefore, this Greater East Asia War cannot be compromised. Therefore, it is a fundamental way to persevere in the war until the tiger's teeth are cut off, and only in this way can we expect true peace and progress in the world.

### General Mobilization to Defend East Asia - Propaganda Minister Lin Gave Broadcast Speech the Night Before Last

For the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Propaganda Minister Lin gave a broadcast speech entitled "General Mobilization to Defend East Asia" at 10:10 PM on the 8th at the Central Radio Station. The main points are as follows: In the three years of the Greater East Asia War, Allied Japan has been at the front, holding on firmly as the vanguard, wiping out the British and American forces that have occupied Asia for more than a hundred years with a quick knife, and achieving glorious war results. China, Manchuria, Thailand, the Philippines, Burma, India, and other countries in the rear have risen one after another under the banner of striving for the liberation of the East Asian nations, with the determination to cooperate and the belief in victory, mobilizing full-scale manpower and material resources to jointly shoulder the responsibility of completing the war, and have also achieved considerable success. For more than a hundred years, the ambitions of British and American imperialism to dominate the world have been endless. They have actively expanded from East Asia with their military and economic violence. Except for the rejuvenated and self-strengthening Meiji Japan, which has not been poisoned, it can be said that no other weak national country in Asia has been able to avoid it. Especially in China, which has frequent troubles, the claws of aggression have taken advantage of the situation and directly entered.

Opening Up a Road to Strive for Freedom, Chairman Wang had long seen this great crisis, so he tried his best to prevent it before the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred. After the incident occurred, he tried his best to remedy it. Finally, he resolutely opened up a road to Sino-Japanese peace for the country and for East Asia. At the beginning of the peace movement, he clearly said that the peace movement is a process to complete China's independence and autonomy, and it is a political action that does not label itself with any other doctrine. The greatest goal of the peace movement is obviously still to overthrow British and American aggression and seek China's freedom and independence by liberating East Asia. Therefore, the peace movement itself is a re-departure of the national revolution, that is, inheriting the teachings of the national father and putting the route of the national revolution back on the right track, so that it can develop towards a more advanced path.

Inheriting the Legacy and Moving Forward Courageously, now that it has been less than a month since Chairman Wang passed away, it is the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. Today, although we, the people of the whole country, cannot hear Chairman Wang's solemn and sincere instructions, Chairman Wang's constant encouragements to us over the years still remain in our memories. Striving for peace to save China is Chairman Wang's lifelong aspiration, and we must make it a reality. Unification is a prerequisite for peace and national construction, and we must make it complete. The Greater East Asia War is the first step in saving China and protecting East Asia, and we must do our best to strive for victory. It must be known that the Greater East Asia War is a war for all East Asian nations to strive for freedom and liberation, that is, the beginning of the joint construction of a new world in East Asia by East Asians. All of us 100 million nationals in East Asia must make the final and desperate battle against the British and American aggressors with the great determination to share the same joys and sorrows and to live and die together. As long as the British and American forces do not withdraw from our East Asia, we will swear to fight them to the end. Although Chairman Wang has passed away, the lamp of justice has shone with thousands of rays of light among the Asian nations, illuminating a great road for 100 million nations to struggle for survival. Chinese compatriots, comrades in all of Asia, now is the time for the general mobilization of our fighting ranks. Let us join hands and welcome the arrival of great victory.

### Joint Talk of the Central Political Committee and the Executive Yuan

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – In order to strengthen the decisive battle system and increase administrative efficiency, the Central Government held a joint talk of the Central Political Committee and the Executive Yuan at 9:00 AM on the 9th to discuss (1) the presentation and deliberation of legal bills, the adjudication of principles, and the verification of provisions; (2) the decision on orders of great importance that require emergency measures; (3) matters that should be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting according to the powers of the departments; (4) departmental orders issued by the departments themselves according to law; (5) which of the various administrative measures should be carried out by departmental orders, which should be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for approval, and which should be presented to the Central Political Committee or the Supreme National Defense Conference for resolution; and (6) the determination of policies, the formulation of technical plans, and the review of expenses. After two hours of detailed discussion, the results of the talk will be reported separately to the Supreme National Defense Conference and the Executive Yuan meeting for implementation.

### Su Kunyu's Inspection Record of Rice Producing Areas (4)

Five, Rationing Issues

The National Government promulgated the "Provisional Regulations for the Transportation and Sales Management of Rice in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui" on September 27th. After the administrative authorities implemented it, the impact on Shanghai is beyond the scope of this article. As for the impact on cities and villages in Jiangsu Province, what was the result after the inspection? The results are as follows:

In cities, there are two types of rice and grain transportation: restricted and unrestricted. For restricted areas, such as Suzhou and Kunshan, only a small amount of rice is allowed to be carried into the city from the suburbs of Suzhou, causing the rice price in the city to rise to 18,000 yuan per stone.

Kunshan is a major gateway for smuggling in the Suzhou area. Along the mountains near Kunshan County, as far as Qingpu, despite this year's bumper harvest, due to transshipment to Shanghai, Kunshan rice is secretly transported from Qingpu to Shanghai. The smuggling method involves using civilian boats, with rice bags at the bottom, oil paper in the middle, and straw piled on top. As of now, the military has discovered and confiscated a total of 355,470 stones of rice and 17,500 stones of grain. The Kunshan County government has already dispatched security teams and police to form a blockade line near Pengwen Town. At the same time, there are strict restrictions on transporting rice from the countryside to the city. The wealthy in the city have accumulated rice and grain, causing problems. Most of the sufferers are salaried workers and coolies. The black market rice price is soaring, and there is no household rice rationing, making their situation truly pitiful.

Unrestricted areas include Changshu City. The transportation of rice from rural areas to the city is unrestricted and unimpeded. Previously, the rice price in the city once rose to 13,000 yuan per stone. The Rice and Grain Association decided to announce the suspension of trading among members, and the price immediately dropped to about 9,000 yuan per stone. The public was delighted and agreed with this measure. Regarding this point, the reporter group inquired with the relevant authorities, who said: "The situation in the Changshu area is relatively special. Rather than allowing rice to be smuggled and transported north across the Yangtze River, it is better to allow it to be transported into the city. Moreover, the rice stored in the city is still consumed by the people of Changshu."

The restrictions on rice and grain transportation between cities and villages may be necessary measures, and we cannot criticize them. However, during the period of restricting rice and grain transportation, there is no household rice rationing in the city, so what do the city residents eat and how do they survive?

"When will the rationing system be established in cities in Jiangsu Province?" The reporter group asked the provincial government representative this question, and he replied: "Regarding the rationing of rice in the four major cities in the province (Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang), the provincial government is planning it and hopes to realize it in the short term. The rationing agency will contact the Rice Control Association and then order each county to designate rice merchants to handle it."

The reporter group also asked Kunshan County Chief Yang, "Rice and grain transportation has already been restricted. How will the food of the city residents be handled?" County Chief Yang said: "This county is planning to hold a meeting in the coming days to discuss and plan the rice rationing issue."

Regarding rice rationing in cities in Jiangsu Province, the authorities did not seem to have implemented it during the peak of rice procurement, only using "planning" as an answer. In reality, if household rice rationing in the city is not implemented immediately, it will also affect the work of purchasing food rice, as people store food rice, making the procurement work difficult to proceed smoothly.

Regarding rice and grain transportation in rural areas, in some areas, free transportation within the same area is allowed, while in others, strict and complete transportation restrictions are implemented. For example, Changshu's second district implements the latter method. However, there are non-rice producing areas nearby. Farmers in cotton growing areas produce very little rice, which is insufficient for consumption. The cotton produced is handed over at a fixed price, and the rice consumed needs to be purchased at black market prices, making the farmers' lives problematic.

Regarding the issue of rice for farmers in cotton growing areas, the Cotton Control Association, Flour Control Association, Oil and Grain Control Association, and Rice Control Association should jointly be responsible for solving it. Among them, the Cotton Control Association, when purchasing cotton, relies on the farmers in the cotton growing areas. After the purchase is completed, the farmers are abandoned and no longer cared for. This attitude needs to be corrected. In reality, the above four control associations for cotton, flour, oil, and rice each operate administratively and do not establish connections. It is hoped that a unified institution can be established between the work of the four control associations to jointly be responsible for protecting farmers and implementing a policy of valuing agriculture.

Regarding the rationing of materials, in Jiangsu Province, only cooperatives slightly engage in rationing. Other institutions do not make efforts to implement it. It is hoped that the authorities can pay close attention to this issue, as it is related to people's livelihood and is extremely important.

Six, Cooperative Issues

The cooperative has achieved the most remarkable results in the work of procuring rice and grain because it regularly rations materials in rural areas, and farmers have confidence in it. Regarding the situation of cooperatives assisting the Rice Control Association in procuring rice and grain, a general idea can be gleaned from Suzhou and Kunshan:

Cooperatives in the Suzhou area directly interact with farmers. From the head office to the county branches to the district sub-branches, passing through the stages of the Bao, they are combined into mutual aid societies. The mutual aid societies serve as units to enable farmers to understand the true meaning of cooperation and simultaneously carry out procurement and production increase work.

The area in which the cooperative is responsible for procuring rice and grain is the area in which the cooperative handles rural loans, fertilizers, and other rations. As a result, farmers enthusiastically take out rice and grain. For example, the Wujiang District Cooperative handles the procurement of rice and grain in four designated villages. Three other nearby villages also requested to be procurement areas for the cooperative because the cooperative offers fair prices and never profits from it. (To be continued)

### The Capital of Hungary Clearly Hears the Sound of Cannons. The War Will Soon Reach its Peak

Central News Agency, Budapest, 9th - Huitong News: The sound of cannons can be heard very clearly in Budapest. Traffic in the city is frequent, and troops and Arrow Cross gangs often pass through the streets.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 9th - Huitong News: The major reason for the Soviet army's major offensive on Budapest on the west bank of the Danube is the northward advance of the German army in the Balkans. The German army in western Serbia is also advancing north at the same time, so the Soviet army's flanks are under considerable threat. The Soviet army between Lake Platten and the Danube has suffered heavy losses but has made no progress. The Soviet army attacking south from Seiler Island has also failed to break through. The situation near Hartwen remains unchanged. The Soviet tank convoy that advanced to the Danube via Qilak suddenly attacked Budapest to the south but has been blocked, and its rear transportation has also been cut off. Judging from various phenomena, the battle of Budapest may soon reach its peak.

### Order from the Economic Security Office: All Industries Must Strictly Abide by Price Limits. Director Goto's Speech Hopes for Cooperation from All Industries

The Economic Security Office of the Municipal Police Department held a symposium at the Police Club of the bureau at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, convening more than 50 chairmen of trade associations from various industries. It was presided over by Director Shigeru Goto, with Deputy Director Heiji Nomura, Head of the First Section Zhihai Dou, Fear of the Second Section Futian, Deputy Section Chief Guangchen Yang, and Commander of the Economic Police Corps Yamamoto all in attendance.

Illegal Operations Will Be Cracked Down On

First, Director Goto gave a report, stating: "This office is responsible for implementing and cracking down on the economic policies of the municipal government, the Economic Bureau, and the economic policies of the Japanese Embassy. The current economic problems in Shanghai are quite serious and concern the entire livelihood of the people, so the authorities and all sectors are very concerned. There are many reasons for the current economic situation, but some people who have authority over wartime economic policies have not yet recognized it clearly. Originally, the Shanghai market in the past was free and not subject to any restrictions. Merchants hope that prices will rise because the more they rise, the more profitable they are. However, in wartime economic policies, the overall livelihood of the people must be taken into account, and no excessive profits should be sought, and actions that violate economic policies should not be taken. I believe that none of you here have a profit-seeking concept, and if there are any, I hope they will be thoroughly corrected. In order to thoroughly suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood, the police authorities will severely crack down on irregular and profit-seeking illegal operations. I also hope that you will assist the authorities under the same goal, supervise the employees, factories, companies, and firms of each association, abide by economic policies, and do everything possible to suppress prices. Since the establishment of this office, in a few months, many factories, shops, and firms have been cracked down on and severely punished. This is because the industry associations have not had sufficient communication and cooperation with this office. However, I do not want to have this measure. When it is unavoidable, only police force will be used to punish illegal merchants. The power of this office is limited, and it is very difficult to handle various economic policies. Therefore, I hope that you will report and crack down on the improper behavior and irregular operations of members, so that the task of this office can also be completed."

Severe Legal Action Will Be Taken for Exceeding Price Limits

Then, Deputy Director Heiji Yamaguchi gave a speech, stating: "In the past, communication between this office and the industry associations was not close, and we could not fully understand each other. Under the current economic situation, we hope that you will cooperate in areas where this office cannot handle. Recently, it has been found that member stores and firms of various associations have applied to the authorities to increase price limits without approval, and the association authorities have tacitly approved members to increase prices without authorization, which is illegal. If the original price limit is already unreasonable, the members cannot be allowed to raise prices without authorization. They must apply to the authorities for approval before they can increase the selling price, otherwise they will be punished according to law. The association authorities should supervise the members to strictly abide by the price limits and abide by the political policies of the authorities. This office will strictly investigate and crack down on daily necessities, miscellaneous grains, and other items that seek excessive profits and are harmful to people's livelihood. At the same time, this office is actively investigating warehouses to look for illegal merchants or non-industry people who are hoarding. We hope that you will cooperate in reporting them. Regarding improper behavior of the staff of this office, please report it without hesitation, and we will investigate it with appropriate methods." Then, Team Leader Yamamoto gave a speech, elaborating on the tasks of the economic police in detail, and in order to thoroughly crack down on bad elements who falsely impersonate merchants and deceive them, he hoped that people would report them. Furthermore, Section Chief Futian stated that in the past, the punishment for illegal merchants was only fines and confiscation of items, which did not seem to be a concern for the general merchants. Therefore, in the future, illegal merchants must be sent to the prosecutor's office to be severely punished by judicial measures. Finally, each director of each association provided opinions, and Section Chief Yang and Section Chief Dou answered and received them one by one.

### Broadcast Speech by Chairman Bose of India in China: Building a New Asia Requires Sino-Japanese Cooperation. The US Uses the Chongqing Side as a Tool Against Japan

Some time ago, I was in Tokyo and broadcasted to you at the request of Tokyo Radio. Today, I am again addressing you in China, and I will briefly repeat the main points of the previous broadcast. My first impression after arriving in the accountable country was the death of Chairman Wang of your country.

Deeply Mournful. I am well aware of how our enemies and some Chinese people judge the late Chairman, but no one can deny three important facts about Mr. Wang. First, Mr. Wang was a loyal follower and comrade of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Second, Mr. Wang dedicated his life to the Chinese nation and people. Third, when Mr. Wang was driven by his conscience and separated from his colleagues, he had a very firm will and self-sacrifice. Our enemies often apply the terms traitor and puppet to their enemies, Mr. Wang, President Lerolle, Bamo, and myself. All of them are given this title, but if the above-mentioned people are selfish and self-interested, they can only withdraw from the world and not ask about world affairs, or follow the trend in order to seek their comfort and security. The reason why they have risen up and disregarded difficulties is nothing more than being driven by the spirit of the highest responsibility and lofty ideals. Based on their experience, they no longer believe in Western European imperialism, especially the United States and Britain, and only Japan can help others. As for the Soviet Union, it cannot provide any assistance to the weak Asian nations, so these leaders have to accept Japan's friendship and cooperation. Some Chinese people may say that this policy of cooperation with Japan may be suitable for countries such as India, Myanmar, and the Philippines, but China should still take resistance against Japan as a

Appropriate Policy. Therefore, I would like to point out the following points: (1) The establishment of a new Asia cannot be without China. Without China's cooperation, any policy that is beneficial to Asia cannot be realized. China must not regard the needs of Asia as nothing. (2) Asia cannot be without Japan's cooperation. If there is no Japan, are there any other countries in Asia that can resist Western imperialist countries? Although China's potential is great, it cannot bear the heavy responsibility of liberating Asia before it is unified, industrialized, and recognized. As it stands, Asia cannot be reborn without Japan's assistance. The strength of Western imperialists lies in their navy, and only Japan in Asia possesses a first-class navy. If we want to resist the aggression of Britain and the United States, we must have the assistance of a first-class navy. (3) Even if Britain and the United States express friendship to the Chongqing side today, it is not out of deep love for the Chongqing side or China, but because they hate Japan. The United States' toleration of the Communist Party is also out of the same motivation. General Chiang Kai-shek should understand this point. The United States, from the standpoint of its own interests, originally opposed communism, but in order to try to destroy Japan, it is prepared to tolerate communism and encourage the Chinese Communist Party. (4) Since Britain and the United States sympathize with the Chongqing regime and the Chinese Communist Party for their own interests, they will naturally demand the full price of the sympathy and assistance they give. If General Chiang Kai-shek is a politician, he should eliminate hatred and prejudice and

Face the Facts. We all know China's old grievances against Japan, so before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, India also sympathized with the Chongqing side, because at that time, it recognized the Chongqing side as the representative and spokesperson of China. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the entire situation has undergone drastic changes, and the attitude and policies of the Japanese government, army, and people have also changed greatly. If I were not convinced of this point, I would not dare to talk about the China problem. Asia cannot be without China, nor can it be without Japan, so all Asian countries want to see China and Japan conclude a glorious treaty.

### News from the News Aid Society: Special Solicitation of Aid Funds. Deeply Hoping That All Sectors Will Promote It Quickly

This newspaper has been raising funds for the 8th Aid Fund since the 1st of this month, launching a "Special Solicitation Team" with a target of 1,000 teams, each with at least 20,000 yuan, limited to one month. We have been making urgent appeals to people from all walks of life for days. As of today, it has been the 10th day, but the response has not been enthusiastic, and the number of people recognizing teams and donating funds is far from our expected goal. We believe that influential people in the community will not stand by and watch, allowing more than 4,000 outstanding and poor students to lose their education, and causing the country and society to suffer great losses. Judging from the current trend of donations, it has already made us extremely anxious and worried. What is anxious is that the solicitation period is urgent, and we are deeply afraid that the donations will not easily reach the target. What is worrying is that the funds raised do not match the budget, and we are deeply afraid that more than 4,000 poor students will have no tuition fees for the next semester, which will lead to the interruption of their studies. In summary, we are purely considering the interests of the country and society, and we believe that wise and influential readers will definitely sympathize and support us. However, sympathy and support are not just words, but actions.

This newspaper has already printed various printed materials. One is the "Team Recognition and Payment Notice." Those who recognize teams only need to fill it out and submit it, and someone will be sent to the designated location to collect the funds with a formal receipt. The other is the "Collective Donation Signing Form," which can be initiated by one person and gather several people to raise enough for a team, which is a method of turning small amounts into large amounts. People from all walks of life who are interested in helping students can collect them from the business department of this newspaper.

Lang Jingshan's Photography Exhibition Opens Today: Photographer Lang Jingshan and his wife, Ms. Lei Peizhi, will exhibit their photography and Chinese painting works at the Dazhong Art Gallery. It will open at 9:00 AM this morning for a period of ten days. All proceeds from the charity sale of the works will be donated to the News and this Newspaper's Aid Fund. The Lang couple's works have a long-standing reputation in the art world, and they are also charity sales to help students, which should be praised by people in the community. Its grand occasion can be predicted.

The Literary Exhibition Achieves Excellent Results: The Shanghai Industrial Bank and Xinghua Industrial Company held a literary exhibition by colleagues in response to this newspaper's "Special Solicitation" for the Aid Fund. The venue is the China Bookstore. In recent days, people from all walks of life have been enthusiastically visiting and ordering works. The exhibition displays calligraphy, paintings, and photography by ten famous artists, all of which are wonderful. Today and tomorrow are the last two days. We hope that people who are enthusiastic about helping students will give their support, so that they can enjoy the name of helping students and obtain valuable works, truly killing two birds with one stone.

Birthday of Mr. Xue Zhulin Kanghou: Exhibition of Oracle Bone Script to Be Held at the China Art Museum Starting Today

In the past forty years, oracle bone script has been transformed from antiques in the hands of antique dealers into international academic reference materials. However, due to the frequent wars, the discovery and collection of oracle bones have become increasingly rare, and it is not easy to preserve and store them. In addition, this object is a precious product of our country's civilization. Today, we are pleased to celebrate Mr. Lin Kanghou's 69th birthday, which allows us to publicly display them so that we can quickly see the handwriting of our ancient ancestors. This is a rhyme and a grand event, and also a thousand-year-old story. The oracle bones exhibited this time are the last batch of unearthed objects before the war, and they are also one of the most refined parts of the unearthed objects in the past, and have not yet been recorded. The characters in this article are all related to the system of the Shang Dynasty, which is very interesting for research. The exhibition will be held from today to the 15th at the China Art Museum, 996 Jing'an Temple Road, Majestic Building.

### Memoirs of the Kamikaze Attack Corps

The Allied powers’ Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Corps, with their spirit of human bullets and courageous devotion to duty, have created unprecedented and great war results, causing the enemy to lose their nerve. Salt Field Captain of the Allied powers’ stationed-in-China Sports Team, in order to make the general public understand the words and deeds of the "Kamikaze" corps, has made the following introduction with detailed explanations.

The "Kamikaze Special Attack Corps," initiated by Captain Seki and four other warriors, also known as the "Sure Death Squad," is a human bullet attack corps from which there is no return. Today, the "Kamikaze" has become a whirlwind covering the South Sea, with the determination to not stop until the enemy is destroyed. Generous devotion to duty is rare both in ancient and modern times. To be able to calmly deal with matters and die peacefully is not something ordinary people can easily do. However, in the minds of the young warriors of the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps, aged twenty-odd, there is no such thing as glory or wealth, and they even forget themselves, only knowing to sacrifice themselves for the sovereign and the country, and die with a smile. The mental state of these warriors is often indifferent, so once they are launched, they are like thunder. This kind of sure-death attack is indeed a manifestation of the glorious tradition of the Japanese Navy, and it proclaims its military prowess at home and abroad without regret.

The Kamikaze Special Attack Corps includes the following teams (limited to those whose names have appeared on the battlefield):

Shikishima, Yamato, Asahi, Yamazakura, Kikusui (First Special Attack Corps)

Chuyu, Giretsu, Junchu, Shisei, Seichu (Second Special Attack Corps)

Tenpei, Meika, Sakon (Those after the Second Special Attack Corps)

The following are excerpts from the instructions of the Commander-in-Chief and Commanders, as well as the words and deeds of the warriors, to give a glimpse of the spirit of the Kamikaze.

Commander's Instructions: "The rise and fall of the nation depends on this moment. The victory of this decisive battle in the Pacific depends on your shoulders. May you, with your human bullets, stir up the Kamikaze! For the sake of His Majesty the Emperor and our motherland, this Commander-in-Chief is willing to receive your lives. Your only regret, I think, is not being able to know the results of the battle. However, the escort aircraft of the direct cover team will carefully observe your battles and report to the Chief. The Chief will also report to His Majesty the Emperor and inform your spirits of the results of the battle. Therefore, you do not need to have any regrets. Please strive for it!" (Instructions from Commander-in-Chief So-and-so Lieutenant General to the First Special Attack Corps)

"...The manifestation of the supreme sacrificial spirit is the true essence of the divine country's divine soldiers. You will be its incarnation and become the most divine of the divine soldiers. Go forth, my comrades! Be sure to achieve your goals! Your loyalty and bravery for the country, your righteousness, pure loyalty, and sincerity are unparalleled. The great achievements you establish will surely move His Majesty the Emperor. Your parents, whether they are still in this world or not, will surely be sincerely gratified. One hundred million people will also be excited and grateful. This is what this officer deeply expects of you." (Instructions from Commander So-and-so to the Second Special Attack Corps)

"Divine spirits are to be respected but not to be sought. Stirring up the Kamikaze depends on your own struggles!" (Instructions from Commander So-and-so)

"Come on, everyone, let's shake hands!"..."Although great battle results have been established one after another, the enemy is still coming! I rely on you a lot! That's what I want to say." (Words of Commander So-and-so when shaking hands with members of the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps to say goodbye)

"Now, the young members are all divine spirits! I've thought so for a long time." (Words of Commander So-and-so when receiving the first report)

"The target of attack is the enemy's aircraft carrier. When ramming, you must choose the weak point of the aircraft carrier." (Instructions from a Deputy Commander before departure)

Brave Warriors' Statements: "We are not the field team, we are bombs! Okay, follow me!" (Slogan of Captain Seki)

"The rise and fall of the Empire depends on this battle. From this moment on, I will set out to carry out the honorable mission of sacrificing myself to attack the enemy's aircraft carrier." (Middle report of So-and-so Captain of the Second Special Attack Corps)

"If everyone thinks they are going to die and doesn't pay attention to enemy fighters, that's not right. We must preserve our lives before entering the enemy's mobile force. Dying without reaching the enemy ship is a futile death. Watch out for enemy fighters! Maintain strict vigilance!" (Words of So-and-so Captain warning his subordinates)

"It is very difficult to achieve the greatest effect and be able to survive. It is especially difficult for us ordinary people. However, our mission is simply to accompany the bomb, which has no living eyes, until it correctly hits the enemy ship. Therefore, as long as you are a pilot, anyone can do it." (Remarks made by So-and-so Captain just before the attack)

"It would be terrible if I went in dirty clothes and was hated by King Yama in hell and driven back..." (Remarks made by a warrior when changing into new flight clothes)

"Tonight, let's bring big sausages as souvenirs and attend the enemy's party."

"At that time, if you say good evening and don't go in, the enemy will say that Japanese pilots are guys who don't understand etiquette!" (Jokes between warriors)

"Hey, please record my last moments well!" (Words of a Kamikaze corps member smiling and patting a comrade from the direct cover team)

"They sweetly ate rice balls wrapped in bamboo leaves and daily field dishes, without thinking that this was the last supper. After the meal, each person wrote their name and the word 'product' on the bag containing their scattered personal belongings...They gathered in front of the command post and then wrote their farewell words in front of the commander, wrapping their heads in headbands. Those who didn't have cloth asked the infirmary for some to bring out as headbands." (Remarks from So-and-so large shooter at the farewell)

"Even if this body is sacrificed in the South Sea, my soul will still linger on the spring of my youth." (Waka of Yonezaki Flight Petty Officer of the Shikishima Team)

"Without caring for one's body, knowing the task is heavy, wholeheartedly destroying the enemy's body." (Shown to comrades by Taniichi Flight Petty Officer of the Shikishima Team on the day of departure)

"This body would rather perish with the aircraft, vowing not to rest until the enemy ship is sunk." (Same as above)

"Don't be in a hurry, the opportunity will come!" (Remarks made by Commander So-and-so because there were too many volunteers to join the Kamikaze corps)

"It's really annoying not to become a Kamikaze corps member! Because the enemy's rampant behavior is too unbearable." (Words of a warrior who was not assigned to the Kamikaze corps)

Explanation by Captain Shiota: (1) When Marshal Togo of Japan was the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, he wrote the words "Kamikaze" with the meaning of "divine blessing and assistance." Therefore, the word "Kamikaze" has long been imprinted in the beliefs of the Japanese people. The Japanese people and the Japanese Army and Navy have extreme faith in Marshal Togo, honoring him as a "sacred general."

(2) The instructions of the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet to the members of the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps and the words and deeds of the warriors in the above text fully express the spirit of the Japanese Navy. According to the Japanese Kamikaze spirit, it has existed since ancient times. For example, before the Kamakura Shogunate era, there was a battle between the "Minamoto" and "Taira" armies. The famous general Saito of the "Minamoto" army, who was nearly seventy years old, feared that the enemy would see his white hair and withered appearance and not engage in battle with him. Therefore, he specially dyed his hair, dressed up, and set off after wearing the clothes of a young man. This kind of spirit is indeed an original Japanese spirit.

(3) Regarding the naming of the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps, "Shikishima" and "Yamato" both represent Japan, "Asahi" represents the sun, and "Yamazakura" is a cherry blossom. Cherry blossoms bloom fully when they bloom and wither completely when they wither, representing purity, unity, and revitalization. "Kikusui" is a chrysanthemum, and chrysanthemums represent the imperial flower of Japan. Previously, during the Northern and Southern Dynasties of Japan, the imperial power was weak, and the counties and states were unruly. At that time, there was Masashige Kusunoki, who, seeing the situation, bravely overthrew the counties and presented the Kikusui flag to the Japanese Emperor. Later, the county soldiers rose up again. At this time, Kusunoki had already died, and his son inherited his will and pacified the county rebellion, also presenting the Kikusui flag. As for "Chuyu," "Giretsu," "Junchu," "Shisei," and "Seichu," they are all named in honor of loyalty to the Emperor. Also, "Tenpei" means the Emperor's soldiers, "Sakura" is a flower respected by Japan, and "Sakon" is a flower near the Imperial Palace, all containing the meaning of respecting the Imperial Family.

### Repairing the Millstone

— Shi Ting

The millstone heart suddenly fell off. After fixing it with fish glue, it became loose again after shaking it a few times. The owner said to me:

"Keep an eye out for a millstone repairman. Call him in to fix it!"

My boss is a Ningbo woman, good looking but greedy. She calculates everything carefully, afraid of losing out and wanting to take advantage of others. I've worked for her for two years, and I've only just learned some of her shrewdness - when dispensing water, the tap is turned on very little, and it takes a long time to fill a pot. At night, she brings the coal briquettes into the room to prevent tenants from stealing them, etc. This is also a rare thing for her. In the past, she would change a servant almost every three months, and it was often an "unhappy breakup." When she eats a good meal, she doesn't allow the rice bucket to be taken to the kitchen. The servant has to go inside to get a bowl at a time. Think about it, this is really embarrassing. She sits next to the rice bucket, and you've filled the bowl three times, but you've only filled a corner of your stomach. You're embarrassed to fill it again. She uses this method to limit the amount of rice the servants eat. We who do physical labor can't succeed if we don't eat enough. We often steal food after meals, and naturally, she finds out, and immediately there's a quarrel. Then, we shoulder our bedding and scram, which is the biggest reason why she often changes servants. She often changes servants because of crimes such as using coal briquettes sparingly or putting men's tops and women's trousers in the same bucket when washing clothes. When it was my turn to work at her house, I ate miscellaneous foods such as third-grade flour and corn flour. The restriction on eating was lifted. I don't like changing bosses. All the crows in the world are black, all the same. As long as there is food to eat, that's fine. When I'm free, she calls me to watch the children, grind wheat, and corn flour, which I don't object to. Therefore, I've been able to work for more than a year. She's been dissatisfied with me only recently.

Let me tell you, one day, I brought an old man back from the street. He was dressed in rags, carrying a cloth bag, and walked with a dragging of broken shoes, not very energetic. I thought, this old man hasn't had anyone patronize his business for a long time.

"Can you repair millstones?" I asked doubtfully.

"If I couldn't repair millstones, why would you call me here?" What a stubborn old man!

I led him into the room and carried out the millstone. He tapped the millstone heart and asked;

"Is it a 'hidden millstone'? The grain won't come out!"

I said, "It takes a lot of effort to grind!"

"Who said 'hidden millstone'!" The owner glared at me. "How much does it cost to fix the millstone heart? Tell me."

"'Hidden' or not, it's none of my business." The old man said, sizing it up, "How much did you buy this millstone for?"

"A hundred yuan!"

"Then, let's make it a hundred yuan!"

The owner jumped up, complaining that the labor cost was too expensive, but the millstone repairman wouldn't do it for less. He shouldered his cloth bag and was about to leave when the owner stopped him again.

"Then forge it again, how much in total?"

"Two hundred yuan!" The old man said, "To be honest, it's useless to fix the millstone heart without forging this millstone."

The old man advised the owner to forge the millstone, but the owner suspected him, afraid that he would take advantage. So she still wanted him to just fix the millstone heart.

"Sixty yuan is enough!" she said. "It cost a hundred yuan to buy, it costs sixty yuan to fix the millstone heart!"

"Your mother is a … How much does fish glue cost at a time? Ten yuan is probably not enough, right? However, it will fall off before grinding a millstone head. This millstone of yours is like renting it." He walked to the door and turned back, "Ninety yuan, how about that?"

"Eighty yuan! Quick and easy!" the owner said. The old man agreed, carried the millstone out of the back door, and started working with his hammer and chisel.

"Seventy yuan, seventy yuan, how about that?" the owner suddenly interrupted him.

"We've already agreed, and you're changing your mind again!" The old man threw down the hammer. "Go ask A'gen, who sells rice cakes, eighty yuan won't make you lose out."

The owner really went to ask A'gen. The old man grumbled and continued working.

"I've never seen such a suspicious person!" he said.

"You don't know, she's a pain when she buys vegetables!" After haggling over the price and weighing it, she either complains that the vegetables aren't good or asks the seller to add two more handfuls. The vegetable seller refuses, annoyed by her fussiness, and simply tells her not to buy it. But she's reluctant. Several times I've seen her arguing with people!"

The owner came back. She said to the old man, "Do a good job. Forge it well. It won't do if it still takes a lot of effort to grind after spending so much money."

The old man asked in surprise, "Did you say you wanted to forge it? I've been advising you for a long time."

"Huh! As soon as you came, I told you to fix the millstone heart, forge it." the owner said shrilly, "Are you deaf, old man? Didn't we agree on eighty yuan to fix the millstone heart and forge the millstone?"

"You vile whore!" the old man cursed, "Eighty yuan to fix the millstone heart and forge the millstone? I've eaten two hundred thousand yuan worth of rice without anything to do! Heaven is above, are you afraid of being struck by lightning!"

"Rice cake stall owner, you be the judge!" the owner said "My millstone is a 'hidden millstone'. If I don't ask him to forge it, is it useful just to fix the millstone heart?"

The stall owner smiled and said nothing.

The old man cursed, repeating the details just now to the stall owner, then turned to the owner:

"If you have the guts, kneel down and swear together. Whichever one of us is lying and has no conscience, may that one die tonight!"

"You old thief!" the owner trembled with anger, "You're still lying after living to such an old age. I asked A'gen, it costs eighty yuan to fix the millstone heart. Do you think I'm stupid? ... If you don't want to do it, you can leave!" She pulled the millstone inside.

"Tell me to leave? How convenient." The old man suddenly pulled the millstone out: "My efforts are wasted!"

The old man赖蒲 wouldn't leave and wanted to call the police.

"I'll give you ten yuan!" The owner gave him money, telling me to carry the millstone in.

At first, the millstone repairman refused to stop and wouldn't let me carry it in. Later, the stall owner gave him face, and he finally said,

"If it weren't for the stall owner's face, I would have had to call the police." So he packed up, dragging his broken shoes away.

I carried the millstone in, and the owner suddenly started crying and scolding me.

"It's all your fault. You brought such a thief to bully me. Get out!" Since she wasted ten yuan, she

"Blame yourself! Who told you to be so suspicious? We agreed on eighty yuan to fix the millstone heart. You wanted to bully the old man. You're shameless!" I scolded angrily. I knew she had long intended to fire me.

"You...you dare to scold me?" she stamped her feet "Heaven and earth bear witness, as soon as he came, I told him to forge the millstone, fix the millstone heart, eighty yuan just to fix the millstone heart, am I that stupid?"

I ignored her and shouldered my bedding and left that night.

### The Coming of Light

— Jiang Jutao

England! America!

These transmogrified demons

-- Blue-eyed, blond-haired.

Before the war,

They assumed the posture of "powerful nations,"

arrogant and striding;

Oppressing us.

"Dogs and Chinese Not Allowed"

Beside the racecourse,

This shameful bronze plaque,

needle pricks—

The hearts of each and every one of us;

Endure, bear the humiliation…

-- The Incident of December Eighth erupted!

Driving them out

Ten thousand li away,

Yellow races avenged

--Repaid the debt;

Demons and monsters flee in the faint light

Darkness will be gone,

Will light be far away?

### Commemorating the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Two Poems Composed to Celebrate Victory

— Chen Quan

The grandeur competes in praising the wind of the great king.
A wave of cheers rises in East Asia.
Loving peace is only for sages.
Supporting the weak is the mark of a hero.
Ten years of hegemony over Vietnam by the Owls and Yi people.
Three years to destroy Qin by the imperial descendants.
Hundreds of millions of people are all watching.
The Rising Sun shines on the red sea and sky.

Victory depends only on firm belief.
Vowing to continue the struggle of our predecessors.
Surely we know the day when the White Emperor hides.
Is the year when the Yellow Dragon drinks to his heart's content.
Within the seas, everyone sings of a true paradise.
East Asia newly opens a free sky.
Peace and happiness are not easy to come by.
Ten thousand li of mountains and rivers are stained with the blood of war.

### Shen Bao Cup Basketball League: Discussing the Zhongbei vs. Hualian Match; Group B Repechage to Begin... Adding Women's Championship

Following the Zhongbei victory over Hualian in the Shen Bao Cup Basketball League Group A on the 4th (Monday), the two teams now have equal points. Apart from the rematch, all other matches have been completed. Each match was extremely smooth, worthy of praise! The six sections of Group B have also concluded successfully, with champions determined for each section. Let's first discuss the Zhongbei vs. Hualian match.

The Zhongbei vs. Hualian Showdown Yielded Satisfactory Results

Due to the attractiveness of the Zhongbei vs. Hualian match, and to maintain order and support the scholarship fund, this newspaper temporarily increased ticket prices. Enthusiastic fans, wanting to appreciate the skills and willingly accept the outcome, competed to attend, creating an unprecedented lively scene. Moreover, good order was maintained throughout, which is the greatest achievement. Both teams strived to display their skills during the match, taking it seriously and exhibiting clear and admirable movements without any violent behavior. They showed absolute obedience to the referee, adding much color to the league. This newspaper feels boundless excitement and satisfaction.

Zhongbei's Sudden Change in Strategy Frustrated Hualian

Given the brilliance of this match, the writer will tirelessly discuss the key to the victory of both teams again, with the aim of fostering further improvement when they meet again in future matches.

Zhongbei adopted the same lineup as described in the previous article. On one hand, they took advantage of their height for passing and stealing the ball. On the other hand, they spared no effort in making arrangements against the pivot player. For example, Zhao Yalin was assigned to closely guard Kong Guangyi, which was a brilliant move. Kong was a key contributor to Hualian's scores, while Zhao was not expected to score points himself. Therefore, Zhao spared no effort in restraining Kong from shooting, achieving twice the result with half the effort. Zhongbei's sudden switch to an absolute man-to-man defense was initially unexpected. Observing Zhongbei's previous matches, they often appeared to lack endurance, even their five-man zone defense seemed exceptionally lax. Therefore, at the beginning of the match, the tight man-to-man marking led many to believe that they would not be able to maintain it to the end. Who would have thought that the players would become braver and braver as the game progressed, completely changing their demeanor until the end, combined with their agile shots and superb skills, they deserved to win. Judging by individual performances, everyone contributed more than they made mistakes, it's not that they are being praised after the victory. Li Zhenzhong not only guarded Bo Tuo, but also repeatedly sought opportunities to attack, which is commendable. The contest between Li Baozhong and Xian Lun was also extremely intense. Chen Xuesui's disappointment with his low score is a misunderstanding. Xuesui's goal was to contain Wu Chengzhang. Wu is the soul of Hualian's ball acquisition, and restricting his opportunities to get the ball is Xuesui's success. Shen Yugong seemed slightly lax on Qu Xilin, but conversely, Xilin was also relatively loose. Therefore, both Shen and Qu scored many points. Yugong's wonderful shooting should also be listed as a contribution. Zhao Yalin's tight marking of Kong Guangyi was a masterpiece.

Hualian's lineup was also as described in the previous article. However, their tactical failure cannot be concealed. The main reason is that they did not expect Zhongbei to adopt a man-to-man defense, so they were constantly pressed. Although they temporarily discussed changing methods, the application was not yet skillful, failing to achieve remarkable results. When they meet again, they should seek countermeasures in all aspects of tactics and conduct appropriate training. With Hualian's past spirit, there is still great hope. It is believed that breaking man-to-man defense requires extremely agile and skilled screening techniques to succeed. It was mentioned in an article during the previous Western Youth League competition that Hualian utilized screening techniques too little. To this day, this remains true. Furthermore, the substitutions in the second half of the day were correct, but the focus was wrong. Replacing Zhang Xianlun with Fan Qinggong and Kong Guangyi with Zhang Liangxiong was intended to allow Fan and Zhang to both make long shots, hoping to save the situation. However, having Fan guard Zhao Yalin and Zhang guard Chen Xuesui, aiming to confuse the opponent's targets, was indeed reasonable. However, Zhao was ultimately a sacrificial player, so wouldn't that also be sacrificing Fan? When Xuesui is attacking more often, how can Liangxiong have the opportunity to shoot from afar? Does Hualian agree?

Re-match Today: Various Sectors Request a Three-Game Series

The date of the rematch between the two teams is of great interest to all parties. It is scheduled to be decided and announced today at the League Committee meeting. Furthermore, many parties have submitted letters requesting that the rematch adopt a best-of-three series format, hoping to see two more good games. Their reason is to seek a fair competition to determine the skill level, so that both sides have no chance of luck and no grounds for complaint. If ticket revenue increases, underprivileged students will benefit even more. What will actually happen depends on the final decision of today's committee.

Group B's Six Section Champions Repechage Date to be Set Separately

(Group B Section 1) Renyu, having defeated strong rivals Jingsheng, not only seized the section championship but also has hopes of vying for the overall championship. Most of its members have represented Group A, making them superior.

(Group B Section 2) With the withdrawal of Dahua, the Pang team secured the top spot, with its members feeling elated and ambitious. Their old partner Dong Yangfeng, who recently came to Shanghai from West Lake, is rumored to be staying for a while, which deserves our attention.

(Group B Section 3) With Liu Hesheng's earnest teaching, Qingxie's skills are improving daily. The team members are all young and motivated, having won the section crown, they will strive for further advancement in the repechage.

(Group B Section 4) The Shan team's young players inherited the style of Group A, known for their fast attacks. Their victory over Moore in Section 4 demonstrated their strength. We can wait and see what they will achieve in the future.

(Group B Section 5) Morning Friends Blue has won all five games, all very smoothly. Judging by their results, they don't seem to be top-notch, but their players have ample experience and many strategies, so they are not a team to be taken lightly.

(Group B Section 6) The Zhongbei team also has the same style as Group A. They seem to lack strength, but they always have clever moves in tense matches. Is this really the Zhongbei style? They beat Lingyou the other day, and the players all put in effort. Their performance in the subsequent repechage will determine their success or failure.

As for the schedule of the Group B repechage, it will be announced soon.

Women's Registration Begins: Hoping for Enthusiastic Participation

During the Group B repechage, the league will insert a women's group, both to increase interest and to promote women's sports. Registration has now begun and will close on December 12th. It is hoped that all female teams will enthusiastically participate to support the event. It is fortunate that teams such as Green, Sanxing, Peimin, and Chongde are all preparing, and should be able to join and showcase their skills as scheduled. Furthermore, Shanghai Girls' High School has always strongly promoted physical education, and its volleyball team has achieved outstanding results. They should be able to muster their forces this time. Among the talents, there are veterans such as Zhang Jiafan, Cheng Hongsheng, and Zhu Shifang with rich experience, and rising stars such as Zhang Minyu and Weng Hanqing with athletic talent. If they have this good opportunity, they should not easily miss it.

### Essentials of Basketball Theory (6)

— Liang Zhao'an

(C) Shooting

Shooting is the ultimate goal in a team competition, so every player must be proficient in it. If a team's shooting skills are poor, it cannot adopt an offensive strategy in the competition, but can only resort to defense, hoping that the opponent scores less, and cannot hope for victory. The reasoning is clear. Conversely, if a team's shooting skills are excellent, the entire team's confidence will be firm, their spirits will be high, and their momentum will be strong. They can launch rapid attacks and shoot at any time, and their chances of winning will be superior.

To shoot accurately, one must be accurate in judging distance, speed of movement, direction and angle, and height of the shot, as well as having accurate judgment. Distance and direction must be carefully considered and cannot have the slightest error. As for the height of the shot, it can vary. Some are accustomed to using high-arcing shots, while others are accustomed to using lower-arcing shots. But regardless of the height of the arc, every shot must be higher than the hoop. If a player is accustomed to a certain height of shooting, even if this height does not conform to correct theory, the instructor should only see if this type of shot is mostly successful, and not force them to change it, otherwise it will only make them less accurate. If a player often makes the mistake of shooting too far or too short, it is clearly due to weak judgment, and it should be corrected immediately, making them practice more during peacetime, correcting their mistakes, and checking their eyesight to see if they have farsightedness or nearsightedness. When shooting, if the body's center of gravity is not stable, or the standing position is poor, it is better to pass the ball to a teammate than to force a shot, because a missed shot will easily allow the opponent to take the ball.

Every player should be familiar with various shooting methods, and should not only be familiar with one or two, or only seek their own specialty, and be satisfied with hitting every shot, and not practice other methods. It must be known that the more complete the shooting method, the more opportunities there are to get a shot. Personal stunts, although rare and valuable, are admired. But it can only be done occasionally. If it is used frequently, it is easy for people to see through, it is not surprising, and it is easy for the opponent to defend, so that the trick cannot be used again. There are many shooting methods, which cannot all be described here. Now I extract the more commonly used ones and describe them as follows:

(1) Chest Push Shot

This shooting method involves holding the ball with both hands, fingers spread apart, on both sides of the ball, and pushing it out in front of the chest. The palms should not touch the ball, the ball should be held firmly, but not too tightly, otherwise it will not be flexible. Stand with your feet stably in front of each other, making your bones more relaxed naturally; the center of gravity of your body must be kept average; when shooting, bend your knees and squat down, move the ball and put it in your abdomen, and let your elbows hang down close to your body. At this time, the body should be sent up with the ball, and the spirit should rise, this action must be faster than squatting down, and the whole body, hands and feet should cooperate, and it should be soft and rhythmic. When the body is squatting, both eyes should focus on the basket or the place where the ball should hit the board; when the ball rises to the chest, both hands should send the ball out, and when shooting, both backs of the hands should be facing your face, and your palms should be open to the basket, and use your fingers and wrist strength to push the ball out. After the ball is pushed out, the arms must still extend straight along the path of the ball, and both eyes should focus on the basket or the board until the ball has entered the basket, or touched the board and bounced out. At the same time, the body must be prepared to follow up, so as to jump up and recapture the ball and shoot again, or pass it to a teammate.

(2) Shoulder Lift Shot

Usually, this shooting method is mostly used when closely guarded by the opponent near the basket, so it is not an attack if you are not familiar with it. The method of shooting it in is the same as the general passing method. But it is mostly a shot that hits the board and bounces into the basket. The place where the ball hits the board is very important. It should be half a foot higher than the basket and done at the corner where the basket and the board intersect. When practicing this shooting method at ordinary times, you should develop a prescribed route to walk to the corner of the basket. This route should form a 45-degree angle with the end line. And you must walk to a place six feet away from the basket, then jump up, the closer the body jumps to the basket, the more accurately it will be shot. After the body jumps up, use one hand or both hands to lift the ball over the shoulder and throw it into the basket. This gripping shooting method can be performed at the front and left and right corners of the basket. Every player should be so familiar with the place that if they shoot ten times, they must hit it more than eight times before they can be considered qualified. In fact, shooting in this place should be regarded as an area where you will never lose the shot. If you do not hit the basket in this area during the game when there is no opponent's defense, it is really unforgivable. You should be strictly punished by the instructor and ordered to practice hard again.

(3) Hook Shot

This shooting method is the same as the hook pass method; it is mostly used after rotating and when using a blocking strategy. When shooting, first turn around to avoid the person hitting the ball, then turn around and jump up, and shoot with the hook pass method; if you can fake passing to the left and right and forward after turning around, or pat the ball and rush forward one step, then it will be very clever, making the opponent unpredictable. However, this shooting method cannot be performed beyond six or seven feet away from the basket. If it exceeds this limit, it will mostly be inaccurate and easy for the opponent to easily get the ball that is touched by the board and bounced out. Therefore, it should not be done unless you are familiar with it.

### Gleanings from the Sports Scene
