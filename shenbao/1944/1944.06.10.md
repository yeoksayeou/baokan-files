### Editorial: A Suggestion

Yesterday, Mayor Chen of our city, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, and the Japanese Embassy authorities each issued statements hoping that citizens would assist the authorities in exposing unscrupulous individuals manipulating the rice market. At the same time, they declared that the Second Police Bureau had already arrested several suspects and was interrogating them, and that the First Police Bureau had also obtained leads and was investigating. This shows that there are indeed unscrupulous individuals speculating and manipulating the Shanghai rice market. In our May 19th editorial, we already pointed out that the severe black market fluctuations in the city's rice prices were caused by some unwilling individuals speculating and manipulating behind the scenes. These speculators are, of course, pursuing profit at all costs. Furthermore, last weekend, when the rice market experienced flash fluctuations, we pointed out that Chen Chongqing's special agents were taking advantage of the opportunity to stir up trouble, with the aim of disturbing the public. Secondly, unscrupulous merchants are colluding to manipulate the black market, pursuing their own profiteering schemes. We are not making baseless claims or exaggerating to create alarm. We believe that while the flash fluctuations in rice prices do have various internal and external objective reasons, these reasons did not arise overnight and would not cause such extreme flash fluctuations. Artificial manipulation is the main cause of the flash fluctuations. Now, after reading the authorities' statements, our previous accusations have been confirmed to be true that there are indeed unscrupulous individuals manipulating the black market. We propose that these profiteers, who only care about their own interests and disregard the public, should be thoroughly investigated, and after their guilt is confirmed, they should be immediately sentenced to the harshest wartime punishment as a warning to others.

Secondly, we cannot ignore the reasons beyond manipulation. For example, the smooth flow of supplies is of utmost importance. Although the authorities have declared that "the Wang Jingwei central government has ordered the Rice Control Council and local governments to encourage purchasing and facilitate supply flow, in order to obtain a sufficient supply quantity," the "facilitation of supply flow" depends on practical action. In particular, the reasons for the poor performance of past efforts to facilitate supply flow must be avoided, such as reasonable purchase prices, increased transportation capacity, and the elimination of extortion along the way.

Since the announcement of the free rice transportation policy, some larger industrial and commercial enterprises and organizations in the city have independently or jointly purchased rice from various regions, which is a good approach. Also, wealthy families have more rice in storage, so their need for rationed rice is relatively less urgent. However, ordinary laborers and those with low salaries, who have no more than three days' worth of food at home, are most in need of rationed rice. Further analysis reveals that sometimes the rationed rice is of poor quality, which wealthy families do not even consider eating, while poor people regard it as their lifeblood. Therefore, we suggest that the municipal authorities, namely the Shanghai Municipal Government, raise funds or borrow cash from national banks to purchase rice from production areas and distribute it through rations or at a set price. The target of rations or fixed prices should first be laborers and low-wage earners, such as factory workers and employees of public utilities, such as tram companies and postal workers. When purchasing, they should not be limited to rice but should also purchase coarse grains. New wheat from Jiangbei has already entered the market, and stored corn, soybeans, and wheat are two to three times cheaper than rice, all of which can be purchased and transported to Shanghai for distribution. If they can earnestly purchase, facilitate transportation, and make practical adjustments to the food supply of the city's residents, then rice prices will tend to stabilize and be more effective.

In short, the rice price problem requires urgent handling to stabilize it. After briefly returning to normal recently, it has soared again in the past two days. This is certainly an abnormal fluctuation, and we hope that everyone will not rush to buy, which would give speculators an opportunity. However, without effective suppression, abnormal fluctuations may become a natural, static state and be regarded as normal. Therefore, on the one hand, we hope that the authorities will severely punish speculators to curb the chaos. On the other hand, they must raise funds to purchase rice and coarse grains and distribute them to laborers and low-wage earners first, in order to achieve a real effect of suppressing prices.

### Captured Chongqing Soldiers Deeply Feel that Resistance is Not the Way

Luoyang, 9th (Central News Agency) - Chongqing soldiers captured by the Japanese army have now realized the wrongfulness of past resistance under the protection of the Japanese army and are willing to be fighters for a new China in the future. The following is the memoir written by Qiu Xixian (24 years old), a lieutenant and military doctor belonging to the Ninth Army. The main points are as follows: "Although we were constantly incited to fight in the rear, we knew about the strength of the Japanese army. We deeply know the danger of fighting with the Japanese army. In the daily newspapers, we learn that the Japanese army is stubborn and brutal, but judging from what has happened, it is not so. Although we are captured, we have three meals a day, and except for weapons, all the items we own are returned to us. The so-called brutal looting is the behavior of our soldiers. After being captured, I heard that the 15th Army and the 64th Division, which retreated from the Shangqinggao Highlands, fled to Luoyang City, but the 14th Army in the city not only refused them entry but also took actions similar to supervising the battle. How they are against resistance is incomprehensible."

### Entire Atlantic Steel Wall; Birdt Declares State of Emergency; Confident that Talented Generals Will be Able to Cope with the Situation

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: In view of the Anglo-American offensive against the Cherbourg-Le Havre area, the German defense line on the Atlantic Steel Wall in other areas has been declared to be in a state of emergency. The tactics used by the invading forces on the morning of June 6th did not produce anything surprising. The German High Command said that the German army, navy, and air force cooperated well in the military actions that day. Many barbed wire obstacles, gate-shaped formations, and major defensive fortifications along the coastal area have completed their tasks. The German navy and air force, which are constantly patrolling the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel, have made great contributions to preventing the enemy from carrying out attacks.

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from Copenhagen: Landing operations have already begun in northern France, and there is also a considerable risk of this kind in Denmark. However, the anti-Axis forces have not yet shown any signs of starting operations in that area. This is because there are many beaches along the west coast of Denmark, and good weather for several consecutive days is a prerequisite for using any new amphibious vehicles. If the anti-Axis forces ignore the weather and attack, they will inevitably suffer great sacrifices. The German artillery corps is now on alert day and night, waiting for them to come.

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Anglo-American long-planned landing war in Europe has finally begun. In the near future, the strength of the German army in the European fortress and the true value of the National Defense Army will be fully revealed on the Atlantic coast. Field Marshal Lundstedt, commander-in-chief of the German army in Western Europe, is not only the highest strategist of the German Defense Army but also a famous general on the battlefield. When he fought on the Western Front, he was called the "Flower of Blitzkrieg." From his exploits in breaking through the Maginot Line at Sedan, we can know about that. When the Soviet Union asked the United States and Britain to establish a second front in the spring of the year before last, the Marshal felt the importance of defending Western Europe. He was ordered by Führer Hitler to transfer from the Ukrainian front to serve as the commander-in-chief of the garrison in the occupied territories of France. In November of that year, he entered the non-occupied areas of France and completed the impregnable defense line from the Atlantic coast to the Mediterranean coast. When the theory of the second front was first proposed, the Marshal was assigned the important task of [illegible] commander-in-chief of the counterattack army. Behind the Marshal is also Field Marshal Rommel, the "Intellectual General of the Armored Forces." Therefore, in this Western European operation, the German army will bring out the agility and maneuverability of its counterattack team. Rommel is now serving as an inspector of the German army in Western Europe, using his rich experience to investigate the defenses of the European fortress and the training of the garrison. Marshal Rommel is a master of armored warfare. Before the North African War, he had already shaken the British army with the fame of the "Skull Division" on the Western Front. From the perspective of his war history, he will surely stand at the forefront of annihilating the main force of the enemy in this operation. According to intelligence, Marshal Rommel has assumed the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Army under Marshal Lundstedt. In addition, the Netherlands in Western Europe has Marshal Kulitscher, Belgium has Falkanhausen, and Denmark has General Hanekenel, who hold the positions of commanders. General Falkanhorst is stationed in Norway, and General Dietl is stationed in Finland. The German army's defense on the Atlantic coast is as strong as an iron wall. In the Mediterranean region of the European mainland, Marshal Kesselring is in charge of the Italian front, and Marshal Weichs is in charge of the Balkans in Southeastern Europe. Marshal Kesselring has held important positions in the Air Force. His wisdom and strategy in the Italian front have been fully demonstrated. Marshal Weichs will also be able to use his experienced combat skills to defend the mountainous Balkans.

### Invasion of Europe Enters Second Stage: Enemy Continues Landing on Cotentin Peninsula

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - London reports: The Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force announced on the 8th that the first stage of the invasion operation had concluded after the Allied forces established a beachhead on the French coast, and the battle had entered the second stage. They are currently strengthening the beachhead near the landing site and engaging with German defense forces. The third stage involves attracting German reserve forces and engaging them in battle. If the main force of the German reserve forces cannot be defeated, the Allied forces will not be able to advance the operation as smoothly as in the initial stages of the war.

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports, according to military sources: Allied forces are continuing to land at coastal strongholds such as Carentan, Caen, and Bayeux, launching a third offensive.

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: On the evening of the second day of the invasion, the enemy's landing center was between Burgquet and Arromanches. A large number of enemy airborne troops landed on the eastern side of the Cotentin Peninsula. German attacks in this area have been effective. The operation on Wednesday showed that the enemy was attempting to break out of the Cotentin Peninsula and Cherbourg port. The nature and scope of future battles will depend on the fighting on this peninsula. On Wednesday morning, the enemy dispatched approximately 600 bombers and twin-engine fighters to various war zones to support their landing troops, but they were met with effective attacks from German anti-aircraft guns and artillery. Hundreds of enemy gliders and transport planes transported troops to land throughout the day. The focus of the landing was Granville, which was bombed prior to the landing. The war zone extends north to Cobenz on the west side of the Cotentin Peninsula, and intense battles are taking place at these points.

Expanding Bridgehead on the Banks of the Orne River

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to frontline reports: Regarding the progress of the battle in Northern France, from the evening of the 7th to the morning of the 8th, the German army mobilized strong strategic reserve forces to participate in counter-offensive operations. At the same time, the enemy continued to reinforce new landing troops, continuing to strive to expand the bridgehead, thus intensifying the battles along the entire front. The center of the battle remains between the Orne and Vire rivers. The enemy bridgehead in that area had reached a length of 60 kilometers by the morning of the 8th. The enemy formed two major salient points in Caen and Bayeux. After the German army withdrew from the city of Bayeux, the deepest point of the enemy's salient extended to the south of the city. Intense street fighting is also underway in Caen. The enemy has landed two divisions equipped with heavy weapons in areas such as Grandcamp and Arromanches on the Seine Bay in that area. At the same time, hundreds of enemy gliders are frequently traveling over that area, and their air force seems to have increased its strength considerably. The enemy troops advancing south from Bayeux are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the German army about 7-8 kilometers from the city. Fierce fighting also continues in the areas of the Sierre River east of Bayeux. The main force of the enemy in that area is the Montgomery army, with a total strength of approximately ten divisions, including three tank divisions. In the Cotentin Peninsula, the U.S. Air Force units, after landing north of Carentan, took the offensive after receiving reinforcements from tank units. The German army is currently taking a defensive position.

German Troops Withdraw from Ancient Town of Bayeux

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German authorities announced on the 8th that British tank units invaded the city of Bayeux on the morning of the 8th and are currently advancing southwest. The German forces, which are outnumbered, have withdrawn from the city of Bayeux, which has no significant importance in terms of the entire Atlantic fortress.

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: The beautiful ancient town of Bayeux has become ruins after being invaded by the invading army. At the same time, the town of Caen, where the remains of William the Conqueror are located, is also in flames. The town is currently still in the hands of the German army.

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to frontline reports from Northern France on the 8th: Intense street fighting is taking place in Caen. Since the afternoon of the 7th, the city has become a battleground for tank units from both sides.

Large Numbers of Enemy Ships Raise Steam, Awaiting Departure

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: According to precise estimates, General Eisenhower is only participating in the operation with one-tenth of his forces, so it can be assumed that he will have more landing operations. German naval and air force reconnaissance reports indicate that British and American forces are moving on the southern coast of England. A large number of landing fleets in the English Channel and the Irish Sea have raised steam and are awaiting departure. Therefore, German Commander Field Marshal Rundstedt, in view of this, ordered the main force of the reserve forces to take a standby posture. In particular, the main force of the German air force does not seem to have yet been deployed on the Northern French front, and this is only the preliminary stage of the landing operation. The formal battle will unfold in the future.

### Allied Warning to Coastal Fishermen

Geneva, 9th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: The Allied High Command today issued the following warning to fishermen in Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, and France: It is hereby stipulated that all fishing activities must cease within seven days (i.e., from 9:00 PM on June 8th to 9:00 PM on June 15th). Fishermen currently residing in ports must not move, but those working on the sea must return home immediately. Those who do not heed the warning will face danger and obstruct the Allied operations.

German Air Force Unleashes Power, Sinks Many Enemy Ships

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports: On Thursday night, German fighter planes sank five landing ships totaling 31,000 tons at the mouth of the Orne River. In addition, transport ships and warships were also hit, including two light cruisers, one troop transport ship, and two cargo ships, totaling 26,000 tons. Another heavy cruiser was severely damaged and is feared lost. Great chaos occurred on the ship, and many British and American soldiers died on the burning ship or jumped into the sea. A large amount of ammunition, tanks, and army supplies also sank to the bottom of the sea.

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - German authorities announced that since the beginning of the Allied invasion of Europe, the German army has shot down 193 enemy planes and shot down or captured more than 1,300 transport gliders.

A Glimpse of British and American Paratrooper Equipment

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency war correspondent Webb stated: The equipment of the Allied paratroopers and air force units that landed in France this time is the same as what I saw in Sicily a year ago. They carry semi-automatic rifles or pistols and a large amount of explosives, wear short boots, large-pocket uniforms, steel helmets, and red belts. The food they carry, such as oatmeal, tea, and chocolate, is all solid and sufficient for two or three days of consumption. Each soldier is equipped with weapons weighing about 80 kilograms. The soldiers who landed this time also carried a small bag containing a map. At night, they wore luminous scarves around their necks to identify each other in the dark. Among these soldiers are technical experts. The task of most of the soldiers is only to repair captured German vehicles.

### Invasion of Europe Plan Devised by Mountbatten

Stockholm, 9th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency, London: The plan for the Allied invasion of Normandy was initially devised by Mountbatten, and then adopted by General Montgomery and is now being implemented based on this plan.

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - Allied British Commander General Montgomery is 54 years old. When the Allied forces invaded North Africa in August 1931, he was appointed as the commander of the British Eighth Army in Egypt, and then as the commander of the British forces in Tunisia, directly under the command of General Eisenhower, the then Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in North Africa. On September 3rd of that year, he broke through the Strait of Messina and led British troops to land on the Italian mainland. Since the end of last year, he has served as the Supreme Commander of the Allied British Forces invading Europe. He once said that the secret to victory lies in close cooperation between air and land operations. Without air supremacy, there is no victory. This is the supreme principle of modern warfare. Since the North African campaign, his operational policy has always been to faithfully and carefully implement this supreme principle. Therefore, wherever he commands, there must be a large number of military supplies and sufficient preparation time. Observing the situation before and after this landing operation, it can be seen that the Allied invasion of Europe is entirely based on Montgomery's cautious principles.

Jakarta, 9th (Central News Agency) - In order to enable millions of students throughout Java to directly participate in various industrial construction works, cultivate the spirit of diligence and service among young students, and strengthen their physique, the Education Bureau of the Military Administration Department recently decided on a student mobilization plan, instructing the states to implement it immediately. This mobilization of students includes students from the fourth grade of national schools and above, including middle schools, universities, and specialized schools. According to the plans instructed by the state governors, they will be mobilized to engage in various labor services essential for increasing production and war effort.

### The Current Stage of the Pacific War

Enemy mobile units are frequently appearing in the Central Pacific, and have recently repeatedly bombed Minamitori Island. The Pacific war is becoming increasingly tense. The enemy has recently been loudly proclaiming that they will bomb the Japanese mainland as soon as they have the opportunity. The subsequent movements of the Nimitz Fleet, also harboring the ambition to bomb the Japanese mainland, require urgent vigilance. Under the command of Commander-in-Chief Toyoda, the Japanese Combined Fleet is closely monitoring the movements of the enemy Pacific Fleet. The Pacific is currently on the eve of a storm, and it is difficult to foresee the future. The enemy's counter-offensive in the Pacific can be roughly divided into four parts:

First, the operation to tighten the encirclement line of Rabaul. Second, the westward advance of enemy bases and the new deployment of land battles, with the landing at Hollandia on the New Guinea front as an important opportunity. Third, the intensification of air raids on the islands of the Central Pacific as a result of the enemy's advancement of air bases to the Marshall Islands or the Admiralty Islands. Fourth, the enemy's mobile units repeatedly attacking the Central Pacific area,展开机动作战。

On this day last year, in the Solomon Islands, the withdrawal operation from Guadalcanal had just ended, and the enemy was focused on preparing for a new landing operation in the Solomon Islands. In New Guinea, after the withdrawal from Buna, the enemy attempted to advance westward, but their attempts were frustrated by repeated bombings of enemy convoys in that area by the Japanese army. In the Central Pacific, the enemy's efforts to capture Gilbert had not yet been completed, and they were preoccupied with maintaining the supply line between Australia and Hawaii. During this year, the enemy focused on increasing the production of aircraft, and launched a general counter-offensive in the Pacific, mainly with reorganized mobile units. In the Solomon Islands, they used an island-hopping strategy to reach the Admiralty Islands via Munda, Torokina, and Green Island. In New Guinea, they advanced through the bloody battles of Salamaua, Lae, and Finschhafen to Hollandia. In the Central Pacific, they advanced bases from Gilbert to Kwajalein, Roi-Namur, etc. During this period, the speed of the enemy's invasion cannot be said to be slow, and the Pacific war has become increasingly profound.

Needless to say, the above four parts of the Pacific war are progressing with organically close relations, and the New Guinea front and the Central Pacific war are particularly noteworthy. The New Guinea war is focused on advancing westward from the north coast, and its goal is clearly to gradually advance bases and invade the Philippines. The enemy's mobile unit's attacks on the Central Pacific, bombing Japanese bases that pose a significant threat to the side of New Guinea, also clearly have a restraining effect. After the meeting between Nimitz and MacArthur at the end of March, the Halsey Fleet was released due to the change in the situation in the Solomon Islands, and the subsequent strategy was discussed. This fact suggests that there is already contact between MacArthur, who is in charge of the New Guinea operation, and Nimitz, who commands the Pacific Fleet, on the capture of the Philippine Islands.

Nimitz's Ambition

In addition to assisting MacArthur's operations, the Nimitz Fleet also harbors the ambition to complete the invasion of the Japanese mainland. With a large mobile unit, deploying more than a dozen or twenty aircraft carriers, flying hundreds of carrier-based aircraft, using the principle of local absolute superiority, concentrating overwhelming air power in a localized area, ensuring air supremacy in a localized area, and relying on its sheer size to attack the Japanese mainland, this attempt is very obvious. If they attempt to attack the Japanese mainland from the sea, it is unlikely that they will deploy a large force like last time. However, Japan is already prepared for any eventuality.

However, such an attack, the bombing is temporary, and there are time constraints, so when the air raid ends, just as the storm has passed, it will return to normal. The publicity effect may be great, but the strategic effect is not remarkable. Moreover, the frequent deployment of the enemy's Pacific Fleet is nothing more than an attempt to lure out the Japanese Combined Fleet and demand a decisive battle. The enemy's opinion is that a decisive battle with the Combined Fleet, harboring the ambition to regain control of the Pacific; or because of this battle, although they themselves will also suffer considerable damage, they can immediately replenish their forces due to their productivity, thereby somewhat offsetting the power of the Japanese fleet. At the beginning of April, an enemy wireless military commentator said:

"The American attack on Truk is to provoke Japan, to provoke a decisive battle of fleets... In America's view, not knowing the whereabouts of the Japanese fleet is the most difficult thing. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to demand that the Japanese resolve the battle and destroy it in one fell swoop. Therefore, America has gathered an unprecedented force in history to attack the Palau Islands."

The New York Times also said:

"The main purpose of the American mobile unit's attack on Truk is to destroy the Japanese fleet."

The Enemy's Fear

The above words clearly express considerable fear of the power of the Combined Fleet. The Japanese Combined Fleet remains silent, keeping its whereabouts secret, which is regarded as something mysterious by the enemy. Therefore, the enemy is eager to lure out the Japanese fleet to fight a decisive battle. The Nimitz Fleet is carrying out this difficult task and moving around in the Pacific Ocean. In response, the Japanese Combined Fleet, under the operational guidance of General Toyoda, has completed its operational preparations to protect the Pacific. In modern naval warfare, the so-called fleet decisive battle is not a fleet encounter battle as seen in the Battle of the Sea of Japan, but an organic and interconnected operation of land-based air power and fleet air power, with a complex state. The Central Pacific, which is full of such bases, has thus become an excellent sea area for deploying modern naval warfare. The Pacific war is becoming increasingly tense. On this, the third Navy Day since the start of the war, we place great reliance on Commander-in-Chief Toyoda. (Translated from the May 25th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun by Xiang)

Implementation of Air Raid Blackout

From 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM, an air raid blackout was implemented, but no alarms were sounded. At 9:00 PM sharp, the Baojia reporters transmitted air raid warnings to residents within their respective jurisdictions by ringing bells and hammers. All vehicles began driving on the left side of the road, and the lights inside the vehicles were turned off. Pedestrians also walked to the left. All street lights were turned off, and the lights in shops and households were completely shielded with curtains and door drapes to prevent light from leaking out. The entire city entered a black market state. Japanese planes took off to patrol and search the sky with searchlights. Emotions were extremely tense. Military police and personnel from the Air Defense Headquarters patrolled various places. At 10:00 PM, the air raid blackout was lifted and a vigilance blackout was entered. Normal lighting was not restored until 10:30 PM.

### Preparatory Office of the Vagrant Labor Camp Receives Business Leaders, Hoping for Enthusiastic Sponsorship from All Sectors

The Municipal Vagrant Labor Camp, since its preparation by the Ministry of Social Welfare in conjunction with the municipal government, and with the cooperation of leaders from all sectors of the city, has been actively proceeding under the united efforts of officials and civilians. However, due to the high start-up costs, it has been decided to solicit donations from all sectors of the city. Therefore, at 5:00 PM yesterday (9th), a tea party was held at the meeting hall of the Industry and Commerce Association to receive representatives from the city's industry and commerce sectors. Minister of Social Welfare Ding Mocun attended on time. Mayor Chen, due to official business in Beijing, specially sent Secretary-General Wu to attend on his behalf. Directors Li Sihao and Xiang Kangyuan, as well as Director of the Social Welfare Bureau Sun Mingqi, Director of the Social Problems Research Institute Wu Wenwei, Director of the International Labor Affairs Office Chen Jingbai, and Director of the Camp Preparatory Office Zhou Yuying also attended. The Economic Bureau also sent Section Chief Wu to participate. More than 100 representatives from various industry associations in the city, including Zhu Boquan, Shen Weiting, Shen Jinzhou, Ding Fangyuan, Zhao Rutiao, and Chen Fukang, attended. First, Minister Ding reported on the purpose of establishing the camp, hoping for enthusiastic sponsorship and active donations from all parties. Then, Wu Songgao delivered a speech on behalf of Mayor Chen, elaborating on the relationship between providing work training for vagrants and beggars and the overall social livelihood and public security, hoping to lay the foundation for the initial work. He also hoped that all sectors would assist in promoting the early establishment of the camp with the enthusiasm of benefiting oneself and the country. Finally, Director Li Sihao delivered a speech, hoping that the representatives from all sectors would provide strong assistance. The event ended at 6:30 PM.

### Health Week Invites Chen, President of This Newspaper, to Give a Lecture at 5:00 PM Today

Since the opening of the Shanghai YMCA National Health Movement on the 3rd of this month, many people have visited the exhibition, watched the sports performances, and listened to the lectures. This association not only focuses on physical health, but also on the gradual progress of psychological and mental health, which is particularly important. At 5:00 PM today, Chen, the president of this newspaper, will be invited to give a lecture on national health and the construction of a new China.

Male Bodybuilding Competition Tonight

The Shanghai Male Bodybuilding Competition will be held at 8:00 PM tonight. This event can be called a pioneering event in our country and has never happened before.

### Daily Necessities Rationing Begins Today in the Nanshi District

The third phase of household coal briquettes and matches, soap, in the entire Nanshi district has been widely distributed by designated retail stores. However, it has been found that the matches and soap purchased by citizens in the district have been replaced with inferior miscellaneous brands, and the coal briquettes are mostly mud rather than coal dust, with numerous drawbacks, which is truly regrettable. It is hoped that the authorities will investigate and stop this, and it is hoped that citizens in the district will cooperate in reporting any violations at any time. It is best to bring your own municipal scales to weigh the coal briquettes to prevent shortages in weight.

### Health Exhibition Closes

The Shanghai Special City Health Movement Exhibition, which opened on the 1st of this month, has concluded all its activities, with satisfactory results. The authorities are currently evaluating and rewarding them separately. The health exhibition has been exceptionally popular with the public. The association originally scheduled it from June 1st to 7th, but due to the repeated ball games and races of the Sports Association, which affected public visits, the authorities extended the exhibition to the 15th in order to allow the public to visit. However, on the 10th and 11th, due to the Sports Association's races, it will be open as usual in the morning and closed in the afternoon. On the 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th, it will be open all day for anyone to visit. Various manufacturers will also continue to sell goods at a 10% discount to show their preferential treatment.

### Materials Control Institutions to Be Reasonably Adjusted; Top National Government Leaders Agree in Shanghai

This will then be submitted to the Supreme National Defense Council for approval and implementation. It is reported that this strengthening of materials control institutions is based on actual conditions and aims to achieve reasonable adjustments.

### Nanshi Opium Dens to Be Completely Eliminated by Month's End; Anti-Smoking Bureau Determined to Ban Them

The poison of opium is enough to destroy a nation and its people. After gambling dens in the Nanshi area were ordered to close, it is now learned that all opium dens are scheduled to close by the end of this month. This news is gradually being confirmed. The Anti-Smoking Bureau has resolved to ban them. With the eradication of opium and gambling, the revitalization of Nanshi is highly anticipated.

### Old Zha Station Police Sub-bureau Arrests Individuals Harming Public Morals

Since Director He took office at the Old Zha Station Police Sub-bureau, he has actively rectified public morals in the district. He ordered Feng Ruisheng, the director of the administrative section, to thoroughly investigate unscrupulous individuals engaged in activities harmful to public morals and illegal acts that endanger young people. A few days ago, Gao Lianjun, Shen Juanjuan (also known as Qian Xianghong), and others were arrested. They were dressed in strange clothing and wore makeup, waiting to be summoned to teahouses and restaurants, which is illegal. Also arrested were Po Yuanyuan, Ding Gendi, Zhao Hailou, Yang Hongmei, Chen Lianyuan, Xie Rongrui, Hu Heshang, Tong Xuequan, Xu Guobiao, Zuo Tianxi, Li Heshang, and others. They specialize in lewd and immoral activities, harming public morals. All have been punished according to the Law on Violations of Public Order. In the future, if any unscrupulous individuals engage in the above-mentioned rogue behavior in the district, they will be arrested and severely punished to ensure they disappear, in order to refresh the city's image.

### Second Police Bureau Forbids Extortion of Rice Vendors

Since the promulgation of the "Temporary Measures for Food Rice in Beijing and Shanghai" and the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Rice Sales in Shanghai," the aim is to increase food supply and stabilize prices. Dishonest merchants are attempting to reap windfall profits, and the municipal government is determined to severely punish them. In order to assist in stabilizing the food supply, the Second Police Bureau notified all subordinate branch chiefs yesterday to inform each police station that they should provide protection at all times for rice vendors carrying rice on their shoulders, facilitate their passage, and strictly prohibit extortion along the way.

### Reader Scholarship News: Application Forms to Be Issued Starting on the 12th

The application procedures and instructions for the seventh session of the reader scholarships sponsored by this newspaper have been announced in the newspaper three times and sent to major primary and secondary schools. In recent days, schools have sent letters with lists of impoverished students applying, but a small number of schools have over-reported the number of applicants, which this newspaper cannot accommodate. According to the regulations, the number of applicants per school is limited to 5%. Only if the number approved in the previous session exceeded the limit will a concession be made. A small number of schools have not filled out the "General Situation Survey Form," making it impossible to verify, so they must submit it. As for the application qualifications, they start from the fifth grade of elementary school; junior elementary schools are not included. Please pay attention to this. This newspaper has already sorted out the list of students applying, and has decided to start issuing application forms from 10:00 AM on the 12th. It is hoped that the schools that have already registered will send staff with letters to collect them; schools that have not yet registered should register as soon as possible before the 15th, and can also collect the forms with a letter two days later. It is hoped that teachers and students of each school will pay attention to the above points.

### Anglo-American Invasion of Europe Will Inevitably Be Defeated: Statement by Director of the Matsushima News Agency

Colonel Matsushima, the press director of the Allied Japanese fleet in Shanghai, made the following statement at the regular press conference yesterday (9th) at 3 pm regarding the Anglo-American invasion of Europe and the Battle of Biak Island in the South Pacific:

Japanese Forces Fiercely Attack American Forces on Biak Island

Director Matsushima first spoke about the offensive and defensive battles on Biak Island in the South Pacific, stating that the enemy American Navy had suffered a strong blow from the Japanese Navy. He also said that when the British and Americans announced the start of the invasion of Europe, they also took consistent action in the Pacific, but so far the enemy Americans have achieved nothing. He also said that the enemy Americans recently exaggerated their propaganda, falsely claiming to have occupied a stronghold on Biak Island. Director Matsushima specifically refuted this, saying that it was the opposite of the truth. The American forces on Biak Island, after a fierce attack by the Japanese army, had fled to the southern part of Biak Island and were now on the verge of collapse. Even the American military reporters had stated that the American advance on Biak Island was quite difficult under the intense attack of the Japanese army. Therefore, as a result of this battle, the United States suffered an unexpected blow. Japan deeply admired the courageous spirit of the Japanese army, and after this intense battle, the enemy suddenly was forced to gradually retreat.

Dunkirk to Be Repeated, Expected

Director Matsushima then spoke about the British and American invasion of Europe. Regarding the war situation of the enemy's invasion in Europe, as of yesterday, the enemy forces landing in Normandy in northern France were under strong attack by the German army, and most of the enemy forces have been annihilated. According to a Washington dispatch on the 8th of this month, the statement issued by US Secretary of the Army Stimson revealed the current situation of the British and Americans without reservation, saying that the joint forces forming the beachhead had invaded northern France. Although there was a crisis of suffering a fierce counterattack in the initial stage, they should patiently wait for changes in the war situation. Therefore, the words of Stimson can prove the difficult situation of the British and Americans at present. The enemy Americans have never made such a statement since the war began. In addition, the German intelligence department in Shanghai does not pay attention to this British and American invasion of Europe and is quite leisurely. It can be expected that the British and Americans will soon suffer a repeat of the Dunkirk debacle.

Developments in the Next Two or Three Days

Regarding the enemy's troop strength in the invasion of Europe, it is said that the total commander of the Americans, Eisenhower, had 50 divisions under the command of High Commander Gaumolly, with 9,000 aircraft. The initial landing force was 10 divisions, and the airborne transportation was 4 divisions. Furthermore, according to the enemy's claims, the number of aircraft used in the invasion of Europe was 11,000, and the number of ships was 4,000. Based on the above, these are purely empty words and lies, and it is impossible for them to become reality. As for the German army's preparations, under the command of General Lunstedt, the supreme commander of Germany, and Marshal Rommel, who was famous for his defeats in the North African theater and was known as a fierce general, defended. It is estimated that the current German military force on the front line has reached more than 60 divisions, and there are also a large number of reserve troops in the rear. It is expected that the German army's operations will have the most important development in the next two or three days.

American and Australian Panic About Human Resources

The director further elaborated on the lack of human resources in the United States and Australia, saying that the United States recently faced a serious panic over the lack of manpower. For example, the staff of embassies abroad have been ordered by the government to be drafted for service. The age of national service for nationals of the United States and Australia has also been revised. The previously set drafting age for young people over the age of 19 has now been changed to compulsory service from the age of 18 and a half, which has caused dissatisfaction among Australian nationals, who broadcast on the radio that the end of Australia is coming. Currently, there is a great lack of shepherds in Australian pastures, and the so-called lost sheep are now common in Australia.

### Sports: Scholarship Fundraising Soccer Charity Match: Donghua Wins Over Overseas Chinese 3-1, Maintaining Unbeaten Record

This newspaper specially invited the ever-victorious Donghua team to compete against the Western team, Overseas Chinese, for a soccer charity match to raise reader scholarships. The match was held at the Racecourse yesterday at 5:45 PM. Donghua continued to maintain its winning record, defeating Overseas Chinese 3-1. Donghua was ahead 2-1 in the first half. To show the importance of the event, Mr. Lin Kanghou was specially invited to perform the opening kick, and movie stars Li Xianglan and Li Lihua presented the awards. Enthusiastic ladies from all walks of life purchased tickets in large numbers, totaling no less than 20,000 people, making it an unprecedented spectacle. Thanks to the assistance of the police authorities, the order at the stadium yesterday was well maintained. Overseas Chinese invited four generals from Tianjin to participate, greatly increasing their strength. Although Donghua's offensive was strong, they repeatedly failed to score. The entire game was tense and exciting. The details of the battle are recorded as follows:

Donghua Leads 2-1

Referee Xuan Gu Zhengzhu started the game at 5:45 PM with the opening kick by Lin Kanghou. The two armies faced off, and Dai commanded the three armies and marched forward vigorously. Luo Xulai was eager to rescue and blocked a corner kick. Youliang opened it, and the landing point was excellent. Zhang Lingen rushed forward to head it, but was caught by McNity, who jumped up. At five minutes, Otoniel dribbled straight in and passed the ball to Baojie at 20 yards. Baojie held it and kicked it very quickly. Fortunately, Zhang Banglun was quick to catch it. At 20 minutes, Sun Jinshun and Dai Linjing sang in harmony, dribbled past Sirati, and sent it to Youliang from afar. Mai made a volley, hitting McNity squarely on the body. Overseas Chinese did not lose this ball, which was fortunate. At 35 minutes, Dai Linjing passed five levels and killed six generals. Luo Xulai was eager to rescue and slammed into A Dai, which was judged as a 12-yard penalty. Sun Jinshun enforced the penalty. The ball was tricky and rapid, hit the goalpost, and bounced in. Donghua scored first. Then Jia Youliang kicked a corner kick, Zhang Lingen stepped forward and headed it, but was pushed out by McNity. Li Yao emerged from the crowd and headed it again, boldly and quickly, incomparably wonderful, only two minutes away from getting the first goal. Overseas Chinese was eager to take revenge, and the offensive suddenly increased. The connection between the forward lines was excellent. Two minutes before the end of the first half, Otoniel rushed violently, and Zhang Banglun hurriedly priced out, accidentally hitting Otoniel, which was judged as a 12-yard penalty. Baojie operated, Zhang Banglun caught and lost again. Overseas Chinese took back a city. At the end of the first half, Donghua took the lead with two to one.

Donghua Maintains Unbeaten Honor

During the break, Li Xianglan and Li Lihua, two female students, gave awards, each presenting a large silver cup to Donghua and Overseas Chinese. In the sound of the battle, Di Pan Na entered and transferred Bama out, while McNity changed to Taiduka, so the offense and defense were increased. The ball repeatedly swirled in front of the Donghua goal, but fortunately, Li Ning and Zhuang Youren resisted effectively. At four minutes, Otoniel scored a goal in the chaos, but it was ruled invalid due to Yatomari's offside. At a quarter of an hour, Jia Youliang cut in from the sideline, Dai Linjing passed lightly, Sun Jinshun turned over, hooked and entered, three to one, Donghua had an absolute advantage. Not long after, A Dai marched forward with a bit in his mouth and passed to Han Longhai more than ten yards away from the door, but he failed. Then A Dai got a wonderful pass from Youliang, and Taisha Ka rushed out, forming an empty door, but Sun Jinshun was too eager to make contributions and used too much force, so he flew away. Overseas Chinese launched a counter-attack. Vera's shot was touched by Li Ning, which almost became an own goal. Fortunately, Zhang Banglun stretched his ape arms lightly and there was no mistake. Both sides had opportunities to attack, but both failed due to lack of success. The statutory time ended, and Donghua returned in triumph with three to one, maintaining the honor of being unbeaten.

### National Forum: Thoughts on Reading "Eliminating Profiteering"

— Mingyuan

Reading the Zhong Bao editorial "Eliminating Profiteering" on May 31st, it stated that there are two major enemies in wartime, one is profiteering and the other is communism. The wording is alert and can be described as a sharp and candid discussion, which is admirable. Profiteering is indeed the main cause of communism, but why is profiteering becoming more and more prominent, and why is its momentum so rampant? There must be severe steps to this, so I will analyze it as follows:

The war has lasted for a long time, and all operations in the business arena have lost their normal track. Those who follow the rules encounter failure, while unscrupulous people often take advantage of opportunities, use unscrupulous means, drill everywhere, push the waves, and do everything possible. Once they make a profit, poor scholars suddenly become wealthy. Society not only does not punish them, but also envies them. Because of this, everyone recognizes this as a good opportunity that comes once in a thousand years, and strives to emulate it, and the speculative wind in the country is like a prairie fire that cannot be extinguished. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and wailing is heard everywhere. This tragic situation is also the place for general profiteers to indulge in extravagance, which is heartbreaking to say.

Because the wind of hoarding and speculation is so prevalent, the government authorities cannot sit idly by and have to devise countermeasures to prevent it. Therefore, various control and management measures have been issued one after another, and countless similar control and management institutions have emerged. Their systems are not clear, and the handling is inconsistent. Cunning people come up with various tricks, and even collude with officials and do evil together, not hesitating to use control and management methods to openly and brazenly seize and plunder in order to fill their unbridled desires, which has led to the current situation where profiteering cannot be curbed.

Because there is a fact of competition between officials and the people for profit, prices cannot only fall, but also have a tendency to rise day by day. Every household is afraid that they will not be able to afford to buy things in the future, so the more people buy, the higher the prices rise, and the more eager unscrupulous merchants are to pursue profiteering. In addition, the inflation of currency continues, and people value goods more than currency. The so-called hoarding currency is not as good as hoarding goods. The purpose of their buying goods is not hoarding, but storage. No matter how much prices rise, they will never sell their stored goods unless absolutely necessary. This also invisibly contributes to the arrogance of profiteering.

In recent years, the number of companies, industrial companies, department stores, etc. established in the business arena is like bamboo shoots after a rain. Although none of them has been approved and registered, in fact, the number of those who can use legitimate enterprises as their business scope is very detailed. Most of them are engaged in speculation in the country to obtain unjust profits as the only way out. The wind of increased capital in recent years shows their essence. This is also a person who obtains benefits under the guise of industry and commerce.

What is most regrettable is that the handling of control does not mention increasing production, the pricing of materials does not match the actual situation, the method is not seeking properness, transportation cannot be smooth, and the rural society cannot be stable, which are all helping profiteering. The inadequacy of human efforts is not to be expressed by the wise.

There are many reasons for the birth and development of profiteering, but if the above points can be thoroughly eradicated one by one, then profiteers will have no place to stand, and communism will not occur. The so-called major enemies in wartime will not be difficult to eliminate.

### This Location Organizes Volunteer Rehabilitation for Opium Addiction

In response to the Municipal Bureau's anti-drug efforts, this location has specially engaged with the China Moral Improvement Association to organize volunteer rehabilitation for opium addiction. The initial work will focus on rescuing young professionals, gradually expanding to all levels of society. Any employee with a low salary, certified by their service unit's supervisor, can register with this location first. Once a sufficient number of people is gathered, they will be sent to a rehabilitation center for group detoxification. After escaping the sea of suffering, they will be further subjected to moral rehabilitation to prevent relapse. This is to uphold the government's earnest intention to ban opium and to save young people addicted to opium. However, the initial phase of mobilization requires significant expenses, relying on the enthusiasm of society to generously donate funds and jointly support this righteous cause. We eagerly anticipate this.

Moral Lecture: The 17th session of Sacred Learning lectures will be held from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 11th. Mr. Sun Xiangzhong will speak on "The Three Cardinal Virtues of Wisdom, Benevolence, and Courage," Mr. Zhang Gongsu will speak on "The Way of Learning," and Mr. Yang Zhongyi will speak on "New Interpretations of the Book of Changes." All are welcome to attend. The address is Cangzhou Shuchang, No. 470 Chengdu Road.

Dr. Huang Zhenmin Offers Free Treatment: In order to benefit elementary school teachers and impoverished children, Dr. Huang Zhenmin will waive consultation fees for all those certified by the school or introduced by this location. The cost of acupuncture and medicine will be charged at cost. The clinic is located at No. 9, Lane 14, at the intersection of Yongtai Road and Greater Shanghai Road. The daily limit is 20 patients, from 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM.

### Letter to My Sister (10) Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

A few days later, Takashi received a package from his sister. The package not only contained the "Navy" magazine and warship photo album he had longed for but also a satin winter coat, a knitted vest, and delicious snacks. This kind of care from his sister was a bit excessive. He deeply felt his mother's unspoken love and couldn't help but burst into tears.

Although the package arrived, the letter never came. He pondered his parents' attitude with great anxiety. The sister's late reply might be evidence that his parents did not approve of his request.

About ten days later, on a Saturday, he returned to the apartment later than usual. He saw a express postcard that had been delivered in his absence. It was a simple letter from the painter Ichiki Tokujiro, saying that he would like to have a talk with him on Sunday.

Takashi had planned to go to Boso to paint the sea on Sunday, but because he received an order from the calligrapher who had taken care of him, he had no choice but to go.

The next morning, he visited the Ichiki's home after a long time.

"Hey, I heard you are a defector, right?"

The painter deliberately used an archaic expression and smiled at Takashi.

"Huh?"

"It's no use hiding it from me. I received such a letter."

Ichiki threw a thick letter onto the table without touching it. Takashi was shocked when he saw the handwriting. The bold and forceful characters written with thick ink were clearly his father's handwriting.

"The crime of desertion is very serious! In the past, it would have been a capital crime. However, recently, the island of deer seems to have greatly reduced such crimes. Read this letter!"

The painter pretended not to know and said this. Takashi unfolded his father's letter.

His father never dreamed that Takashi often visited the painter Ichiki. His father only knew that Ichiki was a famous painter from his hometown, so he asked a friend to introduce him and wrote this letter. In that letter of introduction, he wrote in detail about Takashi's disappearance and future aspirations. At the same time, he wrote that he hoped Ichiki would discipline this son who had left home without permission. If Ichiki agreed, he could send tuition fees every month. When his son became a painter, he would thank him in person—please convey this intention to his son and introduce Takashi's name and address.

"A sensible father is rare in the Kagoshima area."

"Ah!"

Takashi lowered his head in shame and gratitude.

"I hear you want to be a marine painter, is that right?"

"Ah!"

"It's a bit inappropriate for a mountain painter to train a marine painter, but in Japan, there is no marine painter, so we have to make do."
