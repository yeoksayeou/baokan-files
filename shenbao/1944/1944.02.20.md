### China is not Monaco

— Yoshida Yu

People often like to say, "The Soviet Union throws religion aside as opium, while China regards opium as religion." However, recently the Soviet Union has even opened up to religion, and China is gradually no longer considering opium as religion. In addition, the gambling habit, generally regarded as a Chinese weakness, is also not as popular among the new youth. This vice has long been regarded by Chinese patriots as the root of all evil, a means of poisoning the Chinese nation, and a tool for foreign governments to control China. The main goal of the recent Three Prohibitions Movement actually lies in these two things. Moreover, the students participating in the movement are all motivated by righteous indignation and patriotic enthusiasm. Now, when these young people attempt to assist the government in launching the New Citizen Movement, and to ban opium and gambling, which are generally regarded as China's incurable diseases, if they also know that the government they are assisting has already declared brothels and gambling dens legal and is protecting their business with the police, how will they feel? Because of this, the youth students may not be more enthusiastic about the New Citizen Movement. Moreover, precisely because they are young and energetic people full of enthusiasm for the country and the nation, they are likely to develop an even more terrible aversion. Therefore, the government's decision to limit the South City gambling dens to closure by the end of March, and to announce a three-year plan to ban opium, cannot but be considered a wise policy!

The problem that has not yet been resolved is the gambling dens in the First District. Following the ban on South City gambling dens by the end of March, if the gambling dens in the First District continue to operate as usual, then the customers addicted to the South City gambling dens will naturally transfer to the First District. The Two Prohibitions Movement was definitely not launched to attract business for the gambling dens in the First District. If that is the case, then the true purpose of the young students who responded to the call of the New Citizen Movement will be completely trampled upon. If it is considered wrong to roll dice in a glass box in the South City gambling dens, but it is considered right to throw balls vigorously against the wall in the First District gambling dens, then the South City can also throw dice vigorously against the wall! If it is said that the bad thing about the South City gambling dens is that they are Chinese-style, and the good thing about the gambling dens in the First District is that they are foreign-style, then the South City should adopt Japanese-style gambling, which would be even better than other foreign styles, wouldn't it? In short, the students participating in the Three Prohibitions Movement, who are angrily correcting the social atmosphere, do not have their deep-seated abhorrence change depending on whether the tools used by the Chinese for gambling are hard or soft, or whether the method is foreign or Chinese. What is wrong in the South City is also wrong in the First District, and what should be banned in the South should also be banned in the First District. Of course, I do not deny that if gambling dens are abolished, there may be institutions that fall into financial difficulties. However, China is not like the country of Monaco, where the gambling den's gate is guarded by the police, and the police are supported by the gambling den's profits. China is one of the world's leading great powers. If it imitates the world's number one small country, Monaco, and uses gambling den profits to support the police, then it would be more beneficial to abolish gambling dens and the police. There has always been a saying: "Money goes to the gambling den, people go to the courthouse." When gambling dens flourish, petty criminals increase; when petty criminals increase, the police must also increase; when the police increase, the expenses also increase, and thus it becomes necessary to fill the finances with gambling dens. However, conversely, if gambling dens are banned, then temporary inconvenience may occur, but soon after, petty criminals will also decrease, and when petty criminals decrease, police work will also decrease, and personnel can also be reduced. Therefore, the finances that must be filled with gambling dens need to be fundamentally re-examined.

Recently, the author heard that a foreign-style gambling company in the First District has already been established by the Chinese. Although it is hard to believe, it is all over the rumor mill. At a time when Chinese youth students are hoarsely singing for the prohibition of gambling, opium, and dancing, there are actually people who are investing in opening gambling companies, which I really can't believe. Perhaps this is also one of the many anti-propaganda efforts in Shanghai.

The government authorities recently arrested more than two hundred gold bar speculators. A certain newspaper editorial requested that these merchants be subjected to wartime criminal law for the crime of manipulating prices. During the period of waging the Greater East Asia War at the cost of any sacrifice, it is only natural to punish such degenerate elements. Naturally, the people expressed satisfaction with the authorities' decisive action. However, at the same time, in such a serious era, it is also hoped that the government authorities will clarify the major policy of banning gambling dens that promote speculative gambling, and not treat them differently because they are Chinese-style or foreign-style. At the same time, it is necessary to thoroughly investigate the truth of the aforementioned anti-propaganda. If the establishment of the company is related to the behavior of manipulating the stock market, then it is hoped that the government will punish these people with the same severe punishment as the gold standard speculators.

### American Newspaper Praises Japanese Army's Fighting Spirit

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) - After the US military suffered unprecedented damage in the Gilbert operation, the demand for the US military to change its past combat methods from the US military and the public has been increasing day by day. The New York Times published a theory on January 15th, entitled "The Dalawa Teachings," pointing out the strong fighting spirit of the Japanese army and the difficulty of the war against Japan, and demanded a change in combat methods. The general idea is as follows: Although the full picture of the Gilbert operation has been clarified, the comprehensive figures for the damage suffered by the US military have not yet been released, but it is not difficult to imagine that it must be a very large number. We hope that the sacrifices of the US military can be compensated by the new base with a surplus of value, but unexpectedly, the damage to the attack army has created an unprecedented record. We must know that all Japanese soldiers have the fighting spirit to disregard their lives and not leave a single soldier, and the act of committing suicide is always carried out calmly. The Battle of Gilbert has proved that the Japanese army regards death as a home. If the Japanese army has to withdraw when necessary, they will never know what surrender is, and they are particularly strong in their hatred of cowards. According to the aforementioned situation, the United States must fundamentally change its attitude towards the war against Japan. The Gilbert operation can be regarded as a clock that informs the United States of how many difficulties and sacrifices will be faced in the future, and there will be large-scale fierce battles and many sacrifices in the Pacific in the future, so the strength of Japan should be accurately evaluated.

The monthly production volume recently has been only 650 tons, so in addition to making the railways connecting Hunan Province and the mainland unable to transport, the power plants in various places centered on Hengyang have also stopped sending power, so there is a great panic in the replenishment of military supplies and the production of civil materials.

### Currency System of Huaihai Province; Adjustment Measures Have Been Established; Joint Reserve Bank Notes Will No Longer Be Issued Starting Next Month

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Central Reserve Bank notes have been expanded to the Su-Huai area since December 1 last year, and are used together with the original Joint Reserve Bank notes in the area. Three months have passed since its implementation. Thanks to the continuous efforts of the fiscal bureau and the sincere cooperation of administrative and financial officials and related parties in the area, considerable achievements have been made. The Xuzhou Branch of the Central Reserve Bank is also scheduled to officially open on the 20th of this month, which will further facilitate financial cleansing and material adjustment in the area. The area has now been formally reorganized into Huaihai Province, an important part of the rear of the Greater East Asia War. In the future, the province's rapid development in politics, economy, military affairs, and other aspects, as well as the decisive victory of the Greater East Asia War and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, are closely related. Therefore, the importance of the province's status and the greatness of its mission after its establishment are recognized by all. In order to adapt to the environmental requirements, promote the rapid development of everything in the province, and complete its mission, the fiscal authorities should make further adjustments to the province's currency system. Based on the original plan to use the Central Reserve Bank notes together with the Chinese United Reserve Bank notes, and then stop the new issuance of Chinese United Reserve Bank notes in the area after achieving results, special adjustment measures have been formulated. Starting from March 1, the new issuance of Joint Reserve Bank notes in Huaihai Province will be stopped. However, it is still temporarily allowed to be used on the market, and it is stipulated that all treasury expenditures and bank payments, private contracts, etc. in the province must not be denominated in Joint Reserve Bank notes, and payments are limited to Central Reserve Bank notes. The currency system in North China and Central China will not change due to the implementation of these measures. It is firmly believed that after the new issuance of Joint Reserve Bank notes in the province is stopped, the use of Central Reserve Bank notes will be further promoted. The government's unified currency policy has achieved another major achievement, and it can be predicted that the province's financial cleansing, material adjustment, and other work will have a groundbreaking development. Minister Zhou, who is also the Minister of Finance of the National Government, issued a solemn statement yesterday regarding the significance and measures of this move. The original text is as follows:

"After the Su-Huai Special Zone was ordered to be changed to Huaihai Province, it was reorganized and established on February 1 of this year. The province's currency has been originally scheduled to use the Central Reserve Bank notes together with the Chinese United Reserve Bank notes since December 1, 1932, and then stop the new issuance of Chinese United Reserve Bank notes in the area after achieving results. Although only three months have passed since its implementation, the financial cleansing and material adjustment in Huaihai Province have become more convenient as a result, and the results are still good. Now, the Xuzhou Branch of the Central Reserve Bank will also open on the 20th of this month, and the currency system of Huaihai Province should be further adjusted. The adjustment measures are divided as follows: From March 1, 1933, the new issuance of Chinese United Reserve Bank notes in Huaihai Province should be stopped immediately, but they will still be accepted on the market. After March 1, 1933, all financial institutions in Huaihai Province shall stop paying Chinese United Reserve Bank notes and shall not use the notes as a unit for concluding contracts, but those who have previously concluded contracts with the notes shall still be allowed to continue trading. After that, the expenditure of treasury funds and the payment of bank deposits, loans, remittances, etc. in Huaihai Province will no longer use Chinese United Reserve Bank notes, but will be limited to Central Reserve Bank notes. The currency system in North China and Central China will not undergo fundamental changes due to this measure. Based on the above measures, the new issuance of Chinese United Reserve Bank notes in the province has been stopped, and the use of Central Reserve Bank notes will inevitably be further promoted. All of our people must look up to the government's intentions, earnestly follow them, and see the results. Do not disobey, or you will be punished. This is the most fortunate thing. In addition to submitting reports and distributing them, this solemn statement is made."

### Statement by the Japanese Embassy

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Embassy in China made the following statement at 3 p.m. on the 19th regarding the currency adjustment in the Huaihai region: The National Government, regarding the currency adjustment in the Huaihai region, began using the Central Reserve Bank notes in the Huaihai area on December 1st of last year, with a rate of 100 Central Reserve Bank notes to 18 Federal Reserve notes, using both currencies simultaneously. It has now been decided that, starting March 1st, the issuance of new Federal Reserve notes will cease, meaning that after March 1st, the China United Reserve Bank will no longer issue Federal Reserve notes, and general financial institutions will also cease new transactions involving Federal Reserve notes. Furthermore, payments from the National Treasury will be made entirely in Central Reserve Bank notes. However, the China United Reserve Bank and general financial institutions will continue to accept previously issued Federal Reserve notes and will acknowledge the continued existence of previously established Federal Reserve note transactions. Moreover, the general public in the city can still use Federal Reserve notes as usual. At the same time, the first-class post office in Xuzhou and six other post offices will be transferred from the jurisdiction of the North China Postal Administration to the Shanghai Office of the General Directorate of Posts. This time, due to the establishment of Huaihai Province, there is new development in the currency system adjustment in the region. At the same time, the postal issue is also being resolved. This is truly a gratifying fact in terms of the region's administration. The Japanese side will provide full assistance to the Chinese side in this measure in the future. Expanding the Central Reserve Bank note circulation area and promoting the smooth exchange of goods between the region, Central China, and North China will contribute to the stability of people's livelihoods and the economic construction in the region.

### Transfer of Postal Administration in Huai Province

Xie Jing, 19th (Central News Agency verbal dispatch) - Since the National Government officially ordered the rewriting of the Suhuai Special Zone as Huaihai Province, all political and economic construction organizations in the region have been gradually adjusted and are now largely in place. The postal service is of great importance to transportation construction and must be adjusted quickly.

Yesterday, the authorities of the Ministry of Construction specially issued a statement, which is recorded below: Since the National Government officially ordered the rewriting of the Suhuai Special Zone as Huaihai Province, all transportation organizations in the region must be adjusted urgently. Regarding the postal service, the key points of adjustment have been discussed and agreed upon after repeated consultations with relevant agencies. All five post offices in the province that were previously under the jurisdiction of the North China Postal Administration will be transferred to the Shanghai Office of the General Directorate of Posts on March 1st of this year. In order to handle the transfer smoothly and quickly, it has been decided to temporarily establish a temporary Xuzhou branch of the Shanghai Office of the General Directorate of Posts in Xuzhou.

### Finnish Interior Minister Returns from Sweden

### Berlin Watches the Development of the Situation

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German diplomatic circles claim that British reports that ships in Danish ports are not allowed to sail are completely untrue, and that the claim that General Dietl is preparing to retreat from northern Finland is also false.

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency foreign correspondent Hoen writes: The Finnish issue continues to be the focus of political discussion in enemy and neutral newspapers. British and American newspapers still claim that the only condition the Soviet Union can accept is Finland's unconditional surrender. However, at the same time, the British and American newspapers and communist newspapers in neutral countries have suddenly changed their tune and claimed that the Soviet Union is prepared to deal with Finland in a moderate way. Given Moscow's recent diplomatic and political trends, this change in deceptive tactics in the enemy camp is not surprising. However, it must be known that Finland has ample experience and knows that the Soviet people do not attach much value to any conditions signed in Moscow. The Finnish people are keenly aware of the Soviet Union's delaying tactics. In this situation, Berlin will wait quietly for future developments with the same attitude as before. Berlin is confident that the responsible politicians and the people of Finland will not be deceived by the various contradictory propaganda of the Soviet Union and will understand that force is the decisive factor.

### Chuikov Appointed Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army; General Vatutin Relieved of His Position as Chief of Staff

Stockholm, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a report from the Moscow correspondent of the "Svenska Aftonbladet," the Soviet Information Bureau issued a statement saying that General Chuikov was appointed Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Army yesterday, as the deputy of Commander-in-Chief Stalin.

Berlin, 19th (German News Agency dispatch) - Military sources reported yesterday that General Vatutin's chief of staff, Ivanov, has been dismissed by Marshal Chuikov. This information was provided by Soviet staff officers captured by the Soviets in the Siversky Donets area. General Vatutin is the commander of the Soviet forces on the Ukrainian front.

### Hand-to-Hand Combat on the West Bank of the Narva River; German Group Breaks Through on the Southern Route

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Havas dispatch, hundreds of artillery pieces have been firing at each other on the west bank of the Narva River in recent days. The night sky is lit up by the flames of war. There is fierce fighting along the highway from Narva to Narva-Jõesuu. Forests and frozen areas to the north have also been destroyed by artillery fire. After five hours of heavy artillery bombardment, Soviet forces were able to cross the Narva River, enter the German positions, and gain a foothold on the west bank. Soviet forces continue to cross the frozen river and advance westward. German artillery prevents the enemy from advancing along the highway to await reinforcements. The German soldiers defending the eastern bridgehead of Narva are in a precarious situation. Their supply lines are in danger of being cut off, and they themselves are in danger of being surrounded and annihilated. Therefore, volunteers from Germany, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands have been mobilized and formed into teams to repel the enemy forces crossing the river and advancing westward. German artillery fires salvos, causing the houses in Narva to shake. German armored vehicle crews bravely counterattack with grenades and engage in hand-to-hand combat with the westward-advancing Soviet forces, eventually repelling the enemy. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. While the German heavy artillery to the north of the highway was deployed, the German artillery fire prevented the enemy from advancing immediately, and the firing was very accurate. The enemy forces on the west bank of the Narva River were annihilated. More than a thousand Soviet soldiers' corpses were left in the forests and swamps, and Soviet soldiers' corpses were also piled up everywhere on the Narva River ice.

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Havas dispatch, the German forces besieged west of Cherkasy broke through and joined forces with Marshal von Manstein's main force, shattering the Soviet's hope of encircling a large German force and greatly alleviating the situation on the southern route of the Eastern Front. In the past few years, German forces have adopted a strategy of large-scale encirclements, inflicting serious losses on the enemy. The Battle of Cherkasy proved its value again. The Soviet's operational goal of annihilating a large part of the German forces, creating a gap in the German line, and then making a long, direct assault has failed again. The new developments in the battle here have made Moscow's news of the encirclement of a large German force unfounded. The Soviet's offensives in the Vitebsk area have repeatedly failed and have now temporarily ceased. Only in the Narva area in the north has the Soviet's offensive not stopped, but the attacking forces rarely exceed a company. The German withdrawal from Staraya Russa and areas deep in the enemy's rear is part of the German's action to straighten the line.

The Battle of Offense and Defense in the Central Sector Comes to an End Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German News Agency reports: There were no major battles on the central sector of the Eastern Front on Thursday. The calm since February 17 has brought the Second Battle of Defense of Vitebsk to an end. Although the Soviet forces mobilized six army corps, a total of 53 infantry divisions, 13 tank brigades, and a strong artillery force in the southeast and northwest of the town, they ultimately failed to achieve a breakthrough. On the contrary, they lost more than 1,000 prisoners of war, 363 tanks, 91 artillery pieces, hundreds of machine guns, and other heavy infantry weapons.

120,000 German Troops Successfully Break Out

The most important thing on the southern route of the Eastern Front is that a group of German forces, after being cut off for several days, re-established contact. February 4th was one of the unluckiest days the Red Army announced. Three days later, the enemy again claimed that the protected German forces had been tightly confined to an area of 40 square kilometers. Four days later, the area had shrunk to 20 square kilometers. At the same time, the Soviet forces claimed to have surrounded 110,000 German troops. On February 15th, the Red Army admitted that the German relief offensive had made progress. The Soviet encirclement around the German forces was said to be 40 kilometers, but in reality, it was 10 kilometers wide. On the evening of February 16th, the Soviet command admitted that the German tank offensive in Zvenigorodka had been victorious and claimed that the encirclement was still 20 kilometers wide. In fact, the protected German units had joined the German tank group on that day. Although the Soviet forces broke through this German contact again, they suffered heavy losses.

### Bloody Battle in Torrential Rain on the Anzio Front in Italy; U.S. Fifth Army Retreats Slightly

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to news from the Allied headquarters in North Africa obtained here today, there is bloody fighting in torrential rain in Anzio, Italy. The U.S. Fifth Army has been unable to withstand the tremendous pressure from the German forces and has retreated slightly. Field Marshal Kesselring is fighting in Anzio with four divisions.

Berlin, 19th (German News Agency dispatch) - The German High Command announced that German forces, using a large number of artillery pieces, continue to engage in fierce fighting with the enemy forces in the Nettuno bridgehead, thereby further reducing the encirclement of the enemy forces to four kilometers south of Aprilia. The enemy's counterattacks with the assistance of tank units have been ineffective. As for the American forces in Cassino, because their strength has weakened, they have been replaced by Indian troops. Indian troops launched a full-day assault on the mountains in Cassino, but all attacks failed. German forces immediately filled several gaps in their positions when the enemy did not counterattack. The Cassino railway station has been gained and lost several times, but it is still occupied by German forces.

Temple Ruins Filled with Corpses

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Cassino Monastery has been reduced to ruins. The last resident of the monastery, the 83-year-old abbot, Father Amalarius, left on the 18th at the request of the German representatives, accompanied by the surviving priests and monks. The abbot has decided to go to Rome soon to make a detailed report to Pope Pius XII. Furthermore, due to the inhumane attacks by the Allied forces, hundreds of corpses of monks and more than 600 other people have been exhumed from the ruins of the monastery.

### Germany's Total Power

The Japanese Asahi Shimbun held a roundtable discussion with its correspondents in Berlin and Switzerland on the theme of "Germany's Total Power," with each stating their observations on the ground. The following is an attached note.

Asahi Shimbun: What we expect is how Allied Germany will counter the European offensive of Britain and the United States. Regarding Germany's strong military strength, productivity, and the people's unwavering belief in victory, please describe them in detail.

Germany Facing a Two-Front War

Correspondent Moriyama (Berlin): If military strength, productivity, and the people's unwavering belief in victory are combined to form total war power, then I believe that Germany's total war power is definitely not weaker than it was two or three years ago in terms of its absolute quantity, and weapons have been improved. Soldiers have accumulated combat experience. So why is Germany not advancing? That is because the war situation has unknowingly turned into a two-front war. Germany is now attacked from both sides by the Soviet army and the greatly expanded American army. The fundamental idea of ​​blitzkrieg warfare concentrated on a single front must be changed to a strategy and tactics of two-front warfare. Germany's shift to defensive warfare since the autumn of last year is the inevitable sacrifice of this transformation. Since about August last year, the conversion of the aircraft industry into an agency to carry out the two-sided war has ended, and because of last year's general mobilization, all men in Germany who can hold a gun have put on military uniforms. According to German official explanations, Germany's successive retreats since Stalingrad were due to the overwhelming superiority in enemy troops and the quantity of military equipment. However, in today's decisive battle, we will not discuss the relationship between Germany's war power, which has gathered all the country's total power, and the Soviet Union, which is its superior. I will quote the explanation of Minister of Propaganda Goebbels to clarify the relationship.

"Perhaps Britain and the United States are about to try to open a second front! Moreover, the number of enemy troops and equipment may be superior to our German army. However, the difficulty of sea transportation, which is the logistics of these troops, offsets the enemy's superiority in troops, and their power is only equal to our army. But we can see from the results achieved by our army in the Italian front, which is at a disadvantage, what kind of results will occur when the German army is equal to the enemy in strength. Therefore, my Germany will definitely win on the second front."

There are still things to consider in this theory, that is, Germany is aware of using spirit and tactics to make up for its shortcomings, and that kind of awareness is becoming more and more intense, which is gratifying.

Asahi Shimbun: Please observe the impressions of the current war situation from the perspective of neutral countries.

Observations of Neutral Countries

Correspondent Kasa (Switzerland): At the present stage, the following points will ultimately determine the situation in all of Europe: the Soviet-Polish border issue and the disclosure of the truth about the Anglo-German peace talks by Pravda are bombs dropped by the Soviet Union on Germany. The rift between Britain and the Soviet Union has widened due to these two incidents. As a result, many of the careful preparations made by Britain from the Moscow talks to the Tehran talks have completely failed. The Soviet Union has now taken off its mask, which is because Britain is showing cowardice towards the second front. If Germany takes advantage of this rift between Britain and the Soviet Union to launch a major blow on the second front, the state of equilibrium between the Soviet Union and Britain will collapse at one blow. This is an excellent opportunity for Germany. Therefore, the second front will turn into an opportunity that is advantageous to Germany.

However, on the other hand, the Eastern Front and the bombing of Germany are still issues worthy of attention. As far as the Eastern Front is concerned, everything will be determined by Germany's newly sharpened reserve army. As for the bombing of Germany, it should not be taken too seriously. Everything depends on whether Germany can maintain the system set by Minister of the Interior Himmler. The purpose of the bombing is to collapse the Himmler system and weaken the war power. The Himmler system not only raises the morale of the German people, but also uses its organizational power to maintain the morale of the army. He also fulfilled an important task. Therefore, judging from the current situation, this system is far more resilient than generally imagined.

Moreover, regarding the food aspect, as a result of the increased harvest of agricultural crops last year, there is no need to worry about supply. Finally, we can say that the European war is not a war on one side, but a war on three sides. That is, the German-Soviet war, the German-British war, and the dispute between the British and the Soviet Union. The state of this war is becoming clearer day by day. In Germany, the room for fully developing its policies and war is also becoming more and more expanded. This is the impression gained from the current situation.

### Free Trade of Yarn and Cloth Permitted in Three Provinces and Two Municipalities Outside the Shanghai District; Unrestricted Transfer of Goods Other Than Controlled Money

Outside parties have many misunderstandings regarding the methods of purchasing and transporting yarn and cloth outside the Shanghai area. According to the reporter's inquiry with the Business Coordination Committee, the principle of free trade is temporarily adopted for cotton yarn and cotton cloth within the borders of the three provinces and two municipalities outside the Shanghai area. This has been notified by the Ministry of Industry, and all normal commercial supply and demand, rather than attempts at monopoly or manipulation, can be handled accordingly. As for the movement of yarn and cloth, according to the "Provisional Regulations for the Prohibition of Wartime Materials Movement," except for goods being transported out of the Shanghai control line, which requires the permission of the Committee, there are no explicit restrictions on mutual transport between the three provinces and two municipalities, and there is no need to apply for a transport permit.

Conclusion of Yarn and Cloth Purchase

According to the reporter's inquiry with the Business Coordination Committee, the Committee has recently stipulated that the Cotton Industry Management Office shall handle the allocation of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and other materials. All factories and businesses shall, for matters related to allocation, go through their respective industry associations or the Cotton Products Industry Association and then transfer the matter to the Committee, which shall instruct the Cotton Industry Management Office to handle it. The Committee will not directly correspond with the factories and businesses. Matters regarding the inspection and acceptance of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in the purchase case, the retention of movement within the city, and the issuance of special fixed-term deposit certificate exchange certificates from the Central Reserve Bank will be handled by the Committee's newly formed Cotton Yarn and Cloth Purchase Settlement Committee. Factories and businesses should now contact the Committee directly at 984 Datong Road (formerly Avenue Edward VII), telephone 60086 or 33015, regarding the above-mentioned matters. It is also reported that the Cotton Industry Management Office will move from 304 Huangpi Road (formerly Route Massenet) to 306 Taixing Road (formerly Route de Gènes) on February 21, telephone 34242, 34243, 34244.

Free Transport of Old Clothes and Rags

The Shanghai Special Municipality's Clothing Industry Association, Transport and Customs Declaration Industry Association, and Waste Machine Maintenance Industry Association have requested the Business Coordination Committee to stipulate the transfer methods for old clothes and rags from the Shanghai area to the three provinces and two municipalities so that they can follow them. According to the reporter's inquiry, the Business Coordination Committee has, after deliberation with relevant parties, deemed that free transport is permitted without the need for a transport permit. A case for preparation has been submitted to the Executive Yuan and distributed to relevant ministries and the governments of the three provinces and two municipalities for their subordinate inspection agencies to comply with.

Director Nie of the Cotton Industry Management Office Resigns

Since the government announced the order to purchase cotton yarn and cotton cloth in August of last year, the Office for the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth was immediately established, and Mr. Nie Lusheng, a leader in the yarn factory industry, was appointed as the director. After the yarn and cloth registration procedures were completed, the office was reorganized into the Cotton Industry Management Office, with Mr. Nie still serving as the director. It is now reported that Mr. Nie has recently applied to the Business Coordination Committee to resign due to his physical inability to handle the complicated matters. The letter of resignation states, "To the esteemed Sirs: When the purchase of yarn and cloth was concluded, I explained to you that I would retire once the reorganized office was in good shape. Now that the purchasing affairs, due to the retail merchants, cloth merchants, cotton weaving factories, and applicants for sale who have deposit certificates, the cotton yarn and cloth have all been granted a delay in inspection and acceptance. There are not many tasks remaining in the future. All of the fixed-term deposit certificates for the goods that have been inspected and accepted in the past, whether in whole or in part, have been prepared, but more than one hundred copies have not been issued because the sellers have not come to collect them. The allocation affairs have been entrusted to Deputy Directors Sun and Benda by you. As for important official affairs, I rely on you to preside over them, and the pending documents are handled by the various committee members. The daily events are the responsibility of the two deputy directors and the various departments. The reorganization has been largely completed. Since taking office in August of last year, Lusheng has made few contributions to the association and has been of no benefit to the industry. Although I have tried to be public-minded, I am only ridiculed for being a sinecure. In addition, I have become lazy and accustomed to being at home in recent years. It is difficult for me to cope with sudden complexity and my energy is not enough. Recently, I often feel uneasy and sleepless after reading documents and talking, delaying official business and misleading others and myself. Reflecting on myself, I feel uneasy. I hereby resign from the position of Director of the Cotton Industry Management Office from today and respectfully request that you send someone to succeed me so that I can relieve myself of this responsibility. I eagerly await your orders. This is presented to Chairman Tang, February 16, 33rd year of the Republic."

### Methods for Transferring Vegetables, Fruits, Etc. from North China to Central China; First Obtain a Transport Permit from the Central Market

Central News Agency News - In order to promote the exchange of materials between North China and Central China to a more ideal stage, the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy has assisted the Shanghai Special Municipality's Central Market in repeatedly conducting detailed negotiations with the control agencies in North China, the North China Trade Control Headquarters, last year. Until recently, a concrete decision has been made. The Shanghai Office of the North China Trade Control Headquarters and the Central Market will jointly announce today (20th): Starting March 1st, anyone who wants to transfer vegetables, fruits, dried fruits, and other agricultural products produced in North China (Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Zhifu, Henan, etc.) to various places in Central China must first obtain a transport permit from the Central Market to facilitate collection and transportation. It is said that Central Market Director Tao Wenqi specially made an important statement yesterday, saying: "Under the wartime controlled economy, the exchange of materials must be planned. The joint new facilities of the North China Trade Control Headquarters and this market will facilitate the transfer of materials from North China and make the operation of materials in North China and Central China smooth. It is expected to contribute to the supply of materials and the suppression of prices. In order to make this material exchange policy foolproof, this market has recently conducted detailed and full discussions with the relevant authorities, making it as convenient as possible for merchants to collect and transport North China products. In the past, exchange rates and other issues have caused much inconvenience, but in the future, this market will strive to solve the difficulties."

### China United Film Company's Screening of "Invincible Piefu" Film

In order to introduce "Invincible Piefu," produced by Japan's Daiei Motion Picture Co., Ltd., and to announce the details of "Spring River Regret," a collaborative project between China and Japan soon to begin filming, the China United Film Company held a special screening yesterday at 3:30 PM on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel, inviting guests from all walks of life in the city.

General Manager Feng delivered a speech introducing "Spring River Regret," followed by a speech from the renowned Japanese director Inagaki, who introduced the Japanese stars. The event concluded at around 6:00 PM with the guests and hosts parting on good terms.

Broadcasting time yesterday: 7:20 PM

Industrial Fuel Distributed Regularly

Since the start of the Lunar New Year, most factories in the city have been operating at a standstill or half capacity. The reason for this is the doubled manufacturing costs, high expenses, and the lack of raw materials. However, it appears that factories have been able to obtain sufficient daily fuel (smelting coal). Moreover, due to recent restrictions on electricity supply and other factors, they only operate during the day and rest at night, so their coal consumption is somewhat lower than in the past. However, coal distribution continues uninterrupted, so the fuel needs of most factories should not be a problem.

### Prices for Buying Hemp Determined

Last year's hemp production saw a bumper harvest in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, with statistics indicating an increase of more than 30% compared to the previous year. To facilitate the purchase of hemp, the authorities concerned formulated unified measures for implementation. To encourage farmers to willingly sell and continue planting, the purchase prices were also raised as much as possible. Recently, it was learned from relevant sources that purchase prices in various regions have been determined. However, because the harvests in different regions vary slightly, prices will also be adjusted accordingly. The purchase prices in the Suzhou area are divided into three grades: 800 yuan for Grade 1, 750 yuan for Grade 2, and 700 yuan for Grade 3. The Nantong area is about 600 yuan, and the Linping area near Hangzhou is about 500-600 yuan.

### From the Revival of Oriental Culture to the Responsibility of Chinese Military Advisor's Aides: A Speech Given to Japanese Military Advisor Officers on the 3rd of this Month

— Xiao Shuyi

The Relationship Between the Revival of Oriental Culture and the Greater East Asia War

Oriental culture has a long history of thousands of years. When Oriental culture had reached a considerable height, most Western ethnic groups were still in a barbaric era. This is recognized by the world. However, for hundreds of years, Oriental nations either closed themselves off, or declined, gradually weakening. Western nations, on the other hand, seized their utilitarianism, crossed the sea to invade the East, and became strong. In the past, our Oriental nations went from prosperity to decline, while Western nations went from decline to prosperity. Now, our Oriental nations will go from decline to prosperity, and Western nations, such as British and American imperialists, will inevitably go from prosperity to decline. This is the law of historical change. The Sino-Japanese Incident was indeed unfortunate for the two major nations of China and Japan, but because of this incident, Japan confirmed that the fighting spirit of the Chinese army far surpasses that of Britain and the United States. If this strong fighting spirit is strengthened with strict education and training, it will definitely be able to jointly defend East Asia with Japan. Furthermore, the power demonstrated by the Japanese army, navy, and air force in the Greater East Asia War, and the great success achieved, are unprecedented in the history of warfare. It can be judged that the final victory of the Greater East Asia War will definitely belong to us. Taking the victory of the Greater East Asia War as an opportunity, Oriental culture will surely be revived, and the East Asian nations will surely be liberated.

The Essence of Oriental Culture – "Benevolence"

The essence of Oriental culture is "benevolence." To explain benevolence, one must mention Chinese Neo-Confucianism. Mr. Wang Yangming's explanation of "benevolence" is to preserve heavenly principles and eliminate human desires. If a person can constantly remember to preserve heavenly principles, and not allow a bit of selfishness to obscure the essence of benevolence, the essence of benevolence will naturally manifest itself. Chinese Confucianists often say that great benevolence leads to great courage. Confucius said "sacrifice oneself to achieve benevolence," and Mencius said "give up life for righteousness." These are both acts of great courage. Why can a person voluntarily sacrifice himself? Because benevolence and righteousness are more valuable than one's body and life. Therefore, it is said that great benevolence leads to great courage. This is true for individuals, and it is also true for nations. There is an ancient Chinese saying: "An army that is upright is strong, while an army that is crooked is old." It also says, "An army must have a just cause." Taking the Greater East Asia War as an example, the Oriental nations are being invaded and forced to fight. They are fighting to win liberation, so naturally they are confident and have a just cause. Britain and the United States are invaders, fighting to invade other nations to satisfy their desires. Their cause is unjust, so their principles are crooked and their spirit is weak. In terms of benevolence and courage, we are sure to win, while Britain and the United States are sure to lose.

The Expression of Benevolence is "Sincerity"

Benevolence is the essence of the heart, so human nature is inherently good. Therefore, Mencius said that human nature is good. However, when intentions arise, they may be tempted by external things or obscured by selfish intentions, leading to evil. If we can eliminate selfish desires and keep the essence of our hearts pure and without dross, we will not generate great evil intentions. This is called sincerity. Therefore, the expression of benevolence is "sincerity."

"The effect of sincerity is great. I can share a few Chinese maxims with you: 'Without sincerity, there is nothing.' 'Nothing' refers to matters, meaning that if you are not sincere, nothing can be accomplished. Everyone, think about it. If your intentions are not sincere, you cannot even talk about dealing with people, let alone shouldering and completing the great cause of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, you must be sincere in everything you do, especially when doing big things. It is said: 'Where sincerity reaches, metal and stone will be opened.' This means that the power of sincerity is extremely great, and even things as firm as metal and stone can be opened. Taking East Asian nations as an example, we are not afraid that the various nations cannot unite, but only that sincerity is not fully realized. It is said: 'Utmost sincerity moves people.' Human beings are inherently emotional animals and easily react. If you treat people with utmost sincerity, they will naturally be moved. It is also said: 'Utmost sincerity is enough to move heaven and earth.' This means that sincerity can not only move people, but also move heaven and earth. This is because sincerity can unite with heaven, earth, and all things."

The Effort of Sincerity is "Investigating Things"

"Things" – I have already told everyone that this refers to matters. "Investigate" means "rectify." The so-called "investigating things" is to remove what is incorrect and rectify it. Incorrectness arises from selfishness, which is insincerity. If we can constantly remember to eliminate selfish desires and preserve heavenly principles in all matters, so that no evil arises from our intentions, and constantly reveal the essence of benevolence at all times and in all places, this is investigating things, which is the effort of sincerity. However, it is easy to say, but difficult to do. Often, people initially try their best to be sincere, but become discouraged and annoyed because the other party cannot understand. This feeling of annoyance is also a kind of selfishness, not sincerity. Or, they become unhappy, leading to impolite words, slow attitudes, and uncivilized actions. This then becomes malice, not sincerity. It is a pity when sincerity begins but ends in malice. As for those who have no sincerity from the beginning, they are even more unacceptable and unqualified to shoulder this epoch-making great undertaking. For example, Chinese people often say that Japanese people have a sense of superiority. I do not deny this, because no matter how well trained the citizens of Japan are, it cannot be guaranteed that no one will suffer from this problem. But I can honestly say that most Japanese people do not have a sense of superiority. Many intellectuals not only do not have a sense of superiority, but also constantly use the words "sense of superiority" to self-reflect and self-admonish, and to warn their compatriots. I admire them very much. At the same time, I hope that the few Japanese people who have a sense of superiority can eliminate this sense of superiority. If they have a sense of superiority, their intentions will not be sincere, which will lead to rejection. This will create a gap between nations and hinder East Asian unity, making it impossible to jointly shoulder the great mission of liberating East Asia. In the war to liberate East Asia, Japan stands in a leadership position. Every Japanese person should uphold the highest will of their government and use sincerity to influence other nations. Even if the other party cannot understand immediately, they must be patient and treat others with sincerity at all times. Human emotions are universal, and eventually they will be moved.

The Effort of Sincerity Lies in "Self-Restraint and Forgiveness of Others" (Preserving Forgiveness)

How can we put in the effort of sincerity? First, we must "restrain ourselves and forgive others." There is a saying in ancient Chinese books: "Restraining oneself can return to ritual." Ritual is reason. Because one can restrain oneself, one can obtain half of the reason. The so-called restraining oneself is, as I just said, when we have tried our best to be sincere, but the other party still does not understand, we should not blame the other party first. Instead, we should reflect on ourselves, whether it is because we are impatient and quick-tempered, and have not been able to express our sincerity? Or because there are misunderstandings between our words? Or because my sincerity is not enough to move people? I will try my best to be sincere again. This is "restraining oneself." If we have done the work of restraining ourselves, but the other party still does not understand, we must examine the reasons why the other party does not understand, whether it is because they are forced by circumstances, out of necessity, or obscured by other selfish desires, out of a temporary mistake. We should forgive their past mistakes, encourage their future, give them sympathy, and persuade them, until the other party is moved. This is "forgiving others," which is also "preserving forgiveness." Furthermore, differences in customs and habits are also most likely to cause misunderstandings. To give an example from a few years ago, Japanese sentries saw some Chinese people approaching their posts without taking off their hats, and thought it was disrespectful, feeling unhappy in their hearts. In fact, Chinese people are not used to taking off their hats, especially those in the countryside, who do not understand. It is not intentionally disrespectful. Now, Japanese people have gradually understood this. Everyone must understand that the customs and habits of your own country may not be known to the other party. This is understandable and you should not show anger. However, we must know the customs and habits of the other party and respect them. If we do not put in the effort of sincerity, and instead of examining ourselves, blame others, and show unhappiness, anger, and uncivilized actions when things do not conform to our habits, it will inevitably cause resistance from the other party, or face-to-face compliance but inner disagreement, forming a latent sense of resistance, which will then cause resistance. In the past, such things often happened between Chinese and Japanese people, which is very regrettable. Therefore, I have specifically mentioned this for your reference.

Educate and Train the Chinese Army with the Spirit of Benevolence and Sincerity to Cooperate in the Greater East Asia War

As I have already said, in the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has recognized that the fighting spirit of the Chinese army far surpasses that of Britain and the United States. If this is strengthened with strict education and training, it will definitely be able to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. To enable them to quickly shoulder this mission, we must strictly educate and train the Chinese army in a short period of time, so that it becomes a powerful army that can fight alongside the Japanese army and strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. This is my personal greatest hope.
