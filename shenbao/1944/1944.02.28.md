### INNOVATION FIRST: REITERATING OUR STANCE

Recently, some have distorted our stance in our commentary. We consider it beneath us and not worth refuting arguments based on temporary emotions and one-sided notions of self-interest. However, to affirm our position solemnly, we believe it is necessary to reiterate our stance. To facilitate understanding of our consistent commentary, we cite several passages from past writings.

In our editorial on April 24th of last year, titled "Supporting on One Hand, Urging on the Other," we said: "There are three types of those who oppose the peace movement. The first is the Chongqing regime; the second is the Communist Party; and the third is defeatists and wavering elements within the peace movement who, on the one hand, participate in the peace movement as a cover and, on the other hand, create various obstacles to hinder the progress of the peace movement. They hang up the signboard of participating in the peace movement while engaging in the dirty business of fishing in troubled waters... Since the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States on December 9th... the government's responsibility has become even heavier, and the government's actions are more closely related to the people. The government's affairs are the people's affairs, and the people's affairs are also the government's affairs. The government's measures should take the people as their premise, so that these measures can exert their full force... To create a landscape of unity between the government and the people, we need to support the government with utmost sincerity and urge the government with utmost strictness. The responsibility of our journalistic circles is to communicate the opinions of the government and the people, to announce the government's intentions to the people, and to convey the public's opinion to the government. Our advocacy is based solely on the opinions of the general public. If it is thought that our advocacy of 'improving the political structure,' 'clarifying politics,' 'reforming personnel,' and various political, economic, and social reforms is opposing the government, such a view is truly unacceptable... Only those who truly dare to offer candid advice are those who truly support the government; and only those people who truly dare to urge the government are modern citizens who love the country. We reiterate even more painstakingly: 'Supporting the government on one hand, with utmost strictness.' to inform those who generally misinterpret 'support' and 'opposition.'" The publication of this editorial is now ten months past.

In our commentary on December 9th of last year, titled "Our Stance," we said: "Our stance on the current situation is to support the Nanjing National Government's peace policy and national policy. At the same time, we will cooperate with the allied nations to complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War, with the recent Greater East Asia Declaration as the highest ideal. Our stance in expressing our views is to take the people's will as our guide. The people are the foundation of the nation, and the state is originally a collective of the people. Inspiring the people's love for their country is not difficult and can even be said to be innate. Whether it is promoted and to what extent depends, frankly speaking, on whether those in power value public opinion and cherish the people. If they do, how can the people not love the government and love the country? Based on this principle, we absolutely value public opinion, base our arguments on public opinion, and express public opinion. Even if this leads us to advocate political reform to the government with some frankness, we do not mind, because we believe that this attitude is the most sincere expression to the government. Because in today's era, hypocritical praise is something we are unwilling to say and we believe is also something that enlightened authorities are unwilling to hear." The publication of this commentary will soon be three months past.

The above citations can specifically illustrate our stance over the past year. Is it "nitpicking at the government at all costs"? Is it "to separate or even antagonize the people from the government"? "Is it to overthrow the government?" I think that even women and children who have a little understanding of right and wrong would never distort it!

What era is this now? Everyone knows that we are at the decisive juncture of the Greater East Asia War and should have long ago collaborated with real strength to practically participate in the war. Let us reflect on what strength we have exerted since we participated in the war for more than a year. More in writing? More in speech? Or more in real strength? China's current situation is very difficult. Chongqing relies on Britain and the United States, stubbornly drags on the war, and divides the national strength. The Chinese Communist Party is using Chongqing's dragging on the war and poor politics to expand and spread its power, becoming the only major future threat in East Asia. Within the peace zone, has politics been on the right track? Is there no economic crisis? Can the belief in peace and the belief in participating in the war be firm? Has the problem of people's livelihood gradually improved or is it gradually becoming more serious? Please remove your colored glasses and open your eyes to look around. China's current situation has reached the brink of the greatest crisis. If we do not earnestly save it and instead blame it all on the unavoidable difficulties of wartime, then the crisis in the future will erupt overnight, which is unimaginable. For example, in the month or so before and after the Lunar New Year, the general price of goods has risen wildly by multiples, especially the black market price of rice has risen shockingly. What a serious anomaly this is for people's livelihood, yet we are at a loss. How can we completely blame it on the unavoidable difficulties of wartime?

The crisis has reached such a serious point, and of course it is not entirely the fault of the government. The people also have half the responsibility. The current state of society is full of an atmosphere of speculation, opportunism, and straddling the fence, only knowing the private interests of the individual and disregarding the public interests of the masses. The more profound the phenomenon of speculation and opportunism becomes, the more degenerate national morality becomes, and the weaker the concept of public interest becomes, and the more the spirit of sacrifice is buried. The government and the people should be jointly responsible for the formation of this phenomenon. The factor in the formation of this phenomenon is that powerful people between officials and the people initiate it from above, and cunning people in the private sector imitate it from below. The government does not use its power to stop it, and the general public dares to be angry but dare not speak out. Thus, it gets worse and worse. What is regrettable is that China has not yet established a public opinion mechanism. The people have no other way to urge the government to pay attention and hope for improvement except to express their opinions in public discourse.

Politicians of all ages, also known as the ruling authorities, must have a spirit of courage to reflect, a spirit of courage to innovate, and a heart that feels hunger when the people are hungry and feels drowned when the people are drowning, and seek to improve the people's livelihood. Only then can this government have a bright future. If the people in power in a government are all loyal to the country and seek to improve the people's livelihood, the people will naturally be happy to endure pain and sacrifice everything. Allied nation Japan is a good example. They have a parliament and a Greater Japan Political Association, listening to the people's opinions as much as possible. The government and the people truly share weal and woe. Officials do not take advantage of their positions to fish in troubled waters, and the people naturally have no grievances. For example, in Japan, even the royal family and the children of senior statesmen are drafted into military service and sent to the front lines, while the sons of important people in China are reveling, gambling, and dancing in Shanghai. In Japan, the appointment of officials must be based on their talents and abilities to ensure that they are competent. In China, there are hooligans as police officers and unscrupulous party and government personnel deducting military rations. Are these also unavoidable difficulties of wartime? Although there are also self-respecting and law-abiding officials in our government, I still feel that they are not widespread and their number is too small.

In short, we oppose Chongqing's dragging on the war, starting from winning the hearts of the people, hoping that one day we will jointly participate in the construction of Greater East Asia. We oppose the Communist Party's conspiracies of sabotage, starting with political innovation, to strengthen the power to eliminate the Communist Party. We oppose the Anglo-American invasion of East Asia, starting with cultivating strength, to cooperate with allied nations to strive for victory in the war. We oppose the wavering elements and defeatists in the peace camp, eliminating speculation and opportunism, and strengthening the belief in peace.

Our attitude is as stated above, supporting the government no less than others, and what we should support most is political innovation. We believe that striving for victory is first and foremost a distant prospect across the water, and political innovation is a bridge. We must first build the bridge before we can cross the water and receive the distant prospect. If politics is not reformed, and we extravagantly talk about striving for victory, it is no different from imagining a distant prospect in a dream. We will say definitively: Innovation first! Innovation first!

### GRADUATION CEREMONY HELD AT OFFICER TRAINING CORPS: CORPS COMMANDER WANG SPECIALLY SENDS DEPUTY CORPS COMMANDER BAO TO GIVE INSTRUCTIONS

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Since its establishment in March of the 31st year [1942], the Central Army Officer Training Corps has been summoning officers of all ranks from the existing military forces nationwide in batches, organizing them into officer teams and cadre teams, and providing them with short-term training.

Attendees included heads of various organizations, Ye Peng, Ren Yuan, He Bingfu, Bian Ying, Zheng Dazhang, Qin Hanqing, and Allied Major General Chayama (representing Yoshino Hiroji), Lieutenant Colonel Tanaka, as well as all instructors, faculty, and over 300 students. After the graduation ceremony was held, the graduates of the two classes performed graduation exercises (platoon-level exercises). After the exercises, the graduation ceremony was held in the Corps' auditorium. After the chairman took his seat, the Corps Commander gave a training speech (Deputy Corps Commander Bao delivering it on his behalf). All the students were deeply moved. Allied Major General Chayama gave a speech (Yoshino Hiroji representing him), stating: "Today is the graduation day for the fifth class of officer teams and the seventh class of cadre teams, and also the second anniversary of the Corps. I feel very honored to participate in this grand ceremony. Under the guidance of all the officials, you have achieved such excellent results, which is commendable. Now that the Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage, since the National Government declared war, China and Japan have a relationship of sharing life and death. I hope that you will uphold the spirit of the Chairman and achieve the war's objectives." After the speech, Guan Zhizeng (representing all the graduates), a graduate student, gave a reply.

Corps Commander's Address

Corps Commander Wang's address was as follows: Today is the day we jointly hold the second anniversary commemorative ceremony of the establishment of the Corps and the graduation ceremony of the fifth class of officer teams and the seventh class of cadre teams. As the Corps Commander, I am unable to attend in person due to illness, so I have specially sent Deputy Corps Commander Bao to give the following instructions. The Central Officer Training Corps is the highest agency in the re-education of active-duty military officers. Its relationship with military construction is, of course, important, because it is necessary to have sound officers before one can establish a good army. The principle is obvious. Now, the Corps has graduated five classes of officer teams and seven classes of cadre teams. There is still one class of military research currently studying at the Corps. In total, no less than 3,000 people have graduated. Therefore, in the past two years, the work of reorganizing and building the army has also taken on a considerable scale and achieved results. Your stay at the Corps was very short, but you were able to diligently practice and make significant progress in the spirit, technology, and physical training taught at the Corps. I am deeply gratified. At the same time, it is also evident that the Allied advisors and the faculty of the Corps have provided effective leadership and education. I would like to express my deep gratitude to the advisors and faculty for their patient and hard work.

You are now at a critical juncture for the survival of the entire East Asian nation and the entire Chinese nation. Whether we seek life or death, whether we survive or perish, all depends on our efforts. I hope that you will all be at your respective posts, united in purpose and morality, courageous and diligent, and strive to complete our greatest mission. I am willing to encourage you all.

Subsequently, the representative of the graduates of the fifth class of officer teams and the seventh class of cadre teams of the Central Army Officer Training Corps gave a reply. The Director of Education of the Corps, Xiao Shuxuan, and all the officers and faculty members respectfully saluted Corps Commander Wang.

### Shanghai Journalists Association Welcomes Chairman Takaishi; Reception Hosted by This Newspaper Today at Noon

Mr. Takaishi, Chairman of the Mainichi Shimbun of Allied Japan, recently visited various southern regions to inspect economic construction and the newspaper industry. On his way back home, he passed through our country and arrived in Shanghai by plane at 1:30 PM the day before yesterday. Mr. Chen, the president of this newspaper, drove to the airport to welcome him. Chairman Takaishi and his party of seven stayed at the Cathay Hotel. The Shanghai Journalists Association expressed its welcome and hosted a banquet yesterday afternoon at the Industry and Commerce Association. Chairman Takaishi, along with Secretary Komatsu, Deputy Director of the East Asia Department Narita, and others, arrived on time. Also present were Mr. Matsudaira, the press officer of the Allied Japanese Embassy, Mr. Akahoshi, a commissioned officer from the Army Press Department, Lieutenant Commander Shiota from the Fleet Press Department, and from the Journalists Association: Mr. Osaka and Mr. Akamatsu from the Continental News, Mr. Xu Liqiu and Mr. Yan Jiabao from the China Daily, Mr. Chen Binhe from the Shen Bao, Mr. Shao Zhijun from the Ping Bao, Mr. Zhu Yongkang and Mr. Jiang Xiaoguang from the National News, Mr. Weng Yongqing and Mr. Lu Feng from the New China News, Mr. Moriyama Kyo from the New Shen Bao, Mr. Cheng Zhongquan and Mr. Zheng Hongyan from the News, and the association's general secretary, Mr. Ren Peng, and dozens of others. First, Mr. Zhu Yongkang, the chairman of the Journalists Association for the month and representative of the National News Agency, delivered a welcome speech, saying, "We are deeply honored to have Chairman Takaishi and everyone from the Mainichi Shimbun here today. Chairman Takaishi's inspection of Southeast Asia must have been very fruitful, and his contribution to the newspaper industry is especially great. The newspaper industry in Allied Japan is known to be highly developed. Compared to China's newspaper industry, Japan is in the position of an elder brother. Mr. Takaishi is a senior figure in the press, and we hope that he will not hesitate to give us guidance in the future so that China's newspaper industry can develop." Then,

Chairman Takaishi delivered a speech:

"I am truly unworthy of the chairman's praise just now. The chairman said that compared to China's newspaper industry, Japan is in the position of an elder brother, but I think it is difficult to distinguish who is the elder brother and who is the younger brother. However, since there is such a close relationship between elder brother and younger brother, they cannot be separated from each other. Among the guests present, some have attended newspaper conferences or literary conferences in Japan, and they have already met. I heard that they all praised the beauty of the Japanese countryside after returning home, but in fact, we see the Chinese countryside as equally beautiful. China and Japan are geographically closest. They are close neighbors, and they need to be connected to each other, which can be said to be determined by fate, not by coercion. I have a kind of ambition, which is that we do not allow Europeans and Americans to intervene. We East Asians create an East Asia for East Asians ourselves. This ideal is like building a house. Everyone must work together to lay the foundation and build the house. The power of our news media is very important, and we should work together to move towards this ideal. Every Japanese citizen understands Japan's policy towards China, and at the same time, they all understand the situation in China, so they feel even more necessary to work together to create a Greater East Asia. In addition, I am even more concerned that some places are inconvenient because of the war, but there is no need to worry about it. With our joint strength, we are enough to win the victory and realize our ideals. In order to further strengthen the friendship between the news media of the two countries, I would like to borrow the host's glass of wine to wish each other well-being and everyone good health." After the speech, the banquet began. During the banquet, Chairman Takaishi, Minister Matsudaira, and Mr. Chen, the president of this newspaper, exchanged various opinions on the technical aspects of the newspaper industry, which was extremely cordial. Today at 12 noon, this newspaper will host a frugal meal at the Holiday Hua Club.

Brief Biography of Chairman Takaishi

Chairman Takaishi is from Chiba Prefecture, the younger brother of Mr. Shirohei. He was born in September of the 11th year of Meiji (1878). In the 34th year of Meiji (1901), he graduated from the Faculty of Law of Keio University.

### Authorities Authorize Various Associations to Transfer and Distribute Allocated Materials; Distribute Fairly According to Actual Circumstances

The various industry associations in the city, in order to follow the intentions of the authorities and stabilize prices for a long time, have repeatedly requested the competent authorities to allocate sufficient materials or raw materials on a regular basis. The authorities have now approved, with reference to the actual situation, the allocation of the goods needed by the members of the industry for their business, and have authorized the industry association to be responsible for managing this matter and supervising the use of these allocated goods by the same industry. If there is any resale, it should be reported immediately so that it can be dealt with impartially.

It is heard that the method of transferring and distributing allocated materials is mostly based on the size of the business scope of each member, or the usual buying and selling situation, and is divided into four levels, A, B, C, and D, or other fair methods. However, those who have not joined the association as members are refused the right to enjoy the allocation. However, in order to prevent resale, it is stipulated that each member must submit a "Summary Table of Material Usage" for inspection every week or every ten days.

Pooling Funds for Direct Procurement

As for the various industry associations that have not obtained the right to allocate materials from the authorities, they all automatically raise capital and the association finds ways to directly procure from the production area. As soon as the procurement and transportation arrive in Shanghai,

This material will be transferred to the same industry based on the amount of funds recognized, but a limited price will be assessed in advance. At the same time, it is stipulated that all those who are wholesale must transfer the goods to the shops that operate such items, and those who are retail should sell them to legitimate users at the limited price in the store.

### Weekly Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions

Last week, the financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions in Shanghai were still stable. Since the authorities strictly cracked down on illegal transactions in the black market, the market situation has changed, and the money supply has been calmed immediately. Because the money lending industry has been particularly cautious in lending, it is still tight. The stock market prices have fluctuated slightly, and it is difficult to be optimistic about future market prices. Last Tuesday, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce held a price coordination meeting in Shanghai. After the price control measures were decided, the rising price trend was curbed. However, the black market price was still driven up by hoarding and speculation merchants. The key lies in the fact that rumors are rampant in the market, and people are restless. It is learned that the authorities have decided on a thorough method for stabilizing finance and suppressing prices. It is expected that the trend of illegal transactions will soon be eradicated.
