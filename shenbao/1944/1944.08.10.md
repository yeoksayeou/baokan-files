### After the Fall of Hengyang

— Chen Binhe

Question: The U.S.-Chongqing troops exhausted all their efforts to defend Hengyang, but it was finally captured by the Japanese army a few days ago. What impact will this have on the future war situation on the mainland?

Answer: In the war situation on the Chinese mainland, Hengyang is one of the strategic focal points in the decisive stage. The U.S.-Chongqing forces aimed to control Hengyang as a base to shield the southwest and control the southeast, and as the central point of the mainland air force base network for air raids against Japan. Now that Hengyang has fallen, they can neither advance to prepare for the so-called major counter-offensive, nor retreat without losing the vanguard position of their "resistance" base. This will have a significant impact on the future of the U.S.-Chongqing forces.

Question: What is the significance of the Japanese army's occupation of Hengyang?

Answer: This time, the Japanese army's army, navy, and air force closely coordinated to advance the major battle in the border area of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong, and finally occupied Hengyang, completing the initial strategic goal, which is the cornerstone of victory in the decisive battle on the mainland. From then on, the greatest threat to peaceful regions and even air raids on Japan can be lifted; it can advance to open up the Beijing-Hankou and Guangzhou-Hankou railways, promote the full connection of the East Asian mainland railway, and integrate the mainland with Southeast Asia.

Question: Then the political significance of this occupation of Hengyang must also be significant, right?

Answer: From then on, the southwestern provinces of Guizhou, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan have been isolated from the southeastern half of the country east of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway. The anti-Japanese war zone has been further reduced, and the power of the peaceful zone has been expanded. The result is self-evident. Moreover, from then on, the Japanese army gained the initiative in military and political actions against the Chongqing forces, and the impact on the morale of the people under Chongqing's rule is also not to be ignored.

Question: At a time when the relationship between the U.S. and Chongqing is being adjusted as much as possible, what impact will the fall of Hengyang have on Chongqing's diplomacy?

Answer: First, the United States cannot help but increase its doubts about Chongqing's anti-Japanese strength; second, the Chongqing government and people will also lose faith in the strength of U.S. aid to China, because the U.S. army and air force directly participated in the "defense of Hengyang" this time. Third, the United States is doing its best to mediate the relationship between Chongqing and the Communist Party. After this military defeat, the future evolution of the situation is also worth noting.

Question: Some people say that the economic significance of the fall of Hengyang is greater than everything else. What do you think?

Answer: "If Hubei and Hunan are productive, the country is well-fed." This refers to the importance of the food production in the two Hunan provinces to the central provinces. Therefore, Hunan has been a strategic location for military strategists since ancient times, especially Hengyang, which is the intersection of the two major railways of Guangzhou-Hankou and Hunan-Guangxi. At the same time, it is also the hub of the Hunan-Jiangxi highway and water transportation. In recent years, it has been the material exchange center for the southwestern and southeastern provinces. Whoever obtains it dominates, and whoever loses it is in trouble. The reason is obvious. In addition, the output of military supplies such as chromium and tungsten in the Hengyang area is also considerable, which is especially important in the "total mobilization" during the decisive stage.

Question: What is the future of the war situation on the Chinese mainland?

Answer: This battle of Hengyang is not only a major battle on the Chinese mainland battlefield, but also has important significance for the East Asian war situation. At a time when the U.S. military vainly attempted to advance to the Japanese mainland with the "island-hopping strategy," it mainly relied on the coordinated actions of the mainland air force and the promotion of the mainland military counter-offensive for support. Now that this plan has become a bubble, it will naturally change the Pacific war situation.

The Japanese Government Strengthens Combat Power and Decides to Mobilize Science and Technology; Detailed Rules Announced Yesterday After Presentation

Tokyo, September 9th, Central News Agency: In order to mobilize the efficiency of science and technology and humanities and natural sciences, the Japanese government, on June 7th, formulated an investigation and research project based on the draft outline of the Imperial Order by the National General Mobilization Council. It was decided by the cabinet meeting on the 4th of this month and announced and implemented on the 9th after presentation. The purpose of this Imperial Order is to control investigation and research projects. The full text is divided into seventeen articles. According to Article 5 of the National General Mobilization Law, it stipulates cooperation in investigation and research business. According to Article 13, Paragraph 1 of the law, it stipulates the facility management of investigation and research projects. According to Article 16 of the law, it stipulates the commencement, transfer, abolition, and suspension of investigation and research projects. The general investigation and research institutions other than the scientific and technical institutions for investigation and research are under the guidance and supervision of the Cabinet, and the investigation and research mobilization headquarters appropriately operate them. The Technical Institute is responsible for the operation of scientific and technical research institutions. After the promulgation of this decree, investigation and research, which is the foundation for enhancing Japan's combat power, will have a groundbreaking leap forward.

### Strengthening Female Mobilization

Tokyo, September 9th, Central News Agency: In order to cope with the current stage of the decisive battle, the Japanese government once strengthened the mobilization of men in the military and labor circles, and the supply of labor gradually became insufficient. On the one hand, important departments such as coal mines, shipbuilding, iron pots, and national defense construction also gradually need to increase male labor. Therefore, the Japanese government has tried its best to plan to strengthen the mobilization of female labor in order to ensure male labor. The plan has now been drafted. At the cabinet meeting, Minister Hirose Atsushi explained in detail the matters concerning the regulation of the allocation of male workers, and it has been officially decided. The proposal will thoroughly strengthen female mobilization. At the same time, it will also restrict the employment of male employees and replace them with female employees in due course, and transfer male employees to other important departments in order to adapt to the allocation of labor, and to put the total labor force of men and women into the full-scale combat configuration.

### Japanese Elite Troops Sweep Away Remnants of Chongqing Troops Around Hengyang; U.S. Air Force Completely Defeated in Chinese Mainland

Tokyo, September 9th, Central News Agency: The U.S.-Chongqing Allied Forces tried their best to defend the important town of Hengyang, but it finally fell on the 8th. The Japanese army in Hunan Province, after capturing Changsha, immediately advanced southward along the Guangzhou-Hankou Line, approaching the outer perimeter of Hengyang. On June 26th, it occupied the airfield on the opposite bank of Hengyang City, and on the 28th, it completed the encirclement of Hengyang. In the past four weeks, the Japanese army surrounded Hengyang City with a portion of its forces, and annihilated the Chongqing Field Army in the east and west areas of the Xiangjiang River with its main force,迎击企冈解救衡阳之渝第九第六两战区军，并继续展开歼灭战.敵美鑑於衡陽在軍事上之重要性，爲堅守該市計，特　勵渝軍作戰，同時蔣介石氏亦因衡陽若一旦失陷，將予重廳政權以致命打擊，故命令部下死守. In view of the military importance of Hengyang, the enemy U.S. forces encouraged the Chongqing troops to fight in order to defend the city. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek also ordered his subordinates to defend the city to the death, because if Hengyang were to fall, it would deal a fatal blow to the Chongqing regime. In order to defend the city, the operational instructors of the U.S. and enemy armies guided the defense operations, and at the same time mobilized the U.S. Air Force to do their best to cover Hengyang. Therefore, the number of planes flying over the battlefield every day has reached more than 100. During the second Changsha campaign in January of the 31st year of the Republic of China, Fang Xianjue, the commander of the 10th Army and the defense commander of Changsha, won the title of anti-Japanese hero with false propaganda. This time, in the Hengyang campaign, he personally led about four divisions to defend the city, relying on air supplies from outside and reinforcements from the periphery, resisting stubbornly. After the elite Japanese army annihilated the Chongqing Field Army, they began to prepare to attack the city. At dusk on August 4th, with the cooperation of the air force, they launched a general attack, and in three and a half days, they annihilated the four divisions of the Chongqing army in the city. At 8:08 a.m. on August 8th, they completely occupied Shuyang. This was the 41st day since the attack was launched. The Japanese army is still sweeping away the Chongqing Field Army around Hengyang.

Central News Agency: After the fall of Hengyang, Chinese officials and civilians believe that it will have a great impact not only militarily, but also economically and politically. Although the future actions of the Japanese army cannot be predicted, the past several Hunan campaigns have been a series of battles. It can also be understood that after the Japanese army controls Hengyang and Changsha, not only will the obstacles to new military operations on the Guangzhou-Hankou and Hunan-Guangxi lines be eliminated in the future, but also important materials such as antimony and tung oil exported to the United States economically will fall into the hands of the Japanese army. After the Japanese army maintains Hunan Province, the lives of the people under the rule of the National Government of Shanghai and Nanjing will become more stable, and the benefits that the Shanghai financial community will receive in the future are quite promising.

Enemy U.S. Air Force Suffers Heavy Losses

A certain base on the Chinese Front, September 9th, Central News Agency: Japanese aircraft fought with the U.S. Air Force over the Hengyang war zone. Since the Japanese army occupied the Hengyang airfield in late June, the Chongqing troops guarding Hengyang have continued to resist and have been ordered to defend the city to the death. This move was made at the request of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing. Because if the Japanese aircraft can fly freely over Hengyang, Guilin will become a completely forward base, and the forward bases of Suichuan, Jianchang, and Yushan will also be completely isolated and helpless. Therefore, the U.S. Air Force made this request, and at the same time, with all the efforts it had made in the past, it cooperated with the Chongqing troops and poured all its air force to counterattack. Therefore, the number of U.S. and Chongqing aircraft operating on the Hunan front has reached more than 2,000. They repeatedly attacked the Japanese army's rear supply line day and night, and blindly bombed the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force for four weeks since June, fighting each other to the death for the defense of Hengyang. The most intense of these was the supply war launched by both sides in the air against Hengyang. As for the fall of Hengyang, it can be said that the U.S. Air Force has completely failed in the Japanese-U.S. air battle. At this point, the air war on the Chinese mainland has entered a landmark stage. The future air war is the advancement of the Japanese Air Force base and the launch of a new air war.

Pingxiang and Liling Expand the Results of the Battle

A certain base on the Chinese Front, September 9th, Central News Agency: The Japanese army in the Pingxiang and Liling areas is still continuing to carry out annihilation battles, and is thoroughly sweeping away the defeated Chongqing army in the vicinity. Since the 2nd, in the Baizhu area (about 40 kilometers south of Liling), they have continued to carry out a heroic annihilation battle against the remaining main force of the 72nd Army of Chongqing. The Chongqing army in this area is the 34th Division of the 72nd Army. The mountains around Baizhu are steep and the dense forests continue, so the Japanese army attacking continuously is extremely difficult. At this moment, the Japanese army is gradually shortening the encirclement and attacking the Chongqing army's positions everywhere, expanding the results of the battle.

The Morale of the Chongqing Troops is Low

Central News Agency: A student who recently fled here from Chongqing stated regarding the dynamics of the people in Chongqing that recently, if two or more young students in Chongqing gather together to discuss the reasons for this defeat, they all vehemently denounce the decadence of Chongqing. They strongly criticize the weakness of the Chongqing army, which loses every battle, and the U.S. army's empty words of assistance. The reasons for Chongqing's defeat that they pointed out are mostly the following: The front-line troops have been stationed in one area for a long time, resulting in low morale. The commanders of the stationed troops routinely collude with the local people to enrich their own pockets, so the soldiers naturally imitate them, and military discipline is therefore relaxed. The supply of weapons and ammunition to the Chongqing army is not smooth, and the results of U.S.-style training are not as good as they are advertised. Soldiers receive 180 yuan per month, which is difficult to maintain any life. Due to the exploitation of the people by the army, the separation between the army and the people is very deep. Regarding the above four points, the Chongqing authorities shirk their responsibility, saying that the defeat of Chongqing is due to the inadequacy of British and American aid. The strength of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing is weak, making it difficult to prevent the Japanese army from attacking. The British and American armies and advisory groups, shamelessly, said that there was no need to defend Changsha and Luoyang to the death. The fall of Hengyang this time may also say that there is no way to defend it to the death, and vigorously avoid the responsibility for the defeat. In order to protect the lives and property of all the people, they retreated. The combat power is all used to shirk responsibility, and they have fallen into an atmosphere of attack and critical illness among the youth.

### Japanese Army Attacks Leizhou Peninsula

A certain base on the Chinese Front, September 9th, Central News Agency: The Japanese army in the Leizhou Peninsula is advancing every day with the mutual cooperation of the army. The Japanese dive bomber team, at dawn on the 2nd, fiercely bombed the fortifications of the Chongqing army's frontal positions on the Matouling, 10 kilometers north of Suixi, as well as the Chongqing army gathered near Liangdongxu, 10 kilometers east of the area. On the 5th, they again bombed the Chongqing army near Chiling, 8 kilometers northwest of Liangdongxu. At dawn on the 4th, in response to the attack on Lianjiang by the ground troops, they bombed the Chongqing army's positions on the highlands north of the area. The Japanese ground troops attacked along the trails, inflicting heavy damage on the Chongqing army. The area is very close to Danzhu, the mobile base of the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force, but there is no trace of the enemy, indicating that the enemy's air force has been weakened.

### The Ministry of Industry Sends Personnel North to Discuss Material Exchange; Fuel Problem Expected to be Solved

Nanjing, September 9th, Central News Agency: In order to ensure an abundant supply of materials, smooth material exchange between the north and the south, and to dredge the source of coal in central China to solve the difficulties of power raw materials and fuel, the Ministry of Industry decided to send Tao Guoxian, director of the Commercial Affairs Department of the ministry, to the north to discuss countermeasures with relevant parties in North China.

### Enemy Aircraft Bombing Yellow River Bridge Shot Down

Beijing, September 9th, Central News Agency: Two P25 aircraft of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing bombed the vicinity of the Yellow River Railway Bridge on the Beijing-Hankou Line on the 3rd. Due to the obstruction of anti-aircraft fire from the Japanese army's ground troops, they blindly dropped bombs and fled. One of them crashed near Guanzijie (35 kilometers southwest of Luoyang) due to being hit by bullets. The wreckage of the aircraft and the bodies of the pilots have been discovered by the Japanese army's guard team.

### Japanese General Araki Talks About the Essence of Modern Warfare

Tokyo, September 9th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Toyo Culture Summer University has started as usual in Karuizawa since the 7th. There are Japanese, Europeans, people from various parts of the Co-prosperity Sphere, and Indians listening to the lectures. On the first day (7th), Baron Araki Sadao, a general, lectured on the essence of modern warfare with the theme of the purpose of war. In particular, the general explained the meaning of "Wu" as follows: In the British and American war methods, there is quite a bit of interest. "Wu," although only regarded as militarism, is now generally referred to as "Wu," which is completely different from the concept of militarism. Japanese people use the Japanese sword method to best express the spirit of "Wu." Japanese soldiers will never use the Japanese sword to commit innocent massacres, or simply defend themselves and cause useless bloodshed. Therefore, they always move their swords to uphold justice, that is, Japan is seeking world peace so that all mankind can obtain what they deserve, and wield its righteous sword. Therefore, the purpose of the Great East Asian War has always been based on the traditional spirit of Bushido.

Director of the Information Department Izubuchi Talks About the Hengyang Capture Battle; The Japanese Army Will Occupy an Extremely Favorable Advantage in the Future

Yesterday, Director of the Information Department Izubuchi of the Japanese Army Department held a regular press conference at the Cathay Hotel and made the following remarks regarding the fall of Hengyang: The director first said that Hengyang, which Chongqing and Chiang relied on as a copper wall, was finally captured by the Japanese army yesterday (8th). The fall of Hengyang has given a thorough and major blow to the strategic situation of the U.S. Air Force and the Chongqing army stationed in Chongqing in the future. Hengyang is an important place in Hunan in terms of politics and economy. The Japanese army's capture of the area this time occupies an extremely favorable advantage in any aspect of the attack in the future. Therefore, the fall of Hengyang this time has caused heavy and huge losses in both spirit and material to the Chongqing side, especially those suffered by the U.S.-Chongqing forces, which are major and fatal.

U.S. Military Plan Becomes a Bubble

The following is a detailed description: First, the U.S. military, which intends to use the Chongqing side's combat power and mainland bases to encircle the Japanese army from the mainland, has completely turned into a bubble due to the capture of Hengyang this time. Second, the fall of Hengyang also determines the entire fate of Hunan, the treasure house of China. In particular, it is completely impossible for the U.S. to grab Hunan's rich mineral resources in Chongqing. Third, after the Hengyang airfield becomes the Japanese Air Force base in the future, the important areas that the U.S. Air Force in Central and South China rely on as the heart will be lost, and the U.S. military that uses the Chinese mainland will be completely unable to restore its power and fall into a desperate situation.

The Result of Being an Appendage to Britain and the United States

The director also said that in the Hengyang capture battle, the Japanese army annihilated four divisions of the Chongqing army, which is the result that the British and American Air Force should have obtained. The Imperial Government has repeatedly stated that those who refuse to cooperate with Britain and the United States, even the Chongqing army, are not the enemy of the Japanese army, let alone the people. The Japanese army's capture of Hengyang and other places in the past was all based on this spirit and was successfully completed. In this Hengyang and other battlefield, the Chongqing army annihilated by the Japanese army is, in terms of the nature of the army, truly Chongqing, and can be said to be the appendage army of the U.S. military. The Japanese army attacked Hengyang for more than a month. The enemy in Hengyang has indeed tried its best to fight, and its cooperation with the U.S. military can also be said to be close. Unfortunately, this kind of effort only helps the ambition of the United States and Britain to invade East Asia and sacrifice China. It does not make any contribution to the East Asian nation. To the majority of the Chongqing army who sacrificed in the Hengyang battlefield, their bravery is admirable, but their foolishness and misjudgment of the country are regrettable and deplorable, and I feel infinite sympathy.

### Main Culprits in Military Treason Case; Eight Executed by Hanging Yesterday; German Official Announcement of Court Trial Process

Berlin, September 9th, Central News Agency: Haitong News: The Berlin People's Court sentenced eight main culprits in the July 20th coup to death. Last night, an official announcement was made stating: "The Great German People's Court interrogated eight traitors who participated in the July 20th crime on the 7th and 8th. The criminals have been expelled from the military, including: Wieselerben, Hopner, Steve Haas, Bernardis, Krausing, Wartenburg, and Hagen. They were sentenced to death for treason and their property was confiscated. Two hours after the verdict, the defendants were executed by hanging.

Details of the Trial Berlin, September 9th, Central News Agency: Haitong News: The trial of the eight main culprits who assassinated the German leader was held in the Prussian Supreme Court. The outside world did not know about the trial beforehand, so there were no crowds outside the courthouse, nor were there any police officers on alert. However, at the entrance of the courtroom, the listening permits were strictly checked. The courtroom was rectangular in shape and simply furnished with busts of Frederick the Great and the German leader. There were five windows on the wall, which were wide open due to the hot weather.

Three banners with the "卍" symbol were hung in the center of the hall. The presiding judge of the People's Court, Franzlou, sat in the center. On either side of the long table were the infantry general Nagger and the court adviser Laimer, who were the jury members. Opposite the wall were two seats for the eight defendant lawyers, all wearing black uniforms. Behind them were two rows of benches for the defendants. A policeman sat between each defendant to separate them. The seats of the prosecutors were also on the opposite wall. The seats for newspaper reporters and stenographers were on the table in front of the defendants, followed by the seats for photographers. Approximately 200 people attended as listeners, including military and National Socialist Party officials and civilians. Because the evidence was conclusive, each defendant confessed to their crimes in the shortest time. Therefore, the trial proceeded extremely smoothly.

### General Offensive Begins in Normandy and Brittany; Germany Tries to Prevent Enemy from Advancing Inland

Berlin, September 9th, Central News Agency: Haitong News: The situation in the northwestern France war zone remains undecided. The anti-Axis forces are trying to maintain their initiative and expand their occupied areas as much as possible. The German army is able to operate more freely to implement its countermeasures. The focus of the German counter-offensive is not in Brittany, but in the interior of France, because there is a large concentration of reserve troops in the area, which is more predictable. Because it is very difficult for large armies to move to Brittany, the German army allows the national troops in the area to resist on their own. The U.S. armored columns that drove straight into the peninsula have been blocked near Saint-Malo, Brest, Lorient, and Saint-Nazaire. In Normandy and the lower Loire River, the U.S. Third Army, which advanced eastward and southeastward, has slowed down after making some progress. The main force of the army is still along the Mayenne River, and its vanguard is attacking the Sarthe River in Versailles. The fighting in Normandy is still fierce. The right wing of the U.S. First Army between the upper reaches of the Seiron River and the West River encountered a partial counter-offensive by the German army. Although the enemy army had the cover of a superior air force, it was unable to stop the German counter-offensive. The German armored columns advanced several kilometers westward. North of the West River, the U.S. military, which was advancing eastward in the Selins and Saint-Poix area, continued to exert pressure, but gained very little. Other units of the army penetrated deep into the German positions from Vire, and fierce fighting is currently underway. The British Second Army attacked the new German defense line between Vire and Tullehacourt, but the scale was not large. There is still a major battle between Tullehacourt and Poulet. The British army attacked eastward, occupied the city of Grimbasque after crossing the Aunay River. The initial German counter-attack was able to drive the enemy back to the banks of the Aunay River. The enemy then mobilized a large number of reinforcements and re-entered the city of Grimbasque and its surrounding forests. There is still a battle for control there. The Canadian army's frontal attack on the line failed. On Monday, the enemy intensified pressure on the area and between the Aunay and Caen-Falaise highways.

### Only Artillery Battles on Italian Front

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency telegram) - Reuters reports that after the Anti-Axis forces attempted a small-scale sudden attack on the north bank of the Arno River at the end of the week, aiming to establish a bridgehead but failing, Monday's fighting was limited to artillery battles and reconnaissance activities. There were no major battles elsewhere on the Italian front. The enemy is currently deploying everything in preparation for another attack. The German army's purpose in fighting in Italy is to delay time, so the enemy's slow offensive is also gaining time for the German side.

### Heavy Fighting on Two Focal Points of Eastern Front - Battle for Warsaw Begins in Suburbs

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency telegram) - Reuters reports that Soviet pressure remained on two focal points of the Eastern Front today. The Soviet army is using large forces in combat, and the German army's resistance continues to be strong, launching counterattacks from time to time. In the south, the Soviet army is concentrated in the Vistula River bend, and in the north, they are advancing towards the East Prussian border. The enemy is now sending large forces across the Vistula River in an attempt to capture Warsaw from the west bank of the river. In Baranow, ten divisions of infantry and four tank brigades penetrated the German lines for several hundred meters before being stopped. Five divisions of Soviet infantry launched an offensive south of Warsaw. Their numerical superiority initially achieved some gains, but after a German surprise attack on their right flank, they had to reduce their pressure. The focus of the Soviet offensive in East Prussia is northwest of Kaunas in Lithuania. In that area, the enemy deployed nine divisions of infantry and two tank brigades, penetrating the German lines. Hundreds of German aircraft assisted in the counterattack, completely filling the gap. The Soviet offensive towards Riga in the Bauska-Bauske region has been suppressed, and fighting is still ongoing in the areas penetrated by the Soviet army.

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to comprehensive news from the German front lines, the German army in the Carpathian region and southwest of the Tatar Hills shortened its battle lines on the 7th on a large scale according to operational plans, holding new positions to resist the Soviet army. The Soviet army in the Baranow area of the Vistula River bend broke into the German positions and then attempted to expand the breakthrough area to the north. After fierce fighting, the Soviet army advanced several kilometers, after which a fierce German counterattack repelled them. In Warsaw, the German garrison in the city of Warsaw and Polish guerrillas engaged in fierce fighting in the suburbs, with the German army achieving a complete victory. In East Prussia, German forces in Wirballen launched a fierce counterattack, sealing off the Soviet breakthrough and defeating a strong Soviet force in the north.

### Mainland Air War Situation - US Air Force Activity in Chongqing Obstructed

On the morning of July 13th, the aviation fortress of Guilin, an advance base of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, was bombed. A total of eighty-nine enemy aircraft caught fire and were destroyed. The Japanese bombers that achieved this remarkable feat were meticulously manufactured aircraft. The engines, wings, and even every small nail embodied the precious spirit of wartime industrial warriors. Thinking of this, these aircraft are truly worthy of respect. The following is a report on how these aircraft are active on the mainland front:

These bombers were dispatched at night to bomb the U.S. Air Force base stationed in Chongqing, achieving remarkable results each time. Since July, nineteen aircraft were destroyed in Zhijiang, Hunan Province on the 3rd, eight aircraft were destroyed in Ganzhou, Jiangxi Province on the 7th, twenty-eight aircraft were destroyed in Guilin on the 9th, fifty-one aircraft were destroyed in Zhijiang again on the 12th, and eighty-nine aircraft were destroyed in Guilin on the 13th. Summarizing the overall results since January of this year, more than 400 enemy aircraft have caught fire and been destroyed. None of the enemy's major bases scattered across the mainland have escaped the night raids of Japanese bombers.

These bombers were also used to pursue, immediately bomb, and retaliate against the American B24 aircraft that raided Kitakyushu on June 16th. In night air combat, they never get lost and can always reach their destination accurately to bomb it. The enemy aircraft at the base are enemy aircraft waiting to invade the Japanese mainland. Destroying these enemy aircraft means preventing air raids on the mainland. Thanks to the bombers and fighters fighting together on the mainland, the enemy feels very threatened, and the Japanese mainland can rest easy. Often, one aircraft destroys dozens of enemy aircraft, so the presence of one Japanese aircraft prevents dozens of enemy air raids on the mainland. In this sense, all industrial warriors across the country! Please build more aircraft and send them to the front. The air force on the mainland, forgetting their own achievements, only expresses its sincere gratitude and waits for you to manufacture more excellent aircraft and send more aircraft to the front.

A certain unit commander's change

I talked with a unit commander at a press conference and learned about the situation of the mainland air war. The following is a record of it:

Reporter: What is the significance of our current operations?

Unit Commander: In order to carry out its mission, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing selected a base for air raids on Japan in the eastern military region of China. In the vast area east of Guilin, countless air fortresses are being built. Our army, without waiting for its completion, preemptively began the operation to crush this attempt. The arrogant enemy is withdrawing its frontal armies from the southeast and northern fronts, focusing its main forces on the Kunming-Chongqing line, and scattering a strong mobile force in the bases of Guilin, Zhijiang, Danzhu, and Liuzhou, observing the gaps in our front line, and rapidly building central and northwestern bases as B29 launch points to once again invade Kitakyushu. The enemy's plan above, their strategy in mainland China, is a constant wave operation, that is, relying on a long period of wave-like fluctuations and attempting to make the waves rise higher and higher. Our unit uses quality and spiritual strength to confront the overwhelming material strength of the enemy, and under careful planning, carries out operations without interruption.

Reporter: How is the air power of both sides in China?

Unit Commander: For quantity, a certain limited amount is absolutely necessary. We have very little quantity, but that is enough. However, the soldiers' hope is to ask for more aircraft. Now, in view of the war situation in various aspects and the situation in the rear, the soldiers no longer make this request, but would rather use their boiling fighting spirit and qualitative excellence to make up for their shortcomings.

Reporter: What about the enemy situation in the future?

Unit Commander: Even if our side continues to achieve great victories, they are not to be despised. American aircraft will stubbornly advance to attack the bases in the northwest. (Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, July 18)

Within five minutes, all vehicles and vehicles stopped and lined up, and the prescribed time was restored. Pedestrians walked on the left side of the street. At 10:30 AM, the air raid alarm was activated. Vehicles were parked along the street, and pedestrians were guided by air defense personnel to nearby air raid shelters to implement traffic control. Each Bao automatically held various exercises. The Japanese aircraft took off and soared in the high altitude, making a rattling sound, and the atmosphere became more tense. At 11:30 AM, the air raid alarm was lifted and returned to the alert state. At 12:00 PM, the alert alarm was also lifted.

The second alarm was issued at 8:30 PM, and the city was in a state of air raid. In addition to implementing various controls such as traffic, light control was also emphasized. All street lights were turned off, and the adjustment of lights on various vehicles was also corrected and improved along the way by the police and Baojia personnel in shifts. Personnel were dispatched from each branch to patrol each lane, so the results were better than in the past. The city was in a state of darkness. Japanese aircraft took off to inspect and patrol, and the mood for air defense was very high. At 9:30 PM, the air raid alarm was lifted and switched to the alert alarm. Air defense street lights were turned on, but the light bulbs in stores and households were still not allowed to leak out. At 10:30 PM, all alert alarms were lifted and normal status was restored. The alarm drill was completed.

At the same time, each Baojia automatically held light control watch posts and surveillance teams. Air defense personnel supervised the public to pay close attention to light control, and personnel were dispatched from each police branch to each Baojia and air defense organization to check the preparation status of air defense beverages and fire-fighting water. The air defense water tank must be fully filled with water, and the various equipment such as air defense equipment must be thoroughly checked to avoid accidents that may hinder necessary air defense measures.

### Ministry of Welfare Recruiting Laborers

The Executive Yuan of the National Government ordered the Ministry of Social Welfare to actively recruit laborers. In addition to sending personnel to Shanghai to recruit, personnel have also been sent to the Bengbu and Xuzhou areas of Jiangbei. The recruited laborers are intended to be assigned to various mines and factories to work hard to increase production, especially coal miners, which are most needed. If coal production increases, Shanghai's electricity and tap water problems can be easily solved. The treatment for coal miners recruited this time is very generous. Those who bring their families to work together or join the group are very welcome. In addition, mine foremen who transport laborers are also very much needed, and their treatment is roughly the same as that of miners. Shanghai workers who are interested in the north or unemployed workers are requested to go to the following locations: No. 200 Yongkang Road (Remi Road), Shanghai Special City Vocational Guidance Center; Tianhouyu Bridge, Shanghai Special City Social Welfare Bureau; Social Insurance Bureau at the intersection of North Henan Road on Wujin Road (Target Road); No. 69 Zhaofeng Village, Yuyuan Road.

### Japanese Residents in Shanghai Enthusiastically Donate Money

The 100,000 Japanese residents in this city are becoming increasingly enthusiastic about donating money to pay back for the Battle of Saipan.

This shows the Chinese people's determination to carry out the Greater East Asia War.

### Director Gu of the Baojia Bureau Discusses Baojia Administration: Unifying the Baojia System Throughout the City

Since the unification of municipal police administration in this city, the baojia system throughout the city has also been moving towards unification. In the future, the connection between police and baojia will increasingly demonstrate the establishment of a new form. A Central News Agency reporter, in order to understand the police and baojia situation in the newly merged areas of the city, visited the Baojia Bureau of the Municipal Police Department yesterday (the 9th). There, Director Gu Baojia, Yuan Jiwu, granted an interview and made the following remarks:

Director Gu stated in brief: In the past, the baojia system in the southern districts newly incorporated into the city differed slightly from the system promoted by the current Baojia Bureau of the Municipal Police Department. Specifically, in terms of household registration, the population in the former southern city was required to report not only to the police station but also to the neighborhood public office. This dual requirement caused citizens to suffer the hardship of making multiple trips, and made it difficult to achieve ideal accuracy in population statistics. Furthermore, the distribution of material rationing certificates often caused confusion among citizens and increased unnecessary troubles. Now that the aforementioned areas have been newly incorporated into the city, according to the regulations of the baojia system of the Municipal Police Department, each police precinct will establish a baojia section. All procedures, including mobile registration, will be managed by the baojia sections of each precinct. Therefore, the incorporation of baojia into the municipal administration will implement a new system. Citizens will not only enjoy superficial benefits, but the issuance of orders by various administrative agencies and the implementation of government guidelines will be facilitated under a unified system. Therefore, the police bureau's handling of household registration is the most standard basis.

Therefore, the division of baojia areas is based on the scope of each police precinct. Each precinct's jurisdiction includes a joint bao, which is further divided into various baos, jias, and households. This unified regulation will apply equally to the newly incorporated areas of the city, and a new division will be made. The complicated and complex situation of the past is now expected to be clarified under a unified system. Other matters, such as the self-defense corps, will also be handled according to the unified organization and methods of the self-defense corps as stipulated. The police and civilians in the newly incorporated areas will cooperate closely in the future. Under the guidance of the soon-to-be-established headquarters of the self-defense corps, the effectiveness of self-defense itself will be developed. In addition, all measures, such as unified fee collection, will be implemented in the newly incorporated areas such as the southern city. In short, in this newly divided special area of the city, all measures related to baojia will be implemented separately and effectively. Finally, Director Gu stated that he will provide sufficient funds to the remote areas and increase equipment and self-defense corps members. Therefore, the newly incorporated areas in the southern city will also be similarly strengthened and managed, in order to ensure close cooperation between the police and baojia under the current system.

### Air Defense Film Week Successfully Concluded

The Shanghai Special Municipality Citizen Air Defense Headquarters, in order to enhance citizens' awareness of air defense, held an "Air Defense Film Week" from the 4th to the 9th of this month. Various air defense education films were screened at the Cultural Grand Theater, and baojia personnel and members of the air defense corps in this city were admitted free of charge. It is reported that a large number of people went to visit every day, unaffected by the hot weather. Moreover, the impressions gained after watching the films were very good, and they gained a lot of knowledge about various aspects of air defense. The Air Defense Headquarters expressed great satisfaction with this. The aforementioned Air Defense Film Week was successfully concluded yesterday (the 9th).

### Citywide Household Rice Universally Sold Today, Registration of Rice Stockpile Ends This Morning

Citywide household rice will be universally sold starting today. The registration of rice stockpiles implemented by the Materials Allocation Office will end this morning. If the quantity of rice stored by the entire civilian population is intentionally evaded, underreported, or concealed, it will be confiscated upon discovery. It is hoped that citizens will not take the risk of breaking the law for the sake of their own interests.

The Rice Control Committee previously formulated and announced the application for and issuance of passports for rice entering Shanghai, based on the temporary measures for rice for civilian consumption in Beijing and Shanghai. Now that the new issuance is about to begin, the application for and issuance of formal passports for ten stones or more up to 375 stones (300 bags) will be suspended on the 15th of this month. Applications for ten stones or less will continue to be processed.

### Short Comment: The Business Right of Tuition Standards

The Municipal Education Bureau, in order to reduce the burden on students' parents and at the same time take into account the balance of school income and expenses, has reportedly formulated tuition standards for public and private schools for the next semester. According to the tuition categories determined by most private schools at present, most of them exceed the standards. Whether the education authorities will strictly correct schools that exceed the standards is still up for debate, but I would like to say a word to the school authorities who charge tuition fees that exceed the standards.

At present, the price of everything is expensive, and it is understandable to increase tuition fees to ensure the minimum living standards of teachers and staff. However, based on past facts, the biggest reason why the lives of teachers and staff in various schools have become unsustainable is that some school principals only know how to take care of themselves and do not share the joys and sorrows with teachers and staff. Even though the lives of teachers and staff cannot be maintained, the principals can be very rich. Some use tuition income for stock trading, and some use tuition income to hoard goods for profit. Therefore, the treatment of teachers and staff in schools with higher tuition fees is not necessarily better than that in schools with lower tuition fees. This shows that increasing school fees is one matter, and whether the lives of teachers and staff will also be improved as a result is another matter.

Education is a "conscience undertaking." We hope that some principals will not be obsessed with money and regard education as a tool for making money for themselves. In fact, each school has its own different circumstances regarding tuition standards, and it may be difficult to set a uniform standard. However, the school authorities should understand that increasing the burden on students' parents means increasing the number of students who drop out of school, which increases the crisis of the future of the nation. They should seek peace of mind and make the most reasonable regulations.

### After Viewing Mr. Jiang Zhaohe's Painting Exhibition

— Green Duckweed

The Jiang Zhaohe Painting Exhibition, organized by Shenbao and others for scholarships, is being held at the Chinese Painting Academy. The exhibition will last until the 10th. The author braved the sweltering heat and stepped into the building, which is Western in its exterior but Chinese in its interior, with a quick glance. As soon as you enter the door on the third floor, you are confronted with a half-body portrait of a human figure. He uses rough brushstrokes to create a portrait of a strong young man who is only bare-handed. The majestic posture reveals a spirit of self-improvement. In the upper left corner, it is inscribed: "Generals and ministers are not born into it, men should be self-reliant." The portrait is staring forward with bright eyes, giving every viewer the impression of a "brand new feeling." Wouldn't it be better if he was holding a weapon with an appropriately light background?

A Grand View of Refugees

Refugees are displayed in the middle room. The content of the painting includes old and young, dead and wounded, lying supine, lying horizontally and diagonally, sorrow and resentment, and the state of being frightened and at a loss, limping and broken hands, wandering and hungry. The refugees only have an expression of "resigning themselves to fate." There are dozens of figures in the entire painting, filling the entire exhibition room, truly a grand spectacle. Other paintings include one depicting four old and young people with different expressions, titled: "After the war, the fields are desolate, and relatives are displaced on the road," as well as one depicting the flood in Hebei Province, when residents sold their sons, and the mother and child were in a state of sorrowful parting, titled: "Giving birth to you is like parting from a phoenix, how much is it worth in a year of famine? You must respect this journey, not like being by your mother's side," etc. All are very thought-provoking and speculative pictures.

The entire collection consists of less than a hundred works, mostly composed and buried within the past five or six years, almost all painted with ink and light colors. However, the audience does not feel that it is simple. Among them, A Q, who drags his pigtail and has a humble and timid appearance, is particularly outstanding. Although it is also written with ink and light colors, A Q's typical form seems to match the image shaped by Mr. Lu Xun in the book. This is probably because the author has a considerable understanding and correct understanding of A Q in the novel.

In fact, most of the people in ancient China originally lived in such a simple medieval environment, let alone in this year. Therefore, the author did not cater to the eyes of the general snobs in the city, and exaggerated or erased the colors and materials. This proves that the author's feelings for art are not only narrow on the objects that are self-proclaimed as great painters, and cannot be compared. He is down-to-earth in his surroundings, so the pictures he wrote are almost all the phenomena of life of the people in northern China, the ancient capital.

Undoubtedly, Mr. Ai's works are greatly successful in the techniques of using pen and ink and some subjects. His upright and bold brushstrokes contain the adults who have carefully studied and refined them in a few strokes, and vividly express the dynamics of the characters. There is no stroke too much, and there is no stroke not enough. He tells the audience that his observation of individual characters is both detailed and insightful, and the color is also just right. This is not an author who has achieved success overnight, but has worked hard. At this time and place, it can be said to be very valuable.

Chinese and Western Fine Pens

The pictures composed by Mr. Jiang are based on the lines inherited from Chinese painting history as the skeleton, and the colors and strokes of Western painting are used as the muscles. It is precisely what he said in his preface to the album that he selected the fine pens of Chinese and Western paintings, mixed them and used them flexibly to form his own school. These historical and exquisite lines inherited from the ancestors are one of the "national quintessence". Finally, Mr. Jiang discovered and applied them to his modern paintings. This style has Mr. Xu Beihong in modern China, and Su's "Nikolai Solokov" and "Kukryniksy" in foreign countries, as well as Zha Ji of Italy, also have similar strokes, and the pictures are purely rough strokes, and the subjects are purely characters. As far as the author knows, there seem to be very few so far. This is a kind of outline design for the new self-cultivation of the art world, which is worthy of the joy of the world, and wants to be a modern "national painting" that can truly represent Chinese culture.

However, what the author thinks is strange is that in all the works, the expressions and dynamics of the characters are painted with sorrow, but they do not arouse feelings. In these independent paintings, there are few meaningful backgrounds. In this way, it can only arouse some sympathy and a high degree of sadness. If the author also expresses the positive side of the Chinese people on the screen, then the evaluation given by the audience will naturally exceed the author's imagination, which is undeniable.

If this little opinion is considered not too unreasonable, then I hope that in the future, there will be great works. In this way, it will not only coincide with the one sentence in the author's preface: "Change with the times", but also be a painter who truly represents the times. Although the author is hoping that the author will work hard in this direction, perhaps the author has already had this ambition, but he is just stingy in this steaming heat.

The Author's Outlook on Life

A writer, no matter what kind of writer, has his own personality, style, consciousness and environment. Mr. Jiang also wrote this very clearly in his preface, and there is no need for the author to spend his words. But because painting is different from writing, the imageability of painting is easier to understand. Therefore, whether a work is excellent or not is entirely evaluated by the content of the painting. The content of the painting is the image of the object in the author's mind, the turbidity of the object itself, so many commentators use someone's work to measure someone's consciousness at that time, which seems to be fully justified. The reason why a writer's work is loved by people is that his work has a broad outlook on life, which can play a role in leading historical actions, or help to return to the historical forward development.

In the history of China, there is a beautiful story of poetry in painting and painting in poetry, which has been passed down to this day. Some paintings do rely on the title to strengthen the lack of eye-catching places in the painting, some use poetry to set off the painting, and some use painting to express poetic feelings, but it is difficult to paint to express poetic feelings, and it is easy to use poetry to express painting ideas. Because poetry can use auxiliary words, verbs, nouns, and derivative words to help complete the nostalgia, it is more difficult to use these in the picture, and sometimes it is even impossible. Therefore, it is even more difficult to want to draw a painting that expresses the activities of some people in some situations or scenes without thinking, and if you don't use the background, it is even more impossible. Mr. Jiang also attaches great importance to inscriptions, often using them to increase the touching places of strict content, but there is a picture of three suffering children walking together in his works, and the appearance and expression are not very like the suffering children who have been beaten, and there is no background. The author inscribed "What about treasures and hearts, suffering children are worthless." If it weren't for these words, people might think it was moved from the stage! However, the audience unanimously pointed out that the author's own ambition is to have a warm enthusiasm for the compatriots who are whipped by the whip of life.
