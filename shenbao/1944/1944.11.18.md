### Japanese Troops Capture Yishan, Directly Threatening Guiyang; The War in Guangxi Enters its Final Stage

Guilin, 17th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese troops captured Guilin and Liuzhou, they launched a new campaign along the Guizhou-Guangxi Road and occupied Yishan on the 14th. The Japanese troops who captured Yishan continued to advance rapidly along the Guizhou-Guangxi Road, crossing the mountainous terrain of the Guangxi provincial border and entering the Guizhou province, thus directly threatening the Chongqing army's lifeline to India, cutting off Chongqing's lifeblood from the side. Yishan is located in the Longjiang Strait and is a strategic point for entering the mountainous area of Guizhou from the plains of Guangxi, less than 100 kilometers from Liuzhou, serving as the gateway to Guizhou Province. With the fall of Yishan, Guiyang, the last defense stronghold of the southwestern Chongqing army, is also directly threatened. Furthermore, due to the fall of Guilin and Liuzhou, the withdrawal of the U.S. air force base and various military and political organs and military supplies stationed in Chongqing are concentrated in Guiyang, so Guiyang has now been transformed into a military city, and its crisis is becoming increasingly urgent.

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) - A Reuters correspondent in Chongqing recently made the following observations on the future actions of the Japanese troops in Guangxi: Since the Japanese troops have captured the two central cities of Guangxi Province, the war in Guangxi has entered its final stage. There are three possibilities for the current movements of the Japanese troops: (1) The Japanese troops will advance rapidly towards Guizhou. (2) Before continuing the attack, they will first consolidate the areas they have already occupied. (3) They will temporarily halt offensive operations near the border of Guizhou Province. The Japanese troops have entered Guangxi more than once. In the past, they have entered the southern part of Guangxi twice, and then retreated. However, this time the Japanese troops seem to intend to continue to maintain Changsha, Hengyang, and various key points in Guangxi.

Chinese People Cooperate with the Japanese Army

A certain base of the Japanese army on the front line in Guangxi, 17th (Central News Agency) - When the Japanese army broke through the Guangxi-Hunan provincial border and began to launch an offensive operation against the Fourth War Zone of Chongqing, the people of Guangxi Province worked hard to organize self-defense corps and national armies to carry out guerrilla warfare. However, as the Japanese army's operations progressed, military discipline was strict, and the supreme commander of the China Expeditionary Army issued a proclamation, they clearly understood the true meaning of the Japanese army's operations. Therefore, these organized self-defense corps and national armies gradually disarmed, surrendered, and then organized public security maintenance associations to provide active cooperation. What is particularly noteworthy is the direct cooperation of the residents with the Japanese army. The rapid units of the Japanese army, before starting their operations near a certain place and occupying Yishan, found their advance route through a very steep mountainous area, and due to continuous heavy rains, the roads were muddy, causing the horses transporting weapons, ammunition, and fodder to be continuously trapped in ditches. This was an unprecedentedly difficult march. However, after witnessing this situation, the public security maintenance associations in various places reported to the Japanese army authorities, willing to cooperate with the Japanese army in transporting fuel, ammunition, and food. At the same time, the farmers nearby also brought their sticks and baskets to cooperate with the Japanese army. On that day, the Japanese army and the Chinese people became one and started marching on the muddy roads, and finally managed to break through several kilometers of bad roads. As for the fuel, ammunition, and food, they were all carried by the Chinese people, and the Chongqing U.S. air force bases in Liuzhou, Liucheng, Yishan, and other places were subsequently captured by the rapid units of the Japanese army.

### Chairman Wang's Last Instructions

(1) Only by jointly winning the Greater East Asia War can we protect East Asia and protect China.

(2) Let us carry out genuine unity in the spirit of mutual love.

(3) If we identify a direction and move forward bravely, we will surely approach the light.

(4) Corruption and dereliction of duty are malignant bacteria that corrode politics, and hoarding and speculation are foolish insects that poison democracy.

### Chongqing Civil Servants Exempted from Military Service, Arousing Public Opposition

Guangzhou, 17th (Central News Agency) - Recently, Chongqing's broadcasts and newspapers have been vigorously promoting military service for students and intellectuals for days. The Chongqing authorities have also successively issued statements, strongly stating the crisis of the War of Resistance, in order to achieve the goal of mobilizing young people. In addition, compulsory conscription has begun in various places, but so far it has had no effect, and the recruitment of militia groups has been met with deep opposition from young people due to the exemption methods for recruitment by various agencies and organizations. Recently, the Shaoguan Daily published an editorial on this topic, stating that civil servants should not only not be exempted from military service, but should also take the lead in joining the army as a model for young people. This is a major attack on the unfair measures of the Chongqing military authorities.

### Anecdotes of Mr. Wang Jingwei – Part 3

[Author's Note]: Di Lan Qi Cheng Yitan said: "In the past, everyone who talked about revolution talked about Mr. Wang. Now, everyone who talks about governance talks about Mr. Wang. Thus, Mr. Wang has not failed to live up to the expectations of the country." Mr. Wang's courtesy name was Jingwei. He was from Shanyin, Zhejiang. His father, a certain Mr. Wang, served as a traveling secretary in Guangdong and lived in Panyu, thus being registered there. He was intelligent from a young age, possessed great ambitions, and loved to read, remembering everything he saw. He studied in Japan in his youth and met Mr. Sun Yat-sen in Tokyo. Mr. Sun appreciated his talent and often consulted him in secret about the matter of overthrowing the Manchus and restoring the Han. Mr. Wang said: "The Qing government has been corrupt for a long time. Now, a three-year-old child is emperor. What are we waiting for before it collapses?" Mr. Sun agreed with him. He then joined the Tongmenghui and worked with Zhang Taiyan (Binglin) to write for the Minbao, severely criticizing the shortcomings of the Qing government in articles that often ran to several thousand words. In the late years of the Xuantong era, he and Huang Fusheng (Shuzhong) went to Beiping and rented a house to live in, pretending to be merchants and not leaving the house. The two secretly buried landmines, planning to assassinate Prince Regent Zaifeng. The matter was revealed and they were imprisoned in the Ministry of Justice. Tingjie, the Minister of Justice, proposed the death penalty. Prince Su Shanqi, who was in charge of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, strongly opposed it, saying that revolutionary parties were spreading across the country and could erupt at any moment. Mr. Wang was a scholar and could not do anything. It would be better to imprison him for a long time and slowly interrogate him about the secret plans of his party. Even if we cannot obtain everything, getting half or one or two would be enough for precautions. Tingjie was moved and agreed. Shanqi told Tingjie, who told Zaifeng, and Zaifeng also agreed. Mr. Wang was spared death. When the Xinhai Revolution broke out, he was released from prison and learned that Yuan Shikai controlled the military seals. He was about to be appointed, so he arranged for his son, Keding, to accompany him to Huan Shang to meet Shikai, providing him with great righteousness and moving him with public opinion, urging him to depose the young emperor, overthrow the Qing court, and build a democratic republic. This was the time. Shikai was moved by his sincerity and revealed his hidden feelings. Mr. Wang then went south, returned, and participated in the North-South peace talks. When the Provisional Government was established in Nanjing, Mr. Wang declared that he would not be an official or a member of parliament and organized the Six No's Society with six non-binding rules. At that time, the people of Guangdong Province were recommending him as the governor of Guangdong, and the government was also about to make great use of him. After the Provisional Senate appointed Shikai as the Provisional President at Mr. Sun's word, Mr. Sun immediately sent Mr. Wang and Cai Yuanpei to welcome him. Shikai was worried about changes and afraid to go south, so he secretly instructed his trusted third regiment, led by Cao Kun, to riot and loot Beijing and Tianjin, using the excuse that no one was stationed in the north and the head of state should postpone his trip and the government should be elected in the north. The various processes in between are known to everyone and will not be repeated. When Shikai was elected as the Provisional President, Mr. Wang contributed greatly. Otherwise, the North and South would have been at war for a long time, the abdication of the Qing Emperor would have been indefinite, and the situation of unification would have been impossible to establish. After Shikai's death, the strength of the Northern Army gradually declined, year after year, until it collapsed. In recent years, Mr. Wang joined the Party-State government, but then resigned due to political disagreements. He liked to write political commentaries, especially to talk about legal principles, and wrote in vernacular style. However, his collections were published, and he occasionally wrote poetry. His poetry was also guarded and resembled his people.

Qiu Wu Ye Tan said: "When Liao Zhongkai was assassinated, Mr. Wang went to the hospital to see him. Seeing that he had passed away, he repeatedly shook his head in sadness and personally wrote a message to his comrades, which was posted at the Central Party Headquarters. At that time, the Party Headquarters was still in the Huizhou Guild Hall. The next day, all the party members saw it and copied it one after another. There was a striking sentence that said: 'Those who do not make revolution, go to the right. Those who make revolution, go to the left.' The origin of the Left faction really began here." In the early years of the Republic of China, Mr. Wang often went to friends' houses to discuss matters on the second floor of a certain house on Dongheng Street in Guangzhou. Wine was placed against the railing. The railing was rotten and cracked, and a person fell from the third floor, but luckily, he fell to the ground without injury, but it was still dangerous.

Commentary

### How to Realize Chairman Wang's Last Wishes

— Chen Binhe

Yesterday, I accepted the invitation of the city's propaganda office to give a radio speech on how to realize Chairman Wang's last wishes. Now, I am reprinting the speech here.

It has been a week since the passing of Chairman Wang Jingwei of the National Government. The mourning expressed by all parties over the past week is enough to comfort Mr. Wang's spirit in heaven.

First, the unanimous expression of solemn respect for Mr. Wang by officials and civilians across the country, as well as people from allied nations, proves that Mr. Wang's great personality and spirit for the country and for East Asia have won the love of all parties at home and abroad. Although the body is dead, the spirit is truly immortal.

Second, the entire country maintains extreme calmness in mourning. Both central government affairs and all levels of society are as stable as usual. Not only is there no anxiety, but there is also a determination to work even harder and inherit his legacy. The achievement of peace and the victory of the war are fully guaranteed here.

Third, Mr. Chen Gongbo has been designated by the central government as Mr. Wang’s successor. Mr. Chen is also an advanced member of the party and nation, with outstanding talent, and has shared hardships with Mr. Wang for a long time, knowing him best. This time, taking on a difficult task, he will surely draw on his past experience in politics and his fair attitude to complete the unfinished will of Mr. Wang.

Fourth, after the passing of Mr. Wang, the authorities of allied nations have formally stated that their policy towards China will not change. They will continue to provide their greatest cooperation, strengthen close relations between the two countries, and work together to win the Greater East Asia War. This is also the guarantee for the independence and liberation of the Chinese nation.

However, we cannot be satisfied with maintaining the status quo. On the contrary, we should work harder and redouble our efforts after Mr. Wang's passing. First of all, we hope that the government authorities will thoroughly reform politics, eliminate corrupt officials, and establish expert politics.

We have consistently advocated reforming politics and establishing expert politics in the past. Therefore, all future government measures must be in line with this principle. First, be selfless and impartial, abandon partisan ideas, select people for positions based on their abilities, and ensure that talent matches the job. Second, identify and promote talented people who are not in government, because honest and capable people outside the government often suffer from having nothing to do, resulting in being buried and wasted. The government should carefully seek them out and give them opportunities to serve, so that no talent is left out in the field. Third, rewards and punishments should be clear. Officials in the government who have poor performance should be dismissed and punished without any leniency, in order to achieve the effect of cleaning up officialdom and clarifying politics.

Secondly, improve the administrative organs and make reasonable adjustments. For example, organizations with unclear responsibilities, redundant layers, or nothing to do should be merged or abolished. This will not only eliminate many meaningless bureaucratic formalities and unnecessary restrictions, but also use the saved funds to strengthen the functioning organs. Only when politics is on the right track can the implementation of national policies be effective.

Again, at this stage of the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War, we must strengthen our belief in winning the war, and especially mobilize the power of the people to devote themselves to the war. Therefore, we must first improve the people's livelihood. Currently, the people suffer most from two things: the failure to establish public security and the continuous rise in prices. Establishing public security should start with improving the treatment of the military and police. Suppressing prices should start with preventing profiteering.

Our mourning for Chairman Wang cannot be merely expressed in words or writing. We must be down-to-earth, work hard in practical action, and jointly realize Chairman Wang's legacy. This is the way to express our sorrow.

At the same time, I would also like to personally witness the details of the Japanese people's resolute struggle under the war situation.

### The Great Naval Battle East of the Philippines; Asahi Shimbun Reports the Actual Situation at the Time

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - In this great naval and air battle east of the Philippines, the long-awaited Japanese Combined Fleet finally resolutely launched an attack, fiercely attacking over sixty enemy aircraft carriers and battleships in Leyte Gulf, displaying the power accumulated by the Japanese Navy throughout its history, and creating one of the greatest kamikaze battles in Japanese naval history. The Asahi Shimbun correspondent who was embedded with the troops recorded the situation at the time as follows:

The long-awaited attack order was finally issued. The excitement of the officers and soldiers of each ship on this day was indescribable. When receiving the standby order, each ship had already prepared for battle. In the afternoon, the flagship issued a signal for the captains of each ship to assemble, which was the beginning of the attack order. As the large mobile force marched south with high morale, it continued to perform the "one-character formation movement" in order to be wary of submarines. The next day, the weather was clear and bright, which was the most suitable weather for an attack. News of the enemy's actions near the Philippines gradually spread. Finally, it was reported that the enemy had launched a new landing operation near Leyte Gulf, and that the enemy's powerful mobile force was divided into several armies and was operating in the sea east of the Philippines. At this point, the unprecedented opportunity for battle had matured. All members received the captain's order to begin naval calisthenics. Soon, the fleet arrived east of a certain island, and the time for the decisive battle was approaching. According to a telegram, the enemy's mobile force, centered on the landing point in Leyte Gulf, was divided into several armies and was operating in the area east of the Philippines. Just before the start of this decisive battle, the staff room became tense. On that day, one Japanese reconnaissance plane discovered that the enemy's mobile force consisted of several aircraft carriers and several super aircraft carriers, battleships, and cruisers. An attack order was immediately issued, and multiple joint formations of fighter-bombers took off from the aircraft carrier, divided into two groups, and broke into the battlefield. The second group overcame difficult conditions and flew high in the clouds, finally discovering the enemy's mobile force centered on several powerful aircraft carriers. They immediately launched a surprise attack, breaking through the enemy's fierce defensive fire, and concentrated their bombing on the large aircraft carriers. Multiple bombs hit the flight deck, followed by loud explosions. The ship tilted, and a large aircraft carrier also erupted in flames and sank one after another. The enemy's new aircraft carrier was completely destroyed. However, there were still super aircraft carriers, and the Japanese aircraft attack force immediately changed its target, but unexpectedly encountered an attack from the enemy's superior fighter groups and had to return to base. The other naval forces suddenly appeared in Leyte Gulf, attacking the enemy fleet in the bay. The enemy was caught off guard, and the fleet fell into a state of collapse. The Japanese fleet took the opportunity to bombard them with large-caliber guns. The results of the battle gradually expanded, with a total of more than sixty enemy aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, etc. The Japanese fleet further broke into the enemy transport convoy and its escort fleet, engaging in close combat. At this time, enemy aircraft teams appeared in the sky and bombed five times. The Japanese flagship issued an order that the entire army would launch a do-or-die night raid to sink the enemy fleet. Then, they reorganized their formation to protect the main force with destroyers, without any disorder, and advanced in the darkness. Late at night, they encountered the enemy fleet. Cannons roared, and a magnificent close-quarters night raid began. After several minutes of fighting, the sea returned to silence. This time, at least one enemy cruiser was sunk. After the main force arrived, the enemy ships fled in a hurry to the south, and the Japanese fleet turned north. The naval battle in the Philippine Sea thus came to an end.

### Philippine Government Promulgates Compulsory Labor Order

Manila, 17th (Central News Agency) - President Laurel promulgated a compulsory labor order on the 14th to enable the Philippine people to cooperate with the Japanese army's labor operations. General Li Mao-die also issued a statement on this matter, saying: "The enemy Americans rely on their abundant materials and have now landed in the Philippines. At present, the Philippines is facing an extraordinary situation, and the crisis is approaching the people. President Laurel has announced his participation in the war and explained the Philippines' position to the world. However, the Philippine nation has not yet implemented conscription to increase its strength to defend the motherland. Therefore, where is the Philippine people's participation in the war? The Japanese army, in order to defeat the enemy Americans and defend the Philippine defense line, not only makes the greatest sacrifices, but also bears most of the responsibility for labor operations in various parts of the Philippines. All of us Filipinos should emulate the spirit of sacrifice of the Japanese army and strive to engage in labor operations to reduce the burden on the Japanese army and actively cooperate in completing the war. This is the duty of the Philippine people and the only way for us to cooperate in the war."

### Fierce Battle in Leyte, Japanese Aircraft Strongly Attack Enemy Base, Japanese Army Completes Mission in Storm

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) – The war on Leyte Island is intensifying. The enemy is reinforcing the air force bases at Tacloban, Tarac, Burauen, and Sababro in an effort to seize air superiority. The Japanese air force has been attacking these bases and intercepting enemy aircraft daily. On the evening of the 16th, a Japanese warplane unit fiercely bombed the enemy airfield at Burauen, making low-altitude sweeps against 24 enemy large aircraft concentrated on the ground. Five of them caught fire and over ten were destroyed. In the fierce air battle over Burauen, six P-38s were certainly shot down and several were damaged. The Japanese side also suffered two losses.

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from a Japanese war correspondent at the Leyte Island front, the large unit he accompanied landed freely at Ormoc and then began to move north from Ormoc. At that time, the Leyte Island area was experiencing fierce storms. The Japanese army disregarded all difficulties and continued to advance north. As the destination drew closer, the distance to the enemy also narrowed. The vanguard began to be vigilant to guard against the expected enemy appearance. Only the Japanese army could complete such a march through dangerous mountains and dense forests. After several days of arduous travel, we arrived at a certain high ground. Although physically exhausted, we continued to prepare for battle without rest. Gradually, the mountain hazards disappeared, and from a certain high ground, we could also see the lowlands around Carigara Bay. The American combat zone had become a large mud pit due to continuous storms, and Carigara Bay was like a large mud sea, which was particularly surprising. In the mud sea, the movements of the American 24th Infantry Division could also be clearly seen. American tanks were seen submerged in the mud or stopped on small hills emerging from the water. They could not advance or retreat, which was extremely miserable. The American transport units were also helpless, and it was unknown when this bad weather would clear, so the American army's hunger was only a matter of time. The Japanese army has now arrived at a certain place, but the Americans have not yet discovered it. Suddenly, a loud noise was heard, and enemy aircraft were seen slowly circling in the high sky. Soon, objects resembling bombs were dropped one after another. On closer inspection, it was determined that they were food supplies. The American aircraft mistook the Japanese army for the American army. The Japanese army's contact with the rear has been completely successful, and food supplies will be able to arrive continuously. The soldiers are enraged and ready to kill the enemy.

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from San Francisco stated that the headquarters of General MacArthur on Leyte Island announced on the 16th that Brigadier General Izlay, deputy commander of the US Army's 96th Division, was wounded in frontline combat on the night of the 15th.

### Roosevelt Invited to Visit Paris

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – A German news agency dispatch, according to news from Washington, stated that President Roosevelt has accepted General de Gaulle's invitation to visit Paris, but the date of the visit has not yet been determined.

### Spain Recognizes De Gaulle Government

Geneva, 17th (Central News Agency) – A German news agency report, according to a London radio report, stated that Spain officially recognized the de Gaulle government on the 16th. This recognition was announced in a diplomatic note by Spanish Head of State General Franco.

### Bonnet Appointed French Ambassador to the United States

Geneva, 17th (Central News Agency) – A German news agency report stated that Paris Radio reported that Bonnet has been appointed as the French ambassador to Washington.

Intriguing French Attitude

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Central News Agency) – A German news agency report, according to news from Moscow, stated that News Daily commented on Thursday that France has diverging opinions on Britain's plan to establish a Western European group. France must not only consider both sides but also the East. After the war, France must cooperate closely with the Soviet Union.

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) – A Reuters report stated that the German Foreign Ministry believes that Churchill was unable to persuade France to participate in the Western European group organization plan, either before or during his visit to Paris. Furthermore, de Gaulle invited Stalin to visit Paris, but Stalin refused, instead inviting de Gaulle to Moscow. German officials believe that Stalin's invitation to de Gaulle has political implications, as de Gaulle's visit to Moscow occurred after Churchill's visit to Paris and British newspapers began discussing the Western European group plan. The underlying meaning is intriguing. Some French people believe that Britain's plan to organize a Western European group has an anti-Soviet tendency.

However, the German army also concentrated its forces to launch a counteroffensive that afternoon, and after a fierce tank battle, completely regained the northern part of Aszalarocsa. German troops continue to fight bravely in the Balkans and the Finnish-Norwegian border areas, overcoming various difficulties in terrain and weather.

### An Overview of Education in Nanhui County

— Yifei

Nowadays, when people mention "education," they always associate it with the word "poor." It's as if those who serve in the education sector are destined to be inextricably linked with "poverty." As a journalist, I once served in the education sector. Back then, whenever I was at a social gathering and greeted people, mentioning that my profession was a "teacher," the other party would often seem to have a hint of mockery, inevitably offering two lines of flattery: "The education sector is noble and pure, but also very poor." At the time, it was truly a situation that left you not knowing whether to laugh or cry. However, in reality, when has the education sector nationwide ever escaped the confines of the word "distress"? And how many people serving in the education sector have not been struggling financially and able to have a day of stable life? Therefore, before I talk about the educational situation in Nanhui, I can simply tell the readers one thing: The education sector in Nanhui is also a group struggling in a "poor" environment.

In 1937, Nanhui County had two junior high schools, each with a complete primary school. In the villages, there were lower primary schools. Education was quite developed, truly "school districts were close, and singing could be heard from each other." In total, there were no fewer than 300 schools. As for social education, at that time, in addition to the library and sports field in the town, each administrative district had a public education center, and each primary school also ran a public school, sparing no effort to promote social education. The achievements were quite remarkable, and the flourishing scene was unprecedented. But good times don't last forever. With the outbreak of the incident, the devil's hand of war almost completely destroyed the budding flower of education in Nanhui.

Recent Education Status in Nanhui

In the early post-war period, there were only a dozen or so district-run primary schools remaining. Through the continuous efforts of educational personnel in the county, there is now the Municipal Fifth Middle School, one County Simplified Normal School, two junior middle schools, twenty-three complete primary schools, and one hundred and forty-seven junior primary schools. In total, there are 25 male middle school teachers, 1 female teacher, 153 male middle school students, 63 female students, 367 male primary school teachers, 186 female teachers, 14,979 male primary school students, and 3,988 female students, totaling 46 upper grades and 366 lower grades. Although this achievement is far from ideal, it is still quite gratifying. However, private primary and secondary schools are scattered in various districts, with no statistics available. Most of them do not meet the regulations, which greatly affects the future of the general children. Examining the reasons for their establishment, most of them are controlled by special forces or are speculative in nature, aiming for profit. They do not understand the mission of education. The administrative authorities are limited by insufficient manpower and financial resources and cannot integrate them into county-run schools, so they have to let them fend for themselves, which is regrettable.

The current administrative structure of education in Nanhui is based on the old rules before the war, dividing the eight administrative districts into five school districts. Districts one and eight are combined into the first school district, districts two and three are combined into the second school district, district seven is the third school district, districts four and five are combined into the fourth school district, and district six is the fifth school district. In addition to setting up two supervisors in accordance with the promulgated personnel standards, the county government also increases the number of guides in each school district according to actual needs, carrying out the supervision of education in each school district in accordance with the county government's intentions. The organization is quite complete. However, due to environmental and economic limitations, it cannot reach perfection, which is disappointing.

Sources of Education Funding

The education funding in Nanhui County is still not independent to this day, so it is common to be in arrears for several months, which is not surprising, and it severely affects the lives of teachers with meager salaries. Previously, an additional one cent of education fee was added to the surtax, but due to various reasons, it was like a drop in the bucket and did not help. Later, a special education zone was created, but the results were difficult to achieve the expected ideal. Currently, middle schools collect two dou of rice per semester, and senior primary schools collect four, five, and six sheng of rice, and junior primary schools collect three and a half sheng.

The Simplified Normal School currently has a total of 50 male and female students, graduating in one year. In addition to collecting tuition of 350 yuan, a deposit of 500 yuan, and a compensation reserve of 300 yuan, the tuition and accommodation fees are jointly borne by the eight district offices with 88 dan of rice, which is a very good method. However, according to what I have learned, all districts are temporarily shirking responsibility or delaying the date, and there is no "guaranteed response" like military and police rice.

Nanhui has always had public properties dedicated to education, including over 10,000 mu of school land, which could generate over one million yuan in rent (according to 1944 statistics). In fact, only over 500,000 yuan can be collected. Before the war, this was collected by the County Education Bureau to make up for the shortage of education funds. After the war, 19 out of 10 of this fund was diverted for other uses. Last year, only 50,000 yuan of this fund was used for education. Although this public property is nominally school land, the coastal villages in Nanhui suffered severe wind disasters, and school buildings were severely damaged. The schools have been repeatedly requesting relief, but the authorities turned a blind eye and did not use the funds collected from the school land to provide relief to the starving education workers.

The schools I have visited are mostly dilapidated, with one room used for multiple purposes. Except for the slightly larger Municipal Fifth Middle School, the other rural schools mostly rent folk tables and benches as desks and chairs, and even use doors as blackboards. The poverty is so severe that they resemble private schools. Sports equipment is even out of the question.

As for the teachers' salaries, middle school teachers receive over 1,000 yuan, while primary school teachers receive only 600 yuan. According to current prices, this meager salary is not enough for individuals to maintain themselves, let alone those with families. Therefore, teachers with means are leaving the profession to seek other ways out. The current teachers are mostly people who are forced to do so, and there is no shortage of those who are incompetent and filling positions. The quality of teachers is so poor that it deeply affects the studies of children. Thinking of this, I cannot help but feel sad for the future of Chinese education.

Municipal Fifth Middle School, the leader of the pack

Although the education in Nanhui is in a situation of devastation and misery, we can still take some comfort in the fact that the Fifth Middle School stands out from the crowd. In a poor environment, twelve intellectuals are working hard from the perspective of the education sector. In particular, Principal Zhang Shuijiang takes educating future generations as his duty, and the hard work spirit of Director of Teaching Tao Xuekan is admirable. Most commendable is Ms. Chen Manqing, the only female teacher in the county who teaches mathematics and science. She and Tao are both graduates of Datong University. According to Principal Zhang, Ms. Chen's family is the wealthiest in Zhujiaqiao, Nanhui County. She could have lived a comfortable "golden lady" life at home without having to seek employment outside. However, Ms. Chen has great ambitions and is enthusiastic about education. She is willing to work hard to educate the general young people in a small, remote city like Nanhui, which is truly admirable. On the 26th of last month, I accepted Principal Zhang's invitation to give a lecture at the Fifth Middle School. Afterwards, I visited the classrooms and found them to be very clean. The school building is located in Xicheng, Nanhui, in a beautiful and quiet environment, which is quite ideal. The prospects for future development are very promising.

Humble opinions borrowed from the authorities

Currently, the important topics in Chinese education, taking Nanhui as an example, should be done as follows:

(1) Increase the salaries of general teachers and staff. Only after their lives are stable can their efficiency increase. Otherwise, if they are living from hand to mouth and serving the public with an empty stomach, it would be like climbing a tree to catch fish if they are expected to devote themselves to education.

(2) Education funding should be independent to ensure that it is not often in arrears, affecting the lives of teachers. It is possible to add a certain percentage of education funds to the land tax, which should be allocated to the county government for management. The relevant departments of the county government should form a management committee to be responsible for safekeeping and allocation, allocating funds on a monthly basis to avoid repeating the same mistakes, which would be conducive to the promotion of educational administration.

(3) Reorganize public education properties. The county government should appoint special personnel to be responsible for the practical reorganization of school land, ensuring that every cent goes to the public and that the income from public education properties is used for education, which is in line with the original intention of public education properties.

(4) Selection and training of teachers. As mentioned earlier, the quality of teachers has a significant impact on children's learning. Therefore, strict selection must be carried out. Those with excellent skills can be given priority for employment, while the inferior ones should be gradually eliminated or given short-term training to achieve perfection.

(5) Raise funds to widely set up school supplies and sports equipment. As the Western saying goes, "When it's time to read, read; when it's time to play, play." Moreover, primary school students are generally innocent and lively little angels who are naturally active. They should be given more activities after class to develop strong minds and bodies, making them the pillars of the future country and wiping away the shame of being called the "sick men of East Asia."

(6) Universally establish compulsory schools. At a time when the countryside is declining and the economy is depressed, and most of the students in rural primary schools are children of farmers, in order to reduce the burden on farmers and eliminate illiteracy, it is necessary to vigorously promote compulsory schools, so that the level of knowledge of farmers will be generally improved in the future, which will also be of great benefit to the revitalization of the countryside.

### Inspect Warehouses to Eliminate Hoarding, Promote Economic Policies, Economic Security Office Hopes for Full Assistance from Citizens

Tan, the director of the Economic Security Office of the Shanghai Special City Police Department, said: "The recent soaring prices in the city pose a great threat to people's livelihoods. The general public goes without saying, even those engaged in hoarding or obsessed with manipulating prices in the market hope that the authorities will take concrete measures to suppress prices. Under such circumstances, the relationship between materials and prices in the city has become a serious issue that cannot be ignored. The municipal authorities, in view of this, have implemented effective measures, issuing the "Provisional Measures for Investigating the Storage of Goods in Warehouses and Stockyards," to investigate the city's inventory of materials in order to establish a reasonable policy for the control of materials and prices. To promote the city government's policy, the Economic Security Office, based on the spirit of these measures, has been implementing inspections of various warehouses and stockyards since last month. This inspection targets the main commodities announced by the Economic Bureau, and other commodities that are considered hoardable are also included in the inspection. The office divides warehouses into two types, commercial warehouses and private warehouses, for inspection. Commercial warehouses refer to warehouses that are specifically used to store goods for general merchants on a consignment basis, while private warehouses refer to warehouses set up by stores and factories for their own use. In addition, individuals who store large quantities of goods in their own residences, offices, or other places are also treated as private warehouses. If private warehouses have not yet registered their stored goods, they should quickly apply for registration with the City Economic Bureau. Those who deliberately fail to register will be prosecuted for violating Article 28 of the Provisional Measures for Investigating the Storage of Goods in Warehouses and Stockyards. Inquiries regarding registration procedures can be made to the Economic Bureau. Fearing that various circles are not aware of this, we hereby warn them to comply to avoid violations. Furthermore, the purpose of this inspection is to thoroughly investigate the inventory of materials in order to smoothly promote economic policies. At the same time, it is to eliminate the hoarding behavior of merchants in order to eradicate the chronic problems of the city's economic circles. Therefore, the scope of the crackdown is extremely widespread. The general public should deeply understand the significance of the authorities' policies and provide full assistance to the inspection work. If illegal transactions or hoarding activities are discovered, they should be quickly reported to the Economic Security Office or the nearby Economic Police Team for investigation and prosecution. In accordance with the regulations, all informants will be given bonuses as a reward. Please be informed."

### Director Yuan Discusses Streamlining Municipal Tax Revenue: Streamlining Old Taxes and Levying New Taxes

The Municipal Propaganda Department convened its 28th regular press conference at the Municipal Government conference room at 10:00 AM on the 17th. Director Yuan Houzhi of the Municipal Finance Bureau attended to answer various questions raised by reporters. The following is a record of the questions and answers:

Specific Contents of Tax Revenue Streamlining

(1) *Shen Bao* asked: It is said that the Advisory Committee and the Finance Bureau are discussing the streamlining of tax revenue. Can Director Zhu elaborate on the specific contents?

Answer: Regarding the streamlining of tax revenue, the Municipal Government, Finance Bureau, General Accounting Office, and Advisory Committee have formed a Municipal Tax Streamlining Committee to take charge of the matter. After careful deliberation on streamlining old taxes and levying new taxes, the following results have been achieved: (A) Streamlining Old Taxes: (1) The house tax in the eighteen districts previously collected 7 million yuan per month. After re-surveying and re-evaluating, it has increased to 9 million yuan per month, effective since the autumn of this year. (2) Consumption (Special) Tax: After streamlining, it is estimated that it can increase by 20 million yuan per month starting in October. The actual increase is 92 million yuan (Central Government and Municipal Government each receive half). (3) Nanshi Business Tax: Previously, the monthly revenue was over 200,000 yuan. After streamlining, it has increased by about 1 million yuan, effective since October. (4) The pig special tax is levied ad valorem, originally collecting 50 yuan per pig, with revenue of 1.8 million yuan. Now, starting from October 12, the assessed value will be increased, collecting 200 yuan per pig, which can increase by 5 million yuan per month. (5) Dance Ticket Tax: Previously, it was levied together with the banquet tax at a tax rate of 15%, with a monthly revenue of 2 million yuan (half of which went to the Municipal Government). Now, it has been incorporated into the entertainment tax, and the tax rate has been increased to 30%, with a monthly revenue increased to around 4 million yuan, all of which goes to the Municipal Government, effective since November 1. (6) Administrative revenue of the Public Utilities Bureau: After adjustment, it is expected to increase by 2 million yuan per month, starting from January of the 34th year, and has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. (7) Administrative revenue of the Economic Bureau: After adjustment, it is expected to increase by 1 million yuan per month, also submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. (8) Administrative revenue of the Public Works Bureau: After adjustment, it is expected to increase by 300,000 yuan per month, also pending approval from the Municipal Government. The tax revenue portion of the above streamlining of old taxes has been implemented, increasing by about 5.5 million yuan per month. The administrative revenue portion has not yet been implemented, and is expected to increase by about 3.3 million yuan. (B) Levying New Taxes: (1) The "02" telephone tax has started on November 1, and can collect 400,000 yuan per month. (2) Cattle Tax: Following the example of the pig special tax, it is levied ad valorem. It is estimated that 4,000 heads will be taxed each month, at 2,000 yuan per head, which can collect 8 million yuan per month, and has already started. (3) Poultry Tax: It has been implemented since November. The city's turnover is estimated at 10 million yuan, levied ad valorem at 5%, which can collect 5 million yuan per month. (4) Mahjong Entertainment Tax: It is scheduled to start on December 1, specifically collecting from brothels, courtesan houses, clubs, and hotels. After investigation and estimation, it can collect 30 million yuan per month, set at 3,000 yuan per table per month. This is the initial implementation, with a budgeted monthly revenue of 10 million yuan. The above old taxes can increase revenue by about 60 million yuan, and new taxes can collect more than 24 million yuan.

Improving Special Tax Collection Methods

(2) *New China Daily* asked: Regarding the special consumption tax case, apart from those who have been punished publicly, are the remaining parts still under investigation?

Answer: Regarding the special tax corruption case, the involved personnel have been convicted according to law. More than 2,000 other shops have been decided to be fined ten to twenty times the amount, which will be enforced by the police局.

(3) *Ping Bao* asked: What new developments will there be in the city's special tax collection methods in the future?

Answer: We are currently printing small invoices for shops to use, with uniform rates, and plan to specially print stamps. All shop ledgers must be stamped with this stamp to prevent abuses.

(4) Central News Agency asked: Judging from the current situation, the city's special tax collection agencies can be roughly divided into three major areas: the former first district, the former eighth district, and the old urban area. What unified plan does your bureau have for this?

Answer: The special tax in the former one or eight districts is handled by the Municipal Government on behalf of the tax office, while the old urban area is handled by the Tax Affairs Office. A unified plan is under study. The special tax collection in the former one or eight districts can be unified starting next year.

### Cotton Production Increase: Nine Meetings Held

The ninth committee meeting of the General Association for Cotton Production Increase and the seventh council meeting of the Association for Cotton Development in the Jiangbei Salt Reclamation Area were held simultaneously in the conference room of the Cotton Industry Building at 2:00 PM yesterday. In addition to reporting on the recent cotton development work in the Jiangbei area, it was decided after discussion to allocate the second application for development funds to various standing agencies, and to approve the resignation of council member Mr. Xiaochi.

### Special Rice Allocation for Teachers and Staff: Personnel Change Measures

The special allocation of rice for teachers and staff of public and private schools in the city began last month. However, recently, a small number of schools have requested the return or issuance of additional rice allocation certificates due to personnel changes or duplicate allocations. It is understood that the Municipal Education Bureau, in order to facilitate the handling of such matters by the schools, has consulted with the Material Allocation Office and formulated the following handling methods: (1) Schools can directly return rice allocation certificates to the Material Allocation Office. (2) If the number of personnel is the same after personnel changes in schools, it is not necessary to notify the Material Allocation Office. (3) Schools that add staff or hire teachers should obtain application forms from the Material Allocation Office, submit them to the Education Bureau for review, and forward them to the Material Allocation Office.

### Germany United as One: Everyone Does Their Best to Defend the Motherland: Remarks by Colonel Harminge, Military Attaché of the German Embassy

On the 10th of this month, German Ambassador to China Welman hosted Chinese and foreign journalists in Nanjing. During the meeting, Captain Harminge, Assistant Military Attaché of the German Embassy, delivered a speech, which is excerpted as follows:

I left Germany not long ago, so after arriving here, people asked about the situation in my hometown. The mood of the German people today is not as excited as it was in the first year or two of the war. This is a natural phenomenon after a long war. But on the other hand, there is also something different, which is a firm determination, no matter how difficult it is, without any complaints, willing to endure, and persevere to the end even at the greatest sacrifice. Our enemies have clearly declared their war aims. Every German knows that defeat and surrender mean the end of Germany. Since we know this, we will bring out all our inner strength and use it in the war effort. Although the burden on each of us is very heavy, we still avoid everything and persevere to the end. In today's situation, every German is fully dedicated to the war effort, each doing their best to protect the motherland. There is no distinction between the front and the rear. The whole of Germany is a battle line.

In the evolution of the war over these years, in addition to the increased burden on the front lines, the rear has also become tense. The enemy often carries out fierce bombings, trying to destroy and defeat the fighting spirit of the people. In the whole of Germany, there is no place that has achieved their goals so far, which goes without saying. Just as the German soldiers are fighting bravely on the front lines, the people in the rear are also dealing with the enemy's blind bombing. Everyone is united as one, without distinction between each other. I am for everyone, and everyone is for me.

Thorough Air Defense Training

This spring, I personally witnessed the fierce air raids by the enemy in Berlin and central Germany, so I have a deep understanding of the efforts and spirit of every compatriot. The German people have undergone considerable education and systematic air defense training, day and night, regarding the dangers of air warfare, so they are prepared for the air defense of terror bombing. In all cities, the walls of all cellars are thickened with stone walls, or air-raid shelters are built with reinforced concrete for the residents. In addition, there are air defense fortresses above and below ground level. Those underground often have three or four floors, and those above ground have five floors. In case of emergency alarm, people go to take refuge.

Rescue after air raids is extremely rapid. Those who have been bombed can receive special licenses, along with a number of supplementary ration coupons, to purchase various necessities of life. Before the loss is accurately investigated, cash can be borrowed in advance from local authorities. After the bombing, the enthusiasm of the people in general reaches its peak, which I have never seen before. Everyone is willing to unconditionally give what little they have to their fellow victims.

Rapid Progress in Scientific Construction

German scientific construction is based on German chemistry, and it continues to proceed as before during the war in various ways. Although German universities and other educational institutions have been affected by the war, they are still running as usual in appropriate ways, and various scientific researches continue unabated, which can be proved by the emergence of new weapons in Germany.

Since I left the country this April, the war situation has become more tense, and there is a need for a total mobilization of the entire nation. Therefore, all the strength that anyone has that has not yet been directly used in the war effort must now be directly involved. All businesses that are not related to the decisive battle will be stopped, and all theaters, cinemas, concerts, etc., will be stopped.

However, the so-called total mobilization does not mean that the cultural aspects are completely abolished and no longer seek progress. We only need to listen to German radio programs on any evening to know that German newspapers and magazines, although limited, are still very rich in content.

The manufacture of ordinary consumer goods has been stopped. All necessities of life have standards, so they are very easy and simple to manufacture. The most important thing is the manufacture of military supplies. Every German thoroughly understands this and has an iron will to defend Germany with all his might.

### Director Matsushima Discusses the Philippine Island War and the Enemy's American Ambition to Dominate the World

Director Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet Press Department gave a speech yesterday (the 17th) at 2:00 PM at the Naval Attache's Office, as usual, to a group of Chinese reporters. The main points of what he said are excerpted below:

Enemy Ships Active East of Luzon Island

The mobile force led by Enemy American Major General Sherman seems to be active in the sea east of Luzon Island. Within this force, there are a dozen or so aircraft carriers, acting in three groups, with a configuration that is much lower than before. Because enemy ships have suffered disastrous defeats in the past, they are already planning to retreat before attacking. Although the Japanese naval and air forces were searching and annihilating enemy ships last month, they have not achieved decisive results due to poor weather conditions.

Enemy Surrounded on Leyte Island

The enemy land forces that landed on Leyte are being attacked by the Japanese army, which is becoming increasingly fierce. The Japanese army is fighting especially bravely on the road from Carigara to Oyamok. The Japanese army has now cut off the enemy on the Oyamok highway and is encircling and annihilating them. The enemy has repeatedly claimed victory in the battle on that front, but judging from the remarks made by the US Undersecretary of the Army, Patterson, it can be concluded that their so-called victory is completely wrong. Patterson said on the 16th of this month: The Japanese Navy is still giving us a major threat, the Air Force is also gradually increasing its attack power, and the Army's combat power is developing to a greater extent. Even if Germany is defeated, Japan will continue to fight, etc.

Enemy Planes on the Mainland are Nerve Warfare

The initiative of the Philippine operations is in the hands of Japan. The enemy is at a loss in this area, so it has turned to launching nerve warfare with air raids on the mainland. Today (the 17th), several enemy B-29s scouted the Jiangbei coast and Datong area. The fact that enemy planes are not fighting on the Philippine battlefield but are turning to activity in the Jinghu and Yangtze River coasts is enough to prove that they are avoiding the important and attacking the trivial, without combat power.

Enemy America's Ambition to Dominate the World

According to a Reuters dispatch from New York on the 15th of this month, Roosevelt has three ambitions to dominate the world: (1) To make the US naval power exceed the naval power of the world; (2) The United States must possess the world's largest merchant fleet; (3) The United States will have a commercial shipping network covering the entire globe. This kind of megalomania of Enemy America is worthy of our attention.

Nelson Came to Destroy China

Nelson, the former director of the Munitions Production Bureau, recently led a large number of workers to Chongqing again. Among his workers, five are steelmaking experts and one is an alcohol-making expert. What people should pay attention to is that Nelson's coming here is not to build China, but to manufacture munitions in China and destroy China. In addition, he plans to monopolize China's political and economic rights. A British commentator once said: "China will become a country with nothing before and after the war." If Nelson's plan to come to China succeeds, the commentator's words will unfortunately come true.

Britain Also Shows Dissatisfaction with the United States

Regarding the China issue, Britain has also expressed dissatisfaction with the United States' conclusion. On the 15th of this month, British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lawes stated: "Britain has nothing to discuss about the current situation in China. In the future, the China issue is actually a part of the United States' problems," etc. From this, we can know Britain's dissatisfaction with the United States. Even in terms of the relations between Chongqing and the United States, there has recently been a trend towards disharmony. The exchange of propaganda between Chongqing and the United States has no other subject matter except for Japan as propaganda material. On the 15th of this month, the Chongqing Associated Press correspondent sent a telegram to New York saying: "Japan has now admitted defeat and is making a protracted war in the Philippines for future plans." This kind of nonsensical propaganda, which neither understands the facts nor takes into account the current situation, is extremely clumsy and ridiculous.

### Discussions on Salary Payment and Rice Distribution Issues for Faculty and Staff

— Wang Xiuhe

Having read three news items related to education in the October 28th issue of this newspaper, I, though lacking in talent, would like to briefly express my views on matters closely related to my colleagues in the education sector, seeking correction from those more knowledgeable!

Firstly, it was about Director Dai of the Education Bureau answering reporters' questions, stating that concrete results have been achieved in improving the treatment of faculty and staff (increasing the original salary of $730 by 200%). Although the speed of price increases cannot be matched by the amount of increase, the concern of the municipal and educational authorities for educational workers is evident. The psychological comfort given to educational workers is indeed very valuable.

Secondly, it concerns the request to school authorities to "pay all the salaries of faculty and staff for a semester at the beginning of the semester so that faculty and staff can arrange their living needs for half a year in advance." This approach is unimpeachable in principle, but if we look at the facts, it may be difficult to implement, especially in private schools, given the current circumstances where everything is not satisfactory. Because, will a teacher remain unchanged from the beginning to the end of the semester? That is one question. If there is a change, will the overpayment of salary be fully refunded? That is another question. Even if a full refund is possible, and using the refunded amount—which may not purchase the same quantity of goods as when originally received—to find a replacement, will the replacement be suitable? That is another question. If these questions cannot be adequately resolved, the children whose parents pay tuition will inevitably suffer significant losses. Therefore, in my humble opinion, a more appropriate approach would be, after receiving tuition fees, the principal should convene all teachers in the school to jointly determine the total salary each teacher should receive for the semester, based on the tuition fee allocation principles stipulated by the Education Bureau. One-sixth should be paid as a preliminary advance, and the remaining five-sixths should be used to purchase rice in bulk and stored in the school. At the end of each month, the rice should be distributed to each person by quantity rather than price. In this way, regardless of rice price fluctuations, the quantity received by teachers each month will remain consistent. Even if a teacher leaves the school mid-term, the replacement will not suffer losses, and the school's administration will not face difficulties. Let's take the example of our school (Municipal Feihong Elementary School): At the beginning of this semester, based on the resolution of the first school affairs meeting, in addition to paying each person $12,000 in advance (approximately two-thirds of the tuition fee portion each person should receive for the semester) as a settling-in allowance, the rest was handed over to the dining committee to prepare firewood and rice for daily use. Therefore, even though the current rice price has exceeded $20,000 per dan and the firewood price has also approached $2,000 per load, the cost of meals at our school in October is only about $700 per person (three meals a day) (it was $608 in September). Teachers, though working diligently day and night, have never shown any signs of fatigue. Therefore, I feel that if the school authorities can treat the teachers with sincerity, then I believe the issue of salary payment can be easily resolved appropriately.

Thirdly, it concerns the issue of consolidating the special rice rations for faculty and staff. Administratively, there may still be inconveniences, as those entitled to extra rice rations are not limited to faculty and staff. Regarding the handling of this matter, let's take our school as an example: After receiving the ration coupons on October 19th, to save teachers from traveling back and forth, and to save on transportation costs and time, I and a teacher representative (the representative was nominated by the Morning Talk Meeting—the Morning Talk Meeting is a gathering of all faculty and staff in the school, held at 8:20 am every morning to review the work of the previous day and plan the progress of the current day's work) each rode bicycles to the public sales office to pay (the payment was temporarily advanced by the school and will be deducted at the end of the month), pick up the goods, transport them back to the school, and distribute them evenly. We have already received two installments, and the teachers have not experienced the suffering described by a group of teachers. But I don't know if this method can be used for reference by other schools.

In short, education is a grand plan for cultivating people. Our lives may be simple and frugal, but our responsibilities are very heavy. Some shortsighted people may regard us friends who deliver critiques with chalk as fools who are both ignorant and mediocre, but we have our own beliefs and our own ideals. Wu Xun was willing to let people call him a beggar, but he could not extinguish his enthusiasm for establishing schools. I also hope that my colleagues in the education sector will all offer a sincere heart and promote mutual assistance to work together for the children. Then, the future of the family and the nation may have hope. (The稿酬 will be used to support scholarship fund.)

Social Services

### Responding to the Giving of Clothes and Gruel

Mr. Huang Yunsheng wrote: "Dear Sir, the fourteenth of this month was the one-month anniversary of my daughter Lifen. I am deeply grateful for the generous gifts from relatives and friends. Therefore, I have converted the cash and gifts received into a total of $39,963.40, and I am transferring $19,963.40 to your organization for winter relief expenses, and $10,000 each to the Nursing Home and the Pushan Villa, for the benefit of all relatives and friends. I am enclosing three checks and request that you kindly accept and forward them."

Charity in Mind

Mr. Dong Fangjiande, residing in a corner of Shanghai, sees many isolated, poor, and weak people suffering from hunger and cold, unable to make a living, urgently needing relief. Therefore, he has donated $10,000 from his private savings, allocating $1,000 each to the Charity's poverty relief fund, elementary school teacher medical assistance fund, small business loan fund, destitute children assistance fund, medical assistance fund, and maternity assistance fund. Furthermore, as the weather is getting colder and severe winter is approaching, the poor are exposed to the wind and dew, and their suffering is even more unbearable. He generously donated $4,000 for winter relief expenses in response. Also, Mr. Wu Hangben and Mr. Zhu Aqi either donated exclusively to the destitute children assistance fund or divided their donations among the Charity's various assistance funds, all demonstrating enthusiasm for public welfare and a charitable heart, which is truly admirable.

### Children's Welfare Association Appeals for Donations, Hopes All Sectors Will Act Righteously

The Chinese Children's Welfare Association, to maintain the educational work of over 300 orphaned children, launched a fundraising campaign recently. It has been over a week, and donations from all sectors have been quite enthusiastic. The orphaned children cared for by the association are the most pitiful and tragic children in society. Among them are children who have become beggars on the streets due to the deaths of their parents or family separation due to the war. There are also children who have been abandoned by their parents due to poverty, becoming street vagrants. If we do not take measures to rescue these children who are poorly clothed, poorly fed, and sleeping on the streets, the tragic phenomenon is unimaginable.

As the saying goes, "Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda." Saving the life of an orphaned child now means cultivating a portion of vitality for the country and preserving a glimmer of hope for the nation. We deeply hope that enthusiastic people in society will act righteously and support this righteous cause. If you are willing to donate, the Social Services Department of this newspaper can also collect donations in addition to the direct collection by the association.
