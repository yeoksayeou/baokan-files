### Promptly Establish Organs of Public Opinion

The government, in order to respect public opinion, should promptly establish organs of public opinion, both at the central and local levels. This is a consistent stance of this newspaper. In the past, we have repeatedly discussed and suggested this in terms of both theory and implementation. Here, we will quote ourselves again as follows:

On January 9th of last year, when the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States, our newspaper's editorial, titled "On Entering the War," argued that the issue of greatest concern to the people was: What will happen after entering the war? We offered the authorities two points: First, respect public opinion. Now that entering the war has been determined as a national policy, everything related to the future of the nation and the lives of the people must widely solicit public opinion and obtain the full understanding of the people. The people are the most important and ultimate deciding force. The thorough implementation of national policies and the execution of government orders will never proceed smoothly or be successfully completed without the active and voluntary participation and support of the people. If we do not want national policies to be separate from the people, with the two not in harmony, then everything in the future must widely solicit public opinion, gather the essence, and especially give full play to the power of the people. Only by respecting public opinion in this way can we realize national policies and strive for victory.

On September 9th of last year, eight months after entering the war, our newspaper's editorial, titled "Reflections on Eight Months of War," objectively analyzed the past in four points. The third point pointed out that wartime politics had not yet shown effective performance. Although there had been adjustments to the political system, real efficiency had not been achieved. The main reason for this was the continued separation from the interests of the people. Therefore, as long as the people do not have the opportunity to participate in politics, public opinion cannot be effectively expressed, and a gap still exists between government measures and public opinion.

On July 6th of last year, before the imminent takeover of the concessions, our newspaper's editorial, titled "The Construction of a New Shanghai and Organs of Public Opinion," argued that establishing a genuine organ of public opinion in a new Shanghai was particularly important and must be prepared early so that it could be quickly realized. This would assist the government. This organ of public opinion must possess several basic conditions. First, its powers must be clearly defined. It must have the power to assist the government in investigating and designing all municipal facilities, provide opinions to the government, and supervise special public welfare undertakings and facilities. We believe that only by establishing an organ of public opinion endowed with such powers can it be the eyes and ears of the government and the voice of the people, enabling the government's policies to be supported by the people and the people's hardships and demands to be understood by the government. Only in this way can we effectively concentrate the power of officials and the people and jointly shoulder the construction of a new Shanghai. Otherwise, if the government is detached from the people, any construction is out of the question. Second, in terms of organization, it must be rigorous and flexible. It does not necessarily have to have a large form and structure, but it must be convenient for performing its work and exerting its effectiveness. At the same time, in order to realize this requirement, the organizational structure of this organ of public opinion must also avoid bureaucratism and officialdom. In terms of personnel selection, it must be especially cautious. It must elect leaders and specialists who can represent the people and are trusted and respected by the people from among the genuine citizens.

The above-quoted words are all our past arguments for establishing organs of public opinion. We further observe that all countries in Greater East Asia have organs of public opinion of a similar nature, such as our ally Japan, which has the Diet and the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. The newly emerging Philippines and Burma have Congress. The natives of Malaya, Java, and other places also have senates. Even in Chongqing, although the Kuomintang monopolizes power, there is also the establishment of a "Political Council." We believe that all wise governments must value public opinion and have a diet, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, etc. The newly emerging Philippines and Burma have congresses, etc. Indigenous people in Malaya, Java and other places have senates, etc. This is the best way to promote government orders. Moreover, during this wartime, it is especially necessary for the people to cooperate thoroughly in order to ensure victory.

Secondly, as far as Shanghai is concerned, its importance goes without saying. In the past, the municipal government had a council, and the concessions had a board of directors, a public works bureau, a tax-payers association, etc., which were also institutions for expressing public opinion. Since the takeover of the concessions in August of last year, Mayor Chen has also stated that the establishment of an organ of public opinion is necessary and can be established in six months without further consideration. However, time has passed, and we have not yet seen the establishment of an organ of public opinion. For the sake of Shanghai's future and to fulfill the task of an important rear base during the war, the delayed establishment of an organ of public opinion cannot but be a regrettable matter. We have repeatedly offered suggestions for the ideal organ of public opinion. Here, we will briefly reiterate and supplement our opinions as follows:

The selection of representatives should be based solely on the condition that they are trusted by the people. Currently, due to environmental constraints, it is not possible to have a public election, so the municipal government should designate and invite them, but it must break with the concepts of party affiliation, hometown, and region.

Shanghai is an economic center, and it should be centered on people from the private economic sector. In addition to the Kuomintang, outstanding elements from other parties such as the Youth Party and the National Socialist Party should also be recruited.

Various specialized committees should be established within the organ of public opinion to discuss and suggest various specialized issues, such as finance, economy, public utilities, public security, culture, education, social welfare, health, etc. Experts from various departments and experienced people should be invited to serve.

In the past two or three years, there has been very little contact between the municipal government and the people, which is a great regret. If an organ of public opinion is established, the authorities and the people will have regular opportunities for contact, which will naturally lead to close ties and eliminate the gap between officials and the people. In addition, there are quite a few Japanese expatriates living in Shanghai, and in order to further achieve close coordination in building a Greater Shanghai, it is also necessary to communicate as much as possible with the opinions of Allied expatriates. We should have regular contact with Allied expatriate leaders and organize and hold regular gatherings of a consultative nature, listening to opinions on the one hand and explaining government orders on the other, so that there is absolutely no gap between the two sides.

Finally, we advocate that in order to achieve a clear political situation, innovation is the most important thing. As far as Shanghai is concerned, the first is political innovation, the second is economic innovation, and the third is the establishment of an organ of public opinion, so that we can ensure public security and gradually achieve the ideal Greater Shanghai. At the same time, only with such steps can we unleash economic power, fulfill the mission of an important rear base, and contribute to the victory of the Greater East Asia War!

### Japanese Troops Intercept Enemy Reinforcements and Advance Fiercely Towards Chittagong; 10,000 British Troops Surrounded Near Taung Bazaar

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a certain base on the Burmese front: After completing its mission of providing flank cover during the battle near Taung Bazaar in the Chin Hills, a certain Japanese unit is now advancing fiercely towards Chittagong from the Hakha area. At the same time, a certain Japanese unit pursuing the defeated enemy and advancing north from the Kaladan River Valley, in response to the former, is continuing its rapid advance under the enemy's intense retreat-covering fire and with close coordination from another unit that is intercepting attacks from the side on the right bank of the river. It has passed Kengin and is currently attacking a certain strategic location. Moreover, the Japanese troops in this area on the right bank of the river have also begun operations, advancing from the north of Minbya and Inbauk. Therefore, the enemy's 81st West African Division, which is stirring in the Kaladan River Valley in an attempt to reverse the decline in Arakan, and the enemy's 3rd Division, which is launching an offensive towards Arakan, are facing annihilation.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a certain Japanese base on the Burmese front: Approximately 10,000 troops of the main force of the British Indian 17th Division near Taung Bazaar have recently been surrounded by Japanese troops. The Japanese army is launching a fierce offensive by air and land. That is, the Japanese army units defeated the stubborn resistance of the enemy army to the east of Taung Bazaar and inflicted annihilation blows. On the morning of the 14th, at 9:00 a.m., the Japanese army further occupied the area north of the area in a melee, completely cutting off the retreat route of the enemy army in the Tiddim and Taung Bazaar areas, and launched a severe annihilation battle, causing a major fire in the enemy army's military facilities in Taung Bazaar. Another unit fiercely attacked a powerful enemy unit possessing tanks and self-propelled artillery near Sinkin, 3 kilometers northwest of Taung Bazaar on the morning of the 14th. It attacked the enemy army advancing north near a certain key road, causing it to fall into great chaos, capturing hundreds of its trucks. Although the enemy army is rushing left and right in the Japanese army's encirclement, its annihilation is only a matter of time.

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the Southeast Asia Allied Forces Command announced in a battle situation communique on the 15th that a fierce bayonet fight has broken out between the Japanese army and the anti-Axis forces in the northern area of Buthidaung.

### The Defenses of the Andaman and Other Islands are Extremely Strong

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the frontline in the Indian Ocean, their importance has greatly increased with the progress of the war situation on the Burmese-Indian border. The Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces Commander, Mountbatten, is still trying to cover up the failure of the land war in an attempt to reverse the decline. It seems that he intends to carry out a maritime roundabout operation to acquire a base on the two archipelagos and to heavily publicize the Burmese counter-offensive operation. If a large-scale naval force is used in the Bay of Bengal, it can break through the Arakan Mountains. These two archipelagos are the strategic line for crushing the enemy's defense of the Greater East Asia resource zone and are also a major fortress for controlling the sea and air power in the Bay of Bengal. Therefore, they are called the Bay of Bengal Fortress Line. In March of Showa 17 (1942), the Japanese army advanced into the two archipelagos. For two years since then, the defense works have been extremely strong. The main islands include North, South, Small, and Middle Andaman Islands, and Car Nicobar, South Kori, and Great Nicobar Islands. All of these are small islands of less than 1,000 square kilometers. Port Blair, the capital, is the best developed. Except for Car Nicobar Island, other birds are mostly forested and cannot immediately become land-based air bases. Due to this geographical environment, they have the characteristics of a special fortress line. Even if the enemy successfully landed on one of them, it would be difficult to build a flying base and would only become the bait of the Japanese navy and air force. Currently, the bombing and reconnaissance battles between the Japanese and British air forces are in full swing in the Bay of Bengal. Once the war situation in the Indian Ocean matures, this modern maritime fortress line can be proven to be absolutely impregnable. If Mountbatten attempts to launch a counter-offensive from the sea, it is expected to be crushed by the Japanese army, which will instead facilitate the Japanese army's capture of India.

### Four Enemy Planes Attacking Leizhou Peninsula Shot Down

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in South China, when a formation of P40 and B25 enemy planes attacked the Haikou airfield on the 13th of this month, the Japanese naval air force engaged with eight enemy planes. They also encountered another batch of five B25 enemy planes over the Leizhou Peninsula and engaged in a fierce battle, resulting in the shooting down of one B25 enemy plane and three P40 enemy planes, and the destruction of several B25 and P40 enemy planes. The Japanese side suffered very little loss.

### Enemy Landing on the West Coast of Howe Island Annihilated; Japanese Troops on Bougainville Island Attack Enemy Positions

Rabaul, 15th (Central News Agency) - On the 11th, one enemy torpedo boat and one landing craft carried out a landing on the west coast of Howe Island (about one kilometer north of Lorengau, the eastern end of Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands). The Japanese naval forces in the area immediately engaged them and annihilated the landing enemy troops.

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in the Central Pacific, three enemy B25 planes attacked Jaluit Island in the Marshall Islands on the morning of the 14th. Also, three enemy B25 planes attacked Mille Island on the afternoon of the same day, but were repelled by the Japanese garrison. The Japanese side suffered no damage.

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese troops on Bougainville Island have been attacking the main positions of the enemy troops around Torokina since last Sunday. After occupying a certain height of 600 meters above sea level on the 10th, they continued to attack the enemy's main positions on a certain height. On the 13th, they launched a night attack, breaking through the enemy's positions west of the height, and are continuing to attack their main positions from behind. Since the enemy has been attacked by the Japanese army, it has been quite embarrassed. It began on the 11th to cooperate with naval artillery in land operations and attempted to reinforce its forces. However, these enemy boats reinforcing from the sea are simply good targets for the Japanese artillery. Moreover, when the Japanese army occupied a certain height of 600 meters above sea level on the 10th, the enemy army abandoned more than 300 corpses. The Japanese army also captured six mortars, four machine guns, one hundred automatic rifles, and a large number of other weapons and ammunition. The Japanese army suffered only sixty-odd casualties. Also, when attacking a certain height on the 11th, the enemy army abandoned more than one hundred corpses. In total, since the start of the operation on the 8th, the enemy army has suffered approximately eight or nine hundred casualties.

### Japanese Advanced Performing Arts Decided to Stop for One Year

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Based on the decisive battle extraordinary measures, the Japanese government has decided to stop advanced performing arts for one year. The Kabuki Theater and the nine major theaters in Tokyo have already complied with the order to suspend performances. Among them, approximately 1,300 actors of Japanese classical theater, kabuki, and other advanced new dramas and dance performances, and approximately 2,000 employees, will be dealt with in the future, which is attracting attention from all parties. Recently, as a result of research by the Industry Patriotic Society Police Department, it was decided to transfer them to local mobile performances for consolation to engage in production workers. The Japanese government Rich Bureau also expressed great concern for this group of actors. It is actively working to guide younger generations to perform decisive battle dramas and will consult with the theater companies on various preparatory plans, which have now been fully negotiated.

### Original Text of the Judgment in the Case of Corruption by Hou Dachun and Hu Zheng

(Continued from yesterday) Also, on February 20 of the same year, Hou Dachun, the commander of the Zhenrong No. 2629 unit, established a contract to purchase 10,000 tons of rice, requisitioned in the three counties of Wuxian, Wujiang, and Wuxi, using a total purchase fund of 32,396,127 yuan. The Rong unit only handed over 27,381,084 yuan, resulting in a loss of 5,015,43 yuan. In addition, the interest was 757,167 yuan, for a total loss of 5,772,210 yuan. The Rong unit had promised to allocate materials such as matches, soap, wax, cigarettes, sugar, and cotton cloth, equivalent to one-sixth of the rice purchase price, to the rice farmers. However, after Hou Dachun accepted the materials, he only allocated 30% of them to the rice farmers, and the remaining 70% was used for trafficking and profiteering, gaining a net profit of 7,789,501 yuan. After compensating for the previous loss, he actually obtained an illegal profit of 2,774,458 yuan, 5 jiao, 3 fen, and 8 li. Also, in early May of the same year, Hou Dachun, at the instigation of Zhu Zicheng, the director of the Kunshan Flour Mill Industry Association, withdrew 3,500,000 yuan from the 45,000,000 yuan of the Ministry of Food's rice purchase fund to purchase 12,910 bags of flour. In mid-August of the same year, Tang Lianhou, the manager of the Wanfeng Grain Store that he set up himself, moved the flour out of the South Wing area and sold it to the merchant Zhang Chusheng, gaining a net profit of approximately 1,400,000 yuan, which caused the aforementioned flour to illegally flow into the Shanghai area. Also, in March of the same year, Hou Dachun was introduced by Geng Jia to the iron rice merchant Shen Linqing. In April of the same year, he paid him 6,000,000 yuan (Jiangsu Local Bank checks) from the rice purchase fund sent by the Ministry of Food to allow him to requisition 15,000 shi of rice in Suzhou. Hu Zheng took office as the head of the Sales Office in the same month. Hou Dachun also introduced Shen Linqing to him to purchase a large amount of rice at a low price and then turn it over to the Food Bureau and the Sales Office when the market price rose. It is estimated that approximately 1,780 shi were purchased in Qingpu and 3,000 shi were purchased and resold in Jiashan. Subsequently, Shen Linqing gave Hou Dachun and Hu Zheng 540,000 yuan each in June of the same year and also gave Hou Dachun a car. At the end of the same month, Hu Zheng transferred another 875,000 yuan to Hou Dachun. After transferring 500,000 yuan to others, Hou Dachun obtained the remaining amount for himself. (To be continued)

### Random Talk on the Current Situation

— Tokutomi Sohō

Humans are the most intelligent of all beings, controlling and utilizing all things. This goes without saying. However, when it comes to the grand plan of our Japanese military state, people must often be regarded as things. Regarding the issue of quantity, since Sun Tzu, it has become the most important thing for military strategists. Therefore, the increase in population is the highest task for governing the country and bringing peace to the world. In other words, for a country like Japan, even during wartime, or rather, precisely because it is wartime, the population growth rate has actually increased, with an increase of two million people every year. This truly cannot but make us thank heaven and earth.

However, no matter how important human resources are, we cannot expect someone holding a baby to carry a large cannon. What we want to advocate here is a point about age dedication. However, age dedication is by no means unlimited. At least men and women over the age of thirty should each dedicate ten years of their lives, and the age they dedicate is a contribution to the nation. Dedicating ten years means that someone who is thirty years old becomes twenty, someone who is forty becomes thirty, and so on, decreasing in the same way. Someone who is fifty becomes forty, sixty becomes fifty, and seventy becomes sixty. An old man like me, who is eighty-two years old, naturally becomes a seventy-two-year-old man. Those over ninety years old are an exception. If age is reduced in this way, and the past retirement system is completely revised accordingly, then those who have previously retired will have to return to the ranks. Even those who are about to retire can extend their term of service. All these results are for the sake of the country, and naturally human resources will increase.

The reason why the past retirement system was established was to provide an opportunity for newcomers to enter the workforce. However, in today's situation where work is piled up like mountains, and even cats and dogs are being driven to serve, it is naturally impossible to talk about paving the way for newcomers. There should be many opportunities for newcomers to advance. Young people must work, so old people should not work. Saying such things is like limiting childbirth, which can be said to be the extreme of pessimism. Originally, those whose muscles and bones have not yet weakened, whose abilities are still intact, and whose experience and skill increase with age, are abandoned without hesitation and allowed to retire, while paying extra pensions and allowing them to be idle. This is truly an extremely irrational phenomenon in terms of human resource economics. Even in peacetime, it is unavoidable to do this, which is already as erroneous as the most unreasonable theory of birth control that once swept the world. Then, in today's emergency, such fallacies should be quickly swept away and cleared up.

Perhaps some people say that this is indeed very suitable for the elderly, but it is not appropriate for the strong. If I, the author, am an old man, and I am saying a few words in support of the elderly from the standpoint of protecting the elderly, then this is a great injustice. We are in such an emergency today and absolutely do not need to have distinctions between classes, men and women, old and young, etc. Just because someone is old, they cannot do this, or because someone is strong, they must do this, or women are not allowed to do outdoor work, etc. These are ultimately things of peacetime. Today, we should no longer value age. This can be clearly understood by looking at the so-called juvenile air force. Look at the young students who have not yet graduated from middle school, constantly transforming into juvenile air force, and killing enemies and achieving results on the front lines. You can know that when necessary, age is not a problem. Conversely, it can be said that the younger the person, the more useful they are. If young people are like this, then old people are naturally like this too. If young people are useful, then old people are naturally also useful.

War is by no means simple. To conduct a war, if you estimate the work of the front and the rear, then all the complex work, such as large and small vehicles, large and small wheels, must be artistically and comprehensively coordinated to proceed. Therefore, in today's era, age should never be the standard for whether to serve. We must see whether it is suitable for the work, that is the standard. However, some jobs especially require energetic people, while other jobs are not necessarily limited to people of a certain age. For the job itself, it is enough to find someone who can take on the responsibility. Therefore, we have always advocated the adoption of new people, but this does not mean that we should abandon old people. Now the Soviet Union and Britain have expanded the age of employment to sixty years old. Looking at it this way, why don't we implement the theory of age dedication? Those who worry that old people will steal the jobs of young people, or that women will steal the jobs of men, and therefore advocate that those who undertake current duties should be reduced to the minimum, not only narrowly understand the meaning of the national total war, but also hinder and destroy the highest purpose of the total war. In extraordinary times, we must work in the way of extraordinary times. (Translated by Lu from the February 9th Mainichi Shimbun)

### Ambassador Tani states that Japan spares no support for collaborative construction of new China

Central News Agency report: Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani Masayuki, previously toured Southern China, Northern China, Mengjiang, Hankou, and other places following the implementation of Japan's new policy towards China. This tour has now concluded, and he arrived in Shanghai by car at 2:30 PM yesterday (the 16th). He plans to stay for two or three days before returning to his post in Beijing. The following is a record of his remarks made to the press corps yesterday:

The National Government has formally begun implementing wartime price control measures, as evidenced by the recent punishment of corrupt officials. This shows that the National Government's political power is on track, and the people's trust in the National Government has been strengthened as a result, which is cause for great celebration. Japan's new policy towards China is being implemented one by one with the deep understanding of all Chinese and Japanese officials and civilians. However, the degree of its prevalence varies due to regional relations, which is unavoidable, or due to differences in national and social conditions. Some regions have their own characteristics, so the degree of prevalence in each region is not consistent. However, in the future, I firmly believe that the true meaning of Japan's new policy towards China will become increasingly clear, and in the near future, it will be thoroughly understood by the people. Therefore, issues such as overall peace are all internal affairs of the National Government, and Japan only takes a bystander attitude. We are determined to work sincerely to realize the new policy. It will still take some time for the people under the rule of the Chongqing side to understand this sincerity. At least during the Greater East Asia War, there is little hope. However, before people understand it, they will be shown sincerity to guide them. I firmly believe that the day they understand it will be the day that all Chinese people truly realize that they are one of the peoples of Greater East Asia. The Chongqing side is currently only following the lead of the United Kingdom and the United States. In the future, they will surely realize that only the United Kingdom and the United States are the enemies of East Asia. For the sake of the revival of China, all economic support that Japan gives to China must be promoted more actively. Before its specific realization, whether it is in terms of price control measures or industrial revitalization measures in Central China, it is expected that there will still be considerable difficulties. Under these circumstances, Japan will never stand idly by and watch. In order to cooperate in the construction of a new China, it is determined to spare no support.

### Rice and Grain Control Committee Rewards Purchase of Rice Grain, Incentive Money Paid in Three Installments

In order to strengthen the purchasing mechanism, complete the purchasing work, and maintain the food supply for civilians and the military, the Rice and Grain Control Committee, in addition to implementing the exchange of daily necessities for the purchase of rice grain, has specially formulated the "Measures for Handling Incentive Money for the Purchase of Rice Grain:" The Rice and Grain Control Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Rice Control Committee) maintains close contact with the Rural Clearing Affairs Bureau and relevant military departments. In the rural clearing areas of Area A, each county is designated as a unit, and the quantity of rice grain that should be distributed is determined. The quantity to be undertaken by each county stipulated in the above regulations is instructed by the Rice Control Committee to the purchasing merchants in each locality, and the military department and the relevant government offices of the rural clearing area separately notify the liaison department and the county government. The trade association is responsible for purchasing rice grain in accordance with various regulations, and the relevant administrative officials only provide goodwill assistance in persuading farmers to provide rice grain, so as to achieve the expected purchasing target. The rice grain management and payment of funds should not be interfered with in any way, but the township and town chiefs and below should be responsible for guaranteeing the quantity distributed in their respective jurisdictions. In order to implement the above methods and make them have close contact with each other, the Rice Control Committee should promptly send a copy of the rice grain purchasing permit and rice grain transportation passport to the relevant government authorities for reference. When the administrative officials exceed the designated distribution quantity due to their strict and appropriate handling of the tasks described in the lower section of the third item, the Rice Control Committee shall give incentive money. The incentive money allocated to the counties that meet the qualifications in the preceding paragraph shall be 15/1000 or more of the purchase price, up to 20/1000. When deciding on the award-winning county, in addition to the reports of the military department and government officials, the reports of the purchasing merchants should also be used as information. The incentive money is divided into three installments: before the end of December, before the end of the lunar New Year, and before the end of the rice killing year. The money will be allocated to the award winners after review and decision based on the distribution quantity in each period. The payment of the bonus will be decided and implemented by a committee composed of the chairman of the deliberation committee, the chairman of the Rice Control Committee, the director of the Rice Control Committee, the general army, and the representative of the embassy.

### Reissuing of Residence Certificates Has Begun

It is reported that the reissuing of residence certificates in District 1 has already begun. The authorities of each Baojia district have separately issued new certificate application forms to each Lianbao and Baojia chief, who will forward them to each household to fill out. After filling them out and submitting them, the Baojia section of the police station will specify a date and order people to collect the new certificates, and at the same time return the old citizen certificates. Furthermore, it is understood that the Xinza District and other Baojia districts have formally issued new-style residence certificates to some citizens who have moved in from other districts. In addition to the authorities of each district issuing them, their style is similar to the old citizen certificates, but their paper and color are slightly different, and they have been changed to yellow.

### Replacement of Street Signs Can Be Completed by the End of the Month

According to a Times reporter, the dismantling of British and American street signs in District 1 and the former eight districts is expected to yield 16 tons of iron material. Before the end of this month, 1,800 street signs in this city can be reinstalled. At that time, the sign frames and sign faces will be replaced. The former will be replaced with wood, and the latter will be changed to cement. The Public Works Department is actively engaged in dismantling. It is said that a total of 250 roads will have their names changed. Each road has multiple street signs. District 1 has 800, and the former eight districts have 1,000. These street signs only have the Chinese road names filled in.

### The District 1 Public Office Revises the Price of Bread

The District 1 Public Office has revised the price of bread and flour sold within the district from March 18 of this year as follows:

White bread: Wholesale price is 13.20 yuan per pound in national currency, and the retail price is 14 yuan per pound in national currency, both without packaging. If packaging is required, an additional 1 yuan per pound in national currency will be charged. The weight of the bread should be calculated proportionally to the pound, whether it is less than or more than one pound. The rationed flour received by each bakery company is only allowed to be used to bake white bread of eight ounces, twelve ounces, and six ounces, twenty-four ounces, and thirty-two ounces.

First-class flour: One jin per ticket is sold for 11 yuan in national currency, without packaging, based on the flour coupon attached to the bread purchase certificate. According to the office, the reason for approving the revised price of bread this time is the increase in the price of flour, yeast, and fuel.

### The First Police Bureau Prepares to Establish a Consumer Cooperative, Held a Forum Yesterday to Invite Representatives from All Walks of Life

Central News Agency report: The consumer cooperative of the First Police Bureau of this city held a forum at the Police Club at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 16th) to invite leaders from the financial, commercial, and news sectors of this city. More than 100 people attended, including Kai Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Li Sihao, Guo Shun, Chen Binhe, Xiong Bai, and Xu Liqiu. The vice chairman of the cooperative, Du Zhengjian Su Chengde, and all directors and supervisors warmly welcomed them.

Du Zhengjian delivered a speech

Briefly stated that the establishment of the consumer cooperative was due to the recent soaring prices, which threatened the general public, and the lives of the police and their families were also greatly affected. However, the police bear the heavy responsibility of maintaining law and order, so it is necessary to stabilize their lives and improve police administration, eliminate the past bad impressions, and then ensure local law and order. At the same time, it is hoped that major manufacturers will provide more assistance to the establishment of the cooperative.

Su Chengde delivered a speech

Stating briefly (omitted above) that since the takeover of the concessions, the police administration of the 18th and Western Shanghai districts has been unified, reducing the suffering of the citizens from the inconsistency of police administration in the past. The improvement of police administration must first focus on the police system and police education, but the current life of the police has become a major problem. In recent months, I have been urging my subordinates at all times to seek benefits for the 5 million citizens and to obey police ethics and serve the society. However, their lives must also be taken care of. The daily increase in the cost of living is self-evident. The current salary of the police is more than 1,200 yuan per month per person, which is not a small amount, but compared with the current cost of living index, it is shocking. Under such a life, the situation of the police officers is naturally difficult. On the one hand, the government's funds are limited and there is no way to increase them, so there is the organization of a consumer cooperative, which strives to distribute daily necessities such as rice and coal at parity prices in order to stabilize the lives of the police and ensure the security of Greater Shanghai. Regarding the raising of large capital and the distribution of daily necessities to more than 10,000 police officers, please assist.

It is now understood that the department plans to universally levy the special consumption tax in other counties and towns in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui from next month, and has now submitted it to the Ministry of Finance for approval.

### Recommend Design Committee Members

Following that, Wen Lanting, Li Sihao, and Lin Kanghou delivered speeches, briefly stating that the police protect local law and order, and if the lives of the police cannot be stabilized, it will inevitably affect law and order, so the citizens should provide assistance and are happy to provide assistance. Finally, Chen Binhe proposed that everyone present be supporting members, and that a design committee be organized among the supporting members to be responsible for assisting the establishment of the consumer cooperative of the First Bureau. As a result, Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Lvdeng, Tang Shoumin, Chen Binhe, and other eighteen people were appointed as design committee members. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.

### The Old Eight Districts Improve Air Defense Street Lights, Most of Them Have Been Reinstalled

Central News Agency report: Since the long-term lighting control began in this city on the 3rd of this month, the city has fallen into darkness every evening. The Civil Air Defense Headquarters of the City, together with the police sub-bureaus, sent personnel to patrol at any time, and the situation was quite good. However, the air defense street lights in the old eight districts used the method of forced light, and only a line of light remained, and the surrounding area was still extremely dark, which was extremely inconvenient for pedestrians. Therefore, the Civil Air Defense Headquarters of the City summoned the street light management authorities of the district to discuss the method, and changed to the District 1 air defense light method for improvement. Most of them have been completed, and the Japanese Army authorities, together with the Air Defense Headquarters and the police bureau in charge, inspected the district for a week last night and were satisfied.

### The Security Office Cracks Down on a Drug Production Organization

Central News Agency report: The investigation team of the Security Office of this city successively discovered on the 7th and 9th of this month that the Yang family at No. 5 Yideli, Bailinan Road, was the Jianhua Xieji Huachang at No. 1 Zhenjue Temple, Lane 706, Songgongguan Road. Two places secretly set up an organization to manufacture heroin, with a tight organization and a large scale. After signing and requesting Commander Chen for instructions, on the 7th of this month, the team quickly cooperated with the police bureau in charge to crack down on the heroin den at No. 5 Yideli, Bailinan Road. The main criminal, Yang Jinsheng, and others had already fled without a trace. After several hours of strict search, the medicine dealer began to transport all the machines, chemical raw materials, etc., and the engineer Jiang Henian, the accountant Luo Quanzhi, and the suspects Xu Weiqing, Luo Bingchu, Zhu Hao, Luo Fengshi, and other six prisoners were completely detained by the team. On the 9th of this month, they went to Song Park Road to arrest Jianhua Xieji, and when they arrived, the toxic atmosphere outside the house overflowed, causing people to cover their noses. Knowing that the factory was manufacturing drugs, they did not allow a moment's delay, and the officers rushed into the fence and took the staff working at the organization Wang Shaoxing, Zhang Zhiqian, Shi Zhiqing, Yin Yinru, Wang Dingzhang, Xu Hekun, Mei Haida, Wang Zhangdong, Lu Zhang, Li Fusheng, Kang Chuanxi, Wu Jiefu and other twelve people, and 338 taels of manufactured heroin, plus the machines and raw materials, were taken to the team. According to the confession, the main criminal engineer and others were at large, and their whereabouts were usually secretive and they did not often go to the factory. They hired ignorant coolies to manufacture harmful drugs, which was a heinous crime that could not be tolerated by the law. The team is still continuing to order officers to go out and conduct strict investigations. It is reported that all the seized evidence and prisoners have been sent to the procuratorate of this city to await legal punishment.

### Major Commodities May Not Be Applied for Loan Collateral

In order to suppress commodity prices and stabilize people's livelihood, the government's rich bureaus have decided to thoroughly investigate hoarding and crack down on speculation as the main goals. Since the Central Reserve Bank implemented tight lending and inspected the financial affairs offices to restrict financial institutions from lending business and not to undertake major commodity mortgage loans, not only has the trend of hoarding and speculation been curbed slightly, but also the major commodity mortgage loans that have already been undertaken have been urgently recovered. Therefore, in recent days, some people who have used the funds of the silver money industry to hoard goods have reduced prices and sold them, and market prices have continued to fall as a result. Therefore, the measures to contract floating capital and suppress commodity prices have achieved great results. It is heard that the Central Reserve Bank has decided to strictly review the purpose of the merchants applying for interbank lending and the types of collateral before approving the lending of interbank lending and post-loan business of financial institutions. If there are those who apply for mortgage loans with major commodities or are suspected of hoarding and speculating, they will be strictly rejected.

### Each Guild Strictly Prohibits Illegal Transactions

In view of the fact that the establishment of markets by various trade guilds was originally intended to facilitate the centralized buying and selling by members of the same trade, all sales to merchants or by merchants to shops must be transacted in accordance with the established rules, and all transactions are limited to spot goods. It is absolutely forbidden to exceed the officially set price limit. Recently, it has been discovered that people outside the trade are selling in the market without authorization, which is highly inappropriate. However, such incidents have always been prohibited. Therefore, all member businesses must not trade with people outside the trade; violators will be punished.

### Firewood Factories' Monthly Production Only Reaches 30%

The other factories, namely Zhonghua (125 cases per day), Daming (155 cases), Guanghua (150 cases), Hongsheng (100 cases), Tongsui (85 cases), Zhongguo (60 cases), Dahua (45 cases), and Zhongnan (15 cases), produce a total of 735 cases. However, recently, due to difficulties in obtaining raw materials, daily production has only reached 30%, or just over 5,000 cases.

### First Line in the South Pacific: A Jungle Military Journal

"Inside the first airfield of the allied forces surrounded by dense forests," this dispatch writes. "The enemy's first line is about 100 meters away, crossing the forest in front of us. The trenches where we are located are filled with rainwater due to heavy rains every day, and our lower bodies are soaked in mud. Such trenches can be seen everywhere in this forest of Torokina, where ancient axes have passed." In this camp, there is a fighting spirit as firm as iron.

The steadfastness of the soldiers in the jungle is for the world's strongest Japanese soldiers. The enemy sacrificed more than twenty aircraft carriers and occupied a corner of Torokina on November 1st of last year. It has been more than four months since then. During this long period, the soldiers on the Japanese first line, despite the fierce attacks of the enemy air force, are still defending this first line. They are waiting to open a path in this forest, so that a large number of artillery and bullets can be transported from the rear to annihilate the enemy.

Since the enemy landed, the forest has been bombed blindly for many days and is still burning. Even as I write this dispatch, I can hear the enemy planes bombing, splitting large trees and shaking the earth. Each bombing causes whirlpools in the mud of the trenches, and mud and water splash onto the soldiers' shoulders. If we had airplanes, artillery, and bullets, we would never allow the enemy to run wild. Under the enemy planes' bombs, which are roaring over Savo, a soldier in the mud shouted, "They're coming!" In an instant, he grabbed his shining bayonet with his left hand and jumped out of the trench.

Night Marching Under Lightning

The bloody battle of Torokina is a battle of airplanes, rifles, and bayonets. Why is there such a battle? Because this island refuses land transportation for thousands of years, and lets ancient forests grow freely. We know very well how difficult it is to maneuver in the dense forest, because we have sneaked through more than 120 kilometers from Buen to Torokina. The entire way is a dark forest, like daytime and nighttime. It took more than ten days to reach our destination. Our hands and feet were bleeding from thorns. We also had to experience the hardships of jungle warfare. We set off from Maiga, near Buen, more than ten days ago. Because there are several enemy planes bombing during the day, we cannot move. So, we only move at night. In the forest at night, we walked hand in hand, but we could not make out each other's faces. Fortunately, it rained heavily for two or three hours every day at night, so we could move in the instant of lightning. This is the only "road sign." Sometimes, we found the phone line of the allied forces in the lightning and walked along the line. The dried bread we brought when we set off was soaked by the rain, and we ate it like glutinous rice cakes. When we thought about the time we served in Guadalcanal, we ate ants' nests and tree roots. This time, we can eat bread, so we feel very happy.

Self-Sufficiency by Growing Vegetables Around the Position

After four or five days, we actually felt that we were approaching the front line. However, the closer we got to the front line, the faster we moved. When the forest caught fire and the enemy's artillery fire became more intense, the light of the flames and explosions could be used as our target, and we no longer had to rely on lightning. However, we did not know when we would encounter the enemy, and the enemy planes flew as high as the forest. They would fire their guns even if they saw only one person. We peeled off banana leaves and used them as camouflage to advance. Near the front line, there were allied positions, and around the positions, there were camouflaged vegetable gardens, planted with cabbage, radishes, etc. From our experience in the bloody battle of Guadalcanal, we need to implement self-sufficiency in the fierce battlefields. It is admirable to grow vegetables in the spare time of battle.

After seven days, the forest became a wetland. Although there were small rivers, all the bridges had been destroyed. The shallow wetlands reached the knees, and the deep ones reached the waist. Our speed of advance was as slow as in the dense forest area. What was even more difficult was taking pictures. We wanted to take pictures of the soldiers' hardships and send them to the rear. But the humidity was high in this place. It took four or five rolls of film to take a picture. The sun was scorching above the forest. How we longed for the sun! We needed the sun. It was our only hope. But if we saw the sun, we could not survive for a moment, because the enemy planes would not let us move.

Using Rifles to Assault Tanks

We, who carried pens and cameras from Buen to the front line of Torokina, still felt it was so difficult. As for the movement of the army, it can be imagined. When we came to the front line of Torokina, we heard the captain say this: "When the enemy landed on Cape Torokina, we mobilized the mountain artillery unit to aid. The mountain artillery departed after the infantry. After a day or two, the mountain artillery could not catch up. The infantry carried rifles and advanced, holding vines in both hands. The soldiers of the mountain artillery divided the mountain artillery into three parts: the barrel, the mount, and the carriage, and followed the infantry. Because it was impossible to act together with the infantry in this dense forest, they first abandoned the carriage, then the mount, and finally only the barrel. However, the barrel alone could not fire the artillery. As a result, this unit only used rifles to deal with the enemy tanks that were transported to the land. No matter how strong the Japanese army is, rifles cannot defeat tanks. Therefore, if we want to win, we must open routes in the front line, and then we must continue to transport the weapons and bullets made by the people's blood and sweat from the rear. This time will come soon. The soldiers on the front line are determined to fight resolutely, no matter what the sacrifice, so there is nothing to worry about. Please, the rear must be more consolidated. This is the call of the soldiers fighting on the front lines of the South Pacific." (Hiroshi, from the February 12th Yomiuri Hochi)

### A Pilgrimage to the Southern Italian Front

The Southern Italian front has become increasingly tense since the anti-Axis forces landed in Anzio. Bloody battles are unfolding everywhere in the Apennine Mountains. The Yomiuri Shimbun special correspondent, who once served as a soldier in the freezing Apennine Mountains for ten days, presents the following observations:

Characteristics of the Southern Italian Front

The coastline in this area is undulating, the mountains are intricately intertwined, and the terrain is complex. Unlike the Eastern Front, large-scale combat cannot be carried out, and trench warfare is inevitable. It has the characteristics of both coastal defense warfare and mountain warfare. Therefore, the cooperation of paratrooper units and artillery units, the cooperation of mountain units and engineer units, and flexible coordination are necessary. Not only that, but the active role of specially organized units is also needed. The Schultz regiment, known as the "Mother of Paratrooper Divisions," and the Alpine units that were active on the Caucasus line. The reporter looked out from the highest point of the front, Mount Maiella, and saw that from north to south, there were many peaks and valleys. The southern Italian cities, which developed from the castles of medieval lords, stood on these mountaintops. Only a road through the valleys connected one city to another, so each city became a natural fortress.

The German army is numerically inferior to the British and American forces, but there is a significant difference in quality. Using the rugged terrain of the Apennine Mountains, various positions are adapted to the terrain, covered with rocks and vegetation, and houses are organically combined to form a fire line. On January 19th, the enemy fired as many as 600 shells at the German front-line base in the eastern area, which stretched for two kilometers, but could not advance a single step. The ingenuity of the German positions is evident. The same is true for coastal defenses. The reporter visited Schultz, the commander of the paratrooper regiment, and asked him everything. He replied as follows:

"At this moment, the German coastal defenses include mines, underwater obstacles, pillboxes, etc., which have a sustained defensive nature; and aircraft, submarines, and various artillery fires, which have a mobile attack nature. The operation on the Atlantic coast is very different because of the relationship between troops and mobility. In the former, the enemy must be deeply lured inland and annihilated; in the latter, a counterattack is launched near the coast. And the morale of our army is higher than expected. The Allied forces have not yet had a sense of impending danger."

Cities on the battlefield have been razed to the ground. Pescara, one of the most beautiful cities on the Adriatic coast, is no exception. Bombing has reduced the city of 45,000 people to ruins. The reporter entered the city and observed. The bright sunlight of the south shone, but there were no people in the streets. The birthplace of the Italian patriotic poet D'Annunzio, the house where he was born, which houses his books and works, has become a national treasure. His nephew and a maid lived there, and even this family could not escape the bombing. Among the scattered scraps of paper in his house, the reporter found a pair of letters signed by his mother, dated July 26, 1899, from Florence. The letter read: "I will be at the mouth of the Arno River for a few days. Mother." These words aroused infinite emotion in the reporter, but the loud sound of artillery fire came from everywhere, and suddenly brought the reporter back to reality.

In one war zone, the "Mussolini Legion" of the new Italian National Defense Army, which cooperated with the German army, showed an active posture. After the collapse of the old Italian National Defense Army, a new National Defense Army was created under Mussolini's new ideas and organization, and rushed to the front line to defend the country. Although there are Patrio rebels on the anti-Axis side, in fact, it is only a slight addition. The tragedy of the century has been staged with the division of compatriots and the killing of siblings. (Translated from the February 3rd Yomiuri Hochi)

### The Heart of the South Seas - The Truk Islands

On the morning of the 17th of last month, the enemy repeatedly launched air raids on the Truk Islands with powerful mobile units. The Japanese army and navy units in that area retaliated.

Since the end of last month, when the enemy, the United States, launched an invasion of the Marshall Islands, a Japanese territory, it finally launched a powerful mobile unit to attack Truk Island, the central hub of the inner South Seas, in less than ten days. From the morning of the 17th to the morning of the 18th, hundreds of carrier-based aircraft formed a large formation and began a real major offensive. The Truk Islands are the most important stronghold on the Japanese southern operation line, and the enemy's frontal attack is expected to be extremely powerful. The front line has further approached the mainland. The morale of the Japanese army and navy garrison troops is becoming more and more激昂, they are inviting to resist and are taking on the important responsibility of defending the motherland's first line. The battle situation is about to enter a major opportunity.

The US Pacific Fleet Command issued a public statement on the night of the 17th, stating that the attack on Truk Island began on the morning of the 16th, and hundreds of US Air Force planes participated. Also, the Associated Press reported:

According to the Pacific Fleet Command, the operation may still be in progress. Due to the implementation of radio control during the largest naval attack operation, detailed reports cannot be obtained from the fleet. (Translated from the February 19th Western Mainichi Shinbun)

The word "Truk" means "deaf man's high mountain" in the local language. As the name suggests, it can be seen that the islands of the archipelago are 　shaped. Scattered among the 150-mile-circumference atoll are many islands such as Shiki Island and Mokuyo Island, of which the largest are the Archipelago and Yongyao Island, which are 30 kilometers in circumference. The island is mostly hilly, with miscellaneous trees growing, and produces dried bonito and high-class shells. The residents are the Kanaka people of the Micronesian system, about 10,000 fishermen, who grow taro and coconuts on land. Stepping on Truk, one feels that there is no South Seas flavor here. Everything is just like a Japanese fishing village. The islanders wear Japanese-made summer shirts and summer pants, and say "Good morning" in the morning and "Good night" in the evening, just like the Japanese. The same language, without any strangeness. On Xia Island and Mizume Island, there are four-year public schools, where the children of the islanders are educated, with no difference from the Japanese. In short, the Truk Islands, the heart of the inner South Seas, is also the heart of the entire South. The heroic Japanese army is working hard to repel the enemy in order to protect the lifeline of the South China Sea. (Abridged translation from the February 20th Mainichi Shimbun)

### Dreams of the Sea

— Yingcai

I helped a wandering and helpless heart, drifting alone and lonely in Shanghai, for a full four years. In the bitter cup of life, even the dregs are painful. I endure the bitter cup of life, spending my remaining years, not daring to have even a second of fantasy, not daring to have even a moment of clarity. Fantasy and clarity will ruthlessly sting your heart, which is riddled with wounds! I know this myself, so I only allow myself to spend my days and nights in a drunken stupor, constantly drinking. Get drunk! Get drunk until my end. In the gently breezy late night, I staggered out of the small bar, on my way home! The crescent moon hung on the willow tips, the little stars like mysterious, spiritual eyes, weren't they reminding me of my past years? They clearly brought back familiar, memorable scenes. The scenes unfolded like a lunar eclipse in the darkness, devouring sweet memories, allowing a moment of comfort to my heart. Her long, wavy hair fell over her shoulders, two pupils as deep as the sea were set in her eye sockets, and then there were her pink cheeks. When she lowered her head, smiling shyly at people, what a charming posture. All of this further enveloped me. Ah! The song I used to teach her floated up again! Dreams of the Sea, is this a dream?

I calmed down and listened carefully again. Indeed, that slow singing was still lingering in my ears. Under the willow shade, stood a girl with her hands full of flowers. I seemed to have found something I had lost for many years, and I called out to her with a familiar voice, and walked closer to her with a floating body. But she ignored me, rolled her eyes, pursed her lips, and called me a drunkard! Ah, what an unpredictable woman's heart! She ran towards the end of the street without looking back, disappearing without a trace. The breeze still blew gently, dispersing my drunkenness. I regretted not chasing after the vanished girl. I stood dumbfounded on the street for a while, then raised my powerless feet and walked weakly into the small room, staring at the framed picture in front of my bed!

...Sixteen years ago in the autumn, she and I agreed to meet by a stream in a certain village. She stood by the stream, about to run away. Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled. There was no time to escape. All around were trees. After turning a bend, I arrived at my residence. Looking back at her, her long hair was soaked with rain, and there wasn't a single dry spot on her body, so I invited her in with pity to take shelter at my place. She sat and talked without any hesitation. The rain fell harder and harder, and our conversation became more and more extensive. Her father was a reclusive poet, and her name was Danyan (Light Smoke). Ah! I met a girl as poetic as the scenery in a poetic place. Afterwards, in the early mornings when the wild grass was covered with dew, and until the evenings when the setting sun sank, she often stayed by the stream. She naturally gazed at the natural fields, her deep eyes measuring the deep sky. Sometimes she leaned against a tree, sometimes she rested against a large rock. The stream was her only companion. By the trees and the stream, she learned to sing with me, "The spring trees and evening clouds are how you and I gaze at each other, the setting moon and lingering clouds are how you and I long for each other! Dreams of the Sea, exclusively for you and me! The heart is so difficult, the life is so floating! Wanting to stay but unable to, wanting to leave but unable to, the storms of the bitter sea! Wandering... drifting..." This was the song she hummed every day afterwards. One dreary dusk, she sadly told me that her father had passed away and that she was being forced to marry her cousin, who was a wastrel. From then on, her lovely figure was no longer seen by the stream. I only faintly heard that she had a child, and there were frequent rumors that they were very happy together. I, this person drifting from east to west, wandered to another place, and her news was cut off from then on. I only silently hoped in a corner of the world that she would be happy forever... One morning I received a letter forwarded from her village! It read:

My respected sir!

Friend of the past by the stream, all

the misfortunes were not unexpected. Last

winter, I married my cousin. He was very good.

He immediately changed his former dissipated ways.

We had a daughter—Xiaoyan (Little Smoke), very happy,

but inherent nature is hard to change. After a long time,

Xiaoyan's father eventually didn't come home every night,

and spent all day gambling and whoring. Now,

he has fallen in love with a socialite,

and has gone to Shanghai for a honeymoon,

abandoning me heartlessly. This is not all,

he didn't even tell me in advance,

and sold the house I lived in.

It wasn't until the buyer pressed me to move

today that I found out.

My daughter and I have nowhere to go.

I originally wanted to ask sir for help,

but I really don't have the face.

If sir is willing to help me find a way to relieve my hardship,

please come to my old residence once within three days.

After three days, I will become a drifter for life,

and where the broken duckweed will grow

is also unknown.

Goodbye! Waiting for your arrival!

Sincerely, Danyan

Oh Heavens! This letter, after being transferred from east to west, had already passed two weeks. I still didn't give up and ran to that village, but there was no trace of her there. But today! I saw her! She! Was still so young, so innocent, but why did she ignore me! Ah! Drunkenness ruined things. Otherwise, I should have caught up with her! And asked for an explanation!

The next day, I waited for her again at the place where I had met her yesterday, but she never came. Day after day, hope gradually disappeared. In the vast world, had our reunion been cut off? So I drank that strong wine again, letting life become more drunk, more numb! More ignorant! I myself didn't know how I ended up drunk on the roadside. I woke up with a start, and suddenly my eyes lit up. Those sea-like pupils flickered beside me, and that low voice flew into my ears, "Sir! Are you awake? You really scared me to death!" I focused my mind and looked again. This young life, this innocent girl, who else could she be but her? I grabbed her tightly, the drunkenness dissipated, but her face seemed strangely unfamiliar! This was a young stranger. I curiously asked her, and learned that this was the flower-selling girl. She said she had no surname, and refused to tell me her name. I became her regular customer. One day she brought the flowers and wanted to go back very quickly. I didn't know what was wrong with her, so I deliberately made things difficult for her and asked her to change the water in the bottle. She obediently went to change it and then left. This happened every day afterwards. She had no time to answer my questions. One day she didn't come, and I waited until noon, but someone else came, someone I had never seen before. She told me herself that she was Xiaoyan's friend and that Xiaoyan's mother was very ill and couldn't leave, so she was substituting for her to deliver flowers. I frantically wanted her to take me to Xiaoyan's house. Today I learned that this flower-selling girl was Xiaoyan. I and this other girl rushed to a lane and entered a low little house. It was said that this was Xiaoyan's home, but she herself ran away with the flowers. This small house was so dark that I couldn't see the direction. After a long time, I saw a dark shadow wriggling in the eastern corner. I hurriedly called Xiaoyan. The girl told me that her mother was critically ill. That miserable voice reminded me of when Danyan was telling me about it in the late winter. Immediately, the girl pulled me into another small room. Under the greenish dim light of the bean oil lamp, I heard that the critically ill person, with her sea-like pupils, was familiar, but nothing else was. I was stunned. Xiaoyan said beside me, "Mom! This is the gentleman who buys my flowers every day!" The weak patient nodded slightly in thanks, suddenly supported herself to sit up, took my hand, and said laboriously, "Aren't you...aren't you...Mr. Ying...Ying? You, you...have forgotten me, haven't you!" I hurriedly stopped her and told her to lie down, but she was still saying, "I...I will forever, forever rest! Let me...let me entrust...entrust Xiaoyan to you! Please...please promise...promise me! This...this last...last request..." I silently held her dry hand, sadly nodding my head. Suddenly that dry hand loosened. Ah! Danyan! She! Rested forever... The greenish dim light of the bean oil lamp became even greener! Ah! Danyan! I searched for you for more than ten years, and today I finally found you! Reunited! But! Smoke, you really dissipated like smoke. My wandering and helpless heart will become even more lonely and desolate. The bitterness of the dregs in the bitter cup is even stronger. The bitter cup of life, the remaining years, how dare I think about it again. Suddenly, I frantically ran to the small bar nearby, sat down, and habitually used strong wine to bury myself in a drunken stupor. As I was raising that white liquid straight to my mouth, a panting voice, softly and urgently, said, "Sir! Help me with my future life!" Xiaoyan was leaning at my feet. I blankly paid for the wine, helped Xiaoyan, and drifted back to the dark lane. The low little house appeared before my eyes. The greenish dim oil lamp flickered, and suddenly went out. Everything was in darkness...

The crescent moon hung on the willow tips, the little stars had mysterious eyes, and Xiaoyan mournfully sang: "The spring trees and evening clouds are how you and I gaze at each other, the setting moon and lingering clouds are how you and I long for each other! Dreams of the Sea, exclusively for you and me!"

### Bitter Cup

— Jiagan

I, cup by cup,

drain the bitter cup.

A blush flies onto my emaciated face,

but I never think of furrowing my brow.

The world is like strangely arranged bizarre stones,

breaking my steps;

fresh red blood flows out,

step by step leaving behind my past heavy memories.

Human relationships are like fire in a furnace,

beautiful, pretty, but fierce,

they can make you feel warm,

but,

when it abruptly says goodbye to you,

light and heat both scatter in the wind.

Will you then quietly sob to yourself

for the quietly arriving cold loneliness?

The white hairs on father's head,

star by star,

are more numerous day by day,

appearing even older than before;

mother's back is bent even more severely,

and those pair of rough hands—

this haggard image

will give me iron-like spurring,

and a fountain of tears!

I will be on the platform,

hoarsely shouting,

they quietly listen, listening.

But,

who can hear my inner secrets?

Who can understand the music of my heart's vibrating strings?

I only wish—

to let them be buried in the depths of my heart,

forever becoming my unmentionable secret! I, cup by cup,

drain the bitter cup;

my cheeks are stained with evening dew,

but I never think of furrowing my brow.

### Hope

— Shixiong

Spring grass sprouts and grows day by day, the Eight Lives career is like the morning sun, the broad road is diligently attained, and you should strengthen yourself at the top of the hundred-foot pole. Facing the wind ten thousand miles, strive forward, the beautiful rivers and mountains shine brightly, do not waste the vigorous meaning of youth, success originates from a determined and sincere will.

— Shuiyi

Wildfires cannot burn it out, the spring breeze blows it back to life, from a poor dead end, the flowers bloom and there is a village, bitterly spending fifty weeks, coincidentally meeting the second spring, standing firmly in the white thatch, feeling the tillers.

### Drunken Peace (Spring Pavilion)

— Souzhai

Fragrant time does not linger, youth flows like water, bored and alone I lean on the high building, the garden flowers half hide their shyness. The cuckoo cries incessantly, the spring breeze is soft, my love's road is long and far away, someone is sad upstairs.

### Five Women's Teams Participate in the Open Basketball Tournament, Dahua Will Be Green Team's Strongest Opponent, Overseas Chinese and Three Provinces Teams Have Similar Strengths

The Shanghai Open Basketball Tournament kicked off on the 5th of this month at the YMCA gymnasium in Baixianqiao. All the heroic teams are showing their skills, and the stadium is packed with fans, creating an unprecedented scene. In particular, the Dahua-Kang'ai match in the women's division was one of the most highly anticipated scenes for the audience. The women's basketball team of Green has been silent for a long time, so this grand occasion is very meaningful. For the sake of encouragement and promotion, the author specially reviews the simple situation of the competition, and introduces the strength of the San Sheng Overseas Chinese team (a total of five teams participated, and the Dahua Kang'ai team have already been introduced in this publication). First, let's review the Dahua-Kang'ai battle:

Review of the Dahua vs. Kang'ai Battle

Under the planning of Chairman Yang Shuding, everything in the Dahua team is proceeding on track. On this day, they were all in new uniforms, bright and dazzling, and full of energy. Kang'ai is guided by Li Mingyang and organized by students from the St. John's Sports Class. Although they belong to this field, the training period is still short, so they are slightly inferior.

In this competition, Dahua relied on its well-trained triangular passing, constantly attacking. Forwards Huang Meijuan and Huang Fengzhen were exceptionally active. Although Kang'ai tried their best to resist, they eventually lost ground due to their insufficient strength, and their scores plummeted. In the end, Dahua, out of sisterly affection, felt that they should not push each other too hard, so they frequently substituted players. On the one hand, they didn't seek too much, and on the other hand, the newcomers could also gain more competition experience. From then on, Dahua's score gradually decreased, but Kang'ai still couldn't easily get started. Because the difference in ability was still far away, the result was that Dahua scored thirty-eight points and Kang'ai only scored three points, which was also very miserable!

Watching Dahua's tactics, it is indeed a well-trained team. Its offense mostly uses triangular passing and pick-and-roll offense, which is quite methodical. Its defense uses man-to-man marking, which is very tight. It is difficult for the enemy to find gaps, so if Dahua can intensify its efforts and continue its efforts, then this year's championship can compete with the once dominating Green team. Among the individual skills, forward Huang Meijuan is the best. Not only is her shooting accurate, but her posture is also beautiful and graceful. Her speed of shooting is beyond the reach of other female players. Huang Fengzhen runs in a very good position and shoots with confidence. Shen Shuwei has sufficient strength, but her skills do not seem to be fully refined. Guards Xue Deyin and Xue Nenyin are a pair of sister flowers, firmly guarding the rear, like a copper wall and iron wall, intercepting the ball under the basket, and have unique skills. Cheng Mulan has plenty of running ability and is also a good general for defense. The rest, such as Huang Meiyu, Liu Zhaolan, Deng Qiyao, and Zhou Zhifen, are all rising stars. They are truly a multitude of talents. Kang'ai is known as the best in the team for Wang Yinde's bravery, and guard Wang Danyu should be a top general with both wisdom and courage. It is a pity that good flowers have no green leaves to support them, only seeing her hard work in vain, but I dare to say that Miss Wang's position in the basketball world will surely achieve something.

Now, let's introduce the three women's teams of the Green team, Overseas Chinese, and San Sheng, so that fans can get a glimpse of the strength of each team in the women's division.

San Sheng - affiliated with the San Sheng Sports Association, its history is not long, but many of its members are from sports schools, so they can make progress day by day. Since its establishment, there have been at least two practices every week. When they perform, they should be treated with a new perspective. It is no longer the scattered sand of the early days of its establishment. Team member Shi Ruijuan is a famous volleyball player. Since taking over as captain of the San Sheng women's basketball team, she has been wholeheartedly focusing on this, making rapid progress. Her one-handed basket shot under the basket is very reliable, and she has excellent elasticity. She can also command the whole team's soul. Forward Wang Fuzhi was a representative of Shandong City, which shows her exquisite ball skills, and her rapid shooting has a masculine style. It is similar to the style of the Green team's Huang Mingyuan, Rong Shujian, and the retired Xiao Dong. Chen Huidi is a top student of Southeast Teacher's College and is naturally an expert in the field. She is most outstanding at dribbling and has a good relationship with Captain Shi. Therefore, the forward of this team is quite tough. Guards Lu Cuifang and Zhao Jichen have strong bodies and have the advantage of grabbing and blocking the ball. Chen Zezhuang has a different bow for blocking and dribbling, but can show his skills in danger. Captain Shi praised him as a standard guard, which is not false. The rest, such as Hu Meixian and Chen Meizhen, are all first-class players in the volleyball world. They are rarely seen in the basketball arena. In theory, their performances can often be as sharp as in volleyball. Observing the strength of this team, it is slightly weaker than Dahua Green team. Although they will definitely make a difference, they can be expected to defeat Overseas Chinese in the league and win the third place.

Overseas Chinese - is a new organization under the banner of the Overseas Chinese Sports Association. Chairman Huang Shengchang is passionate about promoting it, and specially invited basketball star Zhuo Guorong as the coach. The members of this team usually practice with the men's team, so their endurance is quite amazing. Although they cannot stand out in the league, they will definitely achieve considerable results. The reporter watched the team members fight and felt that the whole team was made up of rising stars. Given time, they will surely become a strong team. Encourage them, their captain Xie Lijian, judging from the name, it can be known that she is a strong person, and her ball skills are quite superior. The other two forwards are Zhang Qifeng and Hu Xiubo, who are extremely good at shooting. On the guard side, there is Wu Ailian in charge. Miss Wu has a slender figure, and jumping up to catch the ball has a multiplier effect. Huang Yuzhen's passing is also quite good. Lin Xiangzhi can rush forward to grab the ball, and success lies in the guard's rush. Su Lanzhen is a sports star among female workers and has the best understanding of badminton. She has been getting the ball for a short time, but her talent will not disappoint. The whole team is quite motivated and can strive for the third place in the league.

Green Team - the members are all famous players in the basketball world, with a long-standing reputation in the women's basketball world. This year, they have risen again, and have extended the invitation to Qian Xucang as the guide and Xie Yiqin as the manager. Like a fish in water, their reputation is even more outstanding. In terms of its lineup, there is Rong Shujian as the forward, a veteran in the sports world, short and capable. Her left-handed shooting style is similar to that of Shen Yugong, which is difficult to defend. Yan Weiwen is a former Qixiu strong general, with extremely sufficient energy. Her passing and shooting are very skilled. Coupled with her kind attitude, she is a model among athletes. Huang Mingyuan is the captain, agile and has the style of a general. She can shoot from a long distance and is a rare talent. Li Lizhi is experienced. The guard Liu Zhengbao is the first place in Shanghai's shooting competition, which shows her level. However, this year she will retire. First, the team has many forward talents. Second, Zhenbao's sneaking out to grab the ball is wonderful to the slightest detail, and she will definitely have an excellent performance. She is a versatile talent. Wang Weizhen was a team pillar of the Patriotic team, and her tight guarding of people often makes them collapse. Her bravery when fighting never allows anyone to get ahead of her, but she is quite polite after the game. Zhu Yilan, Zhu Chengjan, and Zhang Zhiru are all top-notch talents in guarding. Wang is good at intercepting the ball, Zhu Yilan is good at taking the lead, and Zhang is brave and good at fighting. This year, they will be able to exert their strength and maintain the past glory. The only concern is Dahua.

In short, the participation of the above-mentioned five women's teams in this league will naturally add a lot of grand occasions. In the long-silent women's sports, this should be regarded as a baptism of promotion. As for peeking at the strength and predicting the championship, it must be the contention between Dahua and the Green team. Overseas Chinese and San Sheng have similar strengths and often have development. Kang'ai's technology is relatively poor and may be inferior to others. However, with their good physique, after a considerable period of time, they may have unexpected achievements. Then, every Sunday (there must be one game) the competition will be fierce, so I do not hesitate to introduce it in detail above, I think it will be a pleasure for the fans to read it? (Meijie)

### Watching Last Week's Football Match

Last week's football match had two scenes in the second round of the league. The two giants of the Chinese team, Donghua and Lianyi, both sent troops. As a result, although Donghua had a strong army, it only narrowly defeated the rookie team, San Sheng, by one goal. Lianyi once won Qiaolian by three to two, but finally lost three goals in a row and was defeated miserably. There is a reason for this. The reporter does not avoid his own opinions and writes them below.

Donghua first showed laxity, then anxiety and panic

Donghua met San Sheng at Jiaoyuan last Saturday afternoon. Before the game, everyone thought that the game would be one-sided. Because Donghua is a winning team, while San Sheng has been defeated repeatedly. In fact, the difference between the champion and the runner-up, and the judgment of victory or defeat, is self-evident. However, the result was the opposite. Donghua only won by one goal narrowly. The reason is that Donghua had a confident and underestimating mind before the war, which arose spontaneously, and the battle inevitably became lax. For example, Han Nenghai did not use his full strength to scurry, and Li Yao was even more weak, not as hard as when he encountered a strong enemy, which led to the front line seeing wasted efforts. On the contrary, under the guidance of Father Wang, San Sheng used new tactics to win by surprise, with Mairson tightly marking Han Longhai, and Xu Guofu keeping a close eye on Sun Jinshun. Because they knew that their skills were not as good as others, and the players were young and had plenty of endurance, they blocked their way, which was indeed insightful. Because of this, Donghua gained nothing in the first half. In the second half, Donghua had to call up Dai Linjing to help out because Sun Jinshun was injured and left the field. The whole team began to use its full strength, but in view of the danger in the first half, there was a phenomenon of anxiety due to the eagerness to win the ball. In the end, they only won by two to one. If Donghua had not been lax in the first half and did not need to have a phenomenon of panic in the second half, they should have scored more goals. However, San Sheng's undaunted battle against a powerful enemy is commendable. Furthermore, Donghua already has an 80% grasp of the league championship. It is hoped that they will not be proud or discouraged and can maintain their winning prestige and create a more remarkable history, which would be great.

Lianyi lost after winning, due to lack of composure

The battle between Lianyi and Qiaolian took place at Yiyuan last Sunday morning. The audience was extremely crowded. Both teams were strong teams, especially Qiaolian, which used all-Italian generals, so its appeal was very great. From the point of view of this war performance, the battle situation was always in the process of both offense and defense being excellent. Song Lingsheng of Lianyi and Bao Jie of Qiaolian were the souls of the two teams' offense and defense. The battle was colorful, and the audience praised it. When Lianyi was leading by three to two in the second half, if they could focus on defense and use offense as a supplement, they might be able to maintain the victory. However, the team was focused on offense, which caused Qiaolian to tie the game. Afterwards, a few strong players suddenly changed psychologically, which led to foul actions. Wu Qixiang was even injured and left the field. All of this was caused by the inability to calm down, while Qiaolian took the opportunity to launch a major attack and took two more cities. Lianyi lost by three to five.

Many outsiders were meddling, almost causing a full-scale fight

The most regrettable thing about the Lianqiao battle was that there were also people outside the stadium who echoed the chaos, which led to a major conflict with the players. In the end, they threatened with force, which was very undesirable. Therefore, there were several incidents, fortunately, the organizers tried their best to resolve them, and then they were calmed down. I still remember the Jiaoyuan Yiyi incident two years ago, which is still fresh in my mind. Today, this incident is repeated, and I cannot help but feel emotional. The reporter deeply hopes that the players will know how to encourage themselves, and correct any bad actions if they have them, and strive to do better if they don't. It is even more hoped that the spectators outside the stadium will not make unnecessary noises, because everything in the game is the responsibility of the referees and the authorities.
