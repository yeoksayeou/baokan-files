### Before the Merger of Municipal Organs

Our municipal government will formally merge starting from August 1st. Originally, after the acceptance of the concessions last year, in order to adapt to the environment, the original concession areas were inherited and divided into districts. Now that a year has passed, in order to achieve true administrative unity, consolidation from a distance is necessary.

According to general observation, there are currently two main views regarding the merger of municipal organs. One view advocates a thorough and comprehensive reform, while the other advocates a conservative maintenance of the status quo. However, we must recognize the serious environment Shanghai is currently in, which requires comprehensive reform to maintain the status quo. We have repeatedly pointed out the severity of Shanghai's current position and surrounding environment. If we do not actively eliminate the crisis, the severity will only increase. Therefore, those who advocate conservatism are merely sitting idly by as the serious nature increases and are insufficient to maintain the status quo.

In our editorial "The First Lesson in Reforming Shanghai" on March 13th of this year, we said: Shanghai, both in the past and present, can be said to be the center of the nation's economy, culture, and education. In terms of political importance, it is second only to the capital and surpasses all other regions in the country. Since the Greater East Asia War, Shanghai has become one of the most important rear bases. Therefore, from the perspective of China as a whole or the Greater East Asia region, Shanghai occupies an extremely important position. In other words, all of Shanghai's actions have a significant impact on various parts of China and the Greater East Asia region. We can assert that if Shanghai can be reformed, it can influence and promote the reform of the entire China and can truly coordinate to strive for victory in the Greater East Asia War.

Therefore, we recognize that reform in Shanghai is necessary, and it must be a thorough and comprehensive reform. The consolidation of municipal organs should be seen as a preparation for comprehensive reform. Before the consolidation of municipal organs, two issues are particularly worth emphasizing: The first is the issue of public security. Shanghai occupies the position of an important rear base in the Greater East Asia decisive battle. The preconditions for exerting all its strength are internal efforts on the one hand and external security on the other. The so-called external security is to ensure public safety and maintain order. The second is the financial issue. Finance is the lifeline of all administration. All civil servants, in order to improve service efficiency and fulfill the responsibility of reform, must have stable compensation. Secondly, political facilities and the implementation of various new policies all require realistic funding. Therefore, finances must be transparent, tax collection must be organized, and the revenue and expenditure of municipal organs must not be independent but must be centrally collected and disbursed, and be certain.

In addition, we hope that the municipal authorities will pay attention to the following matters before the merger:

For all the excellent systems of the former Public Concession, those worth adopting should be retained and adopted, without abandoning them because of the people involved. Outstanding technical talents and long-serving staff should be fully retained if they continue to serve.

Service regulations for public servants should be promptly redrafted and unified. At the same time, all guarantees that public servants should receive, as well as reward and punishment measures, should be specified in detail to ensure peace of mind in service.

The selection of cadres for the municipal government and various bureaus and departments is very important. Standards should be established, and personnel should be re-evaluated, focusing on talent, so that the personnel will be refreshed at the time of the merger. The original "Personnel Committee" of the First District Public Office should be used as a model. We hope that the municipal government, before the merger of municipal organs, should establish a "Personnel Committee" to seriously assess personnel selection, absolutely adopting a talent-based approach, ensuring that redundant personnel do not get a foothold, and improving administrative efficiency.

Finally, we hope that the municipal authorities will establish a most complete administrative system and then match it with sound personnel. Without a perfect system, personnel will not be sound. However, even with a perfect system, without sound personnel, the advantages of the system will not be realized. Therefore, a perfect system and sound personnel must be given equal importance and should not be neglected. We hope that Shanghai will become a model area for national politics. This merger is the most appropriate opportunity for reform. May the authorities seize the opportunity in time.

### Adapting to the Current Stage of the War and Enhancing Ship Transportation Capacity: Naval Attache Kondo Talks About the Nearness of Navy Day

Naval Attache Kondo of the Allied Shanghai Navy delivered a speech on Navy Day, entitled "The Current Stage of the Greater East Asia War and the Importance of Ship Transportation Capacity." The following is a record:

Both combat and supply are equally important in war, and the two have a close and inseparable relationship. Sufficient supply is a necessary condition for victory. As the saying goes, "It is difficult to fight on an empty stomach." This shows the importance of supply in war. Recalling the past when the minister Toyotomi Hideyoshi征伐attacked 朝解Korea, the result was an anticlimactic ending, which was due to a lack of supplies. Supply in war, broadly interpreted, includes the development of resources, the transportation of raw materials, the production of war necessities, and the transportation of products to the battlefield, and other aspects. Among them, in terms of transportation, there are sea transportation, land transportation, and air transportation. The main battlefield of this Greater East Asia War is in the Pacific Ocean, and the area is thousands of miles of sea. Therefore, the issue of ship transportation is the most important matter of supply, needless to say. Therefore, this war is said to be a war of ship transportation capacity. The issue of ship transportation capacity is not only the transportation of raw materials, weapons, ammunition, and food. In this Pacific operation, combat transportation is actually a part of the battle and has extremely important tasks. It is not difficult to imagine. Maintaining and enhancing ship transportation capacity and enhancing air combat power are the keys to Japan's victory. The enemy is also eagerly trying to reduce Japan's ship transportation capacity through various strategies. This is evident from the activities of enemy aircraft. Therefore, we must mobilize all efforts and overcome all difficulties to devote all our efforts to maintaining and increasing ship transportation capacity.

Ships and Sailors Must Be Excellent

Ship transportation capacity mainly involves the issue of ships and sailors. It is necessary to transport a large number of excellent ships to the battlefield. Moreover, we need skilled sailors who are constantly on alert day and night in the presence of enemy submarines and aircraft. It is not easy to ensure safe navigation. Usually, they must fight against wind and waves, and heat and cold. In wartime, they must fight against time due to operational requirements. Therefore, they must overcome these dangers and difficulties, and act without delay. This kind of hardship is no different from that of the soldiers on the front lines of the army and navy. Sailors must shoulder the same mission as the army and navy, which is their duty. Enhancing ship transportation capacity is also related to those living on land, and there are many points that should be cooperated with. The first is to increase the efficiency of cargo transportation. If something that can be done in two days is delayed to three or four days, it is the same as reducing the ship's capacity by tens of thousands of tons. This is clear. It is also necessary to reduce the repair period of ships as much as possible. Sailors fight against all difficulties and dangers at sea before safely entering the port. Therefore, during the ship's brief port stay, it is necessary to reduce the burden on the sailors as much as possible, so that they can have sufficient rest and be eager to move forward for the mission. This is the natural task of those stationed on land. Second, we should thoroughly restrict the transportation of non-urgent goods and travel. If anyone takes advantage of their position and status to delay travelers with urgent matters, or occupies valuable ship space with non-urgent items, this will hinder the progress of the war and should be strictly rectified. Third, those with experience in maritime service must recognize the current situation and the importance of maintaining and enhancing ship transportation capacity. They must be prepared for any assignment and remember that the absence of a single sailor can reduce ship transportation capacity. Moreover, fathers and brothers should recognize that ship transportation capacity and army-navy cooperation are extremely important tasks for the progress of the war and hope that they will actively cooperate and send their outstanding children to the navy.

More Necessary in the Decisive Battle Stage

Since the start of the war, the activities of sailors in the Japanese shipping fleet have been very remarkable. Not to mention the cold, heat, wind, and waves, they have fought against enemy aircraft and mines and resolutely carried out their missions. This is very admirable. There are countless touching stories of patriotism. Their enthusiasm is commendable. Now that the Greater East Asia War is entering the decisive battle stage, enhancing ship transportation capacity is absolutely necessary. Young men with patriotic enthusiasm should silently carry out this extremely important task, participate in the Japanese shipping fleet, and contribute to the increase of ship transportation capacity. Those living on land, even in the midst of heat, wind, and rain, should be touched by the enthusiasm of the brave ship transportation soldiers who are still fighting against all dangers and difficulties. At the same time, it is hoped that they will devote all their efforts to their respective positions and advance towards the completion of the war. On the occasion of the Navy Day of the year 44, I would like to offer a few words to express my views.

### Account of Decisive Battle on Saipan Island: Japanese Army Held Toast to Mutual Celebration of Heroic Deeds Before General Offensive, Then Jointly Breached Enemy Lines and All Died for Their Country

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) The Japanese army garrison on Saipan Island launched a general offensive against the enemy forces with raging momentum on July 7th. After summing up reports from various sources and other news, it is known that the circumstances of the Japanese army's complete death in battle at the final moment of the battle were as follows: Before the general attack, the supreme commander and all the officers and soldiers jointly raised their glasses to celebrate each other's heroic deeds, shouted "Banzai," prayed for the boundless prosperity of the country, and expressed their deep gratitude for the great assistance of friendly forces. All the soldiers jointly broke into the enemy lines. Three thousand seriously wounded and sick soldiers committed suicide. Those who could move carried weapons, and those without weapons initially held bamboo spears or other handguns, charging towards the enemy lines with the courage of one against ten. The Japanese army garrison made a final general attack on July 7th. After this battle, the remaining Japanese army continued to wage guerrilla warfare in various places, relying on ditches or other positions, with a small number of soldiers engaging in extremely strong activities. The enemy forces were deeply disturbed by this. Until the last moment, they bravely died for their country.

### Actual Situation of Fierce Fighting by Japanese Army Garrison, Talk by Japanese Army and Navy Press Directors

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) Regarding the course of the battle on Saipan Island and the fact that the entire garrison of the island died heroically, the Japanese Army and Navy Press Directors jointly issued a statement as follows: In early June, enemy American powerful mobile units appeared in the east of the Mariana Islands. Initially, 190 carrier-based aircraft bombed Saipan Island. On the 12th, 230 aircraft attacked the island again. On the 14th, the area near the Oleai airfield on the southwest coast of the island was shelled by enemy American forces. Enemy Americans, with a naval force of more than ten aircraft carriers, eight battleships, and about seventy large transport ships as the base, landed soldiers to engage in battle. Starting in the morning of the 15th, they bombarded fiercely. At about 7:00 a.m., enemy troops, under the cover of more than 300 boats, attempted to land near Oleai on the southwest coast of the island. After fierce interception by the Japanese army garrison, they were defeated and retreated. The enemy suffered great losses. In the afternoon of the same day, a part of the enemy army occupied the area near Cape Susupe. Afterwards, it gradually expanded. The Japanese army units in this area continued to counterattack under the fierce artillery fire of the enemy army. By the evening, in the melee alone, they had destroyed more than ten enemy tanks. The intensity of the battle can be imagined.

All Water Sources Destroyed

The Japanese Air Force sank one enemy battleship and one cruiser each, and destroyed two cruisers in total. The Japanese Army artillery also sank or destroyed a large number of enemy boats full of soldiers. The enemy army, relying on its overwhelming military strength, disregarded all sacrifices and forcibly landed with a division of troops. On the 16th, due to the fierce attack by the Japanese army, the enemy army made no progress. On the same day and night, the Japanese army launched night attacks from the east and north, and a part of the army broke into Cape Susupe, dividing the enemy into north and south, causing chaos. At dawn on the 17th, the Japanese army had to retreat again due to the fierce bombardment by the enemy army. After that, under the airstrikes and bombardments from various sides of the enemy army, the damage to the Japanese army increased day by day. On the 19th, the Japanese army simultaneously lost the street of Garapan City and the positions in the center of the bay, as well as Oleai Airport and Aslito Airport. On the other hand, a part of the Japanese fleet immediately began to move to meet the enemy fleet. The enemy American South Pacific Fleet also went north to meet the battle. A fierce encounter battle occurred in the waters west of the Mariana Islands on the 19th and 20th. The details will be announced by the headquarters. As such, until 12:00 p.m. on the 23rd, all the water sources on Saipan Island were destroyed. The island was originally a place to obtain water sources, which caused the water use to fall into a difficult state. Furthermore, the shelling and bombing by those who controlled the sea continued day after day, and finally exerted their fierce power over the entire island.

Non-Stop Fierce Battle with the Enemy

The Japanese army fought fiercely with the enemy non-stop for more than ten days, and the damage gradually increased. The enemy's ship searchlight illumination and nighttime attacks with flares made it difficult for the troops to move. On the 25th, the enemy troops, holding tanks, advanced from the Garapan City street to the south of Mt. Tapochau, reaching the Laulau area. At this time, the battle line gradually became intertwined. In such a fierce battle, the Japanese army did not flinch at all and all rushed into the enemy's positions with bombs, making the enemy tremble with fear. On the evening of the 26th, Mt. Tapochau was finally captured. The high ground was the highest point on Saipan Island. The enemy army immediately moved artillery from the south side of the high ground, and the battle situation suddenly deteriorated for our army. On the 28th, the enemy's attack became even more fierce, almost all of the Japanese army's artillery was destroyed, and almost all of the artillery shells were exhausted. However, they still fought bravely. A part of the Japanese army units, in the enemy's encirclement, was still able to maintain the strongholds on the south side and southeast of Mt. Tapochau, preventing the enemy's northward advance. As the battle situation grew urgent, the Otsu platoon quickly attacked the enemy's camp, which had five or six light mortars and seven or eight groups of illumination shells. When they received the order to return, they broke through several lines of enemy positions with only fifteen soldiers remaining, annihilated 150 soldiers, and destroyed the enemy headquarters before returning to the battalion. Similar courageous actions were seen everywhere. Since June 21, the Japanese air force and naval units have bombed the enemy positions, material collection points, and airfields to aid the ground battle and benefit our army, turning everything into ashes. On the one hand, they attacked the enemy boats around Saipan Island, sinking two aircraft carriers, one transport ship, destroying one cruiser, and one ship of unknown type. They also destroyed more than 30 enemy positions.

Remarkable War Results Achieved by the Japanese Army

Since June 11, when the enemy mobile units attacked the Mariana Islands, the results of the battles achieved by the Japanese air force and naval units are as follows: Sunk two aircraft carriers, three battleships, four cruisers, three destroyers, one submarine, and two ships of unknown type. Sunk and destroyed more than five aircraft carriers and one battleship. Destroyed more than five aircraft carriers and one battleship. Destroyed five or six aircraft carriers, one battleship, three cruisers, three destroyers, one ship of unknown type, and seven transport ships. Shot down more than 863 aircraft. It is regrettable that we were unable to make the enemy abandon their intention. The Japanese army combat units were commended by His Majesty the Emperor on June 17, and on June 30, they were honored with a gift, which boosted the morale of the soldiers. Out of gratitude, they vowed to annihilate the enemy army and fight to the last soldier. However, after a hard battle of two months, the Japanese army was almost completely exhausted, and the enemy's artillery fire became more and more intense. The enemy's ground forces had reached a strength of three divisions, and they repeatedly took the opportunity to break into the Japanese army's positions. On July 4, the Japanese army's battle line was forced to retreat from Mt. Inabak (221) in the northeastern part of Saipan Island to the Tachotao line. There was not a single artillery piece that could cope with the enemy's artillery fire, and weapons were extremely scarce. They only used hand-to-hand combat to stop the enemy's attack. On the 5th, they retreated further to the area near Mt. Marpi at the northernmost tip. At this time, about 3,000 Japanese soldiers were wounded. The 37th Engineer Regiment automatically burned important documents. On the night of the same day, they received the final attack order, and all attacked the enemy's positions. According to this order, they immediately formed about 50 groups of troops and penetrated deep into the enemy's positions, searching for the enemy's headquarters, encampments, bomb artillery, etc., and destroying them, causing internal chaos.

Last All-Out Heroic Attack

On the morning of the 7th, they launched a final heroic attack on the enemy's landing point near Garankanonsi. On the same day, the Japanese army, navy, and air force all continued to fight under the command of Vice Admiral Nagumo, the supreme commander of the navy in that area, Lieutenant General Saito, the commander of the army units, and Rear Admiral Shimasaki, the commander of the naval units. The entire army died in battle. The Japanese air force had learned of this heroic battle situation through observation. In particular, the Japanese residents in the area have been cooperating in the battle from beginning to end, as announced by the headquarters. This kind of sincerity for the country is enough to move heaven and earth and make ghosts and gods weep. The battle of Saipan Island was considered by the enemy American forces to be the most difficult and fierce battle in the Pacific War. According to their announcement, the damage before July 10 reached more than 15,000 people. The elimination of this number was unexpected. The numbers announced are already very objective. In addition, when issuing the order to launch an attack after the battle, the current commander reported as follows: "I have failed to fulfill His Majesty the Emperor's sacred charge and have not been able to make adequate contributions. The Ootsu platoon has demonstrated the essence of the Imperial Army's bravery and courage. There are too many stories to tell. At present, the soldiers are dying in their proper place, and I am convinced that the Imperial country will be victorious and the national fortune will be limitless. I respectfully convey this." The Japanese people will certainly be confident that the entire country will be victorious and will repay the soldiers who have sacrificed themselves for the great cause. At this time when the arrogant enemy is about to advance on the mainland, they will certainly display the traditional spirit of the Imperial Army and annihilate the enemy.

### The Japanese South China Expeditionary Army to Launch Annihilation Campaign; Yu Army Defeated and Retreats from Northeast of Conghua

Central News Agency dispatch from a certain base on the South China front, 19th: Since June 27th, the elite units of the Japanese army in South China have begun attacking the 7th War Zone of Chongqing. Currently, they are launching skillful annihilation campaigns everywhere, plunging the Yu army into a state of complete chaos. The main force of the Japanese army advancing northward from the northwest of Beijiang has already secured the solid position on the high ground south of Lianjiang, the first line of defense for Shaoguan in the 7th War Zone, and is preparing to attack Yingde and then press on to Shaoguan. A certain unit of the Japanese army is pursuing the 159th Division of the Yu army, forcing them to the area south of Lianjiang, and is currently launching an encirclement and annihilation campaign. Another powerful unit is also pursuing and annihilating the 156th Division of the Yu army, which is fleeing from the northwest of Guangzhou. From midnight on the 12th to 12:00 noon on the 13th, a regiment of the 152nd Division of the Yu army in the Wan area northeast of Conghua was completely surrounded and annihilated, leaving behind hundreds of corpses and many prisoners. The Japanese army also captured a large quantity of mortars, light machine guns, rifles, ammunition, etc., inflicting a heavy blow on the Yu army. According to Yu Hanmou, commander of the 7th War Zone of Chongqing, he has consistently attempted to defend Shaoguan to the death, frequently supervising the battle and repeatedly sending reinforcements in an attempt to hold on. He has also continuously sent reinforcements from Shaoguan to the 154th Division and the Independent 9th Brigade of the Yu army on the north bank of the Lianjiang, attempting to defend the second line of defense north of the Lianjiang. Currently, the troops of the Yu army moving towards the northern area of Conghua include the 187th Division on the east bank of the Beijiang, the 153rd Division, which was severely attacked by the Japanese army's flanking units at the beginning of this month, and the 152nd Division of the enemy, which is already in a state of collapse. Therefore, a large-scale annihilation campaign in the mountainous area north of the Beijiang is about to begin.

Enemy American Planes

Harassing the Rear Central News Agency dispatch from a certain base of the Japanese army on the Chinese front, 19th: The fierce offensive of the Japanese air force has caused the American air force stationed in Chongqing to retreat step by step. They are now actively preparing for replenishment work. Observing the recent activities of the American planes, it is known that their tactics have changed. In the past year, they mostly used combined formations of fighters and bombers, which were dispatched during the day. Since the spring, especially after the Japanese air force began its offensive, their bombers have not been dispatched during the day, and only a small number of fighters carrying small bombs have been sent to the battlefield to fight. When using bombers, they mostly choose nighttime, and their goal is to harass the rear. The reason for the enemy planes' change of tactics is nothing more than an attempt to reduce damage, which is further proof of their mental terror. The enemy army is still launching attacks from the mainland with large combined groups of fighters and bombers, but because they fear being discovered by the elite Japanese fighter planes, they have no choice but to find ways to escape, to the point that they dare not continue to attack their target. Therefore, the Japanese air force will further launch a triumphant pursuit war in the skies over the mainland, in order to annihilate the enemy planes before they move, it is said.

### Enemy Planes Attacking Omiya Island; 21 Shot Down

The Japanese forces stationed there intercepted them each time and fought bravely with them. In the three days of the 16th, 17th, and 18th, 21 enemy planes were shot down. In addition, in recent days, the enemy army has also shelled the island with naval guns. Also, 19 B24 planes attacked Yap Island. The Japanese forces stationed there intercepted them, and as a result of the air battle, three enemy planes were shot down, five were destroyed, and the rest fled.

### Philippines Establishes a Materials Purchasing Association to Prevent Speculation by Unscrupulous Merchants and Suppress Prices

Central News Agency dispatch from Manila, 19th: The Japanese authorities in the Philippines, in view of the incomplete procedures for adjusting military supplies and developing materials, which provided opportunities for unscrupulous merchants to speculate, leading to soaring prices, are planning to establish a public purchasing agency to eliminate malpractices and suppress prices. Preparations are now complete, and the Philippine Materials Purchasing and Supply Association was formally established on the 17th. On the 18th, the Japanese Army and Navy authorities stationed in the Philippines issued a written statement, stating that the association is an agency established by the Japanese Army and Navy stationed in the Philippines. Under the guidance and supervision of the Joint Committee for Military Supplies Adjustment of the Japanese Army and Navy stationed in the Philippines, it handles all matters related to purchasing military supplies and developing various materials. In addition, general Japanese merchants and companies are prohibited from engaging in it.

### Japan Decides to Fully Develop Domestic Chromium Mines

Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 19th: The Non-Ferrous Metals Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Munitions, in view of the urgent need for chromium ore, an important raw material for ordinary steel and special steel, in order to establish a permanent and reliable system, will improve the reliance on overseas imports starting from July, August, and September this year, and has decided to fully develop domestic chromium mines. Currently, the main chromium mines in Japan are located in Hokkaido and the Chugoku region. Due to delays in mining, production in Hokkaido is relatively low. The ore quality in the Chugoku region is excellent, and production is also good. Specific plans for emergency production increase in both regions are currently being studied jointly by the Non-Ferrous Metals Bureau of the Ministry of Munitions, the Mining Control Association, and the Ore Allocation Control Company. Production in Hokkaido can be increased by strengthening labor, materials, and transportation. The Chugoku region will also see a rapid increase in production due to the availability of production factors. Therefore, it is urgent for the domestic chromium ore industry in Japan to quickly obtain an increased production system in order to meet the growing needs. Therefore, there are high expectations for the developers' insights, management innovation, and production advancement.

### Soviet Army on the Ukrainian Front Launches New Offensive; German Resistance Strengthens in the North

Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, 19th: The Soviet authorities announced on the night of the 18th that the Soviet army on the Ukrainian front, commanded by Konev, began its offensive under the cover of powerful artillery and air force, and continued to attack the German positions in the Lviv area (i.e., Lemberg) for three days. It also stated that the Soviet army began its offensive on the 15th in the Kovel and northwest Ternopol areas.

Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 19th: German News Agency reports: The main focus of the battle on Monday was east and northeast of Brest-Litovsk and on both sides of Grodno in the Neman River area. On Monday, the Soviet army attacked with several divisions of infantry and two tank teams from the northeast along a front several kilometers wide, attempting to capture Brest-Litovsk. When a breakthrough gap was formed in this unit, cavalry was used as a follow-up. Initially, the Soviet army swept through the German lines and advanced several kilometers to the southwest, but at this point, the German army flanked the enemy from both the north and south, preventing the Soviet offensive. The Soviet army in the Grodno area had built several bridgeheads on the west bank of the Neman River on Monday morning, but German mechanized and tank units drove the Soviet army back to the east bank of the river, and then used continuous artillery fire to attack them, inflicting heavy damage. North of Grodno, fierce fighting was triggered by the German army's desire to eliminate several Soviet bridgeheads. The fighting continued fiercely all night on Monday, and became even more intense yesterday morning. East and southeast of Grodno, the German army achieved complete success in its defensive battles on Monday. The Soviet army there had reached the right bank of the Neman River, but was forced to retreat to its original positions by a German counterattack.

### Fierce Fighting on the Eastern Coast of Italy; German Army Moves North

Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 19th: German News Agency reports: The fighting on the extreme eastern wing of the Italian border has been particularly fierce in recent days. In the afternoon, the British 2nd Tank Division supported the Polish infantry. In the evening, the German army retreated into the defense circle around the port of Ancona, where fierce fighting occurred throughout the night.

### Battle for St. Lo Reaches Climax; Enemy Offensives on the East Bank of the Orne Thwarted

Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 19th: The German High Command in Western Europe announced on the 18th that the battle for the ruins of St. Lo is reaching its climax. The American army is gradually advancing from the northeast, west, and south. On the morning of the 18th, German paratroopers and the American army engaged in hand-to-hand combat at a point two kilometers east of the city. Fierce skirmishes also broke out in the north. American combat units reached the St. Lo-Briouze highway and then divided into two groups, one advancing towards St. Lo and the other towards Briouze simultaneously, while the German army fought fiercely with them at all times.

Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 19th: German News Agency reports: In the past two days, the Normandy defensive war in the Caen and St. Lo areas seems to have spread to the east of the Orne River during the operations on Tuesday. The British artillery fire, which has been active in the past 48 hours, has been converted into covering fire since the morning of the 18th. At the same time, the British army began operations with hundreds of short-range bombers and main force planes, the purpose of which was clearly to break through the German defenses. The aim of the British High Command seems to be to carry out a pincer movement on the German positions in the Caen area from the south, west, and east towards the south of the Orne River and Caen. There is no news about the British tanks and infantry attacking the east bank of the mouth of the Orne River. On Monday, the British army, with newly arrived tank troops and infantry divisions, continuously pressed against the German lines in the Martot and Faltes areas under the cover of artillery fire, but ultimately failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough. The two places of Cintheaux and Noyers, which were repeatedly gained and lost in the past two days, were finally retaken by the German army on the morning of the 18th. The focus of the American army's combat zone is in the St. Lo area, where the troops are retreating to the vicinity of the city to avoid unnecessary losses and save the German army's decisive battle strength. Currently, the German lines are northeast and north of St. Lo, about one kilometer from the suburbs, while the lines in the west are even further from the city. The mountainous positions held by the German army remain unmoved under the strong attacks of the American army.

### Resolved to Participate in the War and Assist the Allied Nations in Striving for Final Victory; Minister Lin Announces Remarks on the Battle of Saipan

Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, 18th: Minister of Propaganda Lin announced remarks on the Battle of Saipan: "Today, the Allied Headquarters announced the news of the Battle of Saipan. Since the 7th of this month, the Allied troops have launched a final attack on the island, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. They fought to the end and all bravely sacrificed themselves. Even the Japanese residents on the island perished with the positions. This spirit of heroic sacrifice is the greatest expression of loyalty to the country by the Japanese military and civilians. It can also be said that it represents the supreme glory won by the East Asian nation in the history of war. It is absolutely not something that can be compared with the gains and losses of one island or one place. This is something that should be shown with infinite respect. Undoubtedly, at this time, Chongqing and Washington will definitely make grand pronouncements. On the 7th of this month, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek had already used the Battle of Saipan to cover up his disastrous defeat on the Pinghan and Yuehan lines. Even he could not help but admit the severity of the situation. He could only understatedly say that this disastrous defeat was fortunate not to have occurred five years ago, but five years later. The suffering in his heart can be imagined. The Chongqing side is using the battle on Saipan to promote it, but it is just beating gongs and drums for others to cover up their own inner suffering.

The American Navy Mobilizes Its Troops and Attacks from Afar

What about Washington? The demonic hand of war will inevitably use this battle to stir up the American people, so that the American people, who have long been suffering under the war, will once again be subjected to crazy stimulation. However, there must be some military experts in the American Navy who understand the strategic advantages and disadvantages, and foresee the difficult and dangerous future. Watching this crazy propaganda, they will not only laugh it off, but will simply be disheartened.

Why is that? This time, Japan's war against the United States in the Pacific, in the terminology of modern warfare, can be said to be a war with limited objectives against a war with 'unlimited objectives.' In the terminology of our ancient warfare, it can be said to be a war of 'waiting for the exhausted enemy,' which is determined by the strategic situation and the power that manpower can change. The so-called war with limited objectives against a war with unlimited objectives means that after the Allied Nations, Japan, in the first stage, seized the American bases in the Pacific with the most rapid action and the most economical force, they immediately counterattacked and defended, waiting for the United States to mobilize its troops and attack from afar. Now the United States is committing a major taboo of mobilizing its troops and attacking from afar in the art of war. The gains and losses of these places have long been within the strategic calculations of the Allied Nations and are not surprising.

Japan Gains an Advantage in the War

On the American side, if it wants to counterattack Japan, it must first establish a naval base in the Pacific, not to mention victory, but at least to avoid defeat. On the one hand, it must keep the enemy within the operating range of its fleet, which cannot exceed a radius of three thousand miles. On the other hand, the supply and escort of the rear must be absolutely safe. According to this calculation, there are only three routes for the United States to counterattack Japan. The one it is currently taking is exactly what military experts call the most dangerous and difficult route. The situation on Saipan absolutely cannot be a base, as everyone knows. How can a base be established? Can a base be established? It all depends on whether the American attack force still has the ability to attack from afar after becoming more exhausted. This is not to say whether the United States wants to, but whether the United States can, which means that it all depends on whether the American army can withstand more heavy losses and more dangerous bleeding wars. In any case, after Japan has gained an advantage in the first stage of the war with limited objectives, if the United States thinks that it has succeeded in one place in the second stage of the war with unlimited objectives and forgets the major taboo of attacking from afar, that is not just madness, it is simply stupidity. The so-called waiting for the exhausted enemy means keeping one's main force in the most solid line of defense. In the shortest distance of combat, when the enemy attacks the farthest and most exhausted, seize the most advantageous opportunity to give the enemy the final and complete fatal blow. Up to now, everyone knows that the United States has exhausted all its strength to carry out this counterattack with unlimited objectives. In fact, the main war has not yet begun, and the outcome of the final victory or defeat can be decided without divination. Short-sighted people often say why Japan has not yet used its main force to intercept the enemy? People who say this neither understand the law of waiting for the exhausted enemy, nor do they understand the tactics of naval attack and defense. Naval operations are not for war's sake, but completely based on the goals of attack and defense in the war. The victory or defeat of a single battle is insignificant. This is the fundamental difference between naval warfare and land warfare. The people in Chongqing may not understand this point, but at least some people on the American side should know it.

Strive for Glory for Greater East Asia

There is another point: The power of naval operations includes three elements: one is the fleet, one is the base, and one is manpower. The so-called fleet is not only the quantity or quality of warships, but also the power that these warships can exert in their operations. This means that it is not only its static power, but most importantly, its dynamic power. The distance of combat and the supply of provisions are very important to this dynamic power. In this regard, Japan has a great advantage. The so-called base is not only a piece of land, but how the terrain of this piece of land is, what the environment is like, and especially how far it is from the mainland, must be calculated clearly. In this regard, Japan also has an absolute advantage. The so-called manpower is not only in the number of people, but also in the morale of the people. We look at the heroic sacrifice of the Allied troops on Attu Island, look at the heroic sacrifice of the Allied troops and residents on Saipan this time, and then think of the time when the so-called well-equipped and well-fed 60,000 troops of Yang Guo were defeated miserably after a single battle, and they still said that they were lucky not to have a casualty. Why were there no casualties? Because they were defeated in one battle and surrendered as soon as they were defeated. The 60,000 well-equipped and well-fed troops have become voluntarily surrendered prisoners. In contrast, the morale of the Japanese and American military and civilians can be said to be worlds apart. Looking at it this way, even if Roosevelt has the heart to mobilize his troops and attack from afar, I really don't know where the United States can go from afar? And how long can it work? Furthermore, I don't know what the parents, wives, and children of these soldiers think when they think of the fate of their sons or husbands in the face of these crazy propaganda in recent days?

The morale of the Japanese military and civilians is innate to the Japanese nation and cultivated later. This morale has already won glory for the East Asian nation in the first great war against foreign countries. In this Greater East Asia War, it is even more demonstrated everywhere. The certainty of a decisive victory is established on the above. What's more, the strategic advantages are also available. In addition to gratitude and shame for the Allied military and civilians fighting bravely, we can only maintain our determination to participate in the war and redouble our efforts. On the one hand, we must mobilize manpower and resources to assist the Allied Nations in striving for final victory. On the other hand, we must use the final expectation to promote the awakening of Chongqing, so that the beautiful mountains and rivers will no longer be used by Britain and the United States as their battlefields for their sacrifices."

### The Seafaring Spirit of Maritime Japan

The Mission of Ships and Seamen

What distinguishes this war from previous wars is that it begins with surprise attacks across the ocean and landings ahead of the enemy, with both the army and navy relying on transoceanic operations from start to finish. Therefore, the paramount importance of completing maritime transport in the war effort goes without saying. In this vital task for the nation, ships and sailors are currently demonstrating their full capabilities and continuing to play an active role.

Since the start of the war, our sailors have relentlessly followed the transport fleets behind the brave Japanese soldiers, fighting tirelessly. They bravely face the enemy's fierce aerial bombardment and artillery fire, assisting in landings ahead of the enemy, and navigate the perilous waters teeming with enemy submarines, fulfilling their transport duties. Our sailors are filled with fighting spirit, declaring, "Come what may! What is there to fear!" "Let's go!" "Let's fight!"

They nonchalantly set sail for dangerous seas.

Bloody Rigorous Training

Even trains running on tracks must struggle on snowy nights. How much more so on the vast, boundless ocean, where dense fog, snowstorms, and hurricanes constantly strike, and enemy aircraft and submarines approach one after another from overhead and alongside. Convoys advancing under strict blackout conditions endure unimaginable hardships day and night. Enduring these hardships and overcoming these dangers, Japanese sailors cultivate a spirit of heroic determination. They undergo bloody rigorous training. Once they set sail, they disregard their own lives. Transport warriors say, "When we are exhausted fighting the enemy, death is the only option." Transport warriors find joy in dying; their only regret is not being able to die for the cause.

As mentioned earlier, the victory in this war and the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere depend on the completion of maritime transport. For the sake of victory and building a paradise, we must not lose a single soldier or sink valuable military supplies. We must advance, overcoming the enemy's fierce attacks. The more horses and weapons that land on enemy shores, the better. We must not allow any harm to come to the warriors building the Co-Prosperity Sphere. The abundant resources of the occupied territories, the necessities of life for the people, and combat materials must be transported to their destinations as quickly as possible. Considering the importance of the transport mission, they would not want to die easily, even if they thought of death.

That is why daily training is essential. In case of emergency, sailors will abandon themselves and do everything possible to rescue the troops on board.

The Resolve of Japanese Sailors: In wartime, they may encounter the enemy at night. In such a case, it would be shameful for Japanese sailors to be caught still in their pajamas. Once they leave port, no matter how sweaty or battered by wind and waves, they cannot bathe. Sleeping in pajamas is simply unthinkable. In the eyes of sailors, the sea beyond the harbor is the battlefield. They must be prepared at all times for anything that may happen.

The captain, bearing heavy responsibility, stands on the bridge twenty-four hours a day. He doesn't even have time to wash or bathe; he takes his three meals on the bridge. He doesn't even have time to go to the restroom. Day and night, when he has a moment to spare, he simply catnaps on a chair on the bridge.

Engaging the Enemy in the Ocean

They must be even more vigilant in watching out for enemy submarines and aircraft that may appear at any time. They cannot overlook a single black speck in the sky or a piece of floating debris in the sea.

There is the northern sea in winter.

Raging waves toss the ship like a leaf. Fierce winds lash the mast, and horrifying tides buffet the face. Dense fog shrouds the way forward. Icy winds sting the skin, and the whole body is soaked in heavy drizzle as they continue to monitor the surroundings.

Here is the southern sea in the heat of summer.

Under the scorching sun, the relentless heat burns like it's roasting bones. The lookout silently stands and gazes at the sea and sky, single-mindedly raising his binoculars and scanning the horizon, ensuring that nothing escapes his sight.

This kind of enemy search and vigilance continues day and night, rain or shine, summer or winter, forever. Behind the transport mission lies this kind of hardship unknown to others.

Ahead, a black dot is seen on the white waves, and a trail of bubbles is rushing toward them. They immediately report to the bridge that it is a torpedo attack from an enemy submarine.

"Right ahead, ten degrees, zero kilometers, an enemy torpedo is heading towards…"

No sooner said than done!

"Hard a starboard!" The captain's powerful command rings out, and at the same time, the emergency alarm blares throughout the ship.

"Battle stations!"

Then, the enemy's second and third torpedoes come in quick succession.

The ship's guns have already opened fire, beginning the bombardment.

Skillfully avoiding torpedoes while navigating, and preparing to die for the cause if avoidance is impossible, the true spirit of the Japanese sailor is fully demonstrated here.

While the 〇〇 Maru was sailing alone in a certain sea, an enemy submarine suddenly surfaced in front of it. The crew immediately went to their respective posts and aimed the ship's machine guns. The enemy submarine began shelling. The ship also opened fire with machine guns. At that time, the enemy added machine-gun fire to their shelling. After about an hour of engagement, only one enemy shell hit the ship's bridge, and a fragment grazed the cheek of a first-class officer. However, the 〇〇-ton ship, taking advantage of its light weight, weaved through the enemy's trajectories and rammed straight into the enemy submarine, which finally had to submerge. The ship then fired four depth charges at it, but the results were unknown.

While the 〇〇 Maru was sailing in the same waters, it spotted an enemy submarine surfacing and immediately opened fire. The second shot destroyed the enemy's periscope. As the blinded enemy was panicking, the ship's aircraft immediately took off to chase the submarine to 〇〇, finally capturing it.

The 〇〇 Maru completed its mission and was returning to base, when it was attacked by an enemy submarine while passing through the 〇〇 Strait. However, because the enemy submarine was spotted first, the ship was prepared. The several torpedoes fired by the enemy passed close by, and the ship was able to return safely to the 〇〇 base. The report stated:

"The ship's greatest regret is that it was not equipped with guns, so it could not destroy the enemy submarine."

The heroic battles of the motorized sailing ships assigned to the naval forces in the waters north of Australia are also quite commendable.

These ships, with their accumulated combat experience and fuel efficiency, sail the waters north of Australia without escorts and with minimal weaponry. Enemy aircraft challenge them. When the Jia Maru was anchored in Fakfak, enemy aircraft, presuming it was an easy target, flew at a low altitude of 100 meters. The B-24 was shot down and crashed. The Yi Maru and Bing Maru, while navigating the waters of Kekwa, braved the concentrated fire of B-25s and shot them down. The Ding Maru, near Makal, was subjected to ten bombing and strafing attacks. Each time, it held its course straight toward the enemy aircraft, luring them in. A Lockheed Hudson finally crashed into the mast and fell. The Wu Maru, on the waters off Bantai, encountered a surfaced enemy submarine. It launched a surprise attack, and the enemy, in a panic, submerged and fled. Many ships, although attacked by enemy submarines and with their decks on fire, continued to fight the fire to prevent sinking and struggled to navigate to their destination, unloading their cargo and completing their mission.

The captains who steer, and the sailors who wield the guns, are truly valiant warriors of the sea, no less than combat soldiers.

Conclusion

If large ships are the solid supply lines linking the rear areas with the bases, then motorized sailing ships are the vital links connecting the bases with the front lines. They cannot be severed and must be strengthened. The waters of the northern region need motorized sailing ships; without them, operations would be inconvenient. The sailors of maritime Japan, active in this region, are truly brave and reliable. We must remember here that the supply of sailors and the provision of weapons are also essential elements for achieving victory. (Bai Ying)

### Second Police Precinct Issues Opium Smoker Registration Permits

The Second Police Bureau of this city has been ordered to assist in eradicating opium addiction in its jurisdiction and to register opium smokers. It is learned that the first thousand opium smoker registration permits have been obtained by the bureau from the Anti-Opium Bureau and will begin to be distributed starting yesterday. Opium smokers who have applied for registration with the Second Police Bureau can go directly to the Fifth Section of the bureau on Penglai Road to collect them. Opium smokers who have registered at the opium smoker registration offices of the various sub-bureaus of the bureau will be distributed after the second batch of permits is received.

### Huashan and Changning Sub-Bureaus Conduct Spot Checks on New Residence Permits

Since the Huashan and Changning Police Sub-Bureaus began issuing new residence permits on April 10th of this year, the process has been progressing smoothly due to the close cooperation of the police and Baojia. However, some residents have been overly negligent. Even after repeated reminders, some have not gone to the bureau to have their fingerprints taken, or have had their fingerprints taken but have delayed in picking up the permits. This situation not only prevents the issuance of new residence permits from being completed properly, but also makes it difficult to clear up the household registration and population statistics. The Baojia section of the two sub-bureaus has obtained approval from the Bao and Tian Office of the General Bureau to conduct spot checks on new residence permits starting immediately. In areas where new residence permits have been issued, if anyone is found still holding an old residence permit and delaying the exchange for a new residence permit, the old residence permit will be confiscated in order to urge them to exchange for a new permit as soon as possible, so as to complete the permit exchange work within the time limit. Residents in the area who have not yet received their new permits should exchange for them as soon as possible to avoid trouble.

### Army and Civilians who Died on Saipan Island Displayed Noble Spirit; Statement by Spokesman of the Japanese Army Press Department

The Shanghai Japanese Army Press Department spoke yesterday to reporters, mentioning the spirit of the army and civilians on Saipan Island in perishing together with the island. The statement issued by the department is as follows: On the loss of Saipan Island, the strategic value should be explained, and the heroic fighting of the Japanese army and the self-sacrifice of the Japanese residents on the isolated island should be praised. The Imperial General Headquarters has already issued a statement on the 18th, and the Empire's determination has been clarified in Prime Minister Tojo's speech. The heroic fighting of the Imperial Army and Navy soldiers and the Japanese residents on Saipan Island has been described in detail in the statement of the Director of the Army and Navy Press Department of the General Headquarters. The self-sacrifice of the entire Imperial garrison follows the previous examples of Attu Island in the North Pacific and Makin and Tarawa Islands in the Central Pacific. However, the fact that Japanese residents joined the soldiers in facing the disaster and sacrificed themselves for the Greater East Asia Liberation War, dedicating their love for their motherland to the isolated island, began with Saipan Island. The last soldier of the army and navy forces on Saipan Island physically attacked the enemy. The situation at that time was fully described in the report sent by the commander of the island to the central government, word by word. It is deeply believed that all Asian nations of the same bloodline will be able to understand its noble spirit.

Spirit is more important than everything

The strategic value of Saipan Island in the Pacific War cannot be underestimated, but its value is not absolutely immutable and depends on whether it can fully demonstrate its value. Therefore, Japan's failure this time may turn into a blessing in disguise. Although this is a strategic issue, spirit has even more value. That is, the statement of the General Headquarters on Saipan Island can explain everything about how it will affect the Japanese people. When 100 million Japanese compatriots learned of the General Headquarters' announcement, their attitude was extremely calm, and their confidence in the final victory was not shaken in the slightest. To annihilate the American devils and avenge the loss of Saipan Island is a valuable lesson to be learned from the previous series of victories in the war. This is not only a gamble on the fate of one country, but it also determines whether the liberation of East Asia can be achieved or whether Greater East Asia will forever be held under the demonic claws of the Anglo-Americans. In the course of the Greater East Asia War, local changes are not surprising. The battlefield of the Greater East Asia War is not limited to the Pacific; the battlefield on the Chinese mainland is equally important. Today, the Japanese army is making favorable progress on this important battlefield, and the damage suffered by the US Air Force in Chongqing is extremely serious. It is believed that this can more than compensate for the unfavorable loss of Saipan Island.

Short Commentary

### Where Did the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Get a Large Quantity of Rice?

According to reliable sources, at 3:00 PM on the 17th, 180 bags of rice were suddenly moved into the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. The source of this batch of rice has attracted close attention from the outside world. It is also heard that Mr. Wen Lanting, supervisor of the association, who is known for his impartiality and integrity and enjoys popular support, is particularly concerned about this issue due to his duties. Another source claims that this batch of rice was jointly purchased by more than ten employees of the Rice Control Association and stored in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.

We have three questions about this matter: First, how could more than ten employees of the Rice Control Association happen to jointly purchase 180 bags of rice? Is this a way to avoid the requisition of 10 stone of rice or more by dividing it into smaller portions? Second, are employees of the Rice Control Association allowed to purchase and store rice exceeding the amount needed for three months? Third, is the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's address allowed to be used for storing large quantities of rice?

Furthermore, we have heard rumors that a certain important employee of the Rice Control Association has 600 dan of rice hidden at home. We will not discuss the rumors for now. However, regarding the credible information about a large quantity of rice being stored in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, we hope that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce authorities will provide a clear answer. At the same time, we ask whether the Economic Security Department authorities have heard this news and whether they have paid attention to this matter.

In the first match, the women's group of Zhiqian easily defeated the West Qinghong team by a score of twenty-one to thirteen. Zhiqian's players, all capable, gave their all. Weng Hanqing was particularly energetic, with her powerful and precise hitting. In the third game, Zhiqian won 21-9. In the second game, West Qinghong tried to struggle, but Zhiqian was well-rounded in both offense and defense, and won again 21-15. The last match was between Russian Émigré A and China Film in Group A. After the two sides made contact, only seven Russian Émigrés appeared. Unexpectedly, China Film, despite having a numerical advantage, suffered a crushing defeat. In the first game, the Russians won 21-13, and the second game went smoothly for the Russian Émigrés, who won again 25-11. The last game was also quickly decided, with the Russian Émigrés winning 21-11.

### Essentials for Constructing Air Raid Shelters

For Factories:

Factories are often targets for bombing, so the necessity of shelters is self-evident. Adequate shelter drills are also absolutely necessary. Especially for important factories, because work cannot be stopped until danger is imminent, it is impossible to take refuge in distant locations, and shelters must be near the workplace. Therefore, sufficient preparation and research are required.

In principle, when constructing factory buildings, one can follow the general shelter guidelines for families. For reinforced concrete buildings, refer to the situation of office buildings mentioned above, and research accordingly. Factories often have equipment not found in ordinary homes, such as underground warehouses, which can be utilized as effective shelters. Furthermore, slightly altering the placement of materials and finished products can create gaps that serve as good shelters. Even without these, simply lying down between furniture and machinery can significantly reduce damage. Therefore, everyone should consider in advance what to do in a split second if a bomb falls.

However, if oil tanks or gunpowder magazines in a factory are damaged, the surrounding area will be extremely dangerous, so one must be careful to avoid these locations when taking refuge.

The above explanation has focused on shelters in ordinary residential homes, as well as construction methods for shelters in high-rise buildings and factories. Building styles vary greatly, and similarly, where and how to build shelters will also differ significantly.

In essence, when actually constructing shelters, one should fully understand the spirit of taking refuge and identify suitable locations for shelters, not adhering to formalities, but utilizing existing facilities and available materials. If unclear, seek guidance from those in charge.

Finally, after shelters are built, one must know the location of fire-fighting equipment such as sandbags and open spaces for evacuation, so that protective activities can be carried out immediately. Furthermore, communication with protection monitors and evacuation procedures must be thoroughly trained to effectively utilize the shelters.

In places without shelters, one must always remember that using nearby objects for cover and lying flat on the ground is the simplest method of refuge. (End)

### Implementing Agricultural Production to Serve the Nation

Japanese Youth and Students

A new wind is blowing in the countryside. To produce even one more grain of rice, young students are wholeheartedly working in the fields, serving the nation through agriculture with fervent hearts. They believe that securing food supplies is of utmost importance, concerning the very life and death of Japan, especially in this decisive stage of the year. Their pure spirit of public service, burning passion, healthy bodies, and genuine thirst for knowledge... amidst unstoppable sweat, they happily and vigorously welcome the early summer breeze that caresses the rice paddies. Today, the village's heroic veterans, watching groups of schoolchildren carrying rice seedlings, running back and forth, and on their own working ridges, hang a flag with the words "Student Mobilization," flying high and deeply imprinted in their hearts.

Filled with Labor Enthusiasm

"Since coming here, everyone feels at ease. At school, we could never settle down..." The Second High School students, who have become rural youth after a reception ceremony was held in Nango Village, Toyu District, Miyazaki Prefecture, are diving into the rice paddies and working tirelessly. Their brows are filled with labor enthusiasm, and in their hearts, they believe that the safety and security of the nation are closely linked to their hard work.

Excellent students from the village, such as those from Utsunomiya Vocational Girls' High School, sleep at their work locations to save on travel time. Dressed in women's work clothes, with trousers and sleeves rolled up, they have already become mud-splattered and not-yet-skilled farmers in the swampy rice paddies. But these lovely young girls do not pity their fair and tender legs and arms, and they are even less afraid of getting dirty. When asked, "Is the teacher not here?" a woman immediately raises her head and says, "That's me." This teacher is also covered in mud and looks even younger than the students. Soon after, during a break, the female students sit neatly lined up under the shade of a tree, drinking tea brought by the young teacher in turns.

Children from the National School in Kito Village, Tamatsukuri District, Miyagi Prefecture, located between Akita and Yamagata Prefectures, gather wild vegetables at the foot of Mount Arao, a snow-covered mountain in the Ou Mountains, more than eight kilometers from the school. The fiddleheads gathered by the adorable and pitiful children have already been sent to the capital, amounting to as many as 18,000 "Next are the gathering of wood vine and mountain grapes. The grapes are raw materials for making acid salts that can turn salt water into fresh water. We want to turn the resources hidden in the mountains into combat power," said the principal, fully displaying the sun-blackened farmer in the mountains.

Outside Fukushima City, Fukushima Normal School has rented seven cho of farmland from farmers with labor shortages, and now they are even mobilizing children from the affiliated elementary school to harvest wheat. They are even harvesting earlier than the nearby villagers. It can be said that they are harvesting with great enthusiasm.

All harvested grain is dedicated to the nation, and the harvested fields are then cultivated well before being returned to the villagers. All the students at the school are looking forward to the harvest season with abundant food. Since April, they have been enduring hunger every day, drinking thin porridge, and looking forward to the harvest.

Securing the National Food Supply

I have traveled on the Tohoku Railway, the Ou Railway, and the Shinetsu Railway, and other trains, and visited many villages. On every piece of beautiful land, one can see such hardworking students. This is not merely a small-scale effort to use the labor of young people, but rather to experience the harsh conditions of various productions in order to secure the food supply for the 100 million people. This is to display the spirit of serving the nation through agriculture and improving management techniques. Students serving in rural areas focus on these two points.

Nango Village, where the Second High School has been serving for four years, previously had a lot of idle land. However, due to the students' enthusiasm for labor, who only drink a little tea and then work with sweaty backs, the previously barren and empty land has been turned into fertile and beautiful fields. The entire village is united and desperately increasing production. After planting the rice, the students in Sendai are concerned about drought and rain, and they often make special trips to see their own cultivated fields. This scene shows how much they respect the agriculture of the Japanese imperial land! Agriculture in the Great Japanese Empire is by no means merely a profession for individual farmers to profit from, but rather a sacred patriotic undertaking that should be deeply felt in one's heart. This year's harvest is earlier than in previous years, demonstrating a labor spirit that inspires admiration.

The Agricultural School in Minamimurayama District, Yamagata Prefecture, is the successor to the Kokumin Higher School, a farm warrior dojo created by the spirit of Dr. Kakehiko Kazami and Mr. Motoji Kato. Therefore, the students of the school mobilized to build the Jinai Village reservoir dam, and they all worked silently and desperately with full discipline. This earth-shattering and tear-jerking enthusiasm left the farmers speechless. Work that ordinary people could not complete was finished by the students in less than a day, thus completely clearing away the laziness and bad habits in the village.

In addition, in terms of improving management techniques, places such as Iwate Prefecture still adhere to established rules and follow the bad habits of individualism. Although there is a labor shortage, they are still unwilling to cooperate. However, the mobilization of students, because of collective labor, may be able to change the bad habits of the past. Currently, Tochigi Prefecture, which has backward agricultural technology, does not encourage planting and even leaves land barren, which is a barrier to increasing production. Student labor must plant according to regulations. There are five or six farming families in one village who do not ask students to cultivate and plant haphazardly. The village authorities then mobilized the students of the National Elementary School and completely cleared the barren land in one day.

### Examination of Rice and Grain Issues in Various Regions

Method to Revamp the Rice Control Committee

As noted earlier, the method to revamp the Rice Control Committee is not the personnel changes advocated by some people. While personnel refreshment is necessary, personnel are influenced by the organization, and the organization is influenced by the environment. It is meaningless to focus solely on minor personnel matters without first reforming the organization to adapt to the environment. Having visited various regions, the reporter was surprised to find that although the Rice Control Committee in Shanghai is large in scale, its local offices are mostly weak. As for the work situation, from criticisms heard from all sides, the work instructions of the Rice Control Committee headquarters do not go beyond the level of intermediary agencies. No wonder there are calls to completely abolish the offices. The structure of the Rice Control Committee truly feels like having one head and several thousand tails, and it is top-heavy. No matter which office you visit, although they have made many charts and statistics, they are merely a superficial statistical and graphical representation of the activities of purchasing merchants. A survey that can truly enable the Rice Control Committee headquarters to establish a correct policy is rarely seen. It is not surprising that this weak lower-level organization cannot promote the difficult and important work of rice and grain purchase. The lower-level organization of the Rice Control Committee is not organized based on the particularity of each region. For example, Suzhou is the location of the provincial government and the mental center of rural administration in Jiangsu Province, but the rice and grain mechanism cannot be implemented by the power of the Rice Control Committee alone. Its success depends entirely on its degree of contact and cooperation with various related agencies. Then, does the Suzhou office have the power to automatically promote contact with important agencies other than the Jiangsu Provincial Government? The Rice Control Committee headquarters should simply serve as a planning agency and a liaison agency, and in the four or five major distribution centers, it should strictly establish mobile Rice Control Committee branch offices with powerful authority. The actual work of the Rice Control Committee should be fully borne by these branch offices. The headquarters should supervise the branch offices and, based on their work, be responsible for national planning, control, and liaison. Seeking opinions from all parties indicates complete agreement with this emphasis on Shanghai. Many other departments have the same situation, resulting in the extremely worrying consequences of today. This must be specifically pointed out.

For example, purchasing merchants are not recommended by the county governments, county chambers of commerce, and rice industry associations of major rice-producing counties, but are determined based on advertisements in Shanghai newspapers and the self-recommendation movement of speculative rice merchants.

When designating purchasing merchants, the reporter pointed out that in the local areas, most of them are speculative and hoarding elements of the bad Lianyingshe system. The situation is largely the same not only in Changshu but also in various regions.

For example, in Songjiang County, only six out of twenty designated purchasing merchants borrowed purchasing funds from the Rice Control Committee, but they were eliminated for reasons of poor purchase performance. The remaining fourteen merchants also had poor performance, using their privileged status as the center of private transportation.

The trade association does not have the nature of a preparatory agency, but is merely a convenient designation for a group of individuals seeking profits. Therefore, if the hope of purchasing after the harvest is normal, it cannot be claimed that the office and the purchasing merchants should be completely reorganized.

In the early stages of work, those who expressed dissatisfaction with the unfair allocation of quotas in the purchase areas were these purchasing merchants. This kind of dissatisfaction is unavoidable in the early stages of work. However, this kind of dissatisfaction is definitely not issued to achieve good purchasing results, but is a strategy to rationalize the reasons for poor purchasing results. In areas where the quotas are very fair, the purchasing performance of each merchant is not as good as expected. Therefore, if the purchase is not smooth, one must seek it from other reasons. To achieve fairness, excellent old rice merchants must first be designated and mobilized.

The Foundation of the Rice Control Committee's Work

The foundation for purchasing rice and grain is definitely not the frequently changing upper-level rice and grain structure, nor is it the local offices without middle ground. The unit agencies that become the foundation of this work are the ones that have strong lower-level organizations in various regions since the incident and have made the greatest efforts to fulfill their missions regardless of how the upper-level organization changes. There is no need to list here what kind of agency this is. These agencies have adapted to changes without changing and have made the greatest efforts to purchase rice and grain. This reality should be fully noted in promoting future work.

Taking the purchase work that began last year as an example, there are existing purchasing merchants in various regions, as well as agencies providing assistance from the side. Their experience has been accumulated since the incident. If funds and prices can be determined early, these agencies can immediately overcome all difficulties and take concrete actions. The upper-level organization of the Rice Control Committee, the lower-level organization, and the funds supplied to the interior are all too slow. The Kunshan office was established at the end of November. By the time the welcoming meeting for the director of the office, who had no experience in purchasing rice and grain, was held, the purchasing merchants could not but sit back and watch the rice and grain market decline.

The main body responsible for purchasing rice and grain should be in the interior. Based on this understanding, the future lower-level organization should be reorganized and abolished.

The most necessary organization in the interior is not the existing Rice Control Committee offices in various regions, but a liaison body of various related agencies that can be called the Rice and Grain Control Council. For this liaison body, there is no reason to object to the Rice Control Committee establishing a practical office to present its policy. Various local offices have requested the establishment of armed inspection teams. This proposal was also made at the Rice Control Committee joint meeting. The Rice Control Committee itself has also applied to the Executive Yuan for approval to establish an inspection team. This policy is probably based on the idea that everything should be handled by the Rice Control Committee itself. But can today's weak offices be more active than other armed groups? According to what the reporter has heard, although the Nanjing office has set up an armed inspection team, its achievements are not enough to build. Having experienced various regions, the request to set up armed inspection teams is still heard today. Just like Shanghai, the Economic Security Office inspects private transportation and hoarding. Similar agencies should be responsible for inspection in the interior.

New policies should naturally be promoted. However, if people in the interior misunderstand this as a measure for light-framed institutions, it should be strictly rejected. A light-framed institution will only result in chaos. (Translated from the Mainland News, June 27)

### Lessons from France for Us

In this world war, France is a country in a most tragic and difficult situation. After the outbreak of the Western European war in 1940, under the blitzkrieg of Germany, the Maginot Line, which France had painstakingly built and considered impregnable, was quickly breached, and the capital, Paris, was soon occupied. At that time, the German army advanced rapidly and irresistibly, and France was truly in danger of being destroyed. Fortunately, an elderly general, seeing that the country had already been defeated and could not fight any longer, bravely stepped forward and signed an armistice agreement with Germany, rescuing France from the abyss of destruction. This, for France, was originally doing what had to be done and stopping where it had to stop. However, Britain and the United States were too cruel to France from then on. On the one hand, they supported de Gaulle in carrying out the movement to split France; on the other hand, they directly put pressure on France, constantly hitting France, such as freezing French funds and trade, blockading French food, attacking the French navy, and even plundering French overseas colonies. France always swallowed its anger, initially wanting to maintain friendly relations with Britain and the United States. When it realized this was impossible, it still tried its best to avoid a direct conflict with Britain and the United States. France did its utmost to compromise and did not offend Britain and the United States. However, Britain and the United States always harbored the ambition to sacrifice France and invade Europe. Recently, they even brazenly landed on the Normandy Peninsula, aiming to attack Paris. From then on, French territory once again became the battlefield between the anti-Axis and Axis forces. The French people, who had survived the war and whose wounds had not yet healed, once again suffered from the ravages of war, displaced and living in misery. Their fate is truly tragic.

We sympathize with France's situation and experience, and at the same time, we believe that France is a good mirror for us, giving us a great lesson. There are things that we should emulate from France, but we cannot proactively seize the opportunity. We could have avoided falling into the same tragic fate as France, but we have brought the country to such a state. It is truly heartbreaking to talk about.

France was defeated and could not fight any longer, so it resolutely decided to make peace with Germany in order to save the country's fate and preserve the country's strength. This is a manifestation of the authorities' loyalty to the country and their sincere patriotism. Therefore, the French people all understood the authorities' painstaking efforts and supported the government's policies. The Chongqing authorities are also not unaware that they have been defeated and cannot fight any longer. In the past seven years, there have been opportunities for China and Japan to end the war and achieve peace. But why couldn't the Chongqing authorities show the same loyalty to the country and patriotic sincerity as Marshal Pétain, seize the opportunity, and change their policies to end the cruel war and preserve the country's vitality? Why do they have to rely on Britain and the United States, beg for mercy from Britain and the United States, and why can't they break free from the manipulation of Britain and the United States, reject the instigation of Britain and the United States, and even know that they are being used by Britain and the United States, controlled by Britain and the United States, and still do not hesitate to lead the wolf into the house, handing over our beautiful land to British and American imperialism as a base for invading China and dominating East Asia? Chongqing treats the American air force in China with the courtesy of honored guests, while they destroy our cities every day, slaughter our compatriots, and destroy our industries. This is truly heartbreaking. On the other hand, since British and American imperialism want to use the Chinese mainland as a base for invading East Asia, Japan, although it does not regard China as an enemy, must adopt the strategy of preemptive strikes and fighting on the Chinese mainland in order to defeat Britain and the United States. The Sino-Japanese Incident, which has lasted for seven years and cannot be ended, has made the Chinese mainland the main battlefield for Japan against Britain and the United States. The continuous wars have only caused suffering to our people. Isn't the fate of the Chinese people even more tragic than the fate of the French people?

Although France made peace with Germany, the European war has not yet ended, and the German army still controls the main cities of France. For this reason, although the French authorities tried their best to avoid war, they could not do so in the end. This is also a helpless matter and can only be attributed to fate. However, the French authorities have done their best in the past four years and can be said to be innocent of the country and the people. China's predicament is the result of poor planning. Because this tragic fate could have been avoided, but it was not avoided, and instead it was brought about. Isn't this the result of poor planning? If the Chongqing authorities had abandoned the policy of resistance and achieved comprehensive peace long ago, independence and autonomy would have been achieved long ago. There would have been no need to beg for mercy from Britain and the United States or to lead the wolf into the house. Even if British and American imperialism wanted to use China to control China as a base for invading East Asia, they would have no opportunity to do so. When the puppet government was established, the Japanese side solemnly stated that once comprehensive peace between China and Japan was achieved, Japan would immediately withdraw its troops from China. If Chongqing had stopped resisting and achieved comprehensive peace at that time, Japan would have fulfilled its promise to withdraw troops, and the Chinese people could have lived and worked in peace, recuperated, and avoided the pain of war forever. But because comprehensive peace was not achieved, Japan failed to withdraw its troops. At the same time, the Chongqing authorities did not realize this and were unwilling to abandon the policy of resistance, so they could not break free from the control of British and American imperialism. In addition, the United States suffered repeated blows in the Pacific and wanted to use the Chinese mainland as a base to launch air raids on the Japanese mainland in order to reverse the decline. Therefore, Japan's countermeasures had to be carried out on the Chinese mainland to destroy British and American bases. For these reasons, it looks as if China will become a second France, suffering a more tragic fate than France. In the past, we did not do our best, resulting in today's misfortune. If we can try to reverse the situation now, it is still not too late. It only requires a change of heart from the Chongqing authorities. Only by stopping the resistance and achieving peace can China be liberated from the clutches of British and American imperialism, and can China be saved from an irredeemable fate.

### When Can the City Consumer Cooperative Distribute Goods?

— Shao Ji

I am a member of the Shanghai City Consumer Cooperative and an employee of a very small store. The cooperative has been established for more than a year, and its purpose is to reduce the burden on citizens and avoid exploitation by middlemen in order to serve society. Unexpectedly, it is completely inconsistent with the facts. It only distributes unimportant items, and after distributing them once or twice, there is no news. When I learned about the distribution, I took time off to go shopping, but the order was chaotic and crowded. I waited for two hours. Because there were few people in the store, I could not spend too much time, and since it was only ordinary items, I returned to the store.

In this way, I contributed one hundred yuan per share, and they solicited 50,000 members. At one hundred yuan per share, it is also a considerable sum. Moreover, in the first half of last year, where did the cooperative deposit this large sum of money, in which bank, for what purpose? It should be reported and the accounts should be made public to inform all members. The inside story of the cooperative is another matter. The "Social Service" column of the News Daily also questioned this on the twelfth of this month. It is said that there are only two young ladies managing the cooperative, and they do not go there often because there is no work. Everything is presided over by a certain manager of the cooperative, and there is no second advisor. These famous people are just figureheads. They are busy enough with their own affairs. Isn't this just using their names to attract members at the time of establishment? I wonder when this manager will be able to distribute goods for the citizens' consumption.

### A Record of Recovery from Miliary Tuberculosis

— Dr. Ye Jun

A few days ago, this column solicited prescriptions for miliary tuberculosis (commonly known as "Hundred-Day Cough"), or those who had suffered from this disease and have now fully recovered. Yesterday, we received a letter from Dr. Ye Jun, detailing his own illness and recovery process, which is very valuable. We are publishing Dr. Ye's letter for the reference of the medical community and those suffering from the same disease. —Editor's Note

Many of my relatives died from tuberculosis, so from the beginning of my career as a doctor, I paid attention to this disease. I even prepared an X-ray machine and focused on studying this disease. In 1940, due to overwork and a bad mood, I also suffered from this serious illness. After consultation with senior colleagues, I was diagnosed with the most terrifying miliary tuberculosis. The cold and fever fluctuated, changing several times a day, reaching as high as 42 degrees Celsius and as low as 39 degrees Celsius. The sputum was either pus or blood, and I lost my appetite completely. At that time, I had already prepared my will and autobiography, and considered myself a living dead man. Whenever my mood relaxed, I felt optimistic about my body, like a prisoner on death row who was given a reprieve. One more breath meant one more moment of happiness. So I injected a small amount of morphine (0.003) subcutaneously once, three times a day, and also used large amounts of calcium propylate and vitamin C for daily injections. After a week, my condition improved. Then I went to the countryside to recuperate for six months, continuing the injections as before, and also taking the following important medicine, one dose per day. After four months, the cough stopped, the sputum disappeared, and I could move as usual. (Chinese medicine formula: Angelica 3 qian, ginger 2 slices, turtle shell 1 liang.) Today, my body is strong and healthy, no different from before. The difficulties and pain of the past, when I think of them now, are like a dream. Because I see others suffering from the same disease, I dare to share my sincere thoughts. There is no shortage of people suffering from the same disease. If they read this article and can cross to the other shore, the credit should go to your newspaper's "Social Service" column for serving society. During the recovery period, sunlight, air, nutrition, abstinence, tranquility, and medicine are all indispensable.

### Enthusiastic Purchase at the Ancient and Modern Artifacts Charity Exhibition

Since its opening, the "Ancient and Modern Artifacts Charity Exhibition" has been visited by a steady stream of people. Mr. Lin Kanghou also came yesterday afternoon despite the heat and purchased many charity items. The exhibition displays no fewer than thousands of items, from the Three Dynasties and the Han Dynasty to the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties. There are also five hundred Arhats painted on silk by the Qing Dynasty Royal Painting Academy, painted in the Tibetan style, totaling thirty huge volumes, a rare treasure. The photography of Lin Yuren, the pastel paintings of Gu Tingkang, and the oil paintings are all exquisite and deeply appreciated by the audience. Because the exhibition received too many items, it could not display them all at the same time. Starting today, a large number of items will be replaced to avoid disappointment. The proceeds from the charity sale will be used entirely for public welfare undertakings such as helping students and charity. With the school year about to begin, out-of-school children are in urgent need of rescue. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will enthusiastically purchase charity items to contribute to the good cause. Dr. Song Daren, a specialist in stomach and intestinal diseases, also participated in the exhibition with many of his medical works, especially the "Eight Heroes of Chinese Medicine," which is his painstaking masterpiece, taking many years to complete. It has inscriptions by famous people and is extremely valuable. The original painting is not for sale, but reordering can be discussed. There are also four landscape paintings, painted in a bold and unrestrained style, both vigorous and beautiful, rarely seen. A painting of a standing crane, with outstanding charm, is inscribed by Mr. Xie Tihong, making it even more valuable.

### Good Progress in Obligatory Inducement of Quitting Smoking

The obligatory inducement of quitting smoking, organized by the Nantong Road Zhongjiao Daoyi Association under special contract with this office, was implemented in its first phase on the 16th of this month. All those who submitted themselves to quitting were able to arrive on time. After a physical examination, except for those suffering from lung disease and heart disease who could not be treated, a total of ten qualified people were admitted. The association specially designated a room on the fourth floor as a dormitory, and doctors such as Cai Daming presided over the matter. The method of quitting smoking is to inject "Sookomtopin" once every five hours after entering the conversion center in order to gradually eliminate toxins. At the same time, attention is paid to the patients' symptoms at all times, and glucose, vitamin B, and cardiotonic injections are administered separately to enhance resistance. Therefore, the cost of injections alone is more than four to five thousand yuan per patient.

### Nanshi Nursing Home Appeals for Assistance from All Sectors

The Nanshi Nursing Home at No. 39 Jichang Street, founded forty years ago by Catholic nuns with a spirit of universal love, accommodates elderly men and women over the age of sixty who are poor and have no one to rely on. The original quota was 300 people, but it has increased to 350 people since the war. Some of the elderly in the home are healthy and willing to help with operations, so they are given some work to pass the time. However, most of them are old and infirm, and the nuns must take care of everything, from getting up early and going to bed late, morning and evening meals, pillows and clothes, washing and combing. Even bathing requires careful support. When they are sick, the nuns serve medicine, and after death, they are properly buried. All of this is done by the nuns themselves. The home has no fixed funds and relies entirely on external donations. Now that the city's situation is very different, the problem of livelihood is becoming increasingly serious. Even in terms of rice alone, the home needs two stones of rice every day. Now that rice prices are soaring, they have to use mixed grains such as mountain glutinous rice flour, which is not very suitable for the elderly, but they have to do it. However, the daily requirement for rice is still one and a half stones, not including other expenses such as fuel. Without assistance, it will be difficult to sustain, and the home is on the verge of running out of food. Therefore, it is earnestly hoped that philanthropists from all walks of life will generously donate to provide relief, and that enthusiastic people will appeal on their behalf, so that everyone can contribute and many small efforts can make a big difference, so that hundreds of helpless elderly people can be spared the fate of being left in the gutter. Donation collection points: Nanshi Zhanjiang Street No. 39 Nursing Home. Guangzhong Bank at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Henan Road. Lihe Paper Store at No. 8, Lane 389, Jinling Road.

### Donation to Maternity Fund

The maternity assistance movement is one of the services provided by this office. Poor pregnant women can register with this office one month before delivery.

For normal births, a midwife will be sent to assist with the delivery. If there are difficult births, hospitalization will be allowed, and all expenses will be borne by this office.

Donating to the maternity fund has the utmost meaning of protecting mothers and babies. It is hoped that all sectors will enthusiastically donate.

Hiring a Midwife A large hospital in this city is in urgent need of hiring two midwives who have graduated from the school. Those willing to take the job can contact and register with the job placement department of the Shanghai Special City Midwives Association at No. 251 Xinzha Road.

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo Translated by Hong Yang

Blood and Tears (1)

Ten

Makoto and Takao left the apartment at nine o'clock the next day. Such a beautiful house, happily rented to naval officers, was also a local custom. The landlady of Makoto's apartment was a widow in her fifties and a skilled embroiderer.

"When returning to port, I always hope to enjoy some family happiness, so we chose such a place. That family is very harmonious and kind, but there are many girls..."

"Isn't that good?"

Takao joked with Makoto and suddenly laughed himself.

"No, it's annoying!"

Makoto's tone was very serious.

"Why?"

"Recently, something happened. Usually when I'm taking a bath, suddenly they start practicing embroidery outside the bathroom. Because there are so many girls, I can't go out naked. I had to wait for them to finish practicing embroidery before I could leave the bathroom, but being steamed by the heat in the bathroom, the taste of bitterness is really indescribable. I think submarines must have this unspeakable feeling when they are submerged for a long time on the equator."

Such words, spoken with a slightly shy expression on his face, could not help but make Takao laugh. Although Makoto was wearing a military uniform today, striding forward with great strides, his face still showed a youthful attitude. Takao then thought of Makoto's long-forgotten nickname "Apple." Rosy cheeks, just like in the military student era, exuded an air of virginity.

(I'm not as pure as Makoto...)

Takao unconsciously began to feel ashamed of his Tokyo life.

"This is Zhongtong Road! It's the most lively and prosperous street!"

Makoto explained, rows of lily-of-the-valley lamps lined the bustling street. There were no trams, so it wasn't like Ginza, but more like Dotonbori. Perhaps because it was Sunday, there were many sailors and non-commissioned officers coming and going on the street. Looking at Makoto, raising his hand with a red armband, carrying out the salute one by one.

Reaching the intersection, Makoto said:

"Kure is such a terrible city, there's no place to visit. That's the naval base, above is the Naval Club, but let's go to the submarine school first!"

"That's what I thought too."

A business car happened to be stopped in front, and Makoto called it over.

Getting into the car, Makoto said:

"The submarine school may be Kure's most famous place. All the citizens visit to buy souvenirs. But how many people really want to join a submarine? At the same time, how many people want to know the history of the perseverance of submarine soldiers?"

Finally, he spoke such indignant words. (120)
