### After the Execution of Hou Hu

This time, the government's execution by firing squad of Hou Yi, alias Hou Zhengxian, who was found guilty in the military grain fraud case, is indeed a major event that has inspired the people. In terms of the government's credibility, it is indeed a major event that establishes prestige. However, purifying governance and enforcing official discipline are comprehensive and ongoing tasks. If only a partial approach is taken to a certain case due to temporary circumstances, the purification of the entire officialdom cannot be thorough, and what is gained is only a temporary stimulus. Therefore, the execution of Hou Hu is the beginning of purifying governance and enforcing official discipline, and should be extended to the entire officialdom.

In the past, the government issued many laws and regulations for purifying governance. In particular, the "Provisional Regulations for Punishing Speculation and Hoarding of Essential Commodities" and the "Regulations for Punishing Civil Servants for Corrupt Practices," promulgated in May and October of last year, were more concrete. Although the former did not specifically target officials, the government's intention to prevent officials from engaging in commerce and merchants from becoming officials, and to prevent them from hoarding, did indicate a desire to purify governance. However, corruption among high- and mid-level officials remained unchanged. Why did these corrupt officials dare to defy the law and risk their lives? The reason is very simple: the government lacked the determination to enforce the law. It is rumored that in December of the year before last, Supervisory Yuan members Ma Mengzhuang, LÃ¼ Yifeng, Zhao Shiyu, and others jointly impeached the authorities of the Ministry of Food, presenting evidence. However, the result was not only that the impeached officials of the Ministry of Food were not punished, but the supervisory committee members who filed the impeachment were dismissed. As a result, the functions of the Supervisory Yuan disappeared, and those who were corrupt and had connections became even more rampant. It is only now that we realize the dedication and courage of these supervisory committee members. Another example is the large-scale speculation and hoarding case in Shanghai investigated by Chen Zhishuo and other senior officials appointed by the government in April of last year. The result was that neither the big fish nor the small fish were caught. Because there were relatives, classmates, or other close relationships of senior officials involved in the corruption, or the implications were too great, they perverted the law for personal reasons, and this path was blocked. As a result, laws remained laws, and corruption remained corruption. Therefore, if the government lacks determination, then regulations, talks, and exhortations are just impractical facades.

This time, the government has the determination in the Hou Hu case. However, the investigation by the Japanese military police of the Allied powers undoubtedly contributed to this determination. However, not to mention other major corruption cases, even in this case, Hou Hu is still a small fish. It is especially hoped that this time, they will not catch the small fish and let the big fish go. We pointed out the responsibility of the highest officials of the Ministry of Food in our editorial on the 14th. What should also be noted now is that Gu Zhenheng is the Minister of Food of the Central Government, and Hou Dachun is the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Food Bureau. All the responsible officials in charge of the hierarchical relationship bear joint responsibility, and of course, there is a need for investigation. Those who are not involved are, of course, exempt, but what about those who are suspected?

Whether the government has the determination to improve politics depends on whether it has the overall determination to purify officialdom; whether the government has the overall determination to purify officialdom depends on whether it has the determination to thoroughly investigate this military grain fraud case. At the same time, for the overall determination to purify officialdom, first, the government itself should continue to expose corruption in the future. Secondly, strengthen the legal system and severely punish corruption in accordance with the law. Unless it is said that in the entire officialdom, there is only this military grain fraud case, it is also a way to prevent corruption. Third, the functions of supervision and justice should be given the freedom to develop independently and fulfill the mission of investigation and prosecution. Fourth, adjust the treatment of civil servants to prevent the causes of corruption.

### Japan's Concrete Measures for Decisive Battles Are Implemented Step by Step, Raising Fighting Spirit and Moving Towards Victory

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese government decided on the "Essential Measures for Extraordinary Times in Decisive Battles" in the cabinet meeting on the 25th of last month, the finalized concrete implementation plans have been largely formulated and are being implemented step by step. So far, twelve items, including the "Concrete Measures to Stop High-Priced Entertainment," have been announced and implemented, and they are moving toward the path of decisive victory. At the same time, in order to raise fighting spirit, increase production, ensure food supplies, and establish the ability to defend the homeland, a national awakening movement is being launched by integrating the government's Greater Political Association and political associations. The thirty-three members of the Central Liaison Headquarters have been decided, and after holding the first meeting on the 18th, they will continue to promote the movement vigorously. In order to cope with the war situation within a week, the domestic affairs are also lively. For example, the Japanese government decided on the "Restrictions on Passenger Transportation" on the 14th, and also decided on the "Outline of Measures to Strengthen the Women's Volunteer Corps System" and the "Outline of Measures to Promote Labor" in the cabinet meeting on the 18th. The purpose of the first restriction on passenger transportation is to quickly strengthen transportation capacity, which is mainly used for increasing pressure and air defense, so general travel, except for students going to school and staff going to work, will be thoroughly restricted. The purpose of the second measure to strengthen the women's volunteer corps system is to strengthen women's participation in volunteering and make them work in the area of increasing production. Therefore, all single women aged 12 to 40, or single women depending on their profession or location, should, at the request of the times, cooperate in labor work based on patriotism, and its nature is different from general conscription. The third measure to promote labor is to transfer the military-style organization to the factory organization. The purpose is to clarify the attribution of responsibility and rapidly increase the efficiency of industrial plants. Therefore, the spiritual uplift of labor will be actively sought in the future, and the entire labor system will be thoroughly implemented through education, training, and renewal of labor management. It is reported that the implementation of the military-style command method in factories has already begun in some factories, and the results are quite good. Therefore, the Japanese government has adopted this method this time and wants to expand its implementation. Regarding the above-mentioned extraordinary measures, the people are all cooperating, and it is not difficult to expect complete results. Therefore, the Trade Association, the Political Association, and the government are actively planning to launch a national uprising movement, which can be said to be an appropriate measure. Among the essential measures for decisive battles, those that have not been concretized include "expanding the prohibition of manufacturing items and unifying specifications," "suspending peacetime projects and businesses," and "transferring central supervision affairs to local areas." In this essential outline of extraordinary measures for decisive battles, all will be put into practice. As mentioned above, Japan is currently making every effort to turn everything into war power, preparing for a general counter-offensive in the near future, and preparing for a decisive battle for a year. The patriotic enthusiasm of 100 million people is boiling, hoping to thoroughly defeat Britain and the United States.

Later, in accordance with the essential measures of the government's decisive battle, it is deemed that the development of the national movement is increasingly important. A national uprising movement liaison headquarters has been established to actively start the movement. Therefore, it is urgent to decide on a successor for the secretary-general to solve the current duties of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and to achieve the comprehensive integration of the movement. Therefore, Koyanagi Tadashi, the chairman of the Industrial Patriotic Association, was appointed as the successor.

### Conflicts Occur Between Chongqing and U.S. Troops

Guangzhou, 19th (Central News Agency) - The United States' ambition to transform China into its colony is becoming more and more blatant. Therefore, the anti-American sentiment in Chongqing is gradually intensifying. The friction between the U.S. troops stationed in Chongqing and the Chongqing troops is becoming more and more serious, and the occurrence of conflicts has become a major military problem. The Ta Kung Pao editorial on the 16th severely criticized the friction between the U.S. and Chongqing troops on this issue, stating that the reason is that the U.S. military despises the Chinese people. If the Americans do not change this attitude, it will inevitably cause a major problem between the two countries. The general idea is as follows: The frequent conflicts between the U.S. troops stationed in Chongqing and the Chongqing troops are truly chilling. Although we want the two armies to maintain a harmonious relationship, the greatest estrangement has been found between the two countries. The main reason is that the treatment of the two armies is different, because the treatment of the Chongqing troops cannot match that of the U.S. troops. Therefore, jealousy arises, and it is always difficult to promote satisfaction. In addition, differences in language and customs in daily life are also the reasons for their discord. However, according to the Chongqing troops, the Americans often insult the Chinese people. The importance of the relationship between the two countries is self-evident. This is not only in the military, but also the relationship between the Chinese and American people must be increasingly strengthened. At this time, if there are misunderstandings between the two peoples, unexpected events may occur.

### Germany Actively Strengthens the Atlantic Fortress

Starts Construction of Four Defense Lines

Zurich, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Berlin: It is reported that while the German military authorities are actively expanding and strengthening the Atlantic Fortress, they are also starting to construct a second fortress in the Atlantic. The original Atlantic Fortress was constructed based on the experiences of the Maginot Line and the Battle of Sevastopol. It is expected that the second fortress line that the German army is starting to construct this time is aimed at countering the landing tactics previously adopted by the anti-Axis forces. The completion of the third and fourth defense lines by the anti-Axis forces has made it impossible for the anti-Axis forces to ignore it.

### The Battle for Cassino Is Fierce

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) - After the anti-Axis forces concentrated their bombing in southern Italy on the 15th, they launched their second offensive in Cassino. The battle on the 18th reached its peak. According to front-line news, the anti-Axis forces entered the Cassino station for the second time on the 17th, and one of their forces attacked to within 100 yards of the top of Mount Cassino on the outskirts of the city. However, they were repelled by a fierce counterattack by the German army, and the top of the mountain is still under German control. In addition, New Zealand and Indian soldiers who broke in from the east and north of the city launched a fierce attack under the cover of mortars and tanks. The German army gathered in the southwest of the city to launch a fierce counterattack and at the same time counterattacked the hills on the outskirts of the city, regaining part of them. According to German sources, the German army has repeatedly dropped paratroopers, so the defensive posture of Cassino is very tight.

### Casual Talk on the Current Situation by Tokutomi Soho

From the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95 to the Russo-Japanese War, the number of Chinese students coming to Japan to study was actually tens of thousands. Among our country's authorities and people, there were foresighted people who believed that for the rise of East Asia, we must first shake hands with China. After the Sino-Japanese War, the so-called "no fight, no friendship," so China and Japan were able to cooperate. After a lot of effort, it finally became like today, with a steady stream of students coming to Japan. However, when it comes to the results, although it cannot be generalized, our sincerity and goodwill have almost completely become a bubble. As for the reasons, perhaps because of the ingratitude of the Chinese, but we Japanese must also reflect. It is also due to the complete lack of enthusiasm on the part of Japan. Based on our experience, unreasonable and unenthusiastic things have given Chinese students a lot of bad impressions. Those who occasionally receive my enthusiasm have goodwill towards me for life. Unfortunately, those who do not cannot dispel their bad feelings towards me for life. The fact that anti-Japanese elements can still survive today, although it cannot be entirely attributed to this point, the coldness and indifference they received in apartments near Hongo and Kanda cannot deny that there was also coldness.

Now that Japan has become the center of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, countries and ethnic groups in East Asia are increasingly coming to Japan to study. If we take this opportunity to promote and develop the inherent enthusiasm of our Yamato people, as expressed in the folk song "Hachi no Ki," then I dare say that we will be invincible.

During the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, General Kawakami once said to me:

"Although we Japanese cannot do what God does, I believe we Japanese can definitely do it."

Our Japan finally achieved a great victory in the Sino-Japanese War with this spirit. Also, during the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Admiral Togo Heihachiro memorialized Emperor Meiji, saying:

"Your subject vows to annihilate the enemy fleet to relieve Your Majesty's worries."

What a resolute determination! Although Zhuge Liang's "Memorial on Dispatching the Army" contains many earth-shattering words, the words "Success or failure, profit or loss, are not what your subject can predict" are, of course, honest and truthful words, but they are also overly modest words.

Therefore, we are by no means saying that we can underestimate the enemy or underestimate the enemy. Examining the enemy's situation and knowing the enemy's strength, this is what is called "knowing the enemy," which is the most indispensable thing for a military strategist. However, at the same time, the spirit of swallowing mountains and rivers and overwhelming the enemy with indignant spirit is also the most important. As for the so-called fierce fighting spirit, vigorous and exuberant fighting spirit, and great and majestic spirit, it is necessary for us to understand the progressiveness of the Greater East Asia War.

Among our modern Japanese strategists, Omura Masujiro is the most outstanding. He is best at mathematics, and everything can be calculated with mathematics. When he pursued and annihilated the troops of the shogunate in Ishiguchi, his success in capturing Ishiguchi and conquering Izumo was indeed due to his mathematical strategy being appropriate, but more importantly, it was because he allowed the shogunate's troops no room to retreat. The shogunate's pawns, the so-called "traditional troops," were the first regular troops trained in the Western style, and they were not comparable to the soldiers of the various domains. Despite the fact that the shogunate's generals were brave warriors who were good at fighting, the reason for their ultimate failure was that they lacked the most important thing: indignant spirit. Before they even fought, they had already shown some discouragement. As the saying goes, "A victorious army wins first, then defeats the enemy; a defeated army loses first, then is defeated by the enemy." As Prime Minister Tojo said, "The difference between victory and defeat is only a hair's breadth," which is the same reason.

Britain and the United States do not have any reliable pillars, but only rely on calculations. In short, they believe that if they have quantity, they can win. However, the great wars recorded in world history are not cases of the majority overwhelming the minority, but of the minority subduing the majority. Looking at modern examples, during the Battle of Mukden, didn't the minority Japanese army surround the majority of the Russian army and inflict a major blow on them? If the Japanese army had slightly outnumbered the Russian army at that time, the Russian army would probably have been completely annihilated, with no survivors. But the Russian army collapsed and scattered in all directions, so the land battleâjust like the Battle of the Sea of Japan at seaâcame to an end. If wars were all like the results calculated by the abacus, then what is the reason for Greece defeating Persia? What is the reason for Nobunaga killing the enemy general Imagawa Yoshimoto in the Battle of Okehazama? This proves that although it cannot be generalized, most should be the case, as proved by the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War. Therefore, abacus calculation, although an important factor in war, is not an absolute factor. There is something more important than calculation. This is not a thing, but a person. It is not the quantity of people, but the spirit of people. The reason why Sun Tzu said, "Join with righteousness, win with surprise," is that he admitted that abacus calculation is also within it. However, at the same time, he also admitted that there is something even more important. (To be continued) (Written from the Mainichi Shimbun on February 9)

### Rice Control Committee Convenes Meeting of Responsible Persons

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - Due to poor past rice purchases, the Nanjing office of the Rice Control Committee and the municipal government convened a meeting of responsible persons from various regions the other day. They discussed future procurement policies and strictly urged agents to quickly complete the payment for all purchased quantities within a short period. Simultaneously, to facilitate large-scale transportation of rice from the countryside, rice inspection stations in various locations were abolished to benefit merchants and civilians in procurement. It is understood that the source and quantity of rice in the city are increasing daily, but due to smooth outflow, the selling price remains firm. The current market price is approximately 1,700 yuan per picul, an increase of 154 yuan compared to the rise this week.

### Coal Briquette Retail Stores to be Re-Adjusted

Citizens to Purchase Nearby

The third phase of household coal briquettes is scheduled to be the last day of sale today. It is understood that the fourth phase will begin distribution within a few days to meet the needs of citizens. Due to the urgent time of this implementation of quota allocation, the designated retail stores are far from the residences of citizens who have obtained purchase certificates, making it very inconvenient to purchase. Therefore, the Economic Affairs Department is re-adjusting and increasing the number of retail stores, which is expected to be implemented around May. It is also learned that retail stores selling household coal briquettes often have shortages in weight and poor quality, which have been reported by many citizens.

### Enthusiastically Donate to Complete Aircraft Donation

Mayor Chen Issues Statement

Mayor Chen issued a statement to the citizens regarding the aircraft donation campaign, stating: "People from all walks of life in this city have organized a people's aircraft donation campaign committee to collect donations for aircraft, with the aim of further fulfilling the national duty to strengthen national defense. This move is truly commendable. In modern warfare, due to the development of the air force, there is no distinction between the front and the rear. Strengthening the air force will change the defensive air defense to offensive air defense, and the consolidation of rear security will benefit greatly. I believe that the citizens of Shanghai have been working tirelessly in their respective positions. I hope that they will continue to adhere to this original intention, economize their income, and do their best to donate to complete the aircraft donation campaign."

### Grand Concert Held Yesterday

The method is recorded as follows: The allocation of glutinous rice for wine brewing is limited to 100,000 picul. The Rice and Grain Control Committee should implement this allocation method as early as possible within a feasible range. The recipients of the allocation are members of the wine brewing industry guilds in three provinces and two special municipalities, and delivery will be made at designated locations by the Rice and Grain Control Committee in cash. The Rice and Grain Control Committee determines the allocation quantity for each county and two special municipalities, in principle, according to the previous year's wine brewing volume. The wine brewing tax amount collected by the Tax Bureau is the main reference material. The guilds should also determine the allocation amount for each of their members according to the method in Article 4. The allocation amounts determined by the Rice and Grain Control Committee and the guilds in accordance with Articles 4 and 5 should be notified to the Tax Bureau for record. When the method in Article 5 is implemented, it should be submitted to the competent provincial and municipal governments for record. The Rice and Grain Control Committee allocates to the guilds according to the prescribed price, and the difference between the price of the Rice and Grain Control Committee and the selling price of the guilds should be turned over to the government by the Rice and Grain Control Committee for the purpose of rewarding increased production. This method will be implemented after approval by the Materials Control Review Committee. (Note) This allocation method should continue to be implemented in the future, subject to the purchase status of rice and grain.
