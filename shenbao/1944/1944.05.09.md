### The Opportunity to Consider the Grain Problem

The grain problem is the most important issue concerning people's livelihoods. However, the way the grain problem has been handled in the past has reached a dead end. Because this most important problem has been handled so poorly, the suffering of the people is self-evident.

In September of last year, as corruption in grain administration worsened day by day, and the grain problem became increasingly serious, the government, in order to adjust and reform, established the Rice and Grain Control Committee. Eight months have passed, and a review of the entire grain problem reveals that it has only become more complicated and deteriorated. We only hear of its drawbacks, but see no benefits. Objectively speaking, the failure of the Rice and Grain Control Committee's work in the past is undeniable. Let us examine the reasons for its failure, which are roughly as follows:

In each rice-producing region, there were local rice merchants who had direct emotional ties and a reputation. Rice merchants in Shanghai, however, were in a position of trust and did not have direct contact with farmers in the producing areas. However, after the establishment of the Rice and Grain Control Committee, it did not utilize the existing rice merchant organizations in the rice-producing areas for procurement work, but instead adopted an official stance, starting from scratch and employing many procurement merchants who were mostly amateurs or engaged in illegal activities. This turned the procurement work into a tool for oppressing farmers, leading to a decline in credibility and making successful procurement impossible. This was an error in the Rice and Grain Control Committee's neglect of the environment in procuring rice and grain.

After its establishment, the Rice and Grain Control Committee was unable to raise sufficient funds for rice procurement, prepare enough sacks, or establish enough warehouses in time for the new grain harvest season. As a result, a large amount of grain could have been purchased, but the funds and tools were insufficient.

The responsible cadres of the Rice and Grain Control Committee and the majority of procurement merchants lacked the will and experience to handle grain administration. Even those from allied countries who participated in the work, while enthusiastic, also lacked experience.

The Rice and Grain Control Committee's personnel system was unsound, allowing unscrupulous individuals to infiltrate and take advantage of loopholes without being punished. For example, although there was concrete evidence of corruption by senior official Sheng Du, he was only dismissed from his position, allowing him to get away with it. Furthermore, the organization was large, with too many redundant staff, resulting in huge expenses, reaching eight million yuan per month.

Having outlined the root causes of the Rice and Grain Control Committee's failure over the past eight months, and with the grain problem becoming even more serious, the situation has reached a point where it is time to consider its "existence," "abolition," or "reorganization." If we continue to procrastinate, the reputation of the entire committee will be tarnished, which is a minor matter compared to the impact on the people's food supply. At this crucial juncture, we would like to offer some points to consider:

As far as Shanghai is concerned, during the transition period from the Grain Department to the Rice and Grain Control Committee in the past, household rice was unavailable for two months. If there are any changes now, attention should be paid to preventing this from happening again.

Wartime military grain is undoubtedly extremely important, but it should be the sole responsibility of the central government to ensure a sufficient supply. In the past, grain administration agencies discovered corruption in the Grain Department and shortcomings in the Rice and Grain Control Committee, while many unscrupulous individuals among private rice merchants also engaged in corruption. If unified control is considered in the future, and the methods of buying and selling are reformed, attention should still be paid to preventing exploitation and manipulation by intermediaries, and strict prevention is necessary.

Before the establishment of the Rice and Grain Control Committee, the allocation of household rice in Shanghai was superior to that after its establishment, both in terms of quantity and duration. In the past year, the Economic Affairs Office of the First District Public Office of this city made considerable efforts in handling allocation, but unfortunately, it only had the right to allocate and not the right to procure. It received a great deal of assistance from allied authorities in obtaining rice sources. Assuming that in the future, the municipal government of Shanghai directly procures and distributes food for the city, the results may be better than the current situation.

Even if the procurement results are satisfactory in the future, the transportation problem is extremely important. Therefore, strengthening transportation capacity and eliminating obstacles is particularly important.

Finally, we must pay attention to the fact that farmers, due to the pressure of being bought at low prices by government-run intermediaries, have adopted a negative attitude towards planting rice, which is enough to reduce grain production. This is a fundamental and serious problem. How to change the farmers' negative attitude and encourage production is most urgent. We hope that the municipal authorities and the members of the Living Necessities Subcommittee of the Municipal Advisory Committee will pay full attention to the above points, quickly devise practical countermeasures, break the deadlock in the food problem, and lay the foundation for the stability of people's livelihoods.

### Fierce Fighting Near Kohima; British Troops Retreat from Buthidaung; Enemy Troops Burned Down Three Hundred Barracks in Palel

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a Japanese base on the Indian front, on the morning of May 4th at 10:30 AM, 700 enemy troops, with over 30 tanks, launched a counterattack on Japanese positions near Kohima after an hour of bombing by enemy aircraft. Japanese units immediately used tank weapons and hand grenades to attack enemy tanks, destroying 12 large and light tanks and two light armored vehicles. During the battle, 40 Japanese aircraft flew over Kohima and heavily bombed enemy Wang Li positions in the Zubza and Jotsoma areas, completely crushing them. On the 5th, 200 enemy troops, led by 17 tanks, launched a strong attack on Japanese positions. A Japanese unit immediately counterattacked, luring them past the positions and then engaging in close combat. Most of the enemy were destroyed, and the Japanese army then launched a surprise attack, instantly wiping out the enemy troops. The enemy abandoned 53 bodies, and the Japanese army captured 15 automatic rifles, one machine gun, and a large quantity of ammunition.

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Contino, the Southeast Asian Anti-Axis Command announced on the 7th that British and Indian troops had withdrawn from Buthidaung on the Arakan front in order to shorten the battle line.

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from the Indian front, the Japanese army's elite forces are intensifying their attack on Palel. At dawn on the 1st of this month, they launched a surprise attack on the enemy barracks group in Palel, engaging in fierce fighting with hundreds of British soldiers and burning down approximately 300 barracks. Another Japanese unit attacked and entered Arumolmarma south of Palel at dawn on the 1st, blowing up bridges and destroying the enemy's escape route in the highlands southeast of Palel. Furthermore, the Japanese army at Highland 3525, 7 kilometers north of Palel, broke through the enemy's stubborn counterattack, secured the position, and directly threatened the Palel-Imphal highway. From this, it can be seen that the battle to attack Palel is extremely fierce and has entered its final stage. Approximately 600 remnant enemy troops are still putting up a last desperate resistance before the fall of Palel.

### Two Major Pillars of East Asia Must Advance Hand in Hand – Guo Xiufeng's Speech in Japan

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – Guo Xiufeng, Vice Minister of the Propaganda Department of the National Government and President of the Central Telegraph Agency, and Vice President Hu Yingzhou, arrived in Tokyo on the afternoon of the 7th to investigate the propaganda and communication industries in Japan. Guo met with reporters on the 8th and made the following remarks: "As the concurrent President of the Central Telegraph Agency of our country, I am honored to be invited by the Allied News Agency to personally come to your country and have frank discussions with senior members of the press, to discuss the close cooperation between our two countries in news reporting in the future, and to take this opportunity to personally witness the true state of your country during wartime. I feel deeply fortunate. On the way to Tokyo, I first visited the Ise Grand Shrine to pay respects to the sacred site and deepen my understanding of the spirit of your country's founding. I am especially honored. Along the way, I witnessed the people of your country, united in heart and mind, diligently fulfilling their duties in their respective positions. Regardless of gender, age, or status, they all possess an extremely strong belief in victory and an extremely courageous fighting spirit. Even in this decisive stage, social order is maintained in an orderly manner, and everything is as usual, which demonstrates the soundness of your country's social organization and the strength of its fighting power, which is beyond the imagination of the enemy. Our country recognized from the beginning of the Greater East Asia War that this war was a matter of the rise and fall of the East Asian nations. We shared the hardships and shouldered the difficult task together. On January 9th of last year, the National Government resolutely entered the war, moving from sharing hardships to sharing life and death. Your country's new policy towards China also began to be implemented, returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights. Last November, the treaty was revised to assist our country in completing its independence and liberation. This spirit is deeply understood by our country's government and people. However, due to the limitations of our national strength, we have not been able to contribute to the war as much as our allied soldiers. I am deeply ashamed to say this. Our country is located in the rear, but the responsibilities of the front and the rear are equally important. On New Year's Day this year, President Wang pointed out three points to encourage the people: first, to rectify our thinking; second, to safeguard public order; and third, to increase production. These are the minimum responsibilities that the rear should fulfill. Regarding rectifying our thinking, the New National Movement has been launched. Regarding safeguarding public order, the Clean Countryside Work has been promoted. Regarding increasing production, the agricultural production increase plan is being implemented. We are striving towards these three major goals in order to contribute our modest efforts and not fail the eager expectations of our allies. Unfortunately, Chongqing still mistakenly believes in Britain and the United States, abandons the East Asian stance, and stubbornly resists, so the country has not yet achieved unification, which is deeply regrettable. However, since the publication of the Greater East Asia Declaration last year, the construction of East Asia has had a clear and unwavering framework. East Asians will ultimately be for East Asians. Chongqing will eventually come to its senses. China and Japan are brotherly countries and two pillars of the East Asian nations. We have an unshirkable responsibility to liberate East Asia. China must be the rear of the allies, join hands and move forward, extinguish Britain and the United States, and build a glorious and splendid new East Asia. This is something we should believe in without doubt."

### Mr. Yamamoto's Impressions After Inspecting the Economy of North China

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – The North China Economic Inspection Group, dispatched by the Japanese government with Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Greater East Asia Ministry as its leader, conducted a detailed inspection of the economic situation in North China, Mengjiang, and other important resource bases in Greater East Asia, and has provided side support for the implementation of this year's major production increase plan. Recently, the Vice Minister expressed his feelings about the inspection as follows: "In order to develop an industry in each region, whether it is to develop an iron mountain or build a factory, political, economic, and cultural aspects must be included in the comprehensive policy, and it must be promoted with a comprehensive and long-lasting force. Furthermore, because various undertakings are being implemented in China, attention must be paid to how to enable Sino-Japanese cooperation to fulfill the plan. Therefore, whether it is a labor problem or a company problem, if the industrial management method is promoted in China in the Japanese style, it will not only produce harm but will be ineffective. On this point, it is necessary to adapt to local conditions. For example, when building a factory, the relationship between the factory and the residents near the factory must be considered. Some companies paid attention to this a year ago, so they have achieved good results. In addition, it is necessary to deeply reflect on the policies implemented in China. Secondly, do not be impatient. If the cooperation between China and Japan is not smooth, then you must take responsibility for resolving it. In this way, we encourage each other and take responsibility. Military officers and civilians must work together and move forward bravely. Furthermore, people in Japan must deeply trust the staff working abroad and allow them to proceed freely in everything. At present, military officers and civilians in all regions are cooperating to increase the production of important materials. For this, the Japanese people must express deep respect and gratitude."

### India Lends Large Amounts of Materials to U.S. Military

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Foreign Economic Administration announced on the 7th the status of India's lending of materials to the U.S. as follows: During the first two months of 1944, the U.S. military stationed in India borrowed more than $35 million worth of materials from India. The amount of materials lent during these two months was the same as the total amount in 1942 and half the total amount in 1943. However, this does not include the funds lent by the general public in India to the U.S. military. From March 1941 to February of this year, the total amount of India's lending to the U.S. has reached $149,512,000.

### Myanmar National Army's Ranks to Be Actively Expanded; Major General Aung San Talks About Fighting Situation

Rangoon, 8th (Central News Agency) – During the extremely short period of national construction, the Myanmar National Army has now trained a large number of elite high-射炮 troops, motorcades, communication units, and other modern mechanized units, and has successively compiled programs. At present, it is jointly protecting the western part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere with the Japanese army. Major General Aung San, the head of the Myanmar National Army, met with a group of Japanese reporters on the 6th and explained the Myanmar army's fighting situation in India and attacking enemy airborne troops. He also expressed his confidence in continuing to defend the country with the Japanese army as follows: "Sergeant First Class Ya Na Yin reported on the situation of the battle with enemy airborne troops in the Assam area. He stated that in a certain battle, the number of enemy soldiers killed was several times greater than that of friendly forces. The enemy suffered such heavy losses with excellent equipment because they were focused on defense and did not know the friendly forces' advancing formation. The training methods of the British and Americans mainly rely on elite personnel and material quantities to maintain safety, while the training of the Myanmar army is to cultivate combat spirit and bravely attack. The British and Americans claim to be familiar with jungle tactics in this operation, but they still cannot abandon the luxury of airborne troops supplying food. The primary task of the Myanmar army is to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In order to complete this important mission, we will fully exert our power and cooperate with the Japanese army to engage in jungle warfare and devote all our efforts to annihilate enemy airborne troops. Whether the tasks assigned to us are achieved can be known from the results of the battle. In the future, we plan to actively expand the ranks of the army."

### Central Consultative Assembly of Java Holds Opening Ceremony

Jakarta, 8th (Central News Agency) – The opening ceremony of the Third Central Consultative Assembly of Java was held at 11:00 AM on the 7th. Attendees included Speaker Sukarno of the Consultative Assembly and all members, the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army and the Governor-General, and several Japanese representatives. First, Speaker Sukarno, representing all members, took an oath, clarifying the new mission of deeply honoring Java and the determination to strive and work hard in accordance with the spirit of public service. After the opening ceremony, a plenary meeting was held. First, the Governor-General delivered a speech, followed by the adoption of a resolution thanking the Japanese army for practicing public service, and then an explanation of the advisory items. The first day's meeting agenda was completed at 3:20 PM. The explanation of the advisory items is as follows: "In order to win this war, it is necessary to make all the people harmonious and cooperative, recognize their own missions, and abandon ethnic and class prejudices. This is the most important thing, and we request all members to express their opinions on concrete strategies."

### National Government's Declaration of War

At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th of the year before last, the National Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared that it would share the hardships with the friendly nation of Japan. Since then, it has launched the New National Movement, engaged in safeguarding public order, and improving people's livelihoods, with the aim of enhancing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, the United Kingdom and the United States continue to use their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and have intensified it, even luring Yu's elements to participate in the so-called Anglo-American front and send troops to Burma and India, using East Asians to kill East Asians. Recently, as their violence has been successively defeated by the land, sea, and air forces of the friendly nation of Japan, and the base for their aggression in East Asia has been lost, they have increasingly resorted to cunning schemes. They are jealous of the peaceful development of the National Government's ruling area and have instigated Yu's elements to constantly harass it in order to obstruct the progress of various construction projects. They have even used their own aircraft, based on Yu's area, to repeatedly bomb Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. Yu's elements willingly accept the orders of the United Kingdom and the United States and act as traitors to East Asia, which is certainly shameful. The United Kingdom and the United States have been scheming against East Asia, doing their utmost to sow discord in order to achieve their ultimate desire for annexation, which should be resisted by all East Asian nations. The National Government hereby declares that, from today onwards, it is in a state of war with the United Kingdom and the United States. It will do its utmost to cooperate with the friendly nation of Japan to eliminate the brutality of the United Kingdom and the United States in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The two countries of Manchukuo and Thailand have long maintained friendly relations and share the same mind for the co-prosperity of East Asia. In the future, they should work together to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. The friendly nations of Germany and Italy have been dealing with the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States in the West for several years and have repeatedly won glorious victories. Our country is now participating in the Greater East Asia War and should echo each other in order to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All our people should know that this is the only opportunity to realize the Great Asianism of the Founding Father. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the attainment of trust, peace, and harmony in the entire world are all closely linked to this. We must be of one heart and one mind, strive to the end, and persevere to the end in order to fulfill the great mission of this great era!

January 9th, 32nd year of the Republic of China Chairman Wang Zhaoming

### Foreign Minister's Statement on Anniversary of Chairman Wang's Visit to Manchukuo

Xinjing, 8th (Central News Agency) – The seventh of this month is the anniversary of Chairman Wang's visit to Manchukuo two years ago. Today, witnessing the thriving scene in China and Manchukuo, the future development of Greater East Asia, and the fact that our Chairman Wang, who is recuperating in Tokyo, is gradually recovering his health without medication, reflecting on the past and thinking about the present has a profound meaning. Minister Li, the Foreign Minister of Manchukuo, met with a group of reporters on this day and said: "I remember today two years ago, when His Excellency Wang Zhaoming, Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China, visited our country's capital amidst his busy schedule in order to inspect the construction of our country and celebrate the tenth anniversary of our country's founding. As the head of a country, he did not hesitate to travel to visit, which is a great honor for our country. At this time when the sacred war of the liberation of the East Asian nations is progressing steadily, the undertaking of building a new order centered on China, Japan, and Manchukuo has laid an unbreakable foundation. The three countries are overcoming the difficulties and fulfilling our sacred cause based on the great ideal of sharing life and death. The progress of the future is just beginning. Recalling that since the publication of the joint declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo on November 30th, the seventh year of Kangde and the thirtieth year of the Republic of China, the two countries have recognized each other. In addition to exchanging prime ministers, I have also visited China in return. Therefore, the friendly relations between our two countries have become closer. In terms of materials, there is also mutual communication. At the same time, Chairman Wang's two visits to Japan have further increased the close relationship between China and Japan. Furthermore, due to the recognition of the National Government by Germany, the United States, and other Axis powers, its international status has become higher, and the national foundation has become more consolidated and progressed day by day. Chairman Wang deserves to be congratulated. I believe that China, Japan, and Manchukuo, working closely together, will surely be able to complete the great undertaking."

### Main Force Operations Reach Climax

A certain location on the Henan Front, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The war in Henan has now reached its climax. Tang Enbo's army was pursued into the mountainous areas south of Songshan (5 kilometers from Dengfeng). The Japanese army, since the morning of the 5th, launched a joint air and land annihilation operation, suppressing the Yu army's 13th Army's advance southwestward. Furthermore, in a certain area, they pursued the Yu army's 29th Army, advancing in multiple routes from land towards the north and northwest. Moreover, the Japanese aircraft units have broken through the Yu army's strongest positions and are turning eastward from the vicinity of a certain location, cutting off the Yu army's western retreat and completely blockading the Yu army's southern retreat. Currently, the Japanese army is gradually compressing the large encirclement net from all sides, fiercely attacking Tang Enbo's main force, the 13th Army commanded by Shi Jue, as well as the 15th Army, 29th Army, and reinforcement units, totaling ten divisions, approximately 80,000 men, inflicting a devastating blow on the Yu army.

Japanese air units also cooperated with ground troops, actively bombing the Yu army within the Japanese encirclement. It is reported that fierce fighting is still ongoing in that area.

### Canal Embankment Spring Repairs - Project Completion Imminent - Pisu Canal Management Work to be Completed

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Water Conservancy Department of the Construction Ministry has established a special office for the Canal Embankment Spring Repair project and appointed Wang Yimou as the director. Since the start of the project, it has been implemented step by step according to the planned work schedule, and the progress has been excellent. Half of the project has now been completed, and the entire project is expected to be completed in approximately thirty more days.

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Chief of the Canal Management Preparatory Office, Ru Geng, previously noted that the section from Yunhe Station in Pixian to Huaiyin had shallow water levels, making navigation difficult. Before the overall project to address the root cause could be undertaken, it was necessary to implement two projects in the Pisu section: dredging and building dams, and raising the water level, in order to allow cargo ships of over ten tons to navigate within a short period of time. Therefore, at the beginning of last month, a temporary dredging and storage project office for the Pisu section was established at Yunhe Station, and engineering sections were set up in Pixian and Suqian counties, with engineers concurrently serving as section chiefs to supervise the progress of the project closely. This project commenced on April 11th and was originally scheduled to be completed on May 24th, but since the start of construction, the staff has actively promoted it, resulting in rapid progress. It is reported that the Suqian section is expected to be completed before the 10th of this month, and the Pixian section is expected to be completed before the 15th of this month, ahead of schedule. After completion, cargo ships carrying fourteen tons will be able to pass without hindrance. At that time, the Preparatory Office will request the Executive Yuan to send personnel to inspect and accept the project, in order to ensure thoroughness.

### Southwest Yu-US Air Force Attacked by Japanese Aircraft

Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Air Force stationed in China has recently been coordinating with the Japanese ground forces in North China, fiercely bombing Yu army positions, and has also been continuously launching surprise attacks on the US Air Force stationed in southwestern China, inflicting heavy damage.

However, the US Air Force, which appears to have a large number of aircraft deployed in Guilin, Lingling, Suichuan, and other locations, waiting for opportunities to act, is now actively expanding its operations, and its movements are drawing considerable attention. The Japanese Air Force is currently prepared for battle and is even launching attacks on its air bases.

Hankou, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A combined formation of Japanese fighter-bombers bombed the Yu airfield in Laohekou (northern Hubei Province) at 0:45 PM on the 7th, destroying its runway and rendering it unusable. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.

### On Countermeasures Against Air Raids

— Nobuhiko Ushiba

When I was in London, I experienced German air raids. After coming to Germany, I experienced British air raids. The experience I gained at that time was that the impact of the initial strike during an air raid is the greatest. Furthermore, if the enemy carries out a reasonably large-scale air raid, the psychological impact is also extremely significant. Initially, due to the destruction of houses, deaths of people and animals, and the outbreak of fires, a certain amount of terror spread, and some confusion was unavoidable. But since the unexpected damage felt at that time was small, the anxiety gradually subsided, and emotions returned to calm.

### Endure the Initial Strike

If one can endure the initial strike, one will get used to it later. At the same time, as the people's lives gradually adapt to air raids, for example, through the preparation of evacuation of the elderly and children, communal living, and communal cooking, the psychological effect that the enemy aims for is countered by the enemy's hatred of the air raiders becoming even more intense.

Speaking of the air raid countermeasures in England and Germany, due to the differences in methods and national conditions, it is impossible to simply compare them. But the methods adopted by both sides are tailored to their national conditions, and the morale of the people is very high.

First, looking at Germany, countermeasures against enemy air raids were planned long ago. Underground shelters, etc., are constantly being reinforced, and strong shelters are constructed with steel bars. But the true awareness of the horror of air raids came after the Hamburg air raid last year. Since then, newspapers have often emphasized the strengthening of air defense. Prior to this, although Germany also advised people to evacuate, it had not been thoroughly implemented. Since the August 1st announcements of evacuation in Berlin and Hamburg, although they suffered such large-scale bombings, the proportion of damage was extremely small. At that time, about one million citizens were evacuated from Berlin, which was quite thorough. The method of evacuation was not based on family units, but rather using group evacuation. This is trained by the Labor Service Corps, so it is different from Japan.

### Food is More Important Than Everything

The most important aspects of air raid countermeasures are the food supply and transportation issues. When a reasonably large-scale air raid occurs, transportation facilities such as trams and trains generally have to be stopped. Especially trams, when they are damaged, are very difficult to repair. As for trains, even if the station is restored quickly, it still takes a considerable amount of time. As a result, the transport of evacuees and repair materials cannot avoid using trucks and buses. If these are not sufficiently prepared in advance, all the functions of the city will cease. Furthermore, this preparation must be a unified plan and cannot be carried out independently, in order to fully exert the transportation capacity. If this preparation is not thorough, no matter how much food or material there is, it cannot be utilized. On these points, Germany, with the Nazi Party as the main body, is extremely well organized.

For general air raid countermeasures, Germany, like Japan, adopts a neighborhood association (bao-jia) system. This is because during an air raid, the police and fire departments have no time to attend to everything, and one must take care of oneself. Firefighting equipment will naturally not include large equipment; the main things are water and sand.

In urban bombings, incendiary bombs are probably the most numerous, so the losses from fires are also the greatest. Moreover, when incendiary bombs are dropped, they are always mixed with explosive bombs. The main purpose of the explosive bombs is not to destroy houses, but to prevent citizens from fighting the fire. However, if one does not risk extinguishing the fire when the bombs fall, it immediately turns into a major fire. On this point, the German people are extremely brave.

Without food and shelter, people will ultimately panic. If people do not drink, eat, and sleep, no matter what, you cannot ask them to work. Once one is hit by an air raid, no matter how well-prepared the air raid countermeasures are, some damage is unavoidable. This phenomenon is inevitable, so if one does not think about the after-effects and does not have complete preparedness, any air raid countermeasures are meaningless.

### Thoroughly Plan Firefighting Methods

In the event of a fire caused by an air raid, with the current level of air defense, it is not easy to extinguish the fire. From this point of view, it is even more necessary to fully consider the situation after the air raid and make greater efforts and preparations. For example, the minimum amount of repair materials such as roof tiles and door panels for houses is absolutely necessary. Some houses that can be used after repairing the tiles cannot be used because they lack tiles.

Looking at Japan, the scale is different, and the nature of the buildings is also different, so there is no need to be so worried and afraid of the damage caused by bombings. However, because there are many wooden buildings, one cannot but thoroughly plan and implement complete firefighting methods. Furthermore, measures for disaster victims, such as the repair of partially damaged and partially burned houses, should also be fully considered.

In terms of national character, the Japanese are rich in the concepts of discipline and obligation. Not to mention the British and Americans, even the Germans cannot compare. Therefore, even if they are repeatedly bombed, the morale of the people will not be demoralized. Even if tens of thousands of people lose their homes in one night, they will find ways to settle down. Regarding issues such as security, food, and transportation, even if they suffer great damage, they will not cause any anxiety.

### No Need to be Apprehensive

As the war situation becomes increasingly tense and fierce, some people seem to be very afraid of the arrival of air raids. However, there is no need to be apprehensive. If air defense facilities can be improved, the elderly and children who should be evacuated should be evacuated as soon as possible, and if there is full preparation for enemy aircraft attacks, there is no need to become neurotic due to air raids. In short, the four words "careful and bold" are also the most suitable for air raid countermeasures. (Xiang: Translated from the weekly magazine of March 19)

### Today is the Fifth Air Defense Day - Emphasis on Evacuation Training - And Strengthening the Effectiveness of Special Protection Corps

Today (9th) is the "Fifth Air Defense Day." Air defense drills are being held in all districts of the city, and the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters has stipulated that emphasis be placed on evacuation and awaiting evacuation as the main subjects, and the three training points of "pre-emptive evacuation," emergency evacuation, and preparing to take shelter are implemented. The number of participants must be based on detailed training beforehand, with the spirit of responding to everything as if actually encountering an air raid, in order to be skilled, courageous, and agile. At the same time, in order to give each protection corps the opportunity to learn from each other, personnel are dispatched to observe each other. However, when inspecting in the field, smoking, talking loudly, and standing idly by are absolutely prohibited. Furthermore, during this exercise, trainees who have already received training will serve as instructors.

Furthermore, in order to strengthen the organization of special protection corps, the Naval and Air Force Air Defense Headquarters and the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters will dispatch personnel to inspect tall buildings and factories, in addition to the training of ordinary protection corps. All special protection corps of relevant groups should prepare everything. Furthermore, each protection corps should rigorously check air defense equipment to avoid negligence and injuries during the exercise. Furthermore, in order to strengthen the capabilities of the special protection corps of factories and buildings, in addition to the ordinary training implemented today, imaginary bombs or incendiary bombs will be thrown at high-rise structures. It is hoped that the public will prepare quickly to ensure safety.

### Shanghai West Shanty Towns Collect Housing Donation

Ordinary citizens in Shanghai often lose their housing donation receipts and are not very clear about the procedures for reissuing them, which affects their household ration. The inquirer specifically consulted the relevant authorities about this matter. It is reported that residents who have lost their housing donation tickets can apply for a replacement by submitting a letter. The authorities will send personnel to investigate and verify the situation, and a replacement will be issued immediately. Currently, due to the high price of paper, a handling fee will be charged appropriately. The collection method is as follows: For every 100 yuan of housing donation, a fee of 10 yuan will be charged, with an additional 5 yuan for each additional 100 yuan, up to a maximum of 50 yuan. No other fees will be charged. As for the general residents of the newly merged districts in Shanghai West, when paying the housing donation, they must pay the outstanding donation fees from before the winter of the previous year. Outsiders who do not understand the situation may suspect that extra fees are being charged, which is actually inaccurate. Those who have already paid off the previous year's housing donation do not need to pay more. In addition, regarding the shanty towns in Shanghai West, there has been no household registration or rationing in the past, and most of the residents are poor and do not pay much attention to the housing donation. Recently, because the authorities have household registration and rationing, they have been requesting to reissue housing donation tickets. In order to care for the general Tang households, the authorities have specially sent people to each cooperative household area to make a comprehensive estimate. Because most of the shanty town houses are simple, the housing donation is collected based on the number of rooms, with a donation fee of 6 yuan collected for each shanty town room, and more if there are more rooms, without any extra charges. It is reported that the authorities have issued more than 11,000 substitute donation tickets based on the request of the shanty town residents, in order to facilitate the citizens to obtain household rationing tickets. People are still being sent to handle this matter. A small number of residents who have not yet obtained the tickets can apply to the Housing Donation Section of the Finance Department at No. 209 Jiangxi Road by submitting a letter.

The Business Administration Commission has conveyed this to the Edible Oil Industry Joint Association for reference and compliance, and has also instructed its members to be informed.

Economic Commentary

### Talking about Purchase Prices

It is heard that the control authorities are actively studying the adjustment of the purchase prices of rice, wheat, and cotton in order to meet the living standards of farmers. It was decided to implement it when the new goods are on the market this year. Increasing the purchase prices of agricultural products is a consistent advocacy of enlightened people in the economic circle, and no one is willing to agree with the suicidal policy of suppressing the purchase prices of agricultural products.

If the purchase price is not adjusted, its impact will be limited to two aspects in the short term: it will affect the current purchase work and it will affect the living problems of farmers. However, in the long term, there are at least two aspects: the gradual reduction of major materials and the gradual tightening of urban silver. Why are major materials decreasing? Farmers, seeing that there is no profit in planting rice and cotton, are changing to other crops. For example, in the Songjiang and Qingpu areas near Shanghai, rice is still ranked first, but soybeans and rapeseed have risen to first and third place, while wheat and cotton have fallen to fourth and fifth place. Why is urban silver tightened? Because of the weakness of farmers' buying power, urban manufactured goods cannot flow to the villages in large quantities, thus making the funds stranded in the countryside unable to flow back to the cities in large quantities, which has become one of the many factors that tighten urban silver.

Now that the adjustment of purchase prices is being actively studied, we believe that the Rice, Cotton, and Flour Wheat Committee will pay attention to the following two key points when studying and implementing the adjustment plan: No coercive methods should be adopted. On the one hand, it should be based on meeting the living standards of farmers, and on the other hand, it should be based on meeting the hopes of farmers. There should be no more embezzlement. The farmers and the farmers should not tolerate embezzlement, and the officials between the farmers and the authorities should not tolerate embezzlement. Otherwise, the benefits after raising the purchase price may still not belong entirely to the vast majority of farmers!

### British Indian Government Releases Gandhi, Minister Matsudaira's Thoughts: One Step in Efforts to Achieve Independence

Minister Matsudaira Jozai of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy in China, at the regular press conference yesterday (8th) afternoon at 3:00 pm, expressed his thoughts on the release of Gandhi by the British Indian government as follows:

Detained for More Than Two Years

Minister Matsudaira first stated: The British Indian government suddenly detained Gandhi and the leaders of the Indian Independence National Congress on August 9th two years ago, and it has been more than two years since then. This time, on the 6th of this month, the British Indian government suddenly issued a statement, citing health considerations, and unconditionally released Gandhi. The reason why Gandhi and the National Congress were arrested and imprisoned was that on August 7th of the previous year, the Indian Independence National Congress held a meeting in Bombay and decided: The British forces should immediately withdraw from India; the Indian Federal Government should be established; and war countermeasures should be decided. If the British refused to accept the above items, all the people of India would start a disobedience movement under the leadership of Gandhi. Unexpectedly, two days later, the Indian National Congress was arrested by the British Indian government. After that, the British government instigated Chiang Kai-shek of Chongqing to go to India in an attempt to ease the independence intention of the National Congress. As a result, the Indian National Independence Movement became increasingly turbulent. Finally, the British Indian government resolutely adopted force to suppress the freedom of the National Congress.

The Independence Movement Did Not Stop

When the news of Gandhi's imprisonment and the loss of freedom of the leaders of the National Congress reached Chongqing, Chongqing actually prohibited various gangs from publishing this news. The local opinion in Chongqing was in an uproar, and the Chongqing regime was severely criticized for taking this measure. Therefore, Chongqing had great difficulty in dealing with the Indian issue. Gandhi's wife was imprisoned and died in prison a month ago. In addition, according to the statement issued by Indian Affairs Minister Amery on November 1st last year, it is said that 15,761 important members of the Indian National Congress were imprisoned in prisons, and 7,267 people were deprived of their freedom and were being monitored. From this, we can see the severe and vicious methods adopted by Britain towards Indian independence. This time, the release of Gandhi by the British Indian government does not, in fact, stop the Indian independence movement. With the majestic advances of the Japanese army and the Indian National Army, the atmosphere of independence in India is more vigorous than before, which is an inevitable fact. Minister Matsudaira finally stated that releasing the detained personnel of the Indian National Congress and completing the independence of India is also one of the goals of liberating the East Asian nations. The two major nations of China and Japan should make further efforts to achieve this goal.

### Encouraging Farmers to Use Garbage as Fertilizer

— Gui Fu

Recently, garbage in the southern part of Shanghai and western suburbs has piled up like mountains. Over time, it inevitably undergoes decomposition, breeding bacteria and spreading epidemics, which undoubtedly has a significant impact on citizens' health. Moreover, as the weather gets warmer, bacteria will easily multiply, and the spread of epidemics is feared to become even more rampant. The health authorities in the southern part of the city once organized a charity performance to raise funds for clearing it up. It is clear that garbage disposal is a matter that cannot be delayed. Yesterday (the 3rd), Mr. Ne of the News reported offered a great suggestion, saying that filling the stinky ponds in Xujiahui and other places with garbage, moving the east to supplement the west, is certainly a good method.

However, I believe that using the garbage that accumulates throughout the city every day to fill up the stinky ponds may not be enough in the long run. Discarding it elsewhere would be troublesome and wasteful. Therefore, I propose that the authorities should encourage and reward the people to transport as much garbage as possible to the countryside for use as fertilizer, which is truly the best way to utilize waste. Currently, food is expensive, and fertilizer is also expensive. For example, in my hometown, each person needs to spend more than thirty yuan on fertilizer, and it is difficult to purchase a large amount of fertilizer. As for bean cake fertilizer, each piece costs more than seven hundred yuan. Some farmers are limited by their finances, while others cannot purchase it even if they want to, so fertilization is often insufficient. This naturally leads to reduced production and stimulates price increases, which seriously affects people's livelihoods. Without an adequate amount of fertilizer applied to the fields, expecting increased production is like climbing a tree to catch fish.

Before the war, the fertilizers used in my hometown's farmland, in addition to bean cake, fertilizer powder, human waste and garbage, were transported from Shanghai by private boats, which were very cheap. Farmers, except for natural disasters, rarely suffered from poor harvests due to insufficient fertilization. Therefore, in the past, there was little uncultivated land and harvests were abundant. Now, the situation is completely reversed, which shows that the adequacy of fertilization can greatly affect yields. The best way to achieve this is to make full use of waste materials. The amount of garbage generated in Shanghai every day is considerable. This garbage is actually a very good composting fertilizer. When it undergoes chemical reactions, it produces organic matter, which serves as nutrients for plants. According to farmers, it can also improve soil quality and promote plant growth. It is truly cheap and good, and farmers are currently seeking it but cannot find it.

I sincerely hope that the authorities will encourage farmers to voluntarily transport garbage to the countryside for use as fertilizer. As for the implementation method, the authorities only need to divide Shanghai into several zones and designate certain villages (preferably those near Shanghai) to clear a specific zone (zoning is to prevent disputes). Furthermore, the clearing must be done cleanly before 5:00 AM every day under the guidance of a few sanitation workers. Farmers can organize fertilizer collection and transportation teams based on the baojia system, using carts and boats. In less than ten days, these wastes can be transported to the fields. This is truly a win-win situation. Why not do it? If the authorities adopt and implement this plan, the citizens will be fortunate, and the farmers will be fortunate.

### Can a Corner of the Park Be Designated for Badminton Games?

To Whom It May Concern,

Recently, I saw in the newspaper that badminton playing is prohibited in parks. This is a great misfortune for the youth in our city! In this extravagant and decadent city, it is simply impossible for young people to find wholesome recreational activities to engage in during their spare time. They either waste time in theaters or indulge in cafes. Entertainment venues such as dance halls and cabarets can further corrupt the minds and spirits of young people. Now that they enjoy playing badminton, using it to cultivate their minds and bodies and exercise their physique is a very good activity. However, due to the lack of venues, it is understandable that they play badminton in parks. Moreover, badminton is a gentle sport that is unlikely to damage flowers and trees, and it does not take up much space. Therefore, we, the youth, request the authorities to provide a corner in the park specifically for badminton enthusiasts to play. If necessary, some membership fees can be collected. This would truly benefit us young people immensely, and it would also create a popular avenue for sports. It is truly a win-win situation. Why not do it?

In addition, I would like to introduce two venues specifically for playing badminton for enthusiasts to inquire about: The first is the Youth Association Fitness Center on Difeng Road (near Haige Road), which is specifically set up for badminton enthusiasts. The membership fee is also affordable, two hundred yuan for a five-month term. You can practice at any time from 7:00 AM to 8:00 PM. The second is the Xiqing Badminton Court, located in the middle section of Zhao Zhujiao Road. The membership fee is one thousand yuan per year, paid in one lump sum. However, you must practice three times before joining, with a fee of thirty yuan per session. I believe there are many other venues as well! Please inform fellow enthusiasts so that they know where to inquire. A badminton enthusiast.

### Mourning Mr. Qian Yunhe

— Rui Hongchu

Another Talent Lost in the Literary and Art World

Mr. Qian Bingxun, from Wuxi, Zhejiang Province, changed his name to Yunhe. He had a passion for reviving the country. Early in his career, he presided over the press, staying in Jinling without seeking fame. He constantly devoted his efforts to promoting revolution. Later, he indulged in painting, poetry, and wine, often associating with comrades of the Party and the nation. Since the war, Mr. Qian, along with his wife, grandchildren, and others, resided in Shanghai, making a living by writing and selling calligraphy. He was full of spirit and content. The year before last, Mr. Qian resumed swimming, writing many poems, and his excellent works were widely circulated. Last winter, Mr. Qian and his wife fell ill. This newspaper once reported that Qian Yunhe needed financial assistance due to illness. Unexpectedly, medicine proved ineffective for his wife, and she passed away to the heavenly abode. Mr. Qian turned weakness into strength and recovered his health. However, Mr. Qian mourned his deceased wife deeply, causing his heart to become ill. Doctors were helpless, and he passed away on April 24th, at the age of sixty-six. The sad news spread, and everyone, whether they knew him or not, cried out in unison. Alas! It has only been a short time since the passing of Mrs. Qian, and now Mr. Qian has bid farewell to the world forever. It can be said that they returned to the west together.

During his lifetime, Mr. Qian had an inseparable friendship with the poet Zhizhi Jushi for thirty years. Jushi wrote four quatrains in seven-character lines mourning Mr. Qian Yunhe: "We have been destined to meet for thirty years, I admire your wisdom and virtue despite the age gap. Your purity is worthy of a crane in the clouds, leaving only calligraphy and paintings." "Admiring the solitary orchid, you lightly dismissed the carriage, now you become an old master in the world. An endless regret like the flute on the Yangshan, Du Fu's voice wrapped in rain like silk." "Living in seclusion on the sea, your talent is hidden, the elegy for your deceased wife was deeply sad. It is most pitiful that in your old age, you faced hardship, and your Vimalakirti-like sick body eventually broke down." "You are a predecessor in the literary and art world, your morality and writing enlighten future generations. Your son is traveling far and has not returned, and the grief and feelings are truly heartbreaking." I am attaching this short article to inform Mr. Qian's relatives and clansmen.

Using Pig Lung to Treat Heart Pain

After reading the Social Services section of your newspaper a few days ago, Mr. Lu Wenzhong vaguely requested a good remedy for heart pain. The symptoms described were exactly the same as my mother's. I have obtained a remedy from various sources, which I describe below. Although my mother is still trying it, I dare not be arbitrary about its effectiveness. However, taking it according to the recipe is beneficial and harmless, so you might as well give it a try.

Method: Prepare a fresh, healthy pig lung, wash it clean, and peel off the thin layer of skin. First, burn it in a pot (without adding water), then add ten taels of good Shaoxing wine, place it in a medicine pot, and simmer over a low flame for about three or four hours until cooked. Add six taels of rock sugar and simmer for another twenty minutes until fragrant. After ten minutes, take it out and it is ready to eat.

Dosage: Take it twice with wine. Be sure to avoid any meat, and eat another pig lung every three or four days. Eat four in total, and it will never recur. Zhang Shanyang Qiqi. Also, Mr. Qian Qiqiu of Xie Xinghong Timber Shop, No. 14 Yuxing Road, Fujian Road intersection, Nanjing Road, has a unique prescription. Because the preparation procedure is troublesome, it cannot be described in detail in writing. I can only tell you in person. I hope Mr. Lu can see the newspaper and go to contact him.

Children's Concert The Shanghai Conservatory of Music, a private school, is scheduled to hold a children's popular music concert at the Eight Power Youth Association at 5:30 pm on the 12th of this month. The program includes piano performances, all performed by students of the school aged five to fifteen. Tickets are priced at thirty yuan and fifty yuan in two kinds. They are already on pre-sale at the Youth Association and various piano stores. All ticket proceeds will be donated to orphanages.

Lost Citizen's Certificate Yang Bingxing reported losing a citizen's certificate (number 197707). If anyone finds it, please send it to No. 41 Tiancheng Lane, Yingmai Xiyang Road, and there will be a considerable reward.

### Shura (6) The Navy

— Iwata Toyo Hongyang Translation

(Damn it!)

Although he was very frugal, the money he had brought with him melted and disappeared quickly, like a snowman under the sunlight, and there was really no way to resist it.

In Tokyo, everything can be calculated with money, he discovered this crucial point. Although he was deeply disappointed, he also felt terrified in his heart. In a few days, he became a penniless pauper. When he thought about being abandoned on the roadside and dying in a ditch, he couldn't help but tremble with fear.

He thought about writing a letter to his sister. Now, compared to when he first arrived in the capital, his body felt even weaker and more powerless.

At that time, the suicide of his friend, which the number four student at Etajima experienced, was not something that had not entered the heart of Ryu Fu, it wasn't as if he hadn't thought about suicide.

Although he was in such a painful situation, when he heard about the opening of the Imperial Exhibition, he still had the enthusiasm to go to the Ueno Art Museum. He had already visited the Science and Engineering Museum, but the Imperial Exhibition was a first for him.

He paused briefly in front of the exhibition of Japanese calligraphy and then went to the Western painting section, carefully appreciating it. He felt a deep interest in every painting. At the same time, he held a feeling of admiration for all the artists. For example, even if there were paintings he didn't like, the brushwork was always more skillful than his own, so he had no choice but to admire them. While viewing the paintings, he even forgot about himself, forgot about Tokyo, and forgot about the hotel's overdue bill.

(I'm going to have to start working soon!)

His heart was just pounding.

Suddenly, he came to a spacious, bright room. In this place, there were many works by the examiners. There was a large painting surrounded by crowds of people. Standing beside such a large painting, he felt small in comparison.

Looking closely at this large painting, he couldn't see anything new or special about it anywhere. It was a landscape painting of mountains, but in terms of the calm and elegant strokes, and in terms of the skill of the brushwork, it was a painting that everyone praised. On the painting, there was also the seal of the examiners.

Ryufu believed that it was one of his favorite paintings. Looking at the name of the artist, he cried out in his heart.

(It's Mr. Ichiki Tokujiro's work!)

He had known this artist's name for a long time. He graduated from Kagoshima Second Middle School early on, and he was a famous mountain painter both in his hometown and in Tokyo. Ichiki Tokujiro did not fit in with the martial spirit of the Second Middle School, and he looked as if he had come from a school for sculptors or dancers. However, his name was generally recognized as outstanding. Because Ichiki almost never returned to his hometown, Ryufu did not recognize him. This was the first time he had seen his works in person, apart from the three-color reproductions.
