### Social Criticism and the Three-Year Anti-Smoking Plan

— Yoshida Toyosuke

Another reader's letter received.

"Mr. Yoshida Toyosuke: It's a pity your opinions came too late! Previously, we already had our "famous scholars" like Hu Shih, advocating that Japan should use "benevolent rule" to conquer the hearts of the Chinese people. The first person to practically use "benevolent rule" to enchant the Chinese people may be you! Whether "benevolent rule" can conquer the hearts of the Chinese people is a question worth considering. Because we, the "vast people" of China, have long seen Japan's "hegemony," and though your words are sweet, who can believe they are "justice"? Do you think the Chinese masses will blindly believe your words? I'm afraid it's a fantasy! Your opinions may win the "surprise" of ordinary "petty citizens," but they have no impact on the Chinese "intellectual class," because the very nature of your opinions is contradictory and undialectical. "Benevolent rule" cannot conquer the hearts of the Chinese people, because the leaders of the Chinese nation are progressive intellectuals, and they oppose "benevolent rule." Those who believe in "benevolent rule" are merely the "Confucians," "orthodox," and "national essence faction" who have been eliminated by the times!" (Several lines of the original text have been deleted)

This letter from a reader makes a crucial mistake common to those who claim to be progressive intellectuals. If, as this reader says, Japan's policy towards China is hegemony, then those who establish benevolent rule against this hegemony are the ones who are still playing a progressive role at this stage. If it is truly as this reader says, that I am the number one advocate of benevolent rule, fighting desperately against a society rife with hegemonic evils, then this reader who attacks me from behind is naturally the "fifth column" of hegemony! Therefore, this reader may be a "progressive intellectual" in his own mind, but objectively he is helping the old bosses of opium dens, "industrial companies," and "foreign-style gambling companies," as well as the second type of pro-Japanese elements, and the second type of Japanese who collude with them, playing a counterproductive role! It's a pity that "the very nature of your opinions is contradictory and undialectical."

My work is only to contribute to the innovative critical power of East Asia. I have been writing for Shen Bao for nearly a year, and looking back on this short year, everyone can see clearly the improvement of the critical power of Chinese society, especially Shanghai society. A year ago, when I first used my pen to attack all kinds of social evils like the "second type of pro-Japanese elements," I deliberately avoided attacking the second type of Japanese. This was because the critical power in Shanghai at that time was still incomplete, and if I did not adopt the tactic of defeating them one by one, I myself would have been attacked and defeated long ago. At that time, many readers did not understand my difficulties, and only stood on the position of nationalism, writing letters to scold me: why do you only attack the second type of pro-Japanese elements, and not attack the "second type of Japanese" who collude with them? If I had not been able to resist their "incitement" at that time, and had launched an all-out attack on the degenerate Japanese, we would not have had today, and would have disappeared from the public opinion circles long ago. Therefore, this group of nationalists also played a role in "inciting" the second type of pro-Japanese elements, objectively. However, now the social critical power of Shanghai has reached an inviolable level. Moreover, the Chinese side cannot but admit the fact that the self-criticism of Japan's past policies towards China has been strengthened. For example, speeches like that of Uzu Colonel are self-criticisms that have never been heard from any officials in the past. In short, many patriots are currently worried about the current situation and earnestly state that if reforms are not made, then China, Japan, and East Asia will perish together, this is a fact.

In fact, war cannot be won without the support of this kind of social critical power. This kind of social critical power is not based on "morality" written in black and white, based on books, but must be based on the life-force morality of attacking hypocrisy. The new Japanese philosopher, Iwao Takayama, said in his work "The Driving Force of History and the Life-force of Morality": "The change of the times, if there is no definite initiation of power, or wide initiation of strength, then there has never been a precedent. Generally speaking, the driving force of history is power, and if you look at the past and present, at home and abroad, the times have all changed through many struggles and battles, this cannot but be said to be a powerful proof. Although there are those who win the world on horseback, there is no precedent for those who govern the world on horseback. Pure power struggles, even if they stir up waves within a certain era, cannot change the era and accomplish major historical missions. In the struggle for change in the new epoch, there often exists a moral spirit to realize justice, and a truly historical war must contain a moral character." We believe that the Greater East Asia War is a historical war to liberate Asia, so we say that the Greater East Asia War is of a moral character. During wartime, launching foreign-style gambling companies, absorbing floating capital (not for the national treasury, but for personal pockets), no matter who says it, has no hint of morality. Young people rise up in anger and oppose opium and gambling, which poison the nation, which is in line with morality; but knowing that opium and gambling are things that poison the nation, they deliberately maintain them in every possible way, which is immoral no matter who says it.

### The Encirclement Battle on the India-Burma Border is Entering the Final Stage; The Main Force of the British Seventh Division Has Lost More Than Half

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a certain base of the Japanese Army on the India-Burma front states that Japanese Army units on the Burma-India border have encircled the British-Indian Army's Seventh Division, centered on Nagadekan, in front of Bukiton Mendo, and are continuing to attack it day after day, gradually compressing the encirclement, so the enemy army has become a bird in a cage. Due to the continuous bombardment and fierce attacks by the Japanese army, the enemy army in the encirclement has now been reduced to 3,000 men, and the enemy's mechanized units, equipped with tanks and automobiles, have also gradually tended to collapse. On the contrary, the damage on the Japanese side is extremely slight, which makes the morale of the Japanese army even more vigorous. In addition, the enemy's 821st Division, dispatched from West Asia, detoured north and south, and arrived at a location twenty miles north of Nagadekan from the Kaladan River Valley, and it seems to be starting to build bases there. Therefore, the encirclement battle on the India-Burma border will enter the final stage here.

Rangoon, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Army on the India-Burma border is currently carrying out annihilation battles against the British-Indian Seventh Division and the British Fifth Division, centered on the Mayu Mountains. The battle situation up to the evening of the 24th is recorded as follows: The main force of the enemy's Seventh Division has been pursued by the Japanese army to the Xinzeva Basin, and half of it has been defeated by the Japanese army. The remaining 3,000 men, now carrying a number of tanks and more than ten heavy artillery pieces, are wandering around the area, looking for a way out. The Japanese army is intensifying the siege. On the Bukiton front on the banks of the Mayu River, although the morale of the enemy forces on the front of Tekuk Tokkit has been lost, they have not launched an offensive against the Japanese army. The Japanese army has carried out night attacks on the enemy's western highlands on the northwestern side of Bukiton, which are controlled by the enemy, for days. The fall of these highlands is only a matter of time. There is no change in the battle situation in the Mendo area, but after the Japanese army north of Lhasa Bill launched an offensive, the enemy army felt it difficult to cope, and its tank fleet seems to have retreated.

### Profiteering Merchants Hoard and Speculate, Chongqing Prices Soar, Mainland Industrial Policy Fails

Beiping, 26th (Central News Agency) - Chongqing's prices are rising daily due to hoarding and speculation by corrupt officials and profiteering merchants. The prices of rice, meat, tea, etc. in Chongqing and Kunming have recently risen by 50% or more in one month. The most serious of these are monopoly products, agricultural products, and daily necessities. The rise in food prices is also extremely significant. This is due to the collusion between a few profiteering merchants and officials to hoard and monopolize. The people under the rule of the surrendered side are living increasingly difficult lives, so recently there have been many who have moved to peaceful areas. In order to prevent this, the Military Commission has issued a surrender order prohibiting the export of food products to the war zones, and stipulates that even the wheat flour and oil, etc., which are immediately provided for military needs, must be approved by the local chief. Those who violate this will be punished with death or life imprisonment. However, due to the inflation of currency and the lack of materials, the economic situation in Chongqing is becoming more and more difficult, and it is natural for the people under the rule of Chongqing to be unable to bear the suffering. According to the investigation, the price index of the main items in Chongqing and Kunming in December of the 32nd year of the Republic of China was two hundred and seventeen times higher than that in the 26th year of the Republic of China, and Kunming was two hundred and sixty times higher."

Guangzhou, 26th (Central News Agency) - Chongqing has recently frequently reported the success of the mainland's industrial policy. Since the establishment of the self-reliance and resistance posture, it has been used to deceive the people under its rule who are tired of war. However, Chongqing's Ta Kung Pao recently published an article "Review of Financial and Economic Policies," denouncing the failure of Chongqing's industrial policy, the main points of which are: Chongqing's current industrial policy has not only failed to develop industry, but has made industry even more depressed. The opposition between commercial banks and the rampant high interest rates have affected the ineffectiveness of the industrial policy, and self-reliance and resistance have shown flaws. In addition, the extraction of industrial profits under the pretext of increasing tax policies is especially something that we cannot ignore. Recently, industrial capital has shown a tendency to shift to commercial capital, so bankruptcies in the industrial sector have emerged one after another, and general floating capital is still ignoring this crisis and engaging in the most unhealthy land speculation and gold sales. Industry is the center of self-reliance and resistance. If there is no hope for development, there is no bright future for the war of resistance.

### The United States Expresses Concern over the Political Development in Argentina; Farrell Currently Holds the Argentine Presidential Powers

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - Soviet News Agency, Washington: There is very little news from the capital of Argentina. It seems to be a fact that General Farrell has taken office as president, but because the national essence faction has seized special privileges, the central figure in the new government may still be Labor Minister Colonel Pelon. The U.S. State Department met with reporters on the 25th and said that the domestic situation in Argentina is quite worrying and may affect the security of the Western Hemisphere. Therefore, the governments of the Americas must convene a diplomatic conference to decide on a common policy.

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - News from the capital of Argentina: Although Vice President Farrell has not obtained the title of President of Argentina, former President Ramirez's official duties have been fully received by Farrell. According to Farrell last night, his position is only temporary, pending Ramirez's recovery. However, it was previously rumored that Ramirez had resigned. According to the new Secretary of the Presidential Office, Dubb, this is only a temporary exercise of power, but he also hinted at changes in the cabinet. Since Farrell took office, the numerous new changes in Argentina after its break with the Axis powers can be said to have reached their highest point.

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to the International Intelligence Office, which is close to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published on Friday: Argentina's actions to sever relations with the Axis powers have failed to achieve peace in Argentina. The joint pressure from Britain and the United States on Argentina continues unabated.

### German Ambassador to Japan, Stahmer, Talks About His Impressions of Inspecting the South

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - German Ambassador to Japan, Stahmer, traveled to various places in the South to inspect the local situation. After more than a month, he returned here yesterday. The Ambassador received a delegation of reporters today, and was immediately asked about his impressions of this trip. The Ambassador signed his reply as follows: I went to Malaysia, Java, Celebes, and the Philippines from Tokyo on January 28 to understand the situation in various places in the South. The three things that impressed me the most were: 1. The defense of the occupied areas has been strengthened quickly and is quite solid. The Japanese soldiers in various places are full of the will to crush the enemy's counterattack. 2. There has been considerable progress in the restoration of the economy and industry in various places. I was very impressed by the richness of the resources and food in the South. Japan has achieved great success in the utilization of these raw materials. Local industries have set up quinine factories, sugar factories, shipyards, and tin smelting factories, etc. Each factory is working hard to increase production, making great contributions to the completion of the war. 3. The feelings between the Japanese army and the local residents are extremely harmonious, and the local residents understand Japan's Greater East Asia ideal and are willing to work hard to complete this war. I visited Thailand and the Philippines, and the impressions I received were very good. Their industrial and food problems are also being solved in line with the goal of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In short, Japan today has realized the ideal of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere that it advocates, based on the spirit of the Tripartite Pact, and I am very satisfied with this.

### US Tax Increase Bill Becomes Law

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington: The US Senate yesterday, following the House of Representatives, rejected President Roosevelt's rejection of the new tax bill. The new tax bill has now become law. The original intention of this bill was to increase new tax revenues of 1.05 billion yuan, but Congress has significantly reduced it, by about one-fifth of the original amount. According to a British reporter stationed in New York, Congress maintained its legislative independence and overturned the President's rejection in a way that clearly left a way out for the President to take the next step. If President Roosevelt cannot compromise with Congress in the future, the current opposition force in Congress is sufficient to overturn all the legislative procedures he proposed in his annual address, including the extension of the Economic Stabilization Act (which expired last month), the Military Voting Act, and the Food Subsidy Act.

Stockholm, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) -- German News Agency reports that according to an official announcement by the Ministry of Defense here, the bombs dropped by Allied aircraft in Helsingborg (southern Sweden) have been proven to be magnetic mines. Eight of these mines have now been discovered, and military engineers have destroyed them. The mines have British markings. A Swedish newspaper commented on this violation of Swedish neutrality, stating that foreign aircraft clearly intended to cut off traffic between Helsingborg and Helsingør. It also reported that Allied aircraft violated Swedish neutrality again last night, with ten to twenty foreign aircraft entering Swedish airspace along the west coast of Åhus in southern Sweden and flying eastward, then flying away south and southeast of Åhus. Anti-aircraft guns fired in several locations.

### Japanese Women's Volunteer Corps Cooperate to Increase Production

The Japanese Women's Volunteer Corps, determined to increase production, are joining factory work one after another. On January 8, the Nakajima Aircraft Factory also welcomed the first batch of volunteer corps. The young women and students enthusiastically took up their work machines.

Below is a transcript of a conversation on various issues regarding the Women's Volunteer Corps joining the production line. Participants in the conversation were Takeo Hattori, Chief of the Labor Section of the Nakajima Aircraft Factory, Ushio Mizobe, Yasuyuki Ito, and Ms. Yu Hayashi of the Education Section.

Accelerated Technical Training

Q: What is the content of the Women's Volunteer Corps' work?

A: The Volunteer Corps are different from ordinary female workers, and we do not expect them to become skilled workers. Therefore, we only aim to train them to become skilled workers and provide them with education and guidance. Most of the members of the Volunteer Corps have their original mission in their families, and their time working outside the home is short, so the vocational guidance is naturally different. Judging from the factory's performance, the average length of service for women is generally two and a half to three years, which seems to be able to withstand considerable labor. The work is to first let them get used to factory life, and then assign them to light suspension work, such as painting seams, parts (flat planing, disc pressing), instrument design, nailing, and airframe allocation. Mechanical assembly and engines are currently men's work, but in the near future, female workers will account for 20% to 70% of mechanical assembly, and 40% of engines. If they become more skilled, then nailing and airframe assembly will also be done mostly by women. As for administrative work, of course, we will use women as much as possible. Currently, 20% of the men engaged in administrative work have been reassigned to the factory. The Women's Volunteer Corps have taken over their jobs and have performed well.

Q: What methods are used for on-the-job guidance?

A: The Youth School's practical training workshop is advanced. Basic work training is done using equipment similar to that of a formal factory. There are also lectures and spiritual training to cultivate a "workplace spirit." After receiving skills guidance and spiritual guidance, they live in the factory. Factory life can be regarded as an extension of the "window study workshop." The factory is equipped with instructors of similar age to provide on-the-job guidance because the work is simple, so it is easy to remember. After one week of "practical training workshop," the first term ends. The Ministry of Health and Welfare has changed the period for training a worker from three months to one month in the past. It sounds like a stretch, but with enthusiasm, one month can also be successful. After one year, any member of the Volunteer Corps can become an excellent skilled worker, which is very important in increasing production. However, if there is an idea that "a job will only be good after one year," then not only is the skill ruined, but also from the standpoint of increasing aircraft production, it is a difficulty. This is something we hope the members who are now joining will understand.

The Work Done by Women

Q: What kind of work is suitable for young women?

A: In the manufacturing of aircraft, there are simple and difficult tasks. In general, there is a lot of work suitable for women, and there is also a lot of work that is more suitable for women than men. For example, wiring, gas welding, rubber welding, painting, etc., female workers perform better. Especially wiring (carrying wiring), if one wire is wrong, it can cause serious accidents, so it requires careful and skillful women. Painting is also sewing stitch by stitch. If one stitch is wrong, it can sometimes cause the aircraft to disintegrate in the air, so it must be sewn carefully and seriously. For this kind of work, we are currently assigning instructors who have been tempered in the factory for many years, and in the future, we plan to have all of them guided by women, while men will switch to other work. The coloring of machine parts is currently all done by men, but in the future, it will also be done by female workers.

Q: What is the Women's Volunteer Corps' research interest in aircraft?

A: It seems that they have not yet had a real interest and research mind since they were assigned to the factory. A few days ago, we invited representatives from each Volunteer Corps to hold a discussion. At that time, the members expressed their feelings, saying: "Although we heard about the 'air war' at home and at school, we did not think about it deeply. But once we personally participated in the manufacturing of aircraft, we painfully realized that the bloody battles in the distant sky are vividly in front of us, and we must hurry up and build these aircraft as much as possible." Indeed, since the young girls joined, they have seen flying aircraft and many airframes every day, and their view of the war has also changed. A member of the airframe assembly corps said: Seeing the aircraft we made, and thinking that we women can also make aircraft, I feel very honored, and whenever I think that we can also contribute a little bit, tears often fill my eyes.

Q: How are commuting and factory discipline issues handled?

A: The Women's Volunteer Corps is divided into commuters who live at home and boarders who live in dormitories. The boarding members are far away from home and their family circumstances are not suitable for commuting. Their lives are similar to the boarding life of a girls' school. There are strict dormitory supervisors in the dormitories, so there is no need to worry about discipline. As for the commuting members, the working hours are always thirty minutes later than ordinary workers to avoid mixing with them on trains and buses. If the time is the same, then men and women are separated into different cars, directed by the Transportation Self-Government Association, or gathered separately by school and region, and ride in groups. Therefore, there is absolutely nothing to worry the family about. We hope that families and schools will understand and feel at ease on this point. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, January 31)

### Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters Promotes Use of Air Defense Clothing; Air Defense Clothing Symposium Held Yesterday

Central News Agency dispatch: In order to cultivate Shanghai citizens' air defense awareness and make it easier to cope with air defense measures in the event of an air raid, the Shanghai Special City Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters held a symposium on Chinese citizens' air defense clothing at the Douchang Hotel at 3 PM yesterday. Present were Deputy Director Noguchi Kinjiro of the General Affairs Department of the Headquarters, Section Chief Okawa Rinpei of the Police Defense Department, Chief Ide Kiyomi of the Fire Department, Deputy Director Nagai Isamu of the Health Department, Head of the Propaganda Section of the General Affairs Department Hayashida Shigemi, Ikeda Kazuo, Chen Gongzhan, Head of the Liaison Section Hirayama, Xie Riben of Wing On Company, Cai Bosen of Sun Sun Company, Xia Huilin of Sincere Company, and dozens of reporters from various newspapers. Chairman Kou presided over the meeting and reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that during the various air defense drills held on Air Defense Day on February 9, the results were excellent, but the Chinese people had not paid attention to air defense clothing and had not made any preparations. This poses a great danger to covering the whole body and preventing injuries. Air defense clothing can prevent burns and minor injuries, and facilitate air defense measures, so we want to arouse public attention and prepare air defense clothing. However, the principles for clothing should be lightweight, economical, and suitable for all seasons. Today, we would like to invite everyone to express their opinions so that we can arouse the city's Chinese citizens to use air defense clothing during the third air defense day on March 9, etc. The attendees exchanged opinions, and the conclusion was: the material should be cheap and economical, and old clothes should be used as much as possible to transform air defense clothing. Add long sleeves, gloves, long trousers, or leather legs, thick machines, and use women's rain hats, and fold them in half to make air defense hats. However, take mobility into account, add buttons, and usually put the air defense clothing in an air defense bag and carry it with you, so that it can be taken out and used immediately in the event of an air raid. Also, men's long robes and women's cheongsams can be equipped with belts, and when the air raid occurs, the long robes can be folded and tied high to take various air defense measures. The above-mentioned measures will be used by the department to use newspapers, or post slogans, and use radio propaganda to arouse public attention in manufacturing. The best use of old materials for the required materials, and when necessary, the department will discuss proper distribution methods with the allocation authorities. Several air defense clothing patterns drawn by Ms. Qiu of the Social Welfare Department were distributed during the meeting.

### Weekly Review (Continued from First Page)

The second type of pro-Japanese faction and the second type of Japanese, under bizarre names, engage in special trade, only acting as intermediaries for others, accepting illegal extra money, and creating factors that lead to high prices. This cannot be said to be moral. If we do not fight these bad labor forces to the death, then we will never be able to achieve victory in the historic war. In order to win such a historic war as the Greater East Asia War, we need to resolutely and without delay strike against such bad forces within. Only when the Greater East Asia War becomes a war of reform for the entire Asia and demonstrates a moral character, can all Asian nations participate joyfully, and then the Greater East Asia War can obtain the historical character of a truly Asian liberation war.

As for China's participation in the war, if there is no recent social criticism in Shanghai and Nanjing, and it is simply viewed from a force perspective, it can be said to be completely like a fart. Because when participating in the war, it will make a loud noise, but the content of participating in the war is just like empty gas, and the socially smelly and unbearable ugliness after participating in the war is infuriating. Is this not a fart? However, during this year, due to the social criticism brewed up by people from both China and Japan, especially young people, who are dissatisfied with the current situation in China, the meaning of world history is being adorned on China's participation in the war itself. This is to say that China's participation in the war is not only to reform China, but also to reform the entire East Asia, and has the nature of completing the moral character of the Greater East Asia War. The recent social criticism in New China cannot but be regarded as such. If this kind of social criticism does not increase, then there will be no talk of the Three Bans Movement, nor will there be any promulgation of the Price Control Law and the Company Elimination Order, and if there is no encouragement and instigation of this kind of criticism, the three-year plan to ban opium will never be put on the agenda. This series of decrees is all squeezed out by the emerging social criticism in New China. For this point, those "pavilion" politicians who know politics in concept but not in practice may say: No matter how these decrees are promulgated, in the end, under the economic pressure in China, they will become useless like the hoarding control order. If China does not have social criticism, and these excellent young political commentators only know how to criticize this kind of social criticism, but do not know how to participate in this kind of social criticism, then, just as these people say, any decree will become useless. However, if these people all rise up and participate in this kind of social criticism, and strive to correct politics and eliminate the bad, then even if some people fundamentally want to make the decrees useless and realize the situation of uselessness, it will not be possible.

The three-year plan to ban opium that was announced this time was decided based on the social criticism that developed in Shanghai. This point cannot but be acknowledged as having tremendous significance. The government attaches importance to this kind of social criticism, which can be said to be the most enlightened policy recently. Naturally, the government has full determination to faithfully implement this three-year plan. The social criticism in New China, especially the criticism in Shanghai, in order to assist and encourage the government's determination, must offer loyal advice without fear of being tedious. Because the bad forces that do not accept this social criticism still occupy strong ground and are constantly moving to guide the government's policies astray. In short, this three-year plan to ban opium is the touchstone of whether China's participation in the war can have a truly "moral character." However, I dare to assert that China's excellent youth will break through this test, and then adorn the Greater East Asia War with moral character. This is China's greatest contribution to world history. (Lu Translation)

### Simple Treatment for Meningitis

In the early stage of meningitis, there is headache, shortness of breath in the chest, and stiff neck. Then there is opisthotonos and coma. This is a dangerous symptom. Those who suffer from this symptom have swelling of the head due to heat, and the root has been damaged. Recently, a Chinese medicine doctor invented the most economical, most effective, fastest, and safest treatment method. A child of 14 years old occasionally felt unwell, with only headache and chest tightness at first. The next day, he had a stiff neck, his eyes rolled upwards, and he was unable to recognize colors. His mind was confused, and he was bedridden. After asking Chinese and Western doctors for diagnosis and treatment, none of them worked. Later, he was sent to a certain hospital in Xuzhou, where he was diagnosed with meningitis. He was immediately prescribed medicine injections, totaling dozens of injections. Just when the hospital's stock of medicine was running out and everyone was panicking, a friend came and taught him a method. Use calcined ferrous sulfate until it has efficacy, grind it into a fine powder, and sieve it. If the patient has a headache on the left side, blow some ferrous sulfate powder into the right nostril. If the headache is on the right side, blow it into the left nostril. If the head hurts on both sides, blow it into both nostrils. After two or three minutes, the chest will feel clear and refreshed, which is the effect. Next, the head and eyes will be clear. Afterwards, continue to try blowing it. In one or two days, the illness was completely cured. The son of friend Mr. Li suffered from this symptom, and after trying it, he also recovered suddenly. After recovery, there was no suffering from numbness in the five senses. Later, after studying this matter with [missing character] Qi Huang surgeons, it was said that ferrous sulfate has astringent properties and can astringe the ripeness of the brain [missing character] to make it divination. The blood clots that flow from the nostrils are ripe poison. This medicine is sour, cool, and non-toxic. It is a product for resolving phlegm and detoxification, and it strengthens the accumulation of blood. Northern doctors use this to rescue many people, and they also sent this medicine to a German doctor in Jinmen. After chemical experimentation, the reply letter was very appreciative, which is a highlight for the national medical community. Another prescription: almonds, peach kernels, glutinous rice, pepper (if not, replace with scallion white), and raw gardenia seeds, each coin. Crush them together, and use egg white to mix with more flour to make a paste. Apply the above two prescriptions and fight on the inside of the Nie family's Applied Good Prescription. Recently, meningitis has been prevalent in various places such as Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Xiaoshan, and Linpu, and many people have died. These two prescriptions are simple and easy to implement, and can be used at the same time. In closed areas in rural areas where there is no good treatment method, it may be worth trying.
