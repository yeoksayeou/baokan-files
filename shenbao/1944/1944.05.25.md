### Strengthening Personnel

In order to enhance wartime administrative efficiency, the government recently announced a plan to reform provincial administrative organs, close down the Shanghai offices of various ministries, and merge the food bureaus of various special municipalities into the economic bureaus. At the same time, it is heard that the government will, on the one hand, eliminate redundant and idle civil servants from its affiliated agencies and, on the other hand, increase their salaries. From the point of view of enhancing wartime administrative efficiency, this is indeed a wise and appropriate measure. In the midst of rising prices, simplifying administration on the one hand and improving the treatment of civil servants on the other are indeed beneficial to the reform of politics.

Although poor political systems and duplicate administrative organs are all causes that prevent politics from getting on the right track, the main cause is still "unsound personnel." Therefore, even with excellent systems and rigorous institutions, if there are no sound personnel to promote and implement them, the results will still be in vain. All systems are originally dead, and all institutions are originally empty. For example, the theories and systems of controlled economy are all very correct. Especially in wartime, controlled economy is even more important. It goes without saying that countries such as China, Japan, and Germany have adopted it, but even countries such as Britain and the United States, which have always been liberal economies, have had to adopt controlled policies. However, once the theories and systems of controlled economy are implemented in China, the situation is completely different. Some corrupt officials regard controlled economy as an opportunity to seize real economic power and consider it a shortcut to wealth, so that some people who manage control have filled their pockets in a short period of time, while those who are controlled are increasingly oppressed and complain. However, the original purpose of the controlled economy was to evenly distribute essential goods and stabilize the lives of the people in wartime, but now the facts are completely contrary to the purpose, with disadvantages but no advantages. May I ask: Why can controlled economy work in Germany? Why can the rationing system be done well in Japan? And why is it counterproductive in China? This is not because the theory of controlled economy is wrong, nor is it because the rationing system itself is bad. The crux of the problem lies in unsound personnel. This is the case with controlled economy, and the same is true with other political issues.

A recent editorial in the *Continental News* discussed the National Government's efforts to reform officialdom and was quite incisive. It said: "First, implement the simplification of administrative organs, reduce redundant personnel, and on the other hand, improve the treatment of capable civil servants, then it will not be difficult to restore their vigorous spirit of doing things. But it is a big mistake to hope that simply improving treatment will automatically reform officialdom. Improving treatment, although a condition and prerequisite for improving administrative efficiency, cannot be entirely relied upon. On the one hand, we must pursue the responsibilities of officials, implement the policy of clear rewards and punishments, and then the reform of officialdom can be fully realized. It can be said that now is an excellent time to establish this atmosphere." This is exactly the same as what we have always advocated.

We have always believed that "strengthening personnel" is a prerequisite for reforming the new officialdom and improving administrative efficiency, and improving treatment is only one point in strengthening personnel. Secondly, adopting talent-based principles, pursuing the responsibilities of officials, and implementing the policy of certain punishment are all extremely important items that must be completely reversed. We hope that the government will pay attention to the comprehensive methods of strengthening personnel when it seeks to enhance wartime administrative efficiency.

Editorial Commentary

### The National Government Refreshes Officialdom

The National Government is studying specific plans based on the original proposal of the Ministry of Finance to improve the treatment of officials, and is considering a system of providing salaries in kind such as rice and grain. There is no better way to maintain the value of the reserve coupons, and in the current situation of endless price increases, price salaries can be said to be the most practical method. However, it is very difficult to implement, and the authorities should carefully study and fully prepare. In short, the National Government is merging central government offices, abolishing Shanghai offices, simplifying provincial administrative organs, and starting to reorganize the central and local administrations; at the same time, it is also improving the treatment of school teachers and staff and stabilizing the lives of civil servants. This is a welcome phenomenon. Without guaranteeing the lives of civil servants, there is no talk of clean politics or responsible politics.

We take this opportunity to sincerely hope that the National Government will more thoroughly simplify the administrative organs and increase administrative efficiency. Whether in the central or local government, there are still quite a few government offices, institutions, and offices that have a sign but no actual activity. The era of using complete institutions to show the majesty of the central government has passed. Now is the time to earnestly request that the actual situation in China be taken into account and that simple and efficient administrative operations be implemented. We must eliminate favoritism and reorganize with the administrative organs of the National Government as the center. At the same time, we cannot adopt slightly bold and effective methods in the execution of affairs. Is it not a tendency to waste energy to spend days in paperwork with so-called red tape, and to draft and exchange formal documents? The simplification of administrative organs must be accompanied by increased administrative efficiency to be meaningful. The National Government seems to need to think deeply about this point as well.

In short, it is most urgent at present to invigorate an atmosphere of active activity among officials and to instill a strong sense of responsibility. It is unreasonable to treat civil servants with such poor conditions and demand activity and responsibility from them as before. First, implement the simplification of administrative organs, reduce redundant personnel, and on the other hand, improve the treatment of capable civil servants, then it will not be difficult to restore their vigorous spirit of doing things. But it is a big mistake to hope that simply improving treatment will automatically reform officialdom. Improving treatment, although a condition and prerequisite for improving administrative efficiency, cannot be entirely relied upon. On the one hand, we must pursue the responsibilities of officials, implement the policy of clear rewards and punishments, and then the reform of officialdom can be fully realized. It can be said that now is an excellent time to establish this atmosphere. We sincerely hope that the National Government authorities will work hard to comfort the people's hopes.

### Fierce Fighting Around Kohima Japanese Army Repels Enemy Counterattack General Nakamura Comments on the Indian Ocean War Situation

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 24th The enemy troops in Ukhrul were attacked by the Japanese army and were eager to open the last blood path. Since the 16th, the enemy has fiercely attacked the Kanglatongbi on the Kohima Highway and the eastern highlands. There were two attacks on the 16th, three on the 17th, and five on the 15th. The Japanese troops in the area fought against the many with the few, day and night, and launched continuous counterattacks, inflicting great damage on the enemy. The enemy finally collapsed and retreated. On the morning of the 19th, five enemy tanks were destroyed in the northern highlands of Kanglatongbi, and ten other tanks and many heavy mortars were also destroyed. The enemy's counterattack attempts were all crushed.

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 24th The British army is trying to actively break through Dimapur in order to rescue the Fourth Army besieged in the Imphal Basin. The Kohima-Imphal Highway has recently been reinforced in the Dimapur area. At the same time, mechanized units such as tanks, aircraft, and artillery continue to counterattack the Japanese army's positions around Kohima, especially the counterattack against the 5102 highland is the most intense. At dawn on the 19th, the enemy army launched harassing artillery from the Chotsoma Manzbuza area, and counterattacked with 19 tanks as a vanguard, but was eventually repelled by the Japanese army. The Japanese army's first-line artillery even destroyed five of its tanks. On the evening of the same day, the enemy army attacked the northwest of the highland with one heavy tank and four field guns. The Japanese army immediately fired fiercely, and the heavy tank was hit and caught fire, so the enemy's counterattack attempt was shattered. In addition, the enemy army transported tanks and artillery units by air to reinforce the 1630 highland southwest of Kohima, Narhema, and Longuzumi, in order to capture Kohima. Fierce fighting is currently taking place in various places, but the enemy has been frustrated due to the fierce attack of the Japanese army.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th When Japanese Navy General Chosaburo Nakamura met with reporters, he talked about Mountbatten's Indian Ocean operations and said that after the rainy season, the operations in India and Burma will shift from land to sea. The main points of his discussion are as follows: In addition to the Pacific operations, the United States also hopes to open the Chongqing highway through India. At the same time, it also attempts to launch mobile units to form a central offensive route through the Philippines to the Chinese mainland. Britain had programmed the Southeast Pacific Army under Mountbatten several months ago, but to this day, what it has implemented is only small-scale vanguard battles. However, if the land battle turns into a stalemate during the rainy season, the activities of the naval forces will be more active. Although the strength of the enemy fleet in India is not known in detail, it is said to be a fleet based on three or four battleships. In the future, some may be transferred from the Mediterranean. It is difficult to operate with such a small fleet. Mountbatten cannot issue orders to operate. Although the United States has repeatedly requested it, its future activities will still be difficult to exceed small-scale actions such as air raids on Surabaya. The activities of Mountbatten's army are closely related to the formation of the European Second Front. He cannot ignore the Second Front. The opening and closing of the European Second Front must not be interrupted. At that time, most of the British forces will be devoted to this battle. From the point of view of British selfishness, the naval operations in East Asia will be entirely entrusted to the United States. If the Second Front is postponed again, Mountbatten's army may start a sensation within the scope of its strength. In short, the strength of the British Navy in the Indian Ocean is not very sound, and the enemy's sensation is not worth worrying about. This is the same as the enemy's operations in the Aleutian Islands in the north. It is difficult to achieve more than a diversionary effect, so the Japanese army is not worried under its strong defense.

### Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry Gives Preferential Treatment to International Students

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th The Greater East Asia Ministry has decided to increase the supply of fats and other side dishes to international students from various countries in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere from the beginning of May, in addition to the prescribed food and vegetables, and adapt to the habits of each country. Aoki, Minister of the Greater East Asia, visited the International Student Friendship Association (South), the Japan-China Society (China), the Zenrin Society (Mongolia), and the Japan-Thailand College (Thailand, India, etc.) on the 17th and 18th to guide the organs and inspect the lives of international students. At the same time, he summoned the international students of the three groups to give lectures, the general idea being: It is hoped that the students will study their studies on the one hand, and on the other hand, they must recognize the true rule of Japan, so that Japan and the countries of Greater East Asia can cooperate closely. Although there are various inconveniences due to material relations, Japan will overcome these difficulties. Japan has gone through hardships to liberate East Asia, and you must deeply recognize its spirit.

### Japanese Undersea Tunnel Double-Track Construction Project Decided to be Completed Ahead of Schedule

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th The double-track work of the undersea railway tunnel between Shimonoseki and Moji in Japan was rapidly carried out with the goal of opening on October 1st. However, due to the urgent request for the transportation of important materials, it has now been decided to open it ahead of schedule. The work is currently being stepped up. The new line penetration work in the laying of the track is scheduled to be completed in mid-August, and operations will begin immediately. At the same time, other works on the existing tunnel track will be completed within one month, so the long-awaited double-track opening line will start operating on September 25. Efforts are now being made to speed up the work.

### Thailand's New Capital Under Active Construction Agricultural Products are Also Striving to Increase Production

Central News Agency, Bangkok, 24th The groundbreaking ceremony of Thailand's new capital, Phetchabun, was held solemnly at the end of last month in the presence of Prime Minister Pipon and his wife. Phetchabun is about 300 kilometers north of Bangkok, slightly in the central part of Thailand, surrounded by mountains on the east, west, and north sides. It is a basin that is 100 kilometers long from north to south and 30 kilometers long from east to west. The new capital of Thailand is being built in a scattered manner in this area. According to the old

Phetchabun

It was only a small mountain village, but after being laid as the new capital, residents from all over the world have successively moved in. Now the number of residents has reached 50,000. A highway with a width of 7 meters has been completed, starting from the Sabangbin Station of the Bangkok-Chiang Mai Railway. In addition, highways are also being built in various places. According to the Phetchabun City authorities, in order to prepare for future population growth, they are working hard to increase agricultural production. The soil is quite suitable for growing sugarcane, rice, corn, and cultivating tobacco fruits. In addition, the construction of factories such as electric lights, tap water, and ice making is also gradually becoming concrete, and a weekly newspaper has been published since April 3. It is said that all political, military, and economic organs concentrated in Bangkok will be moved to Phetchabun. Although it is impossible in fact, the Thai government is very enthusiastic about the construction of the new capital, and its future development is really worth looking forward to.

### Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce Establishes Food Production Increase Department Gathering Government and Civilian Forces to Thoroughly Achieve the Goal

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce has decided to establish a wartime food production increase headquarters in the province and local government offices in order to gather the total power of the government and civilians to thoroughly achieve the goal of increasing food production. Regarding this matter, at the cabinet meeting on the 23rd, Agriculture and Commerce Minister Uchida reported as follows: The increase headquarters will be set up in the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, and the local headquarters will be set up in the local government offices. The Minister of Agriculture and Commerce will serve as the Minister of the Central Headquarters, and the local governors will serve as the Minister of the Local Headquarters. The main task of the Central Headquarters is to seek the flexibility of technical guidance and the implementation of Li Li's mobilization plan. At the same time, it will unite with the Agricultural Patriotic Alliance to carry out joint activities, and the Agricultural Patriotic Team will also be placed under the command of the Minister to tighten the work. On the one hand, in order to consult with the relevant authorities of other ministries to promote countermeasures, a wartime food conference will be set up in the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce to review and deal with the necessary materials and distribution consumption relations for increasing production. In response to the establishment of the Wartime Food Production Increase Headquarters, the Eastern Province has organized a Food Production Student Commando, mobilizing students from five agricultural science universities and fourteen specialized schools to various farms as cadres of the Food Production Increase Team to carry out the work of increasing production and serving the country.

### Talking About the Central Plains War Situation

— Bi Guang

A: The recent Henan war has attracted attention. Please tell us about the overall situation of the war.

B: This time, the Chongqing side has also admitted that the Henan war has suffered a major blow. From the perspective of the war situation, the most important thing is the opening and control of the entire Jinghan Line. The Japanese North China and Central China Army troops met on the 9th of this month at Queshan, a major station on the Jinghan Line. Since the North China Japanese Army started its operations, it has only been 20 days, and it has successively captured important cities such as Xiangzhou and Xuchang. The Central China Japanese Army responded to the Northern Army from Xinyang and marched north, completing the combat goal of opening the Jinghan Road in just one week. After the meeting of the Central China and North China Japanese armies, the war situation extended westward, and the Japanese army has already broken into Luoyang, and some have even passed Tongguan. The initiative in the Central Plains War has completely fallen into the hands of the Japanese army.

A: The biggest achievement of the Japanese army in this operation seems to be the impact on international politics?

B: Indeed, before the Henan war, both Chongqing and the Communists were promoting the so-called "June Counteroffensive," which had the momentum of echoing the British, American, and Chongqing troops' operations in Myanmar and the American troops' operations in the Pacific. Moreover, in fact, there have been major changes in the Chinese battlefield recently. The US Air Force in Chongqing has been strengthened, and it has been delusionally using the Chinese mainland as a base to bomb the Japanese mainland. What is particularly noteworthy is that the US Air Force, which has always focused on the construction of coastal bases in Zhejiang, Fujian, and other provinces, has recently attempted to move towards North China and the Northwest. With Lanzhou, Tianshui, Baoji, Hanzhong, and other places as rear bases, and Xi'an, Luoyang, Lushi, Ankang, Neixiang, and Laohokou as forward bases, there is a clear ambition to attack North China and then disturb the Japanese rear. After this Henan campaign, the ambition of the United States and its allies has been completely shattered, and the great impact on the international war situation can be imagined.

A: Strictly speaking from a military point of view, what is the significance of this war?

B: Shattering the so-called June counteroffensive plan is the first gain in the international situation and also in the military. Second, it proves with the fact of victory that the US Air Force in Chongqing is useless and not enough to assist the Chongqing army. Third, the "central elite" that Chongqing boasted of as "trained for several years" and "preparing for a counteroffensive" suffered a collapse. Taking only the section northwest of Dengfeng as an example, the Chongqing Eighth Fifth and Twenty-Ninth Army had a strength of more than 70,000 and were on the verge of complete annihilation. Fourth, the Japanese army occupied important military points in Henan and even the whole country? And gained the initiative in future operations. Fifth, the Communist armies have recently shown a tendency to launch large-scale guerrilla campaigns in North China. After this Henan campaign, their rear was threatened, and the New Fourth Army in Central China has always echoed the Communist Army in North China. After this Henan operation, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army have lost contact. Therefore, this battle has a decisive significance for the entire Chinese war situation.

A: Does the so-called decisive significance mean that it also has a considerable impact on politics?

B: This is also very obvious. First, in Chongqing, what has been used to maintain the morale of the people in recent years is the so-called "actively preparing for a counteroffensive" and "approaching the final victory." At the same time, with the Henan front line as a barrier, it has tried its best to plan and promote the so-called "Northwest Construction" movement, the blockade of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region of the Communist Party of China, the Chongqingization of Xinjiang's politics, and the appeasement of the Hui people in Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai are all being promoted under the instigation of Britain and the United States. In the Henan War, the Japanese army directly forced Tongguan, the screen of the Northwest has been withdrawn, and there is no more talk of "construction," and the failure of the Henan War is to shake the morale of the rear, and the mood of pessimism and despair will be stronger. Second, in the peace zone, the political field is actively expanding, including most of the fertile land of Anhui and Henan. If we start from reforming politics and improving people's livelihood, the impact will be even greater, which is enough to make the people's hearts in Chongqing tend to peace more and more.

A: I think the economic significance seems to be also very important, because the Jinghan Road has been opened, the peaceful area has been expanded, and the material exchange between Central China and North China can be promoted more smoothly and effectively. Soon after, the Yuehan Railway will be opened, and there is also considerable expectation for trade not only between Central China and South China but also with Southeast Asia.

B: As you said, the Central Plains has always been the oldest base for our nation's development, with abundant products, the most important of which are agricultural products such as wheat, soybeans, and cotton, and mineral products such as coal and other important military resources. Now the main transportation lines are in the hands of the Japanese army, and after the Japanese army occupied the Jinghan and Longhai Roads, the Yellow River water conservancy project, which has been related to the lives of tens of millions of people for many years, can be actively launched under the technical guidance and cooperation of the Allied forces. In the future, there will be greater expectations for the people's livelihood and even the economic construction of the Central Plains. Even the forgetful people in Shanghai seem to have a deep impression of the tragedy of the great drought in Henan in the winter before last and in the spring and summer of last year! We hope that the relevant authorities will seize this opportunity to make a long-term plan.

A: That's right. If the National Government can immediately promote benevolent governance under such a war record of the Japanese army, so that hundreds of millions or even tens of millions of our compatriots in the Central Plains can celebrate their rebirth and seek common restoration after natural disasters, and promote comprehensive peace, on the one hand, it can also cooperate with the Allied forces, share their labor, and complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War as soon as possible.

### The Shanghai District Rice Movement Authority Orders the Lifting of Restrictions and Plans to Formulate an Outline for Rice Measures in Beijing and Shanghai

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) - In order to regulate the people's food supply, the government's Enrichment Bureau previously stipulated restrictions on rice movement in three provinces and two cities. Since its implementation, the people's food supply has been secure. Now, as the rice purchase work of the Rice Control Association gradually progresses, and the price of rice varies greatly in different regions, the food supply for the people is not smooth. In order to eliminate this phenomenon, it is particularly necessary to balance rice prices in various regions. Therefore, the government authorities have specifically removed rice from Article 6 of the Temporary Regulations on the Restriction of Wartime Material Movement, which requires approval from the Business Control Association for materials transported to the control line in the Shanghai area, in order to ease the rice movement control of the Shanghai area's flow control line. At the same time, in order to enrich the food supply for the citizens of Beijing and Shanghai, a "Temporary Measures Outline for Rice for the Citizens of Beijing and Shanghai" has been drafted, stipulating that all rice grains transported to Beijing and Shanghai, except for those purchased by the Rice Control Association, can be freely sold, but those who illegally manipulate prices and attempt to hoard will be severely punished. This measure not only allows rice sources to be unblocked, but also allows rice prices in various regions to be reasonably regulated. In particular, it can provide an appropriate solution to the current serious food problem in Beijing and Shanghai, which is of great benefit to the stability of people's livelihoods. The authorities are also adopting the same approach in this regard, and will severely punish Japanese merchants who violate regulations. Appropriate cooperation will be provided for policies regarding China, so it is hoped that the general public and rice merchants will deeply understand the government's intentions and cooperate in implementing policies. The Rice Control Association and the Rice Grain Trade Association should further develop their self-governance spirit and engage in rice procurement work to balance supply and demand, stabilize prices, and fulfill the important task of stabilizing people's livelihoods. Regarding this matter, Vice President Zhou of the Executive Yuan and the Japanese Embassy authorities issued important statements on the 24th. The Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Dispatch Army in China, the Commander of the China Area Fleet, and the Plenipotentiary Ambassador to China also formally announced on the same day. The details are as follows:

Vice President Zhou's Statement

The government previously imposed restrictions on rice movement in three provinces and two cities in order to centrally manage and regulate the people's food supply. Now, the purchase work of the Rice Grain Control Committee is gradually progressing, and there is a need to balance rice prices in various regions. Therefore, rice has been specifically removed from Article 6 of the Temporary Regulations on the Restriction of Wartime Material Movement, which requires approval from the National Business Control Association for materials transported to the control zone in the Shanghai area. The Rice Grain Control Committee has been ordered to expand the scope of passport issuance, allowing legitimate rice merchants and farmers to transport rice smoothly. This move aims to ease the restrictions on rice movement in the Shanghai area's control line, unblock rice sources under reasonable management, and further regulate rice prices, so that farmers can concentrate on production, and both urban and rural areas can benefit. In the future, the Rice Control Association and the Rice Grain Trade Association will continue to develop their self-governance spirit and engage in rice procurement to ensure that supply and demand are balanced and prices are stable. As for the current rationing system, there is also a need for improvement. A temporary measures outline for rice for the citizens of Beijing and Shanghai has been drafted and will be implemented first in Shanghai. However, after the easing of restrictions, those who violate laws and regulations, take the opportunity to manipulate prices, seek selfish gains, and attempt to hoard will still be severely punished by the competent authorities. Once discovered, they will be severely punished according to the law. As it concerns the stability of people's livelihoods, it is hoped that the general public will understand this intention and assist the government in promoting management policies.

Kyoto and Shanghai Citizens' Temporary Food Rice Management Summary

This outline is based on the principle of unification, Yu Chongyu regulations for food rice in the two cities.

Any vendors approved by the Rice Silk Association and rice shops registered in the two cities of Kyoto and Shanghai, and nearby farmers who transport their own harvested rice to the urban area for sale, may apply to the Rice Silk Association for a passport for transporting rice. However, the Rice Silk Association will purchase rice for the military police and important industries according to the number of parts, and the number of parts to be purchased is stipulated as follows: (A) Vendors who have paid off the original Cheng Dan will be purchased 20 percent. (B) Vendors who have not paid off the original Cheng Dan will be purchased 40 percent. (C) Vendors who have not ordered Cheng Dan, or new entrants, will be purchased 30 percent. The purchase price of micro-purchased rice will be determined from time to time according to the actual cost plus reasonable profits, except as otherwise provided in item B of Article 1. Grain transported to the two cities of Kyoto and Shanghai may be bought and sold at free prices, except for those to be purchased by the Rice Silk Association. However, in order to prevent hoarding and profiteering, the scope of buying and selling shall be determined separately by the municipal government in conjunction with the Rice Silk Association.

If rice grains are transported in without a rice silk club passport, they shall be treated as private rice and punished in accordance with the central laws and regulations.

The Rice Silk Association will designate import ports in the two cities of Kyoto and Shanghai and set up temporary licensing offices. It may also temporarily issue general transport passports to rice merchants who have not applied for a passport.

The above passports shall be issued by the Rice Silk Association in accordance with the original application for the issuance of rice procurement certificates and rice transport deliberation procedures.

This outline shall be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation, and the same shall apply when modifications are made.

Statement by the Japanese Authorities

The Temporary Rules for the Movement of Goods in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River Region, promulgated on March 11, 32nd year of the Republic of China, have been amended as follows and will be implemented immediately.

In Schedule 1, Item 3, the phrase "Goods limited to be transported to the Shanghai area" shall be removed from the section "Rice" (excluding glutinous rice). In Schedule 2, the section "Moving into the Shanghai area" shall be removed from the section "2 kg of rice". May 25, 33rd year of the Republic of China. Commander-in-Chief of the China Dispatch Army, Commander of the China Area Fleet, Imperial Decree Ambassador of Great Japan.

Talks by the Japanese Embassy Authorities

In order to ease the current restrictions on the movement of goods and promote the smooth flow of goods under reasonable control, the Chinese government and the Japanese authorities have long held the same approach. As a result of the agreement between the Chinese and Japanese Wealth Bureaus, rice has been excluded from the Shanghai peripheral collection rules, so that rice transported into Shanghai can be carried out smoothly without any obstacles under the reasonable control of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Rice Control Association. It goes without saying that this will have a great effect on stabilizing people's livelihoods. However, if unscrupulous merchants take advantage of this revision of the transportation rules to speculate and hoard, or violate the control of the Chinese competent Wealth Bureau and the Rice Control Association, resulting in rising rice prices, the Chinese authorities have established decisive measures to deal with this, which is naturally the case. The Japanese authorities concerned will also adopt the same approach and will severely punish Japanese merchants who violate regulations. Appropriate cooperation will also be provided for the suppression of China. In short, it is hoped that all rice grain operators, regardless of Chinese or Japanese nationality, will understand the true meaning of this lifting of control and the great cause of the authorities and food stability.

The Bozhilov government continues to be responsible for national affairs, and the delay in the government reorganization is not related to Bulgaria's foreign policy.

### The Japanese General Headquarters Announces the Battle Results of the Japanese Army in Henan, and the Chongqing Army in Luoyang is Under Japanese Surveillance

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:30 p.m. on the 24th:

In the Henan region, the Japanese army and the powerful units of the Japanese army newly descending from Shanxi echoed each other, defeating the main force of the Chongqing First War Zone Army, and are currently continuing to fight.

Luoyang is currently under surveillance by a part of the Japanese army, and there are about three divisions of the isolated Chongqing army around the area.

Since the beginning of the operation, until May 21, the main battle results confirmed are as follows: 34,100 bodies of the Chongqing army were recovered, 9,400 prisoners were captured, 18 aircraft were shot down (3 of which are unconfirmed), 206 cannons, 725 light and heavy machine guns, about 1,000 rifles, 108 cars, large locomotives, and 123 railway freight cars were seized. The Japanese army's losses were 880 soldiers killed in battle.

Zhengzhou, 24th (Central News Agency) - More than ten divisions of the Chongqing army under the command of Jiang Dingwen and several divisions of Hu Zongnan's army from the Eighth War Zone, totaling about 200,000 people, previously attempted to counterattack in the area west of Luoyang and south of the Yellow River in Xin'an and Yiyang. Due to the fierce offensive of the Japanese army, they are currently planning to flee southwest. Therefore, the Japanese army in the area, in addition to using a part to monitor the Chongqing army in Luoyang, is using powerful units with tanks as the main force to annihilate the main force of the Chongqing army in that area. On the 12th, with the cooperation of the air force, a large-scale offensive and defensive battle was launched. The Japanese army's vanguard, after causing the 12th Army under the command of Tang Enbo to collapse near Luoyang, thoroughly ravaged Songxian. Another Japanese army advanced westward along the Luoyang River and suppressed Changshui Town in the Luoyang River Valley west of Luoyang on the 16th, and launched a fierce attack on the 17th Division of the 96th Army stationed in Luoning, intending to completely eliminate it. Then, on the tenth day, they broke into Luoning, cut off the Longhai Line, and echoed the Japanese army units to form a triangular encirclement of Xin'an Guanyintang Luoning, and pursued the Chongqing army of about five divisions, totaling 35,000 people, which had retreated from the Luoyang Plain, and completely annihilated them. In this short period, about 20 divisions of the 6th Army and 13th Division under the command of Jiang Dingwen in the First War Zone, and the army of Tang Enbo and Hu Zongnan in the Eighth War Zone, totaling about 200,000 people, were either wiped out or collapsed. Due to the loss of the main force of the Tang Enbo army and the suffering of the Jiang Dingwen army, the First War Zone has been shaken.

Japanese Army in Henan Occupies Shanxian

Xinzheng, 24th (Central News Agency) - The elite of the Japanese army in Shanxi crossed the upper reaches of the Yellow River, and after cutting the section near Yuyu and Yudi of the Shanghai Line, they continued to attack westward, defeating the Chongqing 39th Army. On the afternoon of the 17th, they attempted to attack Shanxian County, an important point on the West Shanghai Line, and finally occupied the county seat on the 18th. Another elite force bypassed the south of Shanxian and attacked Daying in the west, cutting off the retreat route of the Chongqing army defending Shanxian.

### "Navy Spirit" Seen in the Lens - A Dialogue Between Photography Reporters of the Mainichi Shimbun

Two dispatched photography reporters of the Japanese Mainichi Shimbun, Tatsuro Niimi and Kaneharu Yamamoto, served in the Southern Front for about a year, going in and out of gunfire and taking many photos. The two gentlemen heard and witnessed in detail the hard fighting of the Japanese Navy on the front lines. The following is a dialogue between the two gentlemen. Difficulties of Photography

Niimi: Everything I heard and saw there was a microcosm of the captivating Navy spirit. Everything captured by the camera is extremely precious. Yamamoto: It is impossible to take photos in the dense forest, even during the day it is very dark. The dense forests of New Guinea are truly untouched forests. Large trees with diameters of about six feet rise branchless to the sky, about one hundred and fifty feet high. The treetops are lush and dense like umbrellas, blocking the sunlight. The noble figures of the warriors fighting in this kind of forest are now all captured by the lens and transmitted to the rear.

Niimi: The humidity that fills the dense forest like fine rain is the enemy of the camera. The photosensitive film melts quickly due to high heat and humidity. However, we put each roll of film into a specially made can and sealed it with tape. Only ten rolls are stored in this specially made can with desiccant. Once a film is loaded into the camera, it is useless if it is not used for two or three days.

The Troops in the Dense Forest

Yamamoto: The coastline is generally a dry, hot zone of coconut groves, suitable for living, but it has become a bombing target for enemy planes, so the troops have to set up camps in the dense forests where even the natives cannot live. The soldiers live in crude huts built on wooden piles. The ground is muddy every day, so they build wooden piles of coconut trees to walk to the neighboring house. Due to humidity and dryness, things that are washed will not dry after three days, and in dry places, white mold will grow, and white shirts will turn black after washing. The smoke must be noted, as the lodging places will be easily discovered by enemy planes, so the warriors pay attention to even the smoke from cigarettes. Cooking is done one or two kilometers away. When enemy planes come, cooking is done in the dark with the fire covered. Water is extremely difficult to obtain, and when it is necessary to wash, they can only boil the muddy water from the smelly swamps and apply it. Drinking water is obtained by distillation.

Niimi: There are tropical malaria, tropical ulcers, and other terrible diseases there. This is a story from ○○ Island; a soldier who returned from the front line, without resting, took out a paper knife from his pocket, ran out of the dormitory, and in a place where sunlight shone through a gap in the leaves of a nearby tree, the soldier spread a piece of paper in his hand. When asked "What are you doing?", he said he was drying it. "What is that piece of paper?" "It's a letter, a letter my child sent half a year ago." The paper, stained with sweat and mud, was written with childish false characters. For the past half a year, this soldier has been wearing a warm shirt and has not found a sunny place to dry it, so that this letter cannot be seen clearly. This kind of scene is truly moving, but this is a posture that cannot be expressed with a photograph.

Dense Forest Battle

Niimi: Because the line of sight is narrow, dense forest battles are exactly the same as night battles. There is always the possibility of engaging the enemy. The soldiers move stealthily, holding their breath, with weeds decorated on their helmets, and advance through the mud. Suddenly breaking forward, cracks appear in front, and beads of sweat the size of soybeans stream down their faces. Clothes are pulled by thorns, and military boots step into the mud. Guns and swords are occasionally illuminated by a line of sunlight shining down from the treetops, glittering. That is truly the solemnity of warriors. This is truly the best and most unadorned material for photography.

Yamamoto: Sound really has an impact on the nerves. The dense forest is silent as death, but from time to time, the wind blows the branches and leaves, making a whirring sound. The sound of about twenty wild boars acting as a group is a killing sound, and the sound of trees falling suddenly without wind often mixes together. The soldiers are most afraid of the situation where trees naturally fall due to decay. This is truly a true story of wind noise, a story of the dense forest battle in southern New Guinea. The soldier on the front line was tripped by a tree and fell. Nearby parrots were startled by the sound and flew up. There are many snow-white parrots there, cackling and cackling. At this time, the cries of dozens of parrots made the warriors nervous all night, thinking they had been discovered by the enemy, preparing to fight the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. However, when they arrived at the enemy's position, machine guns, rifles, food, and ammunition were scattered all over the ground. The soldiers laughed. The parrot's cries startled the enemy and they fled in disarray. Scattered weapons and ammunition indicate their panic.

Naval Battle

Niimi: When turning the troops from Beira Beira Island, we encountered three enemy cruisers, four destroyers, and many torpedo boats and launched a fierce night battle. I was on the flagship, and immediately picked up the camera and went to the deck to prepare to capture the scene of the naval battle, but I could not take photos at night. The enemy was firing colored bullets from a distance of 16,000 meters. These colored bullets looked like two blood-red pieces of charcoal flying side by side. All the lights on the warship were controlled, and the active situation of the soldiers could not be captured, so I took the camera and had nothing to do, and served as a lookout with the military doctor and the chief accountant. The military leader suddenly shouted: "○○ has been destroyed." ○○ was our destroyer. When I looked, the area near the front turret was surrounded by a blood-red fireball. It was clearly visible in the dark night. I couldn't help but grit my teeth. Enemy bullets seemed to be aimed at this fire and concentrated their fire. Countless pillars of water were stirred up. Before long, the fire on the turret was extinguished, and the rear deck caught fire again. The warship began to sink from the bow. The fire was fierce, surrounding the entire ship, and the turret caught fire a second time. Ah! It sank. Just as the front turret was almost completely submerged in the water, there was a loud explosion. The sunken cannon was still firing the last bullet towards the enemy ship. A cannon half-sunken in the sea was still firing. Is there such a terrible thing in the history of world naval warfare? Only our navy. I still cannot forget that last cannon sound. In this naval battle, a great victory was achieved, sinking one cruiser and three destroyers, and our side also lost one destroyer.

Lookout on a Deserted Island

Yamamoto: There is a lookout on Adi Island in southern New Guinea. This place is suitable for enemy planes to attack New Guinea from Australia, so the lookouts are watching day and night for the discovery of enemy planes and enemy submarines. It is a deserted island, and food is transported there once every three months, which is a life isolated from the world. I once took that liaison ship to the island. When the lookouts saw the shape of the ship, they waved towels and shirts on the shore. The ship approached the shore and ran to the beach with a rustling sound, asking each soldier: "What did you bring? Are there any letters from home?" Seeing these dark and energetic soldiers, I couldn't help but be moved. The whole island is a dense forest, and they climb up the coconut trees, 150 feet high, on the shore to carry out their lookout duties. Apart from the liaison ship that comes once every three months, there is nothing else on this island to comfort these warriors. Sometimes, sea turtles five feet long come to the beach to lay their eggs, which is the only rare guest. This is a place where earthquakes often occur. One day, a great change occurred on the island due to an earthquake. The island sank due to the earthquake. The beach and hills were gradually sinking into the sea before their eyes. The lookout reported to the base by radio: "Amao Island is currently sinking due to an earthquake, but as long as there is a piece of wood, we will continue to keep watch." But the base has no ship that can be dispatched to rescue them. That tragic radio message kept coming, and the people at the base could only pray to God. Fortunately, the sinking did not last long and stopped, and the whole island was safe, and it is now a joke. What if it had really sunk completely? The lookouts on this island would have fulfilled tasks unknown to people and died in their posts!

Niimi: There is also such a lookout at ○○ at the southernmost tip of New Ireland. That is the necessary route for enemy planes to raid Rabaul from the Solomon Islands. Relying on the reports from this lookout, Rabaul can know twenty minutes earlier that enemy planes are coming to attack. The location of the lookout is a cave dug on a steep cliff. The liaison ship only comes once every six months. Accompanied by lizards and sea turtles, they are vigilant day and night, and their hardship is truly beyond words. Moreover, if you want to send a telegram, there is no other way. There are many such lookouts in the South China Sea, and they have deployed a strong picket network. There are also many lookouts that have sent out radio messages saying "○○ enemy planes are attacking, and we are currently fighting back," and many have ultimately been honorably sacrificed. We should take the spirit of these warriors on the front lines as our spirit, and the rear should share the same hardships as the front lines. (Xiang: Translated from the May 13 Mainichi Shimbun)

### Marshal Togo's Complete Collection of Sayings

### Be a Warrior Even When Sick

We must be warriors even when it comes to illness. What is meant here by being a warrior against illness is to follow the doctor's instructions in all things, never act rashly, rest fully, and only do so when the doctor permits. This may seem like something that goes without saying, but in practice, it is surprisingly difficult to adhere to, especially for young people. Because they are full of vigor and vitality, they act impulsively, deeply afraid of delaying their duties. There are often those who do not fully comply with the doctor's instructions, resulting in the recurrence of the disease, which in turn causes delays. Therefore, to restrain oneself and endure, and to only act when the doctor permits, is what can be called being a warrior against illness.

### Students Should Focus on Their Duties

As civilization progresses and human intelligence develops, spiritual education is most necessary. Students today have their own duties as students, so they must concentrate on their duties and not be lazy or self-willed. To rashly engage in matters outside of their duties is not appropriate. This is how one must act in life. If one does not devote all their efforts, nothing in the world can be accomplished.

### Do Not Distort the Facts

What people do is not necessarily always judged correctly, but if one believes it to be right, then no matter what others say, one must never distort the truth.

### Thrift

It is best if income exceeds expenditure.

### Simplicity

Simplicity is the first requirement for fulfilling one's duties. If one is not simple, one will eventually imitate extravagance that is outside of one's duties, and ultimately fall into evil ways and become dishonest, leading to the tarnishing of one's reputation. How can one then fulfill one's duties? Be cautious, be cautious! (To be continued)

### The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Plans Electricity Saving Measures to Rationally Distribute to Producers and Consumers

Recently, this city has implemented a second round of universal electricity conservation measures. While various sectors are cooperating in their implementation, they are also hoping that the authorities will adjust the current system to ensure that electricity conservation and increased production are pursued concurrently, so that the industrial sector does not fall into a state of paralysis. Yesterday, reporters specifically inquired with Director Ye of the Bureau of Public Utilities about this issue, and he agreed to release the following statement: "Conserving electricity is originally one part of conserving resources and is a necessary measure during wartime. However, how to achieve rationalization is an extremely complex problem that urgently needs to be solved. The method implemented half a year ago was a universal reduction system, and this time the reduction method is still the same. Although the procedure is simple, it is not entirely rational in practice, so those who are accustomed to wasting on weekdays may not thoroughly save, while those who actually need electricity already feel the hardship deeply. In general, the impact of reduced electricity on production is a serious economic problem. At this critical stage of decisive battle, increasing production is a pressing and urgent plan. If electricity conservation reduces production capacity, it is truly a case of gaining less than is lost. This bureau, which is responsible for public utilities throughout the city, attaches great importance to this issue and is currently planning in detail to ensure that the amount of supply needed for production can be maintained appropriately, while extravagant consumption will be strictly limited. The daily electricity consumption of households will also be fairly distributed according to their actual needs." It is heard that this plan will be implemented as soon as it has been discussed with the relevant authorities.

### Terrorist Drill in Huangpu District Yesterday

The Huangpu District of the First Police Bureau of this city held a terrorist drill yesterday (24th) afternoon around 3:00 p.m. at the entrance of the Hamilton Building at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road. Three people posing as terrorists first fired shots at the scene and then fled. When the branch bureau received the report, it blocked off the entire district and dispatched a large number of detectives, led by Branch Chief Kobayashi and Deputy Branch Chief Liu Ya Ying, to the scene to join military police in searching for the hypothetical criminals. The Self-Defense Corps assisted in maintaining order, and the drill was quite realistic. It ended at 4:10 p.m., and the blockade was lifted, restoring traffic.

### Second Police Bureau Orders Assistance in Arresting Those Privately Collecting Pig Tax

Recently, it was discovered in the urban area that counterfeit tax stamps and certificates of pig tax, which had been announced as abolished, were being used to privately collect pig tax, which is disrupting tax revenue and violating criminal law. After receiving the report, the Second Police Bureau, in order to assist in maintaining tax administration, specifically ordered all subordinate branch bureaus yesterday to assist in arresting and punishing those involved.

### Dr. Sasaki Spoke Yesterday on the Agricultural Situation of Various Countries; Third Lecture to be Held Today

The "Wartime Academic Lecture" jointly sponsored by the News and this newspaper, first hired Japanese agricultural authority Dr. Sasaki as a lecturer. After arriving in Shanghai and taking a short rest, he has already begun his lectures in recent days. The first lecture and symposium were held at the Agricultural College of National Shanghai University at 3:00 p.m. on the 23rd, with over two hundred teachers and students, including President Zhao. A banquet was hosted by the school in the evening, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. Yesterday afternoon, the second lecture was held at the Japan-China Club, attended by about a hundred students from Nantong University, the China Agricultural Technical School, and the Agricultural Textile School. The topics for both lectures were "Observation of Japan, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom from an Agricultural Perspective," analyzing the agricultural situation of various countries and elaborating on the differences between China and Japan and the United Kingdom and the United States in agriculture. He also explained that China and Japan have absolute commonalities in terms of cultivated land area, agricultural production rate, the content of other plants and animals, and agricultural technology and management methods. Therefore, from an agricultural point of view, China and Japan naturally have the necessity of mutual cooperation and friendly relations. The lecture lasted about two hours. The third lecture will be held at St. John's University at 3:30 p.m. today.

### Spokesman for the Japanese Army Discusses the Situation in Henan, Fall of Luoyang Imminent

The spokesman for the Allied Japanese Shanghai Army Press Department, met with the Chinese newspaper reporters in the city yesterday (24th) at 2:00 p.m. as usual, and elaborated on the damage suffered by the Chongqing side in this Henan operation, and the impact on Liu's political economy. A record of his remarks is as follows: Regarding the detailed course of this Henan operation, because the Japanese General Headquarters has not yet issued a statement, it is not convenient to announce it first. However, the biggest problem at present is the fall of Luoyang. Before Luoyang falls, we cannot talk about reaching a final conclusion. However, to date, many important cities have been occupied by the Japanese army, and the ultimate goal of the Japanese army should be Luoyang. Now the Japanese army is gathering all its strength to capture Luoyang. Although the battle is fierce, the progress of the Japanese army is surprisingly rapid. Overall, in this operation, the Chongqing army annihilated by the Japanese army totaled six armies and twenty divisions, about 180,000 soldiers. Therefore, although Luoyang has not yet fallen, it is imminent, so the first phase goal can be said to have been completed, and the Japanese army's destruction of the enemy's forces has also reached the expected goal. The troops of Tang Enbo and Jiang Dingwen of the Chongqing side have been fatally hit.

Elite Troops Heavily Defeated

What we can pay more attention to is that Tang Enbo and Jiang Dingwen, known as the most elite troops of the Chongqing side, have now suffered the most tragic defeat and will no longer be able to restore their strength. Furthermore, the chaotic command of the enemy's army is also countless. To give an example, when the battle was at its fiercest, the Chongqing military authorities once ordered Tang Enbo to firmly defend Dengfeng and Mianxian. However, at this time, Tang's troops had already fled at the first sign of trouble, which shows that the subordinates had no will to fight, and even more remarkably, Tang did not know where his subordinates were. The state of chaos was so great that it was truly laughable. The reason why Luoyang has not yet fallen is that the Japanese army is now gradually shrinking the encirclement, dividing its troops in all directions. Once it is completely surrounded, it can be captured in one fell swoop. There are currently about three divisions of the Chongqing army in Luoyang. The Japanese side's purpose is to annihilate these forces completely, leaving none alive, and then occupy the city. In this way, it can achieve the dual purpose of annihilating the main force of the enemy and occupying the city. Therefore, the Japanese army's attack on Luoyang is not too hasty, and that is the reason. Moreover, the offensives launched on other fronts will not be affected by the failure of Luoyang to fall.

Nujiang War a Bluff

To further elaborate, the first phase of this Henan operation has been completed, and now we are in the second phase. Because the Chongqing side completely failed in this operation, it had to find ways to create various arguments, launching an offensive in the Nujiang area and propagandizing the recapture of Myitkyina. If we criticize it from a military perspective, this is entirely a propaganda strategy, and it would not be wrong to say that they are "trying to save face." Let us try to analyze the point of crossing the Nujiang River as follows: Although the Chongqing side has been vigorously promoting the operation of crossing the Nujiang River recently, there has been no action. In the Nujiang area, the troops under Wei Lihuang of the Chongqing side have only a few divisions, and they are attempting to cross the river, but the strength of a few divisions is already extremely small, and the number that can actually cross the river is even smaller. They attempted to reach Tengchong and Longling, but so far all they have gained are a few bridgeheads. They attempted to transport a large army in a steady stream, but they have now been surrounded by the Japanese force and will soon be annihilated. Therefore, the military spokesman of the Chongqing side also admitted that the Nujiang war was stalled due to rain. Although the Chongqing side attaches great importance to this war, its strength is small, and it is certain that it will not be able to achieve its wishes. Furthermore, on the Myitkyina side, the enemy is also vigorously promoting the occupation of the railway line, but no matter how much they advocate it, we can know that all that the enemy is propagating is purely fabricated by observing the strong strength of the Japanese army. Especially in terms of supplies, they are even more helpless. Although the Chongqing side is spreading rumors about air replenishment of supplies, it is all a dream. The military spokesman of the Chongqing side has also admitted this point. Therefore, the reason why the Chongqing side is so vigorously propagandizing is to cover up the disastrous defeat in the Henan operation.

Impact of Henan Operation on Chongqing

Now, let me briefly explain the impact of this Henan operation on Chongqing:

(1) The most elite Tang Enbo army of the Chongqing side has been completely annihilated, causing the United States to doubt the faith in the Chongqing side. (2) The public opinion centers of the United Kingdom and the United States are concerned about whether the Chongqing side can continue to fight independently in the future. The reason why the United Kingdom and the United States are concerned about this point is that they want to use the power of Chongqing to consume the Japanese force and to make it a base for fighting Japan in mainland China. This is the sinister trick of the United Kingdom and the United States. However, now that the most elite Tang Enbo army of the Chongqing side has been so badly defeated, it is no wonder that the United Kingdom and the United States doubt whether the Chongqing side can continue to fight independently. The victory bonds of the Chongqing side have also plummeted in value in London due to the failure of this Henan operation, which further shows the decline of Chongqing's international status. The United Kingdom and the United States further stated that the two major reasons for the disastrous defeat of the Chongqing side in this Henan operation were: (1) the opposition of the Chongqing Communists, (2) the uneven opinions within Chongqing. In particular, the United Kingdom and the United States are even more dissatisfied with Chiang's dictatorial politics. Therefore, the United Kingdom and the United States further interfered in the internal affairs of the Chongqing side. In particular, the air force bases of the United States in Chongqing were successively crushed by the Japanese army. Out of pain, they turned their anger on the enemy for not being able to protect their bases. Furthermore, regarding the issue of adjusting the relations between the Chongqing Communists, the Communist representative Lin Zuhan and the Chongqing representatives Wang Shijie and Zhang Zhizhong held several informal meetings, but these meetings can be said to be held entirely under the pressure of the United Kingdom and the United States. In fact, the meetings will never have results, and there is no talk of cooperation, only increasing the trouble of the Chongqing side. The reason why the United Kingdom and the United States hope that the Chongqing Communists will hold meetings is to seek their peaceful coexistence and full utilization by the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, the purpose of the United Kingdom and the United States is definitely not to liberate and revive China, but only to hold them as a tool to win the war, so that the Chinese nation will never see the light of day.

### Price Countermeasures Committee Ready

In order to strengthen price management, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce recently convened with the Municipal Government and relevant Chinese and Japanese agencies to form a Price Countermeasures Committee in Shanghai, in order to seek a rational solution to prices. Now, the committee is actively preparing through the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Municipal Government and other relevant parties, and it is basically ready. It is heard that the position of chairman will be concurrently held by Mr. Wu Songgao. The main work in the future will focus on local prices in Shanghai, obtain strict management, in order to adapt to the wartime economic system, and balance prices in various places, stabilize people's livelihoods, and never allow the ugly phenomenon of price spikes to occur again.

### Postal Workers' Strike, Being Persuaded to Resume Work

The postal authorities previously felt that the employees' wages were too low and the postal economy was suffering huge losses, so they submitted a request to the government for approval to increase postal rates by 200% from the 16th of this month. After this price increase, the first step was to improve the employees' treatment, and to increase their salaries and wages by one time starting this month. The authorities have made their best efforts to improve the employees' lives. The employees, on the other hand, demanded a gold and rice subsidy system, and suddenly went on strike on the 22nd. Beforehand, they did not send representatives to contact the authorities, nor did they obtain the consent of the labor union. Since the strike occurred, the postal authorities have actively guided them, and the postal labor union has also tried its best to persuade and negotiate. However, the postal authorities have refused any conditions because they are unable to do anything. Yesterday (24th), the postal authorities and the Shanghai Postal Labor Union separately issued statements and urgent notices, urging them to resume work quickly, in order to maintain postal operations and seek the convenience of the public.

### Naval Day Commemoration, Famous Painting Exhibition Opens Tomorrow

Brief Commentary

### Electricity Saving Principles

The words of Director Ye of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities (see today's newspaper) on the implementation of the second round of electricity conservation measures in this city, and the need to distinguish between the rational allocation of producers and consumers, is a very important issue. The electricity saving measures set six months ago were a universal reduction system. As a result, consumers who are accustomed to wasting on weekdays may not save thoroughly, while producers who actually need electricity feel the hardship deeply. This time the electricity saving measures are still a universal reduction, so the result is that for producers, reducing production capacity due to electricity conservation is indeed a case of gaining less than is lost. Therefore, reducing production due to electricity conservation is definitely not the original intention of electricity conservation, nor is it a phenomenon that should exist amidst calls for increased production.

We strongly advocate that electricity conservation should absolutely limit extravagant consumption, such as entertainment venues closing early, restaurants shortening evening business hours, hotels and homes prohibiting all-night card games, and stopping the use of household electric refrigerators and electric fans, etc. The power company should reduce the electricity supply to extravagant consumers to the minimum. On the other hand, for legitimate production enterprises and social welfare enterprises, the electricity supply should not only not be reduced universally in proportion to extravagant consumers, but should be strictly assessed for their actual needs and appropriately maintained or increased, in order to maintain their production capacity and maintain their service efficiency.

It is worth repeating that the principle of saving electricity should distinguish between the rational allocation of consumers and producers.

Last Night's Film Speech Convention

The Municipal Education Bureau and China Film Company, in celebration of Allied Nations' Naval Day, held a joint commemorative speech and film convention at the Dahua Grand Theater at 8:00 PM yesterday (24th). Naval officers from the Allied Nations were invited to speak. Director Jiong'an Lin of the Municipal Education Bureau, Director Zongyao Ma of the Publicity Department of China Film Company, and over a thousand faculty and staff from more than seventy middle and elementary schools in the city, including He'an First Normal School, Gezhi, and Yu Zhi, attended. From the Allied Nations side, Lieutenant Commander Teshima and Lieutenant Commander Shiota of the Naval Attache's Office in Shanghai were present, creating a lively atmosphere. Director Lin gave an opening speech. Then, Lieutenant Commander Teshima of the Allied Nations gave a speech: First, (1) Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, we have entered the stage of decisive battle. He discussed the past war situation, (2) the current situation in the Pacific theater, (3) the reasons why the enemy Americans are eager to counterattack, (4) the attitude of the Japanese Navy in the Pacific, and (5) the actual major battle results obtained since the naval battles, analyzing them in great detail. Finally, he said: The construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is the advocacy of Pan-Asianism by the national father Sun Yat-sen, and it was not newly created by Japan. Only through full cooperation between China and Japan can this goal be achieved. Now, places such as Nanyang have become very strong fortresses, just like the Great Wall built in the Qin Dynasty in China. He hoped that the Chinese people would work harder and cooperate with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia Holy War. The most important thing is spiritual cooperation, and the most important thing about spiritual cooperation is education. Everyone present today bears the heavy responsibility of education. In the past, Shanghai was bewitched by the evil forces of Britain and the United States, and now the remaining poison still exists. Eliminating the remaining poison is your responsibility. He hoped that everyone would guide the thinking of Chinese youth in order to complete the legitimate and truthful Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. He believed that the Greater East Asia War will be completed soon. Then, Director Lin gave a thank-you speech, and the film "Hawaii-Malaya Sea Battle" was screened until it ended at 11:00 PM.

### Solving the Current Price Problem

— Ren Ming

On the 21st of this month, the editorial column of the Economic Section of the Xinwen Bao published an article entitled "On the Narrativity of Prices," which believes that the current low-price policy adopted by the authorities has failed due to the lack of thorough overall control, the incomplete control mechanism, and the unsound personnel. The low-price policy has not only failed to achieve the expected results, but also caused production stagnation, material shortages, and periodic ladder-shaped price increases, increasing the suffering of the people. Finally, citing the point raised by the Japanese-language "Mainland News" of "trying to restore the natural form of prices as much as possible within the possible range," it suggests that informed people in the society consider abandoning the policy of controlling prices. This paper has very reasonable arguments regarding the failure of the current price policy, but it does not point out the direction and steps that the authorities should take after abandoning the convenient price policy. The author is not talented, so I will make a small contribution based on my knowledge, to supplement it.

From the perspective of economic principles, the matter of controlling prices is a temporary solution. When the war first started, the problem of material supply had not yet reached a serious stage, and it was not unreasonable to adopt a policy of controlling prices at that time. However, due to various reasons, this policy has undoubtedly failed. At present, the supply of materials is becoming increasingly short, and increasing production seems difficult to achieve suddenly. Change price control to complete material control. In the past, prices have risen steadily. Although the reasons are extremely complex, the hoarding of materials by unscrupulous merchants, manipulating the market, and buying and selling repeatedly, which invisibly raised prices, is the biggest factor. If hoarding and speculation are not eliminated, there is no hope of suppressing prices. To eliminate such behavior, it is necessary to start controlling materials. The method of controlling materials can be implemented by the economic control mechanism to manage the buying and selling of merchants in various industries. It is stipulated that before merchants complete a transaction, they must first obtain proof from the same industry association and apply to the competent economic authority, which will review the nature of the transaction to determine whether it is legitimate and whether the transaction price is reasonable. If both the buyer and seller are in the industry, and the seller's asking price is reasonable, and the buyer's required quantity is not excessive (for example, a manufacturer purchases raw materials for no more than three months of consumption), then it may be approved. Conversely, if both the buyer and seller are not in the industry, then their business is obviously illegal and will not be approved.

As for the method of controlling commercial transactions, the first step is to start with registration. Notify merchants in all industries to register their goods so that the authorities can understand the inventory of materials and facilitate adjustments. The second step is to implement measures to restrict the movement of materials, stipulating that the transportation of materials must first be approved by the competent authority before it can be handled. All improper transactions are prohibited from moving materials. In other words, all materials are not allowed to be moved unless a permit has been obtained.

If the above-mentioned plan to control materials can be implemented and supplemented by a sound execution mechanism and personnel organization, the results achieved will not only reach the following points: (1) It can eliminate hoarding and speculation and eliminate black market transactions. (2) It can correct selling prices and make prices fair naturally. (3) It can adjust surpluses and deficits, allocate raw materials, and prevent the transfer of main raw materials to secondary areas. (4) It can improve the rationing system for daily necessities and try to increase the number of rationed items. (5) It can strengthen the organization of industry associations.

If it is said that there are many types of materials and it is not easy to implement overall control, it may be helpful to start by controlling the daily necessities first, and then gradually extend to other items, suppressing prices and improving people's livelihood, which is deeply beneficial. I hope that insightful people in the society and relevant authorities will act quickly!

### "Yi Zhong Ren" Responds to Poor Women's Childbirth Assistance Movement, Midwives' Association Cooperates and Supports

Since our office launched the childbirth assistance movement, it has aroused considerable sympathy from the society. In addition to Mr. Dan Yunhui's father generously donating 20,000 yuan in response, we have now received a donation of 10,000 yuan from Yi Zhong Ren and a letter of support from the Midwives' Association, benefiting poor women and being greatly admired.

Dear Sir, I recently read in your newspaper about the launch of the childbirth assistance movement for poor women, and I was deeply moved. In recent years, the population of our country has declined, and there is a need to encourage childbirth. Unfortunately, ordinary poor women find it difficult to make ends meet in their daily lives, and it is difficult for them to make appropriate arrangements once they give birth. Fortunately, your office is enthusiastically advocating and diligently handling this matter. I admire you very much and am willing to save on transportation costs to donate 10,000 yuan, and I hope that all sectors will respond enthusiastically, save and provide assistance, and benefit mothers. Yi Zhong Ren sincerely.

Dear Sir, I recently read in the newspaper that your office launched the childbirth assistance movement for the poor and needy. Your benevolent and righteous act is truly admirable. Our association is a group organization of midwives in this city. We are obligated to make efforts in our position. In addition to contacting relevant obstetrics hospitals separately, please notify us if midwives are needed to participate in the work. Our association will carefully dispatch capable members to provide services. Sincerely, Shanghai Special City Midwives' Association.

### Leprosy Association Fundraising

As the saying goes: "It's better for a poor person not to get sick than to win the lottery." It can be seen that everyone considers getting sick to be an unfortunate event, let alone suffering from leprosy, which is even more unfortunate!

Based on this sympathy, the China Leprosy Relief Association established hospitals to accommodate them and clinics to treat them. It is obvious that in this time of high living costs, it is extremely difficult to maintain this relief work, so we have no choice but to call on people from all walks of life for help. It is reported that a fundraising campaign will be held for one month starting on May 24th. It is hoped that enthusiastic philanthropists will provide more assistance.

Lost Key. Yesterday morning, I took the No. 17 tram from Sichuan Road Bridge to the Great World, then took the tram to Albert Road at the Eight Immortals Bridge. I lost a bunch of keys along the way, including the key to safe deposit box No. 2960. If anyone finds it, please return it to the Jiancheng Office of this newspaper. A reward of 200 yuan will be given.

Letter to My Sister (4)

Perhaps it is fitting for Ryufu, who is in a troubled mood, to live on the second floor of this desolate and old Kurihama Inn.

He slept all day on the faded and uneven tatami mats. The autumn sky seen from the open window changed from azure to pale yellow. At this time, the lights were turned on, and the sun had unknowingly set.

Because there were no guests, the bathhouse was not heated. The landlady said there was a bathhouse nearby, but he was very restless and had no mood to take a bath.

"Mr. Guest, are you just sleeping?"

The landlady brought dinner. There were saury, octopus, fresh local fish, etc. It looked plentiful, but Ryufu had no intention of eating. The talkative landlady, no matter how much she said, Ryufu remained silent, so the landlady felt helpless, opened the bedding, and went downstairs.

It was not yet seven o'clock, but Ryufu turned off the lights and went to bed. Having said that, falling asleep was not easy. The sound of clogs walking back and forth and the sound of radio coming from somewhere were really annoying.

Soon after, the sounds of clogs and radio subsided, but unexpectedly, the sound of waves was very clearly transmitted to the pillow. His eyes widened even more.

The silhouette of the warship seen during the day was always appearing before his eyes, no matter how he tried to shake it off. The naval second lieutenant wearing glasses looked majestic to Ryufu and smiled. If his physique were healthy, he would be wearing that officer's uniform next year.

(What's the point of thinking about such things now?)

He turned over. The tears that filled his eyes slipped and flowed onto the pillow.

(It's not just that I didn't become a naval officer. I didn't become a calligrapher either.)

He finally realized the reason why he had to come to this place to rest.

(Everything is over. I failed in every path. No matter how much I try to cheer up now, it's no use.)

It was truly a desperate mood. Then he would run back to his parents' knees, beg for forgiveness for his unfilial piety, endure the ridicule of the villagers, or perhaps work as a clerk in the local government office.

He thought it was time to write a letter to his sister, Eda.

Suddenly, Ryufu jumped up and turned on the lights. He took out a fountain pen and stationery from his bag and ran to the filthy dining table.

—Eda, I…

Before he had finished writing the first few sentences, Ryufu felt overwhelmed by all the worries in his heart, so he held his head and cried bitterly. (9) (10) (3)
