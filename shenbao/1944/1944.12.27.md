### Japanese Army and Navy Authorities in South China Announce Opening of the West River Waterway

Transportation Line Between Vietnam, Guangdong, and Guangxi Established

Continental Front Base, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - The East Asian artery, which runs from Manchuria through China and Vietnam to Syonan, has been completed due to the progress of Japanese military operations. This not only makes a significant contribution to strengthening the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere internally, but this artery also helps to facilitate the flow of goods. Therefore, the highest commander of the Japanese Army in South China and the commander of the South China Fleet have jointly issued an announcement opening the waterway on the West River from Sanshui to Wuzhou, which had been closed during the operations. The West River is the most important waterway in Guangdong and Guangxi, and, along with the Xiang River, it is a major artery for nurturing the southwestern economy of the Chongqing side. After this waterway returns to the peace zone, from the Chongqing side's perspective, it loses the abundant human resources of Guangdong and Guangxi. Conversely, the narrow peace area, which has been centered on Guangzhou, is now expanding to Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. On one hand, the Japanese army occupied the highway between Nanning and Vietnam. Through active repairs by the Japanese army and genuine cooperation from the residents, the 120-kilometer-long, 6-meter-wide automobile highway from Vietnam to Sile has been completed in just over half a month and is expected to directly connect to Nanning in the near future. Therefore, the completion of the Nanning-Vietnam highway and the opening of the West River waterway can be said to have established the transportation line between Vietnam, Guangdong, and Guangxi. Furthermore, the Japanese army is using this transportation artery for military purposes, gaining an absolute advantage in internal operations, and it is also beneficial to economic development. This will surely promote the well-being of the people in South China, and further, it can expand the peace zone to the interior.

### Japanese Army Press Department Regularly Invites Reporters

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese Army Press Department is scheduled to meet with Chinese news reporters at the Fuchang Hotel Press Club at 4:00 p.m. today (the 27th) to provide explanations on the recent war situation.

### Where is Chongqing Going?

— Wan Xibai

Britain and the United States hope that cooperation between Chongqing and the Communists will strengthen China's war effort. Therefore, U.S. Ambassador to Chongqing, Hurley, was recently ordered to contact both Chongqing and Yan'an and made a special trip to Yan'an. This matter has long been known to everyone. Recently, Stanley W. Gellard, a special correspondent for the London News Chronicle, also sent a detailed telegram from Calcutta, making the ins and outs of this issue clear. Gellard specifically sent this telegram from Calcutta because news censorship in Chongqing is very strict, and it would not be possible to report the truth otherwise.

In summary, according to the telegram sent by Gellard, negotiations between Chongqing and Yan'an have broken down, and the Chongqing side has rejected the demands of the Communist side presented by Zhou Enlai, namely the participation of the Communists in the government and the unified command of the armed forces. One section of Gellard's telegram reads as follows:

"Although the military situation in South China is extremely urgent, Zhou Enlai had to wait for more than a week to meet Chiang when he arrived in Chongqing. Moreover, Chiang Kai-shek met Zhou Enlai with a very high-handed attitude. Now, Zhou Enlai has returned to Yan'an. Unless Chiang changes this attitude and requests the dispatch of not just nominal representatives without power but Communist representatives to participate in the government, Zhou will not return to Chongqing again."

From this, it can be seen that cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communists is very difficult. Zhou Enlai also told Gellard:

"The CCP has approximately 600,000 regular troops and 2.2 million militia. Before September of this year, they fought against 49% of the Japanese army and 90% of the puppet army."

"The troops used by the CCP to defend the border regions are, at most, 50,000, but the Kuomintang uses 400,000 troops to blockade us (the CCP), and sometimes even more than 500,000. The total number of troops used by the Kuomintang on Chinese territory to blockade the CCP and attack the Communist army is no less than 700,000. In the past four years, we have not received any weapons, military supplies, medical supplies, food, or clothing from the Kuomintang government."

This is the truth about China's anti-Japanese national united front!

According to Gellard, if this dispute can be resolved and Chongqing accepts the CCP's demands, the war effort of the national united front can be rapidly strengthened. Therefore, he advocates that Chongqing should make concessions.

Gellard's opinion fully demonstrates the imperialist intentions of Britain and the United States towards China. As for the Soviet Union, it is naturally concerned about the cooperation between Chongqing and the Communists. However, the Soviet Union's concern for this matter is only to regard it as a stage of the Chinese socialist revolution. On the contrary, the aim of Britain and the United States in realizing the cooperation between Chongqing and the Communists is to use it as a means to maintain and strengthen their imperialist dominance in East Asia and to completely enslave the Chinese people. The goals of the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States seem consistent, but their intentions are fundamentally different. This discord is not only evident in China but also in world politics. Look at Italy, France, Belgium, and Greece; they are all like this. Looking back at the so-called Allied Front against Germany between Britain and the United States, it can also be understood.

Of course, Chiang Kai-shek is fully aware that cooperation with Yan'an can have an effect on expanding the war effort, but he also understands that the formal cooperation proposed by Zhou Enlai can cause the foundation of his regime to collapse. And the intentions of Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union hidden behind this issue are probably also known to him. However, as long as he continues the futile war of resistance against Japan, the contradictions he faces will become increasingly profound, and his own anxieties will increase. As for Britain and the United States, although they are trying to make full use of the Chinese people and land in order to carry out the war against Japan, they are not unaware that this will lead to the collapse of their imperialist dominance in East Asia. The reason why they have to take this risk is for their evil war aims, is it not? Those in Yan'an understand this the most clearly. They are trying to take advantage of the pressure exerted by Britain and the United States on Chongqing to advance towards the goal of Chinese socialist revolution step by step. For Chiang Kai-shek, this is truly being besieged on all sides. Although he once planned far ahead for the "destiny of China," if these considerations continue to be based on the premise of resisting Japan, they will only go around in circles. And he will tremble at the abyss of destruction that his own regime is facing.

From this point of view, his high-handed and discourteous attitude when meeting Zhou Enlai is understandable.

Chiang Kai-shek has only one way to break out of this situation of being besieged on all sides. This path has been clearly pointed out by Japan. It is the most convenient path. Today, what is most necessary for Chiang Kai-shek is the profound and calmly executed courage of Easterners to make a "leap of life."

Editorial

### The European War Situation

In recent days, Germany's operations against the anti-Axis forces have been very fierce, especially on the western front, along the border between Belgium and Luxembourg, where the German counter-offensive has been more successful, and the trend of the European war has changed somewhat.

When the Axis powers changed their strategy and shifted their defense lines on various fronts during the summer and autumn of this year, many short-sighted people underestimated the strength of the Axis camp, and optimists on the anti-Axis side even fantasized about concluding the European war in the short term, perhaps by the end of this year. However, the development of the situation is not like that.

In fact, the strength of the Axis camp has always been strong. From a military perspective, since the summer and autumn to the present, the Axis countries have maintained strong armies. The combat effectiveness of well-trained elite troops equipped with increasingly advanced new weapons has been fully demonstrated in recent months. Some have also doubted Germany's economic strength, believing that it might repeat the mistakes of the previous European war, but this time is clearly different. Before the outbreak of this war, Germany had already anticipated the inevitability of the war, so it had made considerable preparations in terms of material resources in advance. After the war broke out, Germany embraced the determination to destroy the enemy, and then doubled its mobilization, increased production, and provided very abundant supplies. Next, Germany obtained a lot of materials from other countries in the Axis camp and occupied territories, making its reserves even more abundant.

In the political sphere, although Germany has had a few rebellious incidents, in fact, they have not only failed to shake the internal unity of Germany, but have instead clarified the German political atmosphere and truly created a national spirit of unanimous and thorough destruction of the enemy. Therefore, after the rebellious incidents were quelled, German politics, on a more solid and clear foundation, has handled the war situation with great ease.

In addition, regarding the issue of unity among the European Axis countries, some rebellious elements in a few small countries have been seduced by the anti-Axis countries, but the majority remain loyal to the Axis. Judging from the fact that the German-Italian joint forces are still fighting side by side on the Italian front, repelling the Anglo-American forces, and the German-Hungarian joint forces are still cooperating seamlessly on the Hungarian front, resisting the Soviet offensive, it can be imagined.

On the contrary, in the anti-Axis camp, with the United States at its head, although it relies on its abundant material resources, its long-distance expeditions and the supply and support of troops and materials will inevitably become increasingly difficult as the war drags on. Although there are many materials, the consumption is even greater. Production is ultimately limited, but consumption is infinite. At the same time, the people of Britain and the United States are mostly accustomed to enjoying life and are not as able to endure hardship as the people of Japan and Germany. The prolongation of the war will inevitably make it increasingly difficult for the British and American people to endure greater suffering, and the uncertainty of the war will make the morale of the troops at the front and the spirit of the people at the rear increasingly demoralized. The impact on combat and production is extremely significant. This is also one of the anxieties of the anti-Axis countries.

Moreover, the internal contradictions of the anti-Axis camp are becoming increasingly apparent as the war develops. The apparent harmony but real discord between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union has long been in existence. Currently, in the war against Germany, both sides hope that the other side will expend more resources while expending less themselves, which is clearly enough to reduce the strength of their joint operations. At the same time, Britain and the United States do not want the Soviet Union to have too much influence in Europe, and the Soviet Union does not want Britain and the United States to control Europe again. Because of suspicion, their cooperation has been affected. The earlier Finnish issue, the previous Polish issue, the slightly earlier Romanian and Bulgarian issues, and the recent Greek and French issues, the contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have been clearly revealed.

Furthermore, between Britain and the United States, they also have some conflicts. Britain still wants to dominate Europe, while the United States wants to go further and lead Europe, each harboring their own intentions. This is particularly evident in the French issue. The French Petain regime is taking advantage of the contradictions between Britain and the United States and the contradictions between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union, forming alliances to attempt to revive the already collapsed status of France. The somber atmosphere surrounding the Soviet-French communique is one manifestation of their multifaceted contradictions. The cracks in the anti-Axis camp may become increasingly acute.

Judging from the above, the future development of the European war situation can be inferred.

### American Troop Reinforcements in Belgium Initiate Rescue Offensive; German Paratroopers Land on Belgian-French Border

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - Huitong News Agency: On the ninth day of the winter battle in southeastern Belgium, the anti-Axis forces have greatly reinforced their troops. Prior to the launch of the reserve force offensive, Eisenhower had already moved his entire reserve force to Aachen and Saar, attempting to break through Cologne and the Saar region. It is now expected that a large portion of the enemy forces in these two areas have been redeployed. Yesterday's German war report stated that enemy pressure in the northwestern Rhineland and Saar-Palatinate regions had been greatly reduced, and Eisenhower's breakthrough plan had failed. Enemy forces withdrawn from the Aachen and Saar fronts are now attacking the north and south flanks of the German penetration forces. The German side had anticipated these plans and made preparations to respond. On the German right flank, between Elsenborn and Stavelot (northwest of Malmedy), American forces have been forced to launch a rescue offensive, while the American forces on the southern flank are still fiercely counterattacking.

Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - German News Agency: According to the Supreme Command of the Invasion Forces in Europe, German paratroopers have landed in Beauraing, a location on the Belgian-French border, three miles southeast of Givet.

Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to frontline intelligence reports, German forces in eastern Holland have successfully crossed the Meuse River at several locations.

Colonel Iida Discusses the Situation on the Western Front

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) - Colonel Masayoshi Iida, head of the Air Affairs Section of the Japanese Army Aviation Headquarters, who had inspected the area near the battlefield where the German forces are currently launching a new offensive at the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, made the following remarks on the current situation on the Western Front: When the Greater East Asia War broke out, I inspected the area where the reserve forces are currently launching a new offensive. The Ardennes Forest and its surrounding areas, where the Allied German forces are currently conducting their offensive operations, are extremely flat and can truly be described as a peaceful paradise. Because Luxembourg serves as such a buffer zone between three countries, it can be an ideal place to launch operations on the Western Front. The reasons why the German army was able to launch such a large-scale offensive operation this time are: firstly, the recent successful mass production of aircraft, especially the completion of jet aircraft, which was the biggest reason for promoting this large-scale offensive. Germany, as a large factory for this purpose, has been using the same capabilities as before and simplifying procedures as much as possible, resulting in the production of three or four times more aircraft than usual. However, the speed of the produced aircraft is several times faster than that of conventional aircraft engines. Therefore, under the cover of this type of aircraft, 45-ton tanks can advance at will. In addition, the strong National Grenadiers are destroying enemy vehicle convoys everywhere. Therefore, these young people, who have been educated by the Nazi Party for a long time, can truly be called the air special attack force. Because of the German army's silence in the past few months, some have even thought that Germany has weakened. However, this period was a period of relocation or underground dispersal of German factories. However, at present, the relocation of German factories has been completed, and they are producing as usual. In addition, those participating in the Belgian front are all North Germans who are accustomed to the cold. Therefore, they will not be hindered in their operations by the cold in the slightest.

### Key Points for Air Raid Precautions in Public Places; Each Police Precinct Responsible for Enforcement

The Municipal Police Bureau, in accordance with the Municipal Government's regulations regarding air raid precautions in various public entertainment venues within the city, has ordered all such venues to strictly comply with the regulations and has instructed each precinct to be responsible for enforcement. The key points for attention are as follows:

Filing of Air Raid Precaution Status

(1) According to Announcement No. 12110 of the Shanghai Municipal Government, Group 1, Document Hu-zi, dated November 25, 1944, each business venue should fill out two copies of the Air Raid Precaution Status form with the following information. One copy will be kept on file by the precinct in charge, and one copy will be submitted to the Police Defense Division (however, if there are any changes in the information recorded, it should be handled according to the previous item at any time). 1. Type of business. 2. Location and name of the business venue. 3. Address, occupation, name, and age of the operator. 4. Area of the business venue (must be attached with a simplified map). 5. Type and style of the building. 6. Current status of the air defense equipment listed in Article 1 of the announcement and the names, ages, and organization chart of the personnel of each team and responsible person of the special air defense corps listed in Article 3 of the announcement. (2) The alarm transmission equipment must be able to quickly transmit to all parts of the venue simultaneously with the issuance of the alarm. (3) Considering whether the building is sturdy, the most sturdy and safe place must be selected to construct shelter facilities. However, business venues that have always been designated as public shelters should be completely removed at this time, and consideration should be given to constructing their own shelter venues. (4) Emergency exits must be utilized as they have always been. Do not place chairs or stack objects in the passageways or entrances and exits. Strict supervision must be carried out at all times. However, situations where there are no emergency exit facilities or where there are emergency exit facilities but they are inadequate should be reported. (5) Rescue materials, defense equipment, and materials must be prepared quickly and completely. (6) In addition to the water supply, appropriate containers should be provided for fire-fighting water, and they should be filled with water at all times.

Air Raid Alert

Absolutely Prohibited Performances

(7) When an air raid alert is issued, performances should be absolutely prohibited. Therefore, the sale of admission tickets should be strictly prohibited during that time. (8) When a preliminary alert is issued, although the policy of allowing the opening of venues is adopted, if a preliminary alert is encountered during the performance, the issuer should temporarily stop the music and performance. After the planned measures have been completed, the operator should consult the police precinct in charge to determine whether the performance can continue. Therefore, the precinct chief or the police defense director should first request instructions from the Air Defense Headquarters regarding the air defense status. (9) If there is no other suitable place besides using the business venue as a shelter, a report should be filled out, and the precinct chief's opinion should be attached and reported to the Director of the Police Defense Division. (10) Even if the time when the air raid alert is lifted exceeds the prescribed opening time, those who have sought shelter should continue to seek shelter (however, this does not apply if it is the person seeking shelter's own intention, or if the shelter has been lifted by the precinct chief according to the situation, or if it has been permitted by the precinct chief).

### "How Can We Accumulate Twenty Million in Banknotes to Cultivate Ordinary Impoverished Students into Talents?"

An ancient poem says: "How can we obtain tens of millions of mansions to shelter all the poor scholars in the world and make them happy?" This was originally a kind and benevolent statement. However, this kind of benevolence is narrow and passive. For example, if you really had tens of millions of mansions, and you housed the poor scholars of the world in batches, allowing them to eat their fill all day long without doing anything, what good would that do for the country or society? It would only be a high-class public shelter. So, what should be done in the same spirit of benevolence to avoid being narrow and passive? The best way is to donate to the readers' scholarship fund of this newspaper. No matter how much or how little, not a single penny will be wasted. Everyone contributes a little, indirectly cultivating a talent, which is of great benefit to the country and society. Therefore, I want to change the ancient poem here: "How can we accumulate twenty million in banknotes to cultivate ordinary impoverished students into talents?"

After reading the letter of initial donation from Nanyang Middle School, our motivation was inspired. With the support of our Industrial Class 3 classmates, we formed a team called the 'Shanghai New China Middle School Industrial Class 34 Team' and donated 20,300 yuan. Although the amount is small, it is a token of our sincere intentions. Moreover, if everyone in each school and at each grade level works together to solicit donations, then small amounts will accumulate into large amounts, and the predetermined goal will certainly be achieved as scheduled."
