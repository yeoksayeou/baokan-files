### Improving Prison Hygiene

The late Minister of Judicial Administration, Mr. Zhang Yipeng, died of typhus. It is said that the cause of his illness was being infected by lice from prisoners while inspecting the prisoner ward of the Masnan Road Detention Center in this city. Therefore, strictly speaking, Zhang's death was not due to old age, but to the unsanitary conditions of the prison. It is also reasonable to say that. Moreover, Mr. Zhang, with the dignity of a minister, personally went to the prison for on-site inspections. His purpose was nothing more than to improve prison facilities, improve prisoner treatment, and improve prison hygiene. Improving prisoner treatment was exactly what Mr. Zhang planned to improve. Unfortunately, the plan to improve prison hygiene had not yet been realized, and the person who decided on the plan died as a result. We cannot help but mourn for Mr. Zhang. At the same time, we are even more saddened by the future of prison hygiene improvement.

We are certain that when Mr. Zhang took office as Minister of Judicial Administration, he actively paid attention to prisoner treatment, such as striving to increase prisoner rations, raising funds for prisoner medical expenses, and making every effort to solicit donations from all parties to purchase medicines needed by prisoners. These two matters further demonstrate that Mr. Zhang's personal visit to the prison was undoubtedly to inspect prison hygiene and then decide on an improvement plan. Therefore, we hope that in the future, the judicial authorities will first of all quickly plan improvements to prison hygiene. Not only will prisoners benefit universally, but it will also live up to Mr. Zhang's will and comfort Mr. Zhang's spirit in heaven.

The Masnan Road Detention Center in this city is better than general prisons in terms of internal housing facilities, etc., but prisoners are repeatedly ill. It is also heard that the warden is currently suffering from typhus. From this, it can be seen that prisons in other places with even simpler facilities are even more likely to cause disease. For the sake of overall prison hygiene and protecting the lives of prisoners, it is even more necessary to plan improvements as soon as possible.

The purpose of sentencing is not to punish criminals, but to discipline them and hope that they will improve their character. As a result of the improvement, they will become good members of society in the future. Therefore, imprisoning criminals, working hard on their energy, and tempering their will are all appropriate things to do. If the prison is dirty, without regard to cleanliness; if diseases arise, without regard to dispensing medicine; and if prisoners are left to live or die on their own, it is truly a living hell, which is neither permitted by law nor in line with the right path. Based on the principle of improving prison hygiene, we offer a few humble suggestions:

Diligence and labor are the primary duty of every prisoner. For the cleanliness of the prison, prison management personnel should strictly urge prisoners to handle it themselves. According to general assumptions, no matter how simple the prison is and no matter how tight the funds are, sweeping and cleaning should not be abandoned because of this. Moreover, cleanliness is not a luxury, but comes from hard work. After cleaning, it directly reduces the chance of disease transmission and indirectly reduces medical expenses. We hope that the judicial administrative authorities will formulate specific measures and instruct all prison personnel to implement them conscientiously.

Local health authorities should provide special guidance on prison health facilities and liaise with prison management personnel to conduct regular inspections and guidance in the promotion of public health. Medical procedures such as vaccinating against smallpox, injecting vaccinations, and disinfection should be implemented universally in prisons. We hope that the judicial authorities and the health authorities will agree on specific measures and implement them at any time.

Establish prisoner hospitals and clinics, depending on the size of the prison and the number of prisoners, and set them up in the prison. The Ministry of Judicial Administration should raise funds, and if necessary, solicit donations from the public.

Hygiene facilities in prisons, such as bathing places and toilets, should be universally set up, and all cleaning matters should be handled by prisoners.

Although prisoners are detained in detention centers for a relatively short time, attention should also be paid to hygiene. Otherwise, prisoners awaiting trial or those who are innocently implicated are extremely likely to contract diseases once they enter prison. If they are not sentenced to death, they will die nine times out of ten if they have strong resistance. Individual health will be ruined, and public medical care will be wasted.

In short, prison hygiene is not an ideal that is difficult to achieve. As long as the methods are appropriate and the management is strict, it will definitely gradually take effect. We hope that the judicial authorities will actively plan for it.

### Change of Japanese Naval Minister: General Nomura Takes New Post, General Shimada Focuses on Important Military Affairs

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Information Bureau announced on the 17th: Naval Minister Shigetaro Shimada's resignation was approved, and the successor is Navy General Naokuni Nomura, who held the inauguration ceremony at 5 p.m. on the 17th.

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - In order to adapt to the current major war situation, the Japanese government has conducted various reviews on how to concentrate all-out efforts to win. This time, it was decided to change the Naval Minister, and General Naokuni Nomura, commander of the Kure Naval District, will succeed him. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo presented the memorial to the palace at 2 p.m. on the 17th, and the inauguration ceremony was held at 5 p.m. with Prime Minister Tojo standing by. It has been announced by the Japanese Information Bureau.

Brief Biography of Naval Minister Nomura

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Naval Minister Nomura is from Kagoshima Prefecture. He graduated from the Naval Academy in November of the 40th year of Meiji (33rd year of Guangxu). In the 8th year of Taisho (8th year of the Republic of China), he was appointed as a Navy Major and also served as a naval attache in Germany for one year.

In the 4th year (18th year of the Republic of China), he served as a military attache at the Japanese Embassy in Germany. After returning to China in September of the 6th year (20th year of the Republic of China), he served as captain of the Haguro warship. In the 8th year (22nd year of the Republic of China), he served as captain of the Kaga warship. At the end of the same year, he served as the principal of the Submarine School.

Remarks by Director Matsushima

(Central News Agency) - Colonel Matsushima, Director of the Press Department of the Japanese Fleet in China, recently gave a speech on the occasion of Navy General Naokuni Nomura's assumption of office as Naval Minister, clarifying its significance. Colonel Matsushima said: "This time, Navy General Naokuni Nomura personally assumed the office of Naval Minister, so General Shimada, who previously held the dual positions of Naval Minister and Chief of the Naval General Staff, can focus on the important task of carrying out military orders, and the traditional spirit of the Navy, which clearly separates military orders and military administration into two things, has returned. In the past six months, General Shimada, who held two positions, can be relieved of half of his duties, and General Nomura can take on the position of Naval Minister full-time. This is a measure to maximize the effectiveness of naval operations in the current major war situation, and it will have significant implications for the future war situation."

### Navy General Nakamura Discusses the East Asian War Situation: Japan Already Occupies a Geographical Advantage

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Navy General Ryozo Nakamura recently published an article titled "The East Asian War Situation Has Reached a Decisive Stage" in the July issue of "Pacific Magazine," in which he discussed the European and East Asian wars in detail. His discussion of the East Asian war situation is as follows: According to King's statement, the strength of the US fleet is 20 battleships, so all six of the North Carolina class are in service, and it seems that two of the Iowa class have also set sail. It is rumored that three old battleships have been deployed on the Western Front, and the remaining 17 ships, except for those that have been repeatedly sunk by the Japanese army, are all deployed in the South Pacific. It is rumored that six Essex-class aircraft carriers are in service, and five more seem to have entered the water, or will appear on the front line in the near future. Nine Independence-class aircraft carriers are in service. In addition, it seems that there are ships with an unknown number being refitted. Although it is not clear whether some of the aircraft carriers will be deployed in the Pacific, all of the formal or cruiser-converted ships are sailing in the Pacific, and their total number seems to have reached more than 40. In addition to the US fleet, there is also the British fleet in the Indian Ocean, which also has several aircraft carriers. The United States is also planning to build an aircraft carrier formation with a displacement of 45,000 tons, but it will take some time for them to appear on this front line. Although the details of the auxiliary vessels are still unclear, most of the 31 pre-war cruisers and 54 under construction have been put into service as a result of the emergency manufacturing plan after the Pearl Harbor attack. If we look at the map, we can understand that the line connecting the western end of New Guinea, from the Japanese mainland through the Izu Islands, the Ogasawara Islands, the Mariana Islands, Yap Island, Palau Island, and Togobe, is the main line of Japan's defense of the Pacific. In the north, Minami-torishima Island and Oshima Island can be used as forward bases. In other parts, it is extremely difficult to form a line of defense due to the single-line relationship. In the enemy's breakthrough operation, it is inevitable that the enemy will invade the Mariana Islands, successively press on Saipan and Rota Island, attempt to form a Pacific base group, control the surrounding sea and air, ensure the safety of the rear, and attempt to break into China or carry out feint operations to invade the Ogasawara Islands and conduct air raids on the Japanese mainland. For these auxiliary operations, the enemy will never use up all its strength and abandon its main purpose. Once Saipan is captured, the southern end of the defense line will be affected, and it may also allow the MacArthur army to advance from Biak Island and establish a unified coordination of north-south steps. The Pacific theater can be moved to the China Sea. Although we cannot know Japan's highest countermeasures against the enemy at this point, judging from the geographical advantages alone, its victory is undoubtedly on the Japanese side.

### Guilin Begins Evacuation of Population

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing authorities, fearing that the Japanese army on the Hunan and Guangdong fronts will advance towards Guilin, have ordered the citizens of Guilin to evacuate and have ordered that all industrial facilities be moved to the interior as much as possible. Essential facilities that cannot be moved should be destroyed. According to a report from an Associated Press correspondent, the situation in Liuzhou, a key southern street in Guilin, is that Liuzhou is an important transportation hub in Guangxi. The Liuzhou military authorities have issued an evacuation order to the citizens, stating that it is to prevent the danger of air raids and attacks by parachute troops, but the actual reason is still fear of attacks by Japanese parachute troops. The evacuation began on July 17, starting with women and children, followed by key civil servants, and then the general public. Only the army and volunteer army remained in the city.

### National Government Initiates Grand Canal Dredging Plan

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - The National Government, in order to repair the Grand Canal, has been actively preparing, and as a result, decided that the entire project is scheduled to be completed in five years and began on April 1 of this year. It is currently underway. It is learned that the first phase of the project, from Taierzhuang on the border of Shandong and Jiangsu provinces to Guazhou on the Yangtze River, is scheduled to be completed in November. When the project is completed, the Zi River, Huai River, Yangtze River, and Tai Lake can be interconnected, and one-quarter of the total length of the Grand Canal will be unblocked. The coast of this section is the most densely populated and resource-rich area. The opening of the canal is expected to increase the production and transportation of war resources. The development of the National Government in all aspects of politics and economy will also be strengthened.

### Central Memorial Week

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - The National Government held a weekly meeting on the 17th, with all civil servants and military personnel participating. Chief Civil Servant Xu presided over the meeting and reported on the rule of law.

### Hankou Establishes Rice Purchase Office

Hankou, 17th (Central News Agency) - After the establishment of the Hankou Rice Evaluation and Purchase Office, the office was set up in the city's Chamber of Commerce and officially started work yesterday. The office will soon launch new policies and has decided to first set up six rice collection and purchase offices in four suburban areas to facilitate purchase work.

### Focus of National Government's Budget for the Second Half of the Year is Military Spending, Totaling About the Same as the First Half

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Finance held a regular meeting with Chinese and foreign reporters at 10:00 a.m. yesterday (the 17th), attended by Vice Minister Chen Zhishuo, who explained in detail the National Government's budget for the second half of the year, the recent gold buying and selling, the Shanghai stock market, and the universal collection of special consumption taxes. The details are recorded below:

(Budget Issues) The budget for the second half of the 33rd year should have been drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for deliberation, but the actual needs have increased and prices have risen, so the budget has also increased accordingly. It needs to be discussed with all relevant parties. Minister Zhou is scheduled to return to Beijing today to continue consultations with all parties, and a decision can be made. The focus of this budget is on military spending and improving the treatment of civil servants. The budget figures have not yet been formally determined, but the total amount is about more than double that of the first half of the year.

Cracking Down on Gold Speculation

(Gold Buying and Selling) The National Government has not yet completely controlled gold, so it only intends to formulate temporary measures to crack down on gold buying and selling. Newspapers have repeatedly reported on this point. Recently, the price of gold in Shanghai suddenly surged, so the Ministry of Finance recently announced measures to crack down on it, which is actually a targeted countermeasure. The Ministry of Finance originally prohibited using gold as collateral, but some unscrupulous firms in Shanghai disobeyed the order. Now the Ministry of Finance has ordered the China Preparatory Financial Bureau to investigate and check the accounts of these firms. Although the results of the investigation have not yet been submitted to the Ministry, the Ministry is aware that several banks have engaged in this illegal activity. Some of these firms have already been punished by the Ministry of Finance, but because the official report has not yet arrived, their names will not be announced. Since the start of the inspection work, the price of gold has fallen, but other reasons for the rise in the price of gold are the lack of materials, which is also an unavoidable fact.

Unscrupulous Merchants Manipulate the Stock Market

(Stock Market) Since January of this year, the stock market has been declining and has not risen. The legitimate reason for this is that various factories lack materials, power is reduced, and production is reduced, which causes stocks to fall. However, there are also stocks that should not have fallen but did fall, which is related to the unscrupulous firms that manipulate gold trading. These firms use stocks as a powerful speculative force to manipulate the stock market and try their best to make stocks fall. The accounts of these firms have stocks as collateral, and because the stock price falls below the collateral amount, the firms are forced to redeem their accounts. Those who are unable to redeem their accounts, the firms have the right to dispose of the collateral to guarantee their legitimate interests, and the stocks fall into the hands of the firms. Many similar situations have occurred, so the stocks are manipulated by speculators. This kind of mutual cause-and-effect relationship has made the stock market plummet. Recently, because Shanghai has been checking the accounts of various firms, the stock market has slightly improved.

(Universal Collection of Special Consumption Taxes) The collection of this tax was initially stipulated for 15 cities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces and the two municipal districts of Nanjing and Shanghai. The results have been good so far. Since May 16, the tax has been universally collected in all three provinces and two cities. It is estimated to be 120 million yuan per month. Wuhan is also hoping to start collecting the tax, and the Ministry of Finance is currently reviewing it.

Currency Has Not Inflated

(Issuance of Central Reserve Bank Currency) In order to meet the needs, the Central Reserve Bank authorities issued 500-yuan notes at the request of the Shanghai Banking Association. Will the results affect currency inflation and price increases? Let's discuss this separately. First, the occurrence of currency inflation depends on whether the revenue and expenditure of finance are balanced and the supply and demand of social finance. Since the National Government returned to the capital, finance has followed the principle of balancing income and expenditure and prioritizing key areas, so there has never been a deficit, so there is no phenomenon of currency inflation. Secondly, the current demand for social finance is still far from the saturation point, so it will not affect price increases. This is because the Central Reserve Bank and the central financial authorities have repeatedly and carefully studied the issuance of 500-yuan notes and decided to issue them only after ensuring that there will be no impact. Although all banks in the world have reserves, they are all moving towards the legal currency system. The Central Reserve Bank has reserves of more than 60%, which is more than most banks in other countries. Now that banks in various countries are moving towards the legal currency system, various countries will have appropriate handling methods after the end of the war. At that time, our country can also refer to them, so there is no need to worry about increasing currency issuance.

### Wuhu Rice Prices Rise Again

Wuhu, 17th (Central News Agency) - The price of rice in this county once soared, but recently, due to the absorption of Shanghai merchants, it has risen again. First-class machine-milled white rice is 3,800 yuan, second-class is 3,400 yuan, and top-quality rice is sold for 3,200 yuan.

### Civil Servants Who Pass the Higher Civil Service Examination Receive Original Salary During Training

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - The authorities specially submitted this year's temporary higher civil service examination to the National Government, and instructed all agencies to pay civil servants who pass this year's higher civil service examination their original salary during the training period.

### Flour and Wheat Committee Delineates Purchase Areas in Central China and Implements a Deposit System

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Flour and Wheat Committee of the Business Integration Council has been promoting the "Provisional Measures for the Purchase of Flour and Wheat" and the "Provisional Measures for the Manufacturing and Processing of Flour and Wheat" since they were formulated last year to promote the purchase of wheat and the manufacture of flour. In order to promote the work more smoothly, it has been decided to implement a deposit system for wheat and flour factories in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai. The deposit is stipulated to be 30,000 yuan for wheat shops and 50,000 yuan for flour factories. In addition, in order to avoid friction between regions and to increase the purchase as much as possible, purchase areas have been delineated in various wheat-producing areas in Central China. The delineated purchase areas are recorded below: Shanghai Area: The entire area along the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, from the customs and railway line to Huangdu, Shanghai, Baoshan, Pudong, Jiading, and Chongming. Suzhou Area: Along the Beijing-Shanghai line from Anting to Kunshan, through Suzhou to Wangting, Wujiang, Dachang, Changshu, and Qingpu. Wuxi Area: Along the Beijing-Shanghai line from Zhoujinggang to Wuxi, through Shitangwan to Luoshe, Jiangyin, and the northern area. Changshu Area: Along the Beijing-Shanghai line from Henglin, through Qiyi Weir to Yixing. Nanjing Area: Along the Beijing-Shanghai line from Louzhenshan to Nanjing, and along the Tianjin-Pukou line from Pukou to Puzhen, Jurong, Shenshui, Jiangning, Jiangpu, Liuhe, and Donggezhen. Zhenjiang Area: Along the Beijing-Shanghai line from Danyang, through Zhenjiang to Longtan, Jintan, and Rongyang. Wuhu Area: Along the Nanjing-Wuhu line from Caishi, through Wuhu to Wanzhi. Also, the Huainan line Guangzhou and Digang, Tongling, and Hexian. Bengbu Area: Along the Tianjin-Pukou line from Huaqiying, through Chuxian, Luodian, Mingguang, Linhuaiguan, to Bengbu along the upper reaches of the Huai River. Yangzhou Area: From Yangzhou, through Shaobo, Gaoyou, and Sishui, to the Grand Canal, including the Xinghua, Huxi, Tianchang, and Yiwei areas. Taixian Area: Taixian and Jiangyan, Dongtai, Mengcheng, and Nantong. Anqing Area: The area from Datong to Anqing along the Yangtze River.

### Success of Japanese Surprise Attack on Myitkyina Airfield; Marshal Terauchi Sends Congratulatory Telegram; Encourages Japanese Air Force to Continue Efforts

Central News Agency Dispatch from the Burmese Front Lines, 17th: The Japanese air force successfully launched a surprise attack on the Myitkyina airfield, a base for airborne troops in northern Burma, destroying 39 P40 fighters and Douglas transport aircraft. Upon hearing of this glorious victory, Marshal Terauchi, Supreme Commander of the Southern Area Army, sent a telegram of congratulations, encouraging them to continue their efforts. This surprise attack was launched during heavy rain. Upon arriving over the western side of the enemy airfield's runway, 23 P40 fighters and Douglas transport aircraft were found parked side by side on the ground. As soon as the squadron leader gave the order, all aircraft suddenly dove down, and upon releasing the first bombs, the fierce P40 aircraft were completely shattered, and black fuel spread across the ground. The entire airfield was engulfed in fierce fire and smoke.

Ledo Road Will Be Unusable

Central News Agency Dispatch from Guangzhou, 17th: The Ledo Road, which replaces the Burma Road, can be said to be the lifeline of the Chongqing regime. Its construction is currently receiving assistance from American technicians, who are working hard on its construction. According to intelligence from the area on the 14th, American technicians and Chinese laborers are working hard on the construction of the Ledo Road, regardless of the weather. However, the work is difficult, and due to continuous rain since June 4th, the water level is several feet deep, forcing the construction to stop. If Japan exerts further pressure, the road will become unusable.

Difficulty Replenishing Chongqing-American Troops

Central News Agency Report: According to a dispatch from Kunming, the Chongqing-American forces operating in northern Burma are attempting to replenish their troops after suffering heavy blows from intense Japanese bombing. The Chongqing military decided on the 15th to send an educational corps currently undergoing training in Guiyang to replenish one of the major divisions of the country, and they arrived in Kunming on the 14th, awaiting air transport. Recently, the second and third divisions will also arrive in Kunming. It is ultimately proving difficult to replenish losses with troops transported by air, so the Chongqing side is finding troop replenishment truly challenging.

Thoroughly Destroy Chongqing-American Bases

Furthermore, after losing their front-line bases in China, the Chongqing-American air force retreated and is now working hard to prepare their second-line bases. However, the Japanese air force is also repeatedly bombing their second-line bases in Guilin and Danzhu with swift attacks. Within at least three to four hundred kilometers along the Beijing-Hankou and Guangdong-Hankou lines, the Chongqing-American air force bases have all been placed under the threat of the Japanese air force. As a result, the Chongqing-American forces on the Chinese coast have become silent and inactive. As the Japanese military is pursuing the Chongqing-based American air force, forcing them to retreat into the inland areas around Kunming and Chongqing, the losses of their air force personnel and aircraft are heavy, and they seem to be in dire straits. As a result, America's prestige in the Chongqing region will also be lost, which will inevitably lead to the Chongqing side reflecting on their situation. The Japanese air force aims to thoroughly destroy the Chongqing-American air force, continuing its bold attacks.

Fierce Fighting on the North Bank of the Lian River

Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, 17th: According to a dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing side released the following battle situation on the evening of the 16th: The Japanese army on the Hunan front launched a fierce attack on the outer defenses south of Hengyang on the night of the 13th, and a portion of the troops broke into the streets of Hengyang. At noon on the 14th, the Japanese army received reinforcements of large units with various types of light and heavy equipment, and on the same night, they completely encircled Hengyang and launched a fierce attack simultaneously. The Chongqing defending troops resisted with artillery and infantry, and the fierce fighting continued throughout the night without stopping. On the 15th, the Japanese army again bombarded the streets of Hengyang with field artillery, and Japanese infantry units, under the cover of field artillery, strongly attacked the entire defensive positions outside the city, with the attack on the southwestern outer defenses being particularly fierce. The Japanese army on the Guangdong front advanced north on the west side of the Guangdong-Hankou line, crossing the Lian River, Yan River, and their tributaries, and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Chongqing army in the area on the north bank of the rivers. There is also fighting west of Qingyuan.

### Reasons for the Failure of the Chongqing-American Air Force Counteroffensive; Insufficient Aircraft Preparation

Central News Agency Dispatch from a Certain Japanese Front-Line Base, 17th: The annihilation battle against the Chongqing-American air force on the China front has gradually intensified since the Japanese air force bombed the Suichuan airfield on April 12th. In the two months since then, the Japanese air force has braved severe weather to crush the strong counteroffensive of the Chongqing-American air force. At the same time, they supported the progress of land battles and placed further pressure on the Chongqing-American forces. During this period, a total of more than 550 Chongqing-American aircraft were shot down, destroyed, or detonated by bombing. Furthermore, since the fall of the Chongqing-American air force's Hengyang base, the Chongqing-American air force has put up a desperate resistance against the repeated attacks by the Japanese army, even bombing the Japanese mainland of Kyushu. However, the Japanese army had foreseen the Chongqing-American aircraft's attempt to raid them and had taken measures to counter them, so the American army's move ultimately ended in complete failure. The biggest reason for their failure was that they used the P-108 model aircraft too early. This can be demonstrated by comparing it to the German army's cautious approach to using the V-1 flying bomb, which resulted in brilliant battle achievements. Looking at the American army's B-29 aircraft, not only were their reserves and replacements insufficient, but so was their fuel. Under such circumstances, it was only natural that their attempt to raid Kyushu would fail.

### Ba Maw Sends Telegram to Chairman Wang to Express Gratitude

Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 17th: A delegation from the Special Investigation Group of Burma recently came to Nanjing to inspect the actual situation of our country's construction and the state of cultural affairs, and the National Government warmly received them. It is now learned that Mr. Ba Maw, representative of the State of Burma, sent a telegram to Chairman Wang of our National Government to express his gratitude. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "To His Excellency Chairman Wang of the National Government of the Republic of China: I am greatly pleased and grateful to receive your letter upon the arrival of the Special Investigation Group of Burma in your esteemed country. I sincerely express my gratitude for the warm hospitality and various conveniences extended by Your Excellency and your government to the Burmese investigation group. I deeply believe that this move has great historical significance, as it will enhance the direct relationship between our two countries and symbolize the unity of the New East Asia. Ba Maw, Representative of the State of Burma."

### Central Officials Initiate the Reconstruction of the Zhou Gong Temple

Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 17th: Since the Incident, the Zhou Gong Temple has fortunately been preserved thanks to the arrival in Shandong of Commander Tajima of the allied nation of Japan, who appreciated the sacred sites of Qufu, which embody the spirit of Oriental benevolence. However, due to the passage of time and lack of repairs, and to make the birthplace of Eastern culture magnificent again, Central Officials Chu Minyi, Mei Siping, Li Shengwu, Lin Baisheng, Xu Suzhou and others have initiated a fundraising campaign to rebuild the Zhou Gong Temple in the ancient city of Lu, so that virtuous people of the present age can jointly witness this sincerity and contribute their small efforts.

### Guangdong Province Plans to Issue Increased Production Savings Bonds

Central News Agency Dispatch from Guangzhou, 17th: In order to vigorously strengthen its production efforts and further inspire the public's enthusiasm for saving, the Guangdong Provincial Government has decided to implement measures to absorb general idle funds in order to increase its combat power. Recently, the issuance of increased production bonds and savings bonds has been decided by the Provincial Government and submitted to the National Government's Executive Yuan for approval.

### Electricity Restrictions in Hangzhou

Central News Agency Dispatch from Hangzhou, 17th: In order to conserve coal, the Huazhong Water and Electricity Co., Ltd. has appropriately reduced the amount of coal allocated to its branches in various parts of Central China. Regarding Hangzhou, the original coal allocation was 1,400 tons, but from the 16th of this month, it has been reduced to 700 tons. After receiving the notice, the Hangzhou branch held an emergency meeting yesterday and decided to reduce the amount of electricity used by each household by one-half, based on their usage in June. The electricity usage standards for June, from June 15th to July 16th, will be recalculated by re-examining the meters. To remedy the situation, strict restrictions will be imposed in an effort to conserve electricity.

### Soong Mei-ling Arrives in Brazil

Central News Agency Dispatch from Guangzhou, 17th: According to news from Chongqing, Soong Mei-ling, due to poor health, left Chongqing on the 9th of this month with a doctor, cook, and several others, and arrived in Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Brazil, on the 13th to recuperate.

### Eastern Front: Focus of Summer Offensive

At a time when Anglo-American forces are invading the European continent, and Germany's astonishing new weapons have appeared, with the world's attention focused on the Western Front, the anniversary of the German-Soviet war on the Eastern Front has quietly arrived. Three years ago, on June 22nd, Hitler decided to deploy elite German troops to attack the Soviet Union with overwhelming force, and now it is the fourth year. What will be the trend of the fourth summer on the Eastern Front? Based on the Soviet Union's current attitude, it can be divided into two directions:

The first view is that the Soviet Union will fully exploit the opportunity of Germany facing two fronts and will launch a major offensive on the main Eastern Front. The offensive on the Finnish front is just a small-scale operation to remove obstacles in the north before the start of a major offensive.

The second view is that Stalin will pursue a conservative, calm, independent, and pragmatic policy to allow the conflict between Germany and Britain to intensify, and when both are exhausted, he will seize the opportunity to recover the lost territory in the East in one fell swoop.

The German View

However, powerful German circles believe that the former view is reliable. It is indeed a fact that the Soviet army has been preparing a major offensive on the entire Eastern Front since early May. This is because the Soviet Union is not only satisfied with recovering its lost territory. For example, assuming that the Anglo-American forces gradually approach the German border, the Soviet Union would never be content with simply recovering its lost territory. The issue of the postwar treatment of Germany, which is the biggest problem in postwar Europe, is still unresolved among the three countries of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, who dream of final victory. Therefore, the army of any country that first enters Berlin is likely to be the decisive factor in the right to speak after the war.

The Soviet Union now holds the initiative in the attack, and naturally occupies the most advantageous position by watching the progress of the landing operation in northern France. However, this kind of observation is also limited. If the German army drives the Anglo-American forces out of Western Europe, the German army will return to the East to annihilate the Soviet army. Conversely, if the Anglo-American forces really gain a foothold in Western Europe and begin to put pressure on the German army, competition will arise among the three countries of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet Union is not allowed to observe quietly in any situation. Therefore, the Soviet Union will launch a major offensive at a certain stage of the Western European landing operation. This period depends entirely on the progress of the landing operation. When the German reserve forces are fully deployed to Western Europe, the Soviet Union will seize this opportunity, which goes without saying. As for this period, some say it will be after the fall of Cherbourg, and others say it will be when the decisive battle unfolds on the French plains near Paris. The German side is of course prepared for all of this.

Location of the Offensive

Speaking of where the Soviet Union will launch its offensive, the Soviet army is now deploying offensive forces on the entire front line of about 2,000 kilometers, and is stationing its main force in the following four key areas, waiting for an opportunity to move.

First, the corps advancing towards Riga from the Pskov-Ostrov area of the northern front.

Second, the Belarusian corps in the Vitebsk-Gomery area.

Third, the corps facing Lviv head-on from the Rovno-Ternopol area.

Fourth, the corps advancing on Romania from the Yassi-Kishinev area in the south.

In short, the Soviet Union's summer offensive can be launched anywhere. However, what the German side is most wary of is that Stalin will seize the right moment in the Western European battle situation and seek a decisive battle in one fell swoop, attempting to break through the central front, that is, the line from Minsk to Lemberg, and enter the Polish plains. The Soviet army has concentrated more troops in this area than elsewhere. The German air force is also extremely active, and is conducting fierce bombings of Soviet concentration areas and troop stations behind the central front, such as the railway intersection southeast of Vitebsk and the Gomery station, in order to prevent the Soviet army's activities.

### German Elite Troops Inflict Heavy Casualties on the Enemy in Recapturing Hill 112 Near Caen; Minimal Progress for American Troops in Southern Cotentin

Central News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 17th: German News Agency Report: Southwest of Caen, after hours of preparation by British land artillery and the main artillery of the , on Saturday evening, the British launched an offensive against the high German positions on Hill 112 northeast of Esquay and neighboring areas. Enemy warships shone searchlights, illuminating the battlefield to facilitate the British mission, so the contours of the battlefield were clearly visible. However, the British did not expect that the German defenders could also take advantage of the battlefield lighting, and the advancing British tank and infantry formations were clearly visible. In hours of fierce fighting, the enemy's fierce attacks on Hill 112 were repulsed and suffered heavy casualties. However, the German army failed to prevent the enemy from attacking from the flank and breaking in, so the British were able to temporarily reach the northern outskirts of Esquay. However, they encountered extremely strong resistance from German reserves there, and most of the British assault units were annihilated in that area, while the remnants had to flee in all directions. German automatic weapons and several heavy grenade artillery units pursued the fleeing British troops. By Sunday morning, the entire battlefield in the British offensive zone had returned to German hands.

Propaganda Efforts Prove Futile

At the same time, the British Second Army has been quiet for a long time, and a large-scale enemy is preparing a large-scale offensive, aiming to break through the German line and advance to the outside of the Orne River. The British army used loudspeakers to carry out propaganda, inducing German soldiers to defect, but this effort was futile, just like their throwing leaflets from airplanes into the German front. In the area held by the American First Army, the American army is also reorganizing its troops, so a new large-scale offensive is expected here as well.

Wasteful Shelling is Not Worth the Cost

The German army's disengagement operation towards the Lessay-des-sesves line was not hindered by the enemy, and the La Roserie area has been taken by the British army. Within 24 hours, the American army fired 45,000 heavy and medium shells in the area around Sanloh, and 30,000 shells of various sizes in the Lessay-St Germainesur Aya area. Although the American army expended so many bullets, the result was still no significant progress.

Treacherous War Tactics

Near StPierre de Semily, east of Sanloh, the American army used a new, criminal tactic. Several enemy soldiers carried red cross flags and posed as medical personnel with stretchers, advancing towards the German line. But when they approached the German position, they suddenly attacked the German army.

German Aircraft Active in the Skies Over Northern France

Central News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 17th: German military authorities explained the activity of the German Air Force on the 15th as follows: From midnight on the 14th to the morning of the 15th, British bomber squadrons made large-scale bombings of railway centers in northern France and the suburbs of Paris. German night fighter squadrons took off to meet them and engaged in fierce aerial combat, shooting down several four-engine bombers and destroying several other aircraft. On the evening of the 14th, German bomber squadrons, in cooperation with fast bomber squadrons, bombed anti-axis ships anchored in the Seine Bay, hitting many targets. On the 15th, German bomber squadrons carried out carpet-bombing of anti-axis tank groups in the Caen area and the Carpiquet area, destroying several tanks.

### German Commander in Western Europe Expresses Determination to Annihilate the Enemy

Central News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 17th: Houtong News Agency: Marshal Kluge, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army in Western Europe, told field reporter Zhang Bo: "We will continue to strike the invading European forces so that they will never forget it." Kluge, who previously served as Commander-in-Chief of the German Army in the Central Sector of the Eastern Front, was injured, but the 62-year-old Marshal remains in extremely good health.

Steel Tempered in Fire

He said, "The time I have spent outside and the injuries I have suffered can be said to have set a new record. I have flown over the front line more than 2,000 times, have been shot down twice, and have had several car crashes. Once, I was rescued from a burning car. After the last injury, I participated in night raids from midnight to the morning of the 15th, when British bomber squadrons made large-scale bombings of railway centers in northern France and the suburbs of Paris. According to Jun's night battle team, they took off to meet the voices and engaged in fierce aerial combat, and fired and destroyed its four engine bomber. German bomber squadrons, in cooperation with fast bomber squadrons, bombed anti-axis ships anchored in the Seine Bay. Hit multiple bombs. On the 15th, the German bomber squadron carried out a carpet bombing of the anti-axis vehicle group in the Caen area. When the car was bombed, several vehicles were destroyed. Also exercise gymnastics, now it is extremely strong.

Skilled in Defeating the Enemy

Regarding the combat methods of General Eisenhower's army, he said: "Our opponents do not have an obvious spirit of fighting. The British, American, and Canadian armies must advance after their artillery and bombs have destroyed all obstacles. The enemy's operations take a safe approach and fight in Europe with absolute scientific methods. We use the knowledge of struggle to deal with this method, but military leaders cannot reduce their chances. We will use various countermeasures to deal with the enemy's less methods. At that time, the world will know the effectiveness of this measure."

Seize Opportunities

When a reporter asked whether "D-Day" had caused chaos in Western Europe, Kluge replied that we are now waiting for the enemy's new attack at any time, and we will strike it so that they will never forget it. He also expressed the hope that Europe's eight battles will be waged in a heroic manner. He was shocked when he stood in front of the half-destroyed Rouen Cathedral, which the German army had saved from the catastrophe in 1940. Regarding his subordinate Marshal Rommel, he said that Luo has extensive experience and worked with him in the 1940 Western European campaign.

### US Steel Production Sharply Reduced After the War: Strikes Are the Biggest Reason

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch from Washington) - Due to labor unrest and insufficient labor, the United States has not been able to achieve its expected steel production goals. According to Reuters, the biggest obstacle to steel production is the illegal strikes that have occurred. Therefore, to increase production, the first thing that must be resolved is the strike and labor problem.

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Looking at the United States' steel production volume, the pig iron output in 1939 accounted for 30% of the world's total, and steel ingots accounted for 36%, ranking first among all countries in the world. After the outbreak of World War II in that year, in order to solidify the foundation of the military industry, it more actively developed the steel industry. Especially since the end of 1941, when the Greater East Asia War broke out, the United States has been increasing steel production even more vigorously. From July 1, 1943, to the present, the production capacity of steel ingots has reached more than 98.77 million tons. Due to the expansion of iron smelting capacity, the efficiency of steelmaking has also increased accordingly. From January to September 1942, the average monthly efficiency of steelmaking reached 98%. From the above, it can be seen that the United States' steel production has reached its peak (raw materials sector and its obstacles).

Iron Ore

The estimated reserves of iron ore in the United States are approximately 10.953 billion tons, accounting for 17.9% of the world's reserves. According to the reserves of various American countries, the total is 26.886 billion tons, accounting for 46% of the world's total. In 1939, the production volume of iron in the United States was 72 million English tons, accounting for 36.5% of the world's production volume. In 1940, it had increased to 73.8 million English tons, breaking the previous record of 73.28 million English tons. In 1939, the iron ore reserves in the United States were in the three states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, especially the area of Lake Superior, which had the largest output, accounting for 83.7% of the country's total production. The iron content was 52%, which is the highest grade of hematite. As mentioned above, raw material iron ore is the foundation of the steel industry, and the United States is particularly self-sufficient in this regard. Most of the iron smelting plants are located in the northeastern states, so the transportation of iron ore is subject to considerable restrictions. For example, the distance for transporting iron ore from the Lake Superior area is 1,500 nautical miles on the lake. After landing on the shore of Lake Erie, it still needs to be transported by rail for 166 miles to reach the consumption site, Pittsburgh. Therefore, lake transportation is the biggest obstacle. Since the outbreak of the war, the United States has ceased transporting grain by lake and has devoted all its efforts to the transportation of iron.

Copper and Manganese Ore

This kind of mineral is particularly sulfur-free and is also a raw material for special steel, so it is an indispensable raw material for the modern steel industry. Due to the insufficient supply of copper in the United States and the increase in demand, a severe situation of excessive disparity between production and demand has formed. According to its domestic production, in 1940, it was only 40,000 English tons, and at that time, almost all of it relied on imports. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, due to the difficulty of imports, the source has been cut off.

Coke

The raw material for obtaining iron is coking coal. Currently, the production capacity of coke is slow, so the supply and demand are extremely uncoordinated. This is also a major obstacle to the increase in silver and iron production in the United States.

Scrap Iron

As a raw material for American steel, its importance surpasses iron ore. Currently, due to the urgent need to increase steel production, the demand for scrap iron has also increased accordingly. However, the supply of scrap iron is limited. Especially since the establishment of the highest price for scrap iron in 1941, its source has further decreased. Moreover, the industrial areas for manufacturing scrap iron and the central locations for iron smelting are not consistent. The freight for scrap iron on the Pacific coast and the Gulf region is also inconsistent. The target for scrap iron recovery in 1943 was 27,192,000 tons recovered by oneself and 14,386,000 tons purchased, totaling 41,578,000 tons. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to carry out large-scale preservation of scrap iron.

### Chongqing Lacks Materials; Urgently Needs US Aid

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Chongqing's Finance Minister, Dr. H.H. Kung, met with a reporter from the Associated Press on the 16th and stated Chongqing's difficult situation, saying that President Roosevelt had said that the situation in Chongqing was serious, but this should not be considered dangerous. Because the Japanese army has taken possession of land in China before, this is a danger not only to Chongqing but also to the United States. However, it is impossible to ask soldiers to wage war empty-handed. Since the United States is called the world's arsenal, it should aid Chongqing. More than half of Chongqing's US$500 million loan remains. The main target of this loan is not cash but materials. Chongqing's inflation is not caused by paper money but by a lack of materials. High prices and insufficient materials can lose the will to fight. If the Chongqing army is to continue the war, then aiding Chongqing with materials and strengthening Chongqing is a prerequisite. Because when there are no materials at all, things cannot be done. Therefore, materials are Chongqing's weapons in the struggle against inflation and in the battle against the Japanese army. As for the transportation problem, there is a way to solve it.

### Thai Tin and Antimony Mines to Be Extensively Mined

Bangkok, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Thailand, which is actively advancing from an agricultural country to an industrial country, has discovered through geological surveys that the ground contains tin, tungsten, and antimony mines, which are important military resources in modern warfare. In the future, they will be extensively mined to meet military needs. According to a survey by the government, the range of these mineral deposits spans eight counties, covering an area of 3,000 square kilometers. Currently, the investigation of the mined ore is underway. The mining of tin, tungsten, and other mines has already begun, and the mining of copper and other mines will begin soon.

### Sweden's Neutrality Remains Unchanged

Stockholm, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: Swedish Foreign Minister Günther stated in a speech yesterday that Sweden's policy of neutrality, although not generally recognized by various neutral countries, has gradually gained respect over the years. Among the belligerent countries, neutral countries are naturally not welcome, and foreign criticism naturally shifts with interests. The goal of the Swedish government remains to preserve Sweden's freedom and peace. If Sweden can maintain its neutrality until the end of the war, it will do its best to assist countries devastated by war.

### Soviet Army Expands Offensive on Northern Section of Eastern Front; German Army Mounts Vigorous Counteroffensive on Southern Section

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: Yesterday, after receiving reinforcements from rifle divisions, the Soviet army expanded its offensive on the northern section of the Eastern Front. Upstream of the Prypiat River, west of Ternopil, and west of Lutsk, the enemy was supported by powerful tank formations, and their purpose was clearly to quickly break through the German lines towards Lviv (also known as Lemberg). However, they were defeated. German anti-tank guns have been attacking in this war zone for two days. The German army withdrew from several positions under heavy enemy pressure in order to plug the places where the enemy had invaded.

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: Although the German army increased the deployment of tanks and infantry formations on the 15th, the Soviet army still failed to achieve its goal on the southern section of the Eastern Front that day. A powerful general tank force participated in the battle in Ternopil and, in a vigorous counteroffensive, plugged a gap that had been broken through the previous day. Southwest of Lutsk, the Soviets continued to attack with nine rifle divisions, but were still repelled. West of Lutsk, the enemy attacked several times with a regiment of troops, but were unsuccessful. The fighting in the Neman River area is even more intense. The German army advanced from Grodno (located within the old Polish border, near Lithuania and East Prussia) to the west bank of the Neman River.

### Bloody Battle Record of Biak Island

Bleeding on a Desert Island

The enemy forces that landed in Hollandia, New Guinea, on April 22nd have since gradually increased their strength, and the atmosphere in the southwestern Pacific has become tense. As expected, on the morning of May 27th, under the cover of intense naval gunfire and dozens of aircraft, the enemy began to land a large force near Bosnek on the south coast of Biak Island.

The enemy army led with amphibious tanks, using dozens of boats full of landing troops to approach the coast. The Japanese garrison on the island, who had long been aware of this, suppressed the burning anger in their hearts and lured them closer to the shore. Once the enemy army approached the shore, the Japanese army immediately bombarded the enemy from the coastal positions. The enemy amphibious tanks, which were confident due to the cover of the large mobile force, were arrogant and forward, and were the first to be destroyed when they were ambushed by the Japanese army. The boat troops following behind also suffered significant damage. After landing safely, a few of the tanks that landed saw that all the subsequent troops were repelled, panicked, and retreated back into the sea, fleeing in disarray.

After suffering an unexpectedly strong counterattack from the Japanese garrison, the enemy army approached the coast again on the same day with naval vessels, lined up in formation, and launched fierce close-range fire. At the same time, the enemy air force, which had obtained a base on Ahu Island south of Biak Island, also responded to the attacks of the naval vessels and continuously bombed the Japanese army's positions. With the support of the naval and air forces, the enemy landing forces then used fresh troops to invade the coastline from Bosnek to Mokmer, 11 kilometers to the west. The Japanese army near the Bosnek coast gathered its main force in the high ground behind, which was conducive to attacking the enemy army, and launched a night attack, a masterpiece of the Japanese army, against the landing troops who had gained a foothold on the coastline and attempted to invade the center of the island, intercepting the enemy army and inflicting heavy blows. However, under the impact of the enemy army's tanks, the fierce bombardment of the artillery, and the bombing of the aircraft, the Japanese army also suffered continuous casualties, and the blue blood stained Biak Island red.

Scorched Earth in a Dense Forest

On the one hand, the Japanese army, which was entrenched in caves west of Mokmer, fiercely attacked the enemy army that landed in Wardo and was advancing westward with tanks and armored vehicles, responding to the main force and launching a heroic counterattack, temporarily confining the enemy army to the southern coast area.

The Battle of Verdun, the fiercest battle in World War I, is said in the history of war to have changed the shape of the mountains and rivers in the vicinity. Today, on the second day after the enemy army landed on Biak Island, its air force dropped as many as 300 tons of bombs in one day on the Japanese army's positions near Mokmer. Coupled with the fierce covering fire of the artillery, the situation was more tragic than the Battle of Verdun. Under the rain of artillery shells, the tropical dense forest instantly turned into nothingness, leaving only a piece of scorched earth, full of desolation. However, although the enemy army spared no expense, pouring out so much gunpowder and steel, the Japanese army was not afraid at all and remained unmoved. In difficult circumstances, under continuous hard battles, they demonstrated unparalleled courage and used a steel-like will to bravely attack the enemy army with flesh and blood and inflict a strong blow.

Ready to Die

Look at the Japanese soldiers' spirit of readiness to die!

On May 28th, the fourth day after the enemy army landed, in the battle near Mokmer, a company of Japanese soldiers led by Captain Yokoyama suddenly encountered a strong enemy tank group. They suddenly spat fire, and Captain Yokoyama was the first to be hit and killed in action, and many others were injured. Sergeant Isayama and Private Takahashi cursed "Damn it" through gritted teeth and quickly lay down beside the road. At this time, enemy tanks rumbled over the ground, constantly spewing out a string of bullets. Sergeant Isayama and Private Takahashi suddenly crawled forward, secretly approaching the tanks. In the blink of an eye, Sergeant Isayama suddenly stood up, holding a bomb, and rushed towards the bottom of the enemy tank's track. With a loud bang, the tank flipped over, spitting out raging flames. Private Takahashi was a few seconds slower than Sergeant Isayama and also rushed towards the third tank in the same way, producing a series of ear-splitting explosions. After that, this tank could no longer move and was also emitting thick smoke. How tragic was the action of these two brave warriors who embraced bombs and perished together with the enemy tanks! Even ghosts and gods would have to retreat three times.

In the face of such a fiery fighting spirit of the Japanese soldiers, the remaining enemy tanks retreated in a panic. The enemy army had lost its courage.

Great Victory in the Night Raid

In such a hard and fierce battle on Biak Island, on the night of the 29th, Lieutenant Sato led a team of brothers and boldly attacked the enemy army's road construction unit's encampment north of Bosnek, wiping out about 40 enemy soldiers and seizing many spoils, including flame throwers, establishing a glorious achievement. In addition, a certain lieutenant also led a small team of his subordinates to launch a surprise attack on the enemy army near Bosnek in the dark of night. The enemy soldiers were at a loss in a panic and were slaughtered by the Japanese army in a flurry of attacks, leaving behind 150 corpses, weapons, ammunition, food, and countless other supplies. On the desert island near the equator, in an adverse situation of vastly unequal strength, the Japanese soldiers were not discouraged at all, maintained a strong fighting spirit, and demonstrated a spirit of great fearlessness.

A Brief Biography of Mr. Zhang

Mr. Zhang Yipeng, from Wuxian, was born in the eleventh year of the reign of Emperor Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty. He was a successful candidate in the imperial examination in the guiwei year of the nineteenth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu. In the thirtieth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu, he went to Japan to study and graduated from Tokyo Hosei University. In the thirty-third year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu, when Beijing was preparing for judicial independence, Mr. Zhang personally drafted the trial implementation regulations for the Beijing courts at all levels and then served as the first Chief Prosecutor of the Beijing Local Court. He was subsequently transferred to serve as the Chief Prosecutor of the Yunnan High Court. At the time of the Wuchang Uprising in the xinhai year, local gentry elected Mr. Zhang as the Yunnan representative. Without fearing danger, he rushed to Nanjing and participated in the revolution. During the first and second years of the Republic of China, the government established the Pingzheng Yuan and Suzheng Ting to improve governance. Mr. Zhang was appointed as the Presiding Judge of the Third Chamber of the Pingzheng Yuan, handling many important cases, especially the cases of Wang Zhi and Liu Zhizhong, officials convicted of banditry, both of whom were sentenced to death, shocking the government and the public. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, when Mr. Zhang was serving as the Vice Minister of Justice, the government recovered the Chinese Eastern Railway and specially appointed Mr. Zhang as the special envoy to prepare for the takeover. He was stationed in Harbin for a month and established the Eastern Special District Court and Prison. After resigning from his official position, Mr. Zhang practiced law in Shanghai and other places for nearly twenty years, redressing grievances and protecting human rights, which was highly regarded by society. During the thirty-first year of the Republic of China, Mr. Zhang witnessed the urgent need for lawyers in Shanghai society and did not hesitate to dedicate himself to serving the public interest. He was always fair, law-abiding, and meticulous in his work, and was especially respected by his colleagues. In the autumn of the thirty-third year of the Republic of China, Mr. Zhang's elder brother, Zhongren, passed away in Sichuan. Mr. Zhang was deeply saddened by the brotherly love and wrote an elegy for his brother, with sincere and truthful words. At the beginning of this year, the central authorities valued Mr. Zhang's talent and knowledge and earnestly sought his service, appointing him as the Minister of Judicial Administration. Mr. Zhang initially declined due to old age, but ultimately, with the desire to reorganize the judiciary as his lifelong ambition, he resolutely stepped forward to accept the appointment, hoping to focus on it for half a year, carefully planning and gradually reorganizing, and personally inspected the judiciary in North China, traveling long distances without complaint. He also inspected prisons and personally entered the cells. Unfortunately, due to accumulated overwork, he fell ill in Beijing on July 5th, suffering from spotted fever, and passed away on the 15th at the age of seventy-three.

### During the Henan Campaign, Chongqing Soldiers Returned in Droves; Interview with Director Liu of the 24th Group Army

General Pang Bingxun, Commander-in-Chief of the 24th Group Army of the National Government, after the tragic battle in the Taihang Mountains on May 6th of last year, with the full support of the Allied military authorities in North China, General Pang resolutely led his troops to comply with the order to return to civilian life and participate in transportation, sparing no effort in reorganizing and training his troops. Major General Liu Tianxing, Director of the Political Training Department of the army, recently came to Shanghai on official business, and our reporter specially visited him to report on the situation of the army as follows: Recently, during the Allied forces' Henan campaign, many Chongqing soldiers requested to return to General Pang's command, such as the Hebei Advance Army of the 12th Army led by Qiao Lizhi, the troops of Wang Guoran, and the guerrilla forces directly under the First War Zone of Wei Fenglou, all of whom admired the greatness of General Pang's personality and were willing to return. I have already reported this to Chairman Chen. According to the anti-Japanese Chongqing army, there are four levels: the most elite are the adjusted divisions, followed by the reserve army, then the temporarily organized army, and finally the guerrilla forces. The troops previously commanded by General Pang were his directly affiliated army, the 40th Army, and the various guerrilla forces in the Taihang Mountains. The 40th Army was an adjusted division, and the 27th Army was a reserve army, so the cadres of the 24th Group Army are different from other units. On June 17th, the Heilongma regiment of the Communist Eighth Route Army and the Southern Detachment, numbering over three thousand, launched a fierce attack on the 8th machine gun company of the 116th regiment of our 31st division in the area of Liuweizi, east of Weihui, Henan. After our battalion commander Li rushed to the scene, they were completely defeated. In this battle, in addition to an unknown number of enemies captured, over two hundred were killed or wounded, while we only suffered four deaths and ten injuries, achieving a great victory.

### Press Conference at Allied Embassy

The Shanghai office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held its regular press conference at the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund in Nanjing Road yesterday (17th) at 2:30 PM.

### Shanghai Branch of the China Youth Corps Held Inauguration Ceremony Yesterday

The youth corps organization in this city has been largely completed since the city corps headquarters began organizing it a year ago. In order to assist in improving the city's youth corps organization, the Shanghai branch of the China Youth Party School took advantage of the summer vacation of various schools and consulted the city corps headquarters authorities to select over a hundred teachers and staff from various schools across the city, as well as instructors of youth corps at all levels, to provide them with rigorous training, hoping to cultivate strong cadres to lead the youth of the present era and truly assume their due tasks and missions. Since the beginning of this month, all the trainees have undergone intense training under the scorching sun. Yesterday (17th) at 9:00 AM, the school held an inauguration ceremony for the completed organization of the school corps headquarters. Mr. Xi Peiwen, Deputy Commander of the City Corps, personally presented the flag and delivered a training speech. The ceremony was simple and grand. After the flag was presented, Wu Pengfei, the battalion commander of the school's trainees, led the reading of the oath and the singing of the Youth Corps song. The ceremony ended at 10:00 AM.

### Staff of the Grain Rationing Association's Permit Issuing Office Openly Engaged in Malfeasance; Apprehended by the Grain Protection Patrol Team

The Shanghai Security Department, in order to facilitate the transportation of rice from the four suburban counties to Shanghai by rice merchants and improve the people's food supply, specially assigned the Special Task Force to organize a transportation patrol team, led by Captain Weng Tiandan, to specifically investigate unscrupulous elements along the way who extorted money from rice transporters. Since the team has been carrying out its duties, the situation at the designated rice transportation entry points in the city has greatly improved. However, on the 12th of this month, Xu Jinkui, a staff member of the temporary permit issuing office established by the Grain Rationing Association in the Zhoujiaqiao area of ​​western Shanghai, dared to disregard the ban and secretly issued more than fifty temporary permits for transporting rice, colluding with Zhou Mengkang, the owner of the Futai Rice Shop in the town, to sell them to rice merchant He Achang, and divided the proceeds. The patrol team learned of this incident and immediately arrested Xu Jinkui, the staff member of the office, and Zhou Mengkang, the owner of the Futai shop. Fearing that the matter would escalate, Xu and Zhou dared to incite others to bribe them with 30,000 yuan in cash in an attempt to settle the matter. After the third team leader of the patrol team reported the information, Zhang Kaiqin, the acting team leader, personally went to the scene and arrested the perpetrators and the bribery money. Captain Weng interrogated them separately. The perpetrators confessed to illegally selling temporary permits for transporting rice and attempting to bribe after being arrested. Captain Weng stated that there are clear provisions in the law to facilitate the entry of food for the people. The perpetrators dared to collude with each other and engage in malfeasance, hindering legitimate merchants, and dared to openly attempt bribery after the incident, which was extremely audacious. In addition to intensifying the supervision of various rice transportation entry points to prevent such unscrupulous elements from engaging in malfeasance again, the one thousand perpetrators were transferred to the Shanghai Security Department. It is reported that they will be severely punished according to the law.

### Regarding the Appropriateness of Arbitrary Punishment in the Baojia System

Since the recovery of the concessions in this city, the unified police administration and matters that should be reformed have gradually improved. Recently, the Baojia Section of the First Police Bureau of this city, in order to minimize various punishments related to the Baojia system, specifically issued orders yesterday to the police substations in the Lujiawan, Taishan, Huangpu, Changshu, and other districts of this city, stating that in the future, for Baojia-related application procedures that are mistaken or delayed, arbitrary fines should not be imposed. Although police penalties are stipulated by law, consideration must be given to both the law and the people's sentiments. In Baojia matters, the bureau hopes to take a supervisory and guiding stance, providing detailed explanations to the public who are unfamiliar with the procedures. For those who are negligent or intentionally violate the regulations, the matter should be handled according to the severity of the circumstances, following the police regulations through a specific procedure. Each substation was ordered to comply and to inform their officers to conduct inspections at all times, refraining from imposing penalties rashly in order to alleviate the people's difficulties.

### Supplementary and Correspondence Schools Should Immediately Register

Since the Education Bureau of this city began handling the registration of all private supplementary schools and correspondence schools in the city, various schools have been enthusiastically complying with the order and applying for registration one after another. However, there are still some supplementary and correspondence schools that have not yet completed the registration procedures with the bureau, either due to unfamiliarity with the procedures or time constraints. According to a reporter who spoke with the person in charge of the bureau, the deadline for all private correspondence schools and supplementary schools to apply for registration is the end of July. It is hoped that all schools will complete the procedures at the bureau before the deadline. Those who continue to wait and see or refuse to register will be severely punished.

### Financial Bureau Tax Collection Office Investigates Business Turnover of Commercial Firms

The collection of business tax in the South, Wusong, Huacao, and Nanshi districts of this city by the Financial Bureau has always been based on quarterly investigations and a single collection. Recently, due to the sharp increase in the cost of living, the quarterly turnover of various companies, commercial firms, and factories has also been increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the collection methods for business tax in each district. It is learned that the Wusong, Nanshi, Huacao, and Punan tax collection offices under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Finance Bureau are now preparing to investigate the business turnover of the various companies, commercial firms, and factories in their respective districts, in order to make adjustments.

### A Factory Recalling the War

—Police Inspector Jimei

Recently, every morning at seven o'clock, forty or fifty female students mobilized from the Northeast march past the front of the Metropolitan Police Department in Tokyo. Led by their teacher, this group of students sets off from the dormitory near the police department to the factory. They wear white headbands, sing labor songs with vigor, and wear neat uniforms, exuding sincerity and enthusiasm. Looking out the window, I sincerely admire this genuine expression. Hard work, hard work! Please persevere to the end! And the mothers who love their daughters, coming from distant, remote places to the bustling city of Tokyo, cannot help but shed tears when they see this spirit of selfless sacrifice.

But what is the situation like in the factory where these female students are working today? As the police chief and head of the industrial mobilization headquarters, I went to dozens of companies and factories under my jurisdiction.

Attendance Rate

What is the attendance rate of female students in all the factories in my district today? How much has production increased smoothly? How is the person in charge directing and proceeding? Is the administrative system running smoothly without any problems? I know all these questions completely. In an instant, I thought of these factories at one o'clock in the morning.

All factories hold morning meetings at 7:00 AM. Each group leader checks the personnel. Because if there is no roll call, the overall attendance and production efficiency of the factory for the day will not be known. The factory director compiles the group leaders' reports and reports to the company's general manager, and also notifies the mobilization headquarters of the police department.

Around ten o'clock, each factory in the district calls in. The police department staff answer the phone. Every day, they say the same thing: "Is this the ○○ Manufacturing Plant? How is it going today? Is the attendance rate 93%? Hard work, hard work! Please work hard!" All the police department staff are very concerned about the factories.

There are many small and medium-sized factories in the district. In the past, each factory had its own strengths and weaknesses, and it was difficult to increase production. But what about recently? All the factories are working very well. Of course, they have not yet reached perfection, but there are some excellent factories. In particular, the workers are very dedicated. Even the senior bad elements with malicious intentions are moved by the workers' enthusiasm for labor. The attendance rate has also improved. Recently, things have been going a bit smoother, so the overall average of each factory has reached a good score of 88%. From the general manager to the employees, everyone is present at the factory between 7:00 and 7:30. The factory is filled with a refreshing and enthusiastic atmosphere.

However, it would be far from the truth to say that there are no bad elements among them. For those workers who are absent from work too often, the police department sends people to investigate or summons them for questioning. Most absentees do so not out of necessity, but because of selfishness and laziness. They participate in things they think are profitable and abandon their factory work. This is the general reason for their absenteeism.

Even if these degenerate elements come to the factory every day, they do not work diligently, so they have a bad influence on others. As long as there is a profit to be made, they immediately run to other factories. In factories with such employees, senior personnel such as the deputy manager have failed to personally direct the work properly. The following has happened recently.

Because there was a factory with a poor attendance rate, I asked the manager about it and said that his guidance was poor.

He replied to me very definitely, "No, there is no such thing." The manager did not accurately know the attendance situation of the workers. Therefore, I showed him the attendance rate table for each factory prepared by the police department.

"Indeed, that's how it is!" Then the manager looked at me and started nodding.

Of course, sometimes the deputy manager is too busy and has no time to take care of the daily affairs of the workers, but they should allocate their time to go to the factory, personally ask about the workers' lives, and often encourage them. Only in this way can the company and the factory have good attendance rates and production efficiency. I believe that so-called personal command is definitely not just a matter of rolling up your sleeves and inspecting.

Factory Family

I convene a symposium for the heads of each factory once a month. The venue is the Industrial Patriotic Hall. Everyone is like at home, without any reservations, openly and honestly contributing opinions on increasing production.

On the one hand, all the factories in the district are combined into seven teams to organize the promotion team. The promotion team is divided into teams and goes to the factories of other teams to check the methods of improving efficiency and point out various production problems in order to strengthen production. Naturally, the principle is not to hinder other factories, and the inspection lasts for two or three hours before leaving. At the same time, the police department also sends a police officer to accompany them. The report from this promotion team is also presented at the symposium. Sometimes, if there are suitable people, they are invited to give lectures on the current situation. After many such symposiums, the heads of the factories who previously excluded each other gradually became close. They shake hands with each other, with a sense of fighting to the end. It is truly a delightful thing. When the intimacy between the factories deepens, the police and the factories become very close. When something happens, they consult with the police, and some workers also come to consult about problems.

Generally speaking, all the factories in my district are progressing smoothly. Among them, there is a factory that I admire the most. I will briefly excerpt and record it.

Mr. Nakajima, the general manager of ○○ Watch Co., Ltd., is an elderly man of 75 years old this year, but he has a spirit of vigor despite his age, and he is usually at work before 7:10 in the morning. The production efficiency of the company is very high, and the following happened at the end of last year.

"Now that the prices in Japan are so high that we cannot live, can we increase our allowances?" This was a request from all employees to the company. So General Manager Nakajima said:

"What you say is very true, and everyone's hope is not unreasonable. I also want to meet everyone's urgent needs, but I would like everyone to consider one thing. This is not a special matter. I believe that there has been too much waste in the company before. In the future, we will eliminate the waste, and the money saved can all be used as everyone's allowance for everyone to enjoy."

As a result, all the employees rose up and responded to the general manager's words. Even the smallest pencil stub is used, and the back of the paper is also used for writing. As a result, the waste was reduced by three yuan a month. The company also contributed 2,000 yuan, a total of 5,000 yuan, as a family allowance for the employees. What a meaningful thing this is!

I believe that from the manager to the employees, everyone must have a spirit of cherishing the factory. The employees must develop a feeling of not wanting to leave the factory, and at the same time, they must work hard for the factory without complaint.

One Heart and One Mind

On the other hand, the administrative staff must also be serious. At ○○ Camera Co., Ltd., the administrative staff and the workers go to work together in the morning. After 5:00 PM, the administrative staff run to the factory to help the workers with various miscellaneous tasks. They finish the work, such as tidying up after the workers have finished their work, or cleaning. Only by doing this can the workers be willing to work hard.

Recently, the workers have been very busy, and they don't even have time to get a haircut. Because the barber shops are already closed after they finish work. Therefore, the barbers in my district discussed and decided to serve at the workers' dormitory. This can be said to be service, or it can be said to be consolation. The workers from the countryside are very happy. Because they are busy at the factory, they cannot get a haircut with peace of mind. But when they return to the dormitory after finishing work, and after eating, when they have nothing to do, they start getting their hair cut. It really feels like being at home. The workers receive the warmth of family love. So some of them even shed tears of gratitude and say, "Thank you!" The barbers are also very moved and say, "Please work hard!"

"Since we started going to the dormitory to cut hair, we really feel that this is service, so we are very happy." This is what the barber said when he saw me visiting. When I see this situation, I want to help the workers as much as possible. It is based on this mentality that I used my days off last year and the year before to organize amateur theater troupes twice. When the performance begins, the workers elect actors from the factory to help. This is because they love their own factory, so they have achieved very good results.

Therefore, the workers can carry out raids against the enemy, the United States and Britain, in the factory. From 4:00 PM, it is the raid time. When the advance horn is blown, everyone wears a white headband. During this hour until 5:00, everyone invigorates their tired bodies from the day and works with all their strength. My daughter, who ran to the factory to work after school, said very moved after this raid time was over, "I want to work in that factory!"

I believe that the factory must also be filled with the spirit of true Japanese people. Managers, guards, workers, administrative staff, etc., all must be of one heart and one mind, striving to increase production, and must establish truly awakened and dedicated Japanese factories.

### Review of Rice and Grain Problems in Various Regions: Utilizing Administrative Institutions

Fourth, when operating the contribution system, it is better to adopt the Baojia head-centered approach rather than the township head-centered approach. There are many criminals among the township heads because they are regarded as "traitors" by the enemy bandits, so most ordinary people are unwilling to be township heads. As a result, they are often occupied by rascals and bad elements. Of course, under the anti-communist pacification work, there are also good model township heads, but in terms of fee collection, abuse should be avoided, and people above the township head level should be used. The Baojia heads are relatively more likely to be residents of the village, mostly farmers who care about the situation in the village. Therefore, it is hoped that the Baojia head-centered purchasing strategy will be implemented, and that normal cooperation between the business firms and the Baojia heads and their residents will be established.

Fifth, the national government and the Rice Control Commission should pay cooperation fees for the cooperative purchase of administrative agencies.

Purchasing cannot rely on the individual efforts of each business firm. It is absolutely necessary for all relevant agencies to provide guidance and assistance. There should be assistance fees for administrative agencies. The expenditure of these fees should not be a formal bonus to the county magistrate. The most cooperative contributors and purchasers should be accurately identified. At the same time, administrative agencies should never act as purchasing agents. This must be strictly rooted out.

Sixth, the contribution quota should be based on the Baojia unit, and the Baojia head should proportionally allocate the quantity to each farmer's household, and determine it according to the cultivated area and the number of family members. Unfair quotas, such as previously giving more lenient treatment to self-cultivating farmers and stricter treatment to poor farmers, should be eliminated.

When stipulating the quota, the cultivated area and the population of the Baojia should be used as the basis. The report of cultivated area is extremely inaccurate, and there are various malpractices. Although this is sometimes reported, setting the quota based on the area itself becomes a cause of unfairness. For example, there is a tenant farmer who cultivates seven mu of land and a self-cultivating farmer who cultivates fifteen mu of land. If a uniform amount is stipulated per mu, it is obviously unfair. The difference between the harvested amount and the amount used by the farmer's household should be deducted as the contribution amount. Therefore, it is best to stipulate that the quota is the smallest for poor farmers, and more for middle peasants, landlords, and absentee landlords. The realization of quota fairness is not only a technical problem, but the quota should be fair, and farmers should not groan under an excessive burden.

Seventh, the farmer's loss caused by the difference between the contribution price and the market price should be protected by allocating necessary materials at a subsidized price. If the material allocation cannot be implemented quickly, a contribution bonus must be paid to avoid a large loss for the farmers.

How the purchase price will be determined in the future is still unclear, but the problem of price difference will inevitably occur unless a comprehensive policy of purchasing at market prices is adopted. The allocation of exchange materials is certainly necessary, but if it is delayed, its effect will be halved. Its allocation should be implemented during the peak purchasing period. If this is difficult to implement, a bonus system must be adopted for contributors as soon as possible.

Eighth, in order to realize the simplification and speed of purchasing, the special and civil use purchases should be distinguished. The special use should be the responsibility of the Rice Control Commission, and the civil use rice should in principle be purchased freely, and the administrative agency should implement the local civilian food rice policy.

As Shanghai and other places in the mainland will advocate this method, the special use rice should be purchased in the early stage in order to realize it. If the work of the Rice Control Commission is delayed until the period between harvests, as in the past, this will not only hinder the security of special use rice, but also increase the insecurity of the future of civil use rice, causing a more profound rice problem.

In summary, the administrative purchasing system can continue to be used in the future under a comprehensive reform policy. (Translated from the Continental New Report, June 25)

### Air Raid Shelter Construction Essentials: Shelter Size

The size of the shelter is not a critical issue, as it is for a short period. As long as the family can all fit inside, even if it is a little cramped, it does not matter. Generally speaking, one square meter is enough for four adults to sit or two people to lie down for shelter.

If a shelter accommodates too many people, the impact will be huge if it is hit by a direct hit bomb. Therefore, the scale of each shelter should be kept as small as possible, and shelters that accommodate many people should be built separately.

### In the Case of Tall Buildings

In offices in concrete and steel buildings, the building itself has considerable bulletproof effectiveness, so the rooms can be used immediately as shelters. However, in general, the second-floor rooms from the top floor, the rooms on the ground floor that are close to the outer walls, the rooms near the ground and adjacent to the roof of the building that are close to the outer walls of the escalator, or the rooms facing a small atrium, or particularly large rooms, etc. are less safe compared to other rooms, so they should be avoided as much as possible within the possible range. Floor surfaces above the second floor (excluding the first and second floors from the top mentioned above) and not facing the outside, such as in the corridor, or on a floor not close to the outer walls, are particularly safe to use.

If all the rooms on the first and second floors are to be used as shelters due to various circumstances, the windows and entrances are easily destroyed by bombs, and shrapnel and air currents will enter, and glass will shatter. Therefore, sandbags should be piled up in front of the windows to a height of one person, and protective walls should be set up at the entrances and exits to create protective equipment that prevents shrapnel and air currents from entering through these openings.

In addition, it is even safer to appropriately partition the rooms used as shelters, such as with something like an easel. This method can be studied.

### Huacheng Company Liquidation: Shareholders to Share Profits and Losses, Hoping Other Companies Will Follow Suit

In order to maintain credibility and protect the interests of shareholders, the board of directors of Huacheng Industrial Company in this city decided to convene a temporary shareholders' meeting for voluntary liquidation, selling off the assets, and using the proceeds to recover the shares, returning the full face value of the shares. It has been learned that the general public in this city and the holders of the company's shares have expressed that Huacheng Company's measures are to maintain the general trust in Chinese stock trading and to assist the authorities in stabilizing the social economy, and they have all expressed their appreciation. At the same time, it is also hoped that other companies with listed stocks will automatically liquidate and return the funds if they are in the same situation as Huacheng Company. However, whether there is a profit or loss after the sale of Huacheng Company's assets compared to the total amount of 50 million yuan in shares should be clearly reported at the shareholders' meeting, and the accountant should be asked to verify the accounts. If there is a loss, it should be shared by the shareholders in reverse. If there is a profit, in addition to returning the full face value of the shares, the profit amount should be distributed to the shareholders after deducting expenses.

### Banking Association Announces Half-Year Bill Figures

### Indian News Record

— Gao Jian Shun

During my time in Rangoon, I read a book introducing India, "Indian Essays" by Robert Byron, which discussed many of India's complexities. In conclusion, it said that India was originally the most difficult country to unify, one of the many reasons being the relationship of the terrain. The poet's observation is very meaningful. Byron has traveled extensively in India, and the vast plains of India, the vast wilderness within sight, show no change in appearance. "Indian scenery lacks color and form. So uniformity is almost all terrifying." It is such a lack of change, on the contrary, this monotonous and unified terrain, of course, there can be no unity in social and political aspects. This is what Byron said. Nature itself is a country of extreme harmony and unity, and its inhabitants are unwilling to live a unified life. All aspects of divisiveness among the Indian people are said to occur naturally.

There is no need to add [?] about Britain's divide and rule policy, which is known to everyone in the world. Byron, a British man, wanted to use the point of view of political geography to defend its claim for such a prominent and notorious policy. It is very interesting to read his article on this point.

The best example of the divide and rule policy is the number of India's astonishing princely states. Now let us briefly introduce its general outline. One country with a population of more than 60 million participating in the Princely Conference and each having a seat is 108; [?] There are 127 two [?] princely states with a population of more than 8 million and sending 12 representatives to the Princely Conference. There are another 327 small principality states (according to the 1931 survey).

Britain has arranged such a number of princely states in its directly governed territories, but it is obstructing the unification of India, that is, preventing the unification of the anti-revolutionary movement. In addition, the treatment of the princes is allocated to establish friction and infighting among the princes. [?] The foolish princes, because they are loyal to the United Kingdom, will try to improve their treatment as much as possible. — This is the Indian political complexity created by the British.

As for India's "specialty," the friction between Hindus and [?] co-religionists is not known to everyone, and there is no need to add [?]. However, when I met a high-ranking Indian in Rangoon, he lamented that it was after the British invasion of India that it became a "specialty."

Almost all races of India live in Rangoon, and most of the races live in separate districts, that is, even if they are the same Benares people, they must be divided into absolutely different Hindu Benares areas and [?] Benares areas. Even restaurants and vegetable stores, Indian [?] believers and [?] believers also have their own different places to enter and exit. Any small [?] fire food [?] , [?] are also frequently [?] . Therefore, any place that simply accommodates [?] guests will hang a [?] with a star and moon in front of the door to prevent Hindu [?] from breaking in. Hindus will never patronize stores run by the same Bengali, as long as they are run by [?] Bengalis.

The complexity of religion does not stop there. The customs of Hindus are even more complex and strange. For example, servants and [?] servants have different identities. The identity of a cook is a more humble profession than that of a servant. So when we were in Rangoon, we would use Indian [?] servants. Because the war was very fierce, we ordered the cook to work as a servant at the same time, but it was not successful. Therefore, we ordered the servant to work as a cook, and this also encountered the strict refusal of Yanzhou. People with high status doing work with low status will damage the identity of the gods, so it is absolutely "impossible." It is also in accordance with God's will that those with low status do not do work with high status. Regarding identity, I am not ignorant, but I actually want to know. This is a very strange country. What is meant by common sense is that when talking about Indians, we must also know that there are many races, such as the Aryan, [?] Mongolian, and Dravidian. [?] Bose is an Aryan Indian. Famous figures such as Tagore, Ramakrishna, and Vivekananda belong to the Aryan system. The famous Ms. Neyidewo belongs to [?] Gaoer.

But in actual research, it is not so simple. Even if they are Indians of the same Aryan descent, if they are from Bengal Province, they speak Bengali, if they are from Punjab Province, they speak Punjabi, and if they are from Gujarat, they speak Gujarati, and they cannot understand each other. Strictly speaking, they all regard each other as "foreigners."

On December 8, 1942, many things were done in Rangoon, one of which was the Indian Congress. An Indian Independence League lecture was held on the square. Representatives from various Indian groups in Burma, celebrities from all walks of life, etc., enthusiastically debated, believing that the long-cherished wish, the period of Indian independence and liberation, has been approaching. However, when the Tamil (Dravidian) spoke, only the Tamil people among the Indians in the square understood Tamil. Most of the other Indians did not understand it at all. So it was translated into English [?] for the audience to listen to, but this was only for some Indians who understood English [?] . Therefore, in order to allow [?] only English-speaking Muslim Indians to listen, it was translated into Urdu, the official language of the Muslims, but [?] Indians [?] did not understand, so it had to be translated into Hindustani. This is really a troublesome thing.

The complexity of India is fully expressed in this meeting. When such a complex speech ended, a demonstration parade began. I stood at the corner of the street, watching such a long line of characters, and I was very moved. Look! The [?] believers and Hindus of canine hatred, aren't they carrying [?] in friendship and peace?

Please see again! Aren't the lowly also marching with the monks of the high status? The wealthy merchants of [?] and Mumbai also participated in the demonstration parade together with the poor Tamil laborers. It was the British who created such racial divisions in India in the Middle Ages. Now this shackle has been shattered. Under the great goal of Indian independence, all Indians have abandoned [?] their differences and united. The unity seen in this demonstration parade on December 8 soon formed the [?] of the Indian National Army.

And the National Army has already advanced into India. India has already abandoned the complexity of India as promoted by the British, and has seen the united posture of the Indian people. The independence of India will destroy the [?] control of the British, liberate India, and at the same time liberate the Indian people from the deformed complexity.

### Curbing the Black Market for Gold

The price of gold has been rising for years, and the reason for this is the impact of the current situation in recent years. However, the rise in gold prices is particularly easy to stimulate rising prices. As a result, the city authorities have repeatedly tried to make gold prices tend to be stable, but ordinary speculators do not understand the overall situation, act against the public good, stir up trouble, and raise gold prices to satisfy their selfish desires; and the Taiping people have also failed to consider the difficult times, and have always been blinded by greed, hoarding a large amount of gold to protect the value of their property. It must be known that one person seeking profit and all people vying to buy can not but make gold prices soar. And stimulating prices, disturbing people and harming oneself, and causing panic among the people, there is a tendency to be restless all day long. If this continues, what can be imagined! In addition to expressing our deep regret, we hope that the authorities will quickly take appropriate measures, which is a matter of urgency. The fluctuations in gold prices in the past three years are briefly described below:

I remember that from February to May of the previous year, the price of gold per 1,000 taels (with each tael as a unit) continued to jump to 1,800 yuan. In mid-June, due to the replacement of the old and new legal tender, it once jumped to 4,000 yuan in old legal tender. On the 17th of the same month, the new legal tender was uniformly used, and the price of gold was also changed from 4,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan by 20%. Therefore, although the new and old legal tender were calculated at a ratio of one to two, the price of gold remained calm and unhurried, and by the end of the year, it had already broken the 3,000 yuan mark!

Subsequently, in February of last year, the price of gold rose from 3,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan. The authorities ordered the closure of the four major silver houses, namely Qiutian Shi, Lao Fengxiang, Xin Fengxiang, and Fang Jiuxia. And other major silver houses also immediately and automatically closed. Although they repeatedly requested to resume business, the authorities believed that the matter was related to the stability of finance, and it was necessary to carefully consider appropriate measures in the future. It was delayed until April 21 before resuming business, and it was stipulated that the limit price of market transactions should not exceed 5,000 yuan. Therefore, for two months, the price of gold was as calm as ever. By July, ordinary speculators stirred again, and at first, because of the authorities' strict measures, they did not dare to despise the law, and did not dare to exceed the limit price. But as time went by, they became playful, and re-launched the waves, approaching the 10,000 yuan mark. Later, due to the purchase of cotton cloth, rumors said that the residual sound might affect gold, so after Wanzhi reached the 8,000 yuan mark, the authorities took appropriate measures. For half a year, gold has always been stable at the 10,000 mark, and prices have not been much affected, and the people's hearts are stable, which is indeed a period of peace and prosperity.

Until the end of January to mid-February of this year, the aftershocks were re-launched, and the price of gold soared from 10,000 yuan to 14,000 yuan. Until the end of February, the Central Reserve Bank, due to the rise in gold prices, which affected the stability of finance, allocated a small portion of its inventory, tens of thousands of taels of gold, to silver houses for dumping. At the same time, it sold as much as possible at a low price of 11,500 yuan. It can be seen that the fiscal authorities care for the people's hardships and seek to suppress prices, and for a time, they have eliminated the rise in gold prices. However, it was not for many days before the distribution was stopped, resulting in the failure of all previous efforts, which is regrettable.

Since the Central Reserve Bank stopped distributing gold, the silver houses also stopped business. Until March 11, the authorities implemented a gold allocation system, and appropriately increased the selling price to 15,000 yuan. At the end of March, it once fell to 13,000 yuan. In April, it slightly returned to about 14,000 yuan. Until the beginning of May, it was still hovering between 14,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, within this month, it rose by 100 yuan every day, so by the end of May, it was 18,700 yuan. In mid-June, it had exceeded the 20,000 mark, and by the end of June, it had risen to 27,300 yuan every day. Especially in the month of Muyue, the wind of rising prices was more intense, reaching 37,500 [?]. If this crazy rise continues, it will really affect the stability of the entire finance.

It is found that the rise of gold prices in recent months is due to the imperfect allocation market. Each silver house in the city sends staff members to the city market every day to listen to the market prices, and purchase according to the needs of the store, without any obstruction. Unexpectedly, before long, ordinary silver houses from other places also registered for allocation in Shanghai, which is reasonable. However, there are unscrupulous elements who take the opportunity to sell the allocated gold to the black market at high prices, seeking to satisfy their personal pockets. As a result, the average allocation number of each silver house in this city has decreased, which is enough to affect the retail business, making it impossible to cope with customers, and customers have to turn to the black market for entry. As a result, the higher the price in the black market, the higher the allocation price by the authorities, forming a trend of rising every day.

Due to the rise in gold prices, the stimulation of prices is profound and huge. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that the allocation to other places will be stopped immediately. The above two points are the most urgent things.

### Stock Market Changes and the Future of Shanghai's Economy

— Zhang Shizhou

Since the beginning of spring this year, all things have risen in price, but only the stock market has been depressed, and has been falling continuously. Most small-cap stocks have fallen far below the par value, about 50% lower, and the better ones are still hovering around the par value. Various gangs and large accounts have repeatedly implemented short-selling, deliberately suppressing market prices, so that popular stocks and unpopular stocks have both collapsed and plunged. Most small investors were so frightened that their souls flew away, and many stock firms were also stranded and liquidated. This period was the most vicious period since the stock exchange resumed business, and all parties almost talked about the stock market with a change of face. It is conceivable how bad the outside world's impression of the stock market is.

After the vicious development of the stock market made the authorities pay close attention, the authorities of the Central Reserve Bank, based on the instructions of the upper authorities, announced on July 10 that they would reorganize the pledge of Chinese stocks. It was also rumored in the market that the authorities would establish a Chinese Stock Stabilization Fund to maintain the normal development of stock prices. When the news came, people's hearts were greatly encouraged, and the stock market showed a new atmosphere that had never been seen before since the 12th.

The securities market has always been the best place to accommodate floating capital. According to investigations by relevant parties, no less than ten million [?] yuan of floating capital in the city is used for commodity speculation. This omnipresent floating capital has already caused no small harm. In addition, what can teach gold to not rise greatly and prices to not skyrocket in the past six months after the huge amount of capital withdrawn from the stock market? The common people have simply suffered greatly, and the middle and upper classes have also felt that their burdens are gradually increasing. Therefore, if we want to stabilize the current unstable economy of Shanghai from the storm, what other way is there besides inducing floating capital to return to the stock market, so that the people's livelihood and industry will immediately benefit from it? The government should quickly plan concrete and special policies to deal with it.

The reasons for the stock market's depression can be described as follows. In the past, because there were many rumors and credit was tight, the stock market was very weak. As soon as it heard the rumors, it blindly sold off, and the psychological panic was abnormal. In addition, a small number of members among the Guang Gang, yarn flower gang, and bank gang took the opportunity to sell short, and many short positions were added to the market, so can prices not fall sharply? In particular, the bank gang often uses customers' pledge materials to sell short on a large scale in the stock market, suppressing market prices and profiting from it, which is the most hateful thing that endangers the entire economy. It is hoped that the Central Reserve Financial Inspection [?] will expose or advise on it within the possible scope, so that the [?] breeze [?] [?] [?] , then the future of the stock industry will be fortunate.

In the course of this long-term decline, large-cap stocks and small-cap stocks have both fallen by an average of 50%. Although the responsibility mainly lies with short-selling speculators, the unhealthy nature of the company enterprises themselves of these small-cap stocks cannot be blamed. The indiscriminate increase in capital has caused a large increase in the stock [?] , and of course, a vicious overabundance will occur. In the future, it is hoped that the company enterprises [?] ask whether it is not [?] perfect, and should imitate the method of the supervisory resolution of Huacheng Industrial Company, and appropriately recover the stocks at par value. Those who have not paid dividends for the previous year will pay generous interest to the shareholders in order to maintain credit. At the same time, the powerful large accounts will also do their best to maintain it. Once the investors' interest is drawn back, the stock market can surely show its edge greatly, and the large absorption of floating capital will naturally not be a problem. In addition, it is hoped that the relevant authorities and the Central Reserve Bank will urge and work hard to establish Shanghai's new economic market. Prices can fall, and the people's difficulties can gradually be alleviated.

### Charity Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Cultural Relics Receives Enthusiastic Purchases from All Sectors

Since its opening, the Charity Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Cultural Relics has seen a steady stream of visitors daily, causing considerable crowding. Due to the overwhelming number of precious items received, it is impossible to display them all simultaneously, so they will be rotated in succession. Currently, no fewer than several thousand items are on display, a dazzling and breathtaking sight. Most notable are a painting of a divine falcon by Song Zheng, which will be sold in a competitive charity auction, as well as landscapes by Liu Bowen and calligraphy and paintings by Tang Bohu, all rare and invaluable treasures.

In addition, there is a photography exhibition by Mr. Lin Zihong, housed in two separate rooms, showcasing his latest spring travel works, which have been highly praised by the audience. The antique section features an ivory "Loving Son" figure over a foot tall, exquisitely carved; a large Yuan dynasty Jun kiln double-eared vase with raised floral decoration; a Song dynasty Jun kiln tiger pillow; a Kangxi famille verte vase; a Kangxi blue and white vase; Qianlong jadeite and white jade pieces; as well as bronzes from the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, and various famous porcelains, all exceptionally valuable. To meet the requests of visitors, the organizers have specially invited renowned calligraphers and painters Qian Hailong and Xu Hanchen to showcase their skills every afternoon, starting today, to add to the artistic atmosphere.

Seeking Classrooms for Charity School

To Whom It May Concern: Our school is jointly organized by several deaf-mute teachers with the aim of promoting education for the deaf-mute and benefiting fellow sufferers. It has been established for two years. Previously, the school building was shared with another institution, but recently, due to plans for that site, the landlord has given us a deadline to move. The school has no choice but to seek alternative premises. However, due to these extraordinary times, finding a suitable building is not easy, and as the staff are mostly deaf-mute and of limited means, despite repeated attempts to negotiate subletting, no satisfactory outcome has been achieved. Nevertheless, in order to uphold our original intention, we cannot bear to see these disabled students abruptly deprived of their education. Therefore, we have no choice but to plead for help from the outside world. If any kind-hearted individuals or schools can lend us one or two classrooms to allow us to continue teaching and benefiting deaf-mute children, it would be an immeasurable act of kindness. Sincerely, Guangzhen Deaf-Mute School (Temporary address: No. 20, Renheli, Laochan Bridge)

We, a group of young professionals in this city, are concerned about the decline of the social economy and the increasing number of students dropping out of school. We are willing to dedicate our spare time to run a free night school, offering classes from 7 to 9 pm every evening, completely free of charge, and providing books. Therefore, we are seeking two classrooms. If the authorities of schools in the Old Zhabei District and the New Chengdu District can appreciate our sincerity and offer cooperation by lending or subletting classrooms, please indicate the rent and send a letter to No. 40, Fuming Village, Fuxu Road, or contact us by telephone at 39759. We would be extremely grateful. Sincerely, Shen Wen

Donation of Medicine

Shanghai Girls' High School sent a letter stating: "We are writing to inform you that a certain impoverished student of our school received financial assistance from your newspaper. Deeply grateful for your newspaper's service to society and its benevolent support for the needy, she has solicited Mr. Lin Zhengxiong for twenty boxes of Zhongying Shasha medicine, totaling eight hundred bottles. Please ask your newspaper's service center to distribute them to impoverished teachers. We are immensely grateful." This student, having received help, does not forget to repay society's kindness, and in turn, helps others. Her aspirations are commendable. We will distribute the medicine on her behalf. All impoverished teachers may write to us to request it.

Donations for Medical Aid

Medical aid is one of the four services provided by our office. Its purpose is to help the poor and sick, and relieve suffering and danger. Those whose families are truly impoverished and unable to afford medical treatment can apply to us for assistance or be introduced to contracted doctors and hospitals for free treatment.

Donations for medical aid provide opportunities for the poor and sick to receive treatment. The grace of this action is widespread, and the merit is immeasurable.

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

Sakura and Gunkan (10)

The jovial Lieutenant Yuasa, regardless of others' pleasure, dragged Ichito and Takao into the living room, led Takao to the guest seat, and introduced him to everyone. "Ah, this is good enough. Please have a drink!" Takao thought Lieutenant Yuasa was a straightforward person. The introduced Ensign Nitta was a sturdy man with subdued eyes and broad shoulders. Another Ensign, Hara, was a gentle and quiet person like a statue. These two looked at Ichito as if they knew him well and, after giving him an affectionate look of greeting, started chatting.

Two or three sake pots were arranged on the dining table. Lieutenant Yuasa seemed to be the main character in this scene.

"Old Tani, you still don't drink? I originally stipulated that we drink on Saturdays, but the last week and the week before last, we all broke the rules. Tonight, we haven't had such a good time. Hey, Nitta, are you having a good drink?"

Lieutenant Yuasa shouted happily like this. "Not yet, not yet," he said, waving his hand. Ensign Nitta's voice was like a broken gong, and Takao couldn't help but laugh.

"Nitta, tomorrow I will take a person to the submarine school to visit. It just so happens to be Sunday, I'm really sorry, please take care of him!"

Ichito seemed to have prepared his words beforehand. The friend from the water management school he mentioned earlier seemed to be Ensign Nitta. That Ensign seemed to be going to listen to some kind of course.

"Okay."

Ensign Nitta's broken gong voice was only one word.

When Takao heard this way of speaking of the naval officers, the image of the officers and officials who visited the Isuzu warship in Yokosuka appeared again in his mind. No, this time the atmosphere was even more lively and refreshing than that time. Takao felt immensely honored to be in this atmosphere. Therefore, he could not help but let the naval officer's long-cherished wish that had been suppressed in his subconscious revive again.

"Since you read naval books, then you must know our secret language."

Lieutenant Yuasa was right.

"Ah, certainly..."

"For example, people on warships call "Good morning" as "Good." Especially when speaking to superiors, you must speak in naval language, otherwise you will be scolded."

"Haha! It's really simplified."

"Yes. But you probably don't understand this sentence! What does "Ke Pa" mean?"

"It's your daughter. Isn't your daughter "daughter"? Copper is Copper, and according to the ancient pronunciation, it is "your daughter"."

Takao burst out laughing. Meaningless, completely like middle school students, creating secret language. ——（119）
