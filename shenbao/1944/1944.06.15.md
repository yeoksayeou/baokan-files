### Hope and Zeal

Harmony is the natural law for human survival, and mutual assistance is the way to achieve harmony. We firmly believe that if every Chinese citizen can help each other and unite, China's national affairs can immediately embark on a path of positive revitalization.

Take the student aid movement as an example. Readers and we share a hope in our hearts: that the next generation of the Republic of China will surpass our generation, so that the future of the Republic of China will be bright. Therefore, cultivating the next generation of citizens is the most important task at present. This matter is originally the responsibility of the government, but when the country is not yet capable of planning comprehensively, people from all walks of life have an unshirkable responsibility to cooperate and use the power of society to promote its success. This is a common belief, a common hope, and the student aid movement is a common endeavor generated from this common belief, carried out with the full enthusiasm of readers and ourselves, persevering for years, one term after another.

Because we have hope and zeal, we are not afraid of any difficulties and strive to fight. When we handle student aid affairs, we never expect difficulties or impossibilities. The number of applicants increases term by term, the amount of tuition increases period by period, but the social economy gradually declines. Objective facts are enough to discourage the general public, but our subjective mentality only teaches us to move forward bravely. We believe that there is nothing difficult in society, and there is nothing impossible in society. If you have a mindset of difficulty and impossibility in your heart, then everything is difficult and impossible. Therefore, objective facts cannot stop our progress; they only teach us that we need to make more efforts and fight harder.

Why do we have such great courage? Because we have hope and zeal, and most importantly, because this is the common hope of the readers, and we have the common zeal of the readers as our backing. Each and every reader voluntarily lends a helping hand to this work. Is the power of gathering the 'helping hand' of hundreds of thousands of readers not great enough? With concerted efforts, success is easily achieved. How can a cause not succeed?

Just imagine, in a few years or more than ten years, the aided students will have completed their studies one by one. Someone will serve in a certain aspect of society, someone will contribute to the country in a certain part, someone will have a position in academia, and someone will create a certain career. The aided students will all become useful talents for the society and the country. When drinking water, think of the source, and thank the readers of Shen Bao for their help. When the readers of Shen Bao recall the enthusiasm for supporting the student aid movement at that time, the seeds they planted with their own hands have actually blossomed and borne fruit. Is there any spiritual joy higher and greater than this? And we, the colleagues of this newspaper, feel infinitely honored to recall that we have been following the readers and working hard to make this matter a great success.

### Japanese Land Improvement Yields Results

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) The land improvement project in the Japanese Second Food Production Increase Countermeasures has been launched in rural areas throughout Japan since last autumn. This improvement project has been completed at the end of May this year, according to the plan for last winter.

### Vice President Takagi Discusses Sino-Japanese Cooperation: The Two Countries Should Establish a Leading Position

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) Mr. Rikki Takagi, Vice President of the Sino-Japanese Industry Company, is one of the leading figures among Japanese "China experts." On the 13th, he met with reporters in this question and refuted the argument that "Sino-Japanese cooperation is impossible," stating in essence, "My friend Chen Youren once doubted the feasibility of Sino-Japanese cooperation, saying: 'Genuine cooperation, if not based on reciprocity, then there is absolutely no possibility of genuine cooperation. Judging from the current actual situation between China and Japan, Japan only gains from China, and has nothing to contribute to China, so it is quite difficult to achieve genuine Sino-Japanese cooperation.' We cannot deny this now. In the past, Japan certainly held this view, but since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, there is an urgent need to develop a new sphere of influence. Therefore, Japan has no need to attack the densely populated Chinese mainland. Japan needs great strength to develop the undeveloped world in the South, and there is absolutely no need to conquer the Chinese mainland by force. Thus, Japan's new policy toward China has emerged at this time. And China today needs a lot of supplies from the South, such as oils, rice, rubber, and sugar, so it must rely on Japan to mediate. Mr. Chen Youren's so-called one-sided cooperation has now become mutually beneficial cooperation. Comprehensively considering the objective situation of China and Japan, I firmly believe that genuine cooperation between the two countries can be realized without doubt. The Greater East Asia War has evolved into a holy war for the liberation of Asians. The Chinese nation is the largest nation in Asia, and the Japanese people really need to cooperate with them. If China and Japan are not united, the Greater East Asia War cannot be completed at an early date. China and Japan must establish a guiding position in the new world order."

### The Japanese Army Occupies Kokadan and Advances Towards Bishnupur; The Mainline Rapid Advance Team Fiercely Attacks Ningthoukhong

Indian Front, 13th (Central News Agency) The elite units of the Japanese army, which had previously ravaged the enemy positions north of Sattha (10 kilometers southwest of Bishnupur), raided the enemy's heavy artillery surveying position (about 8 kilometers north of Koubimoal and southwest of Bishnupur) on the 7th and completely occupied it. The main force of the Japanese army has entered the area north of Sattha. Except for the enemy's obstruction, the Japanese military counterattack continues to resist tenaciously, and the Japanese army has launched a fierce attack, and finally defeated it, occupying the high ground north of Koubimoal, and obtaining a powerful base to attack Bishnupur. On the same day, the Japanese army broke through the enemy's position east of Koubimoal with a night attack, and seized the enemy's strongholds near the position, and the Japanese army occupied Kokadan (8 kilometers southwest of Bishnupur) in the same day. One side of the troops that advanced rapidly from the mainline also broke into the important town of Bossahaam on the morning of the 7th, completely occupied it, and then reversed and echoed the northward troops, fiercely attacking the stubborn enemy near Ningthoukhong (5 kilometers south of Bossahaam), and defeated them, and prepared to break into Bishnupur at the same time as the troops advancing westward from the mainline. The will to fight of the enemy's 23rd Division and armored troops has declined due to the recent fierce battles. Although they have repeatedly counterattacked in the past, their counterattacks have recently become weaker and weaker.

Fierce Battles on the Nu River Front

Yangon, 14th (Central News Agency) A heroic annihilation battle has been launched on the Nu River front. The elite units of the Japanese army lured the main force of the Southwest Expeditionary Army to the front of the stronghold to annihilate it. At the same time, the Chongqing army's supplementary boats have all been sunk in the turbulent flow of the Nu River, and their attempt has been crushed. Therefore, they are currently only relying on the supply line of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing for relief, but because of the infighting between the American military officers and the Chongqing army, the air supply is also often interrupted. In addition, the command system is chaotic, and their plan to open up the New Stilwell Road has been abandoned. Now, under the fierce attack of the Japanese army, they can only linger. Although they claim to be well-equipped, the Southwest Expeditionary Army is actually extremely rudimentary. From the corpses collected by the Japanese army and the captured weapons, it is not difficult to see their poverty and weakness. In addition, since the start of the Nu River operation, as of the 10th, the Chongqing army has abandoned 4,740 corpses, captured 16 mortars, 55 light and heavy machine guns, 425 rifles, and a large amount of other food and ammunition.

### The Japanese Army Launches a Three-Dimensional Interception Battle in the Central Pacific, Sinking One Enemy Ship and Shooting Down More Than One Hundred Aircraft

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 5 p.m. on the 14th: On June 11th, an enemy powerful mobile force appeared in the sea east of the Mariana Islands, and from the afternoon of that day to the morning of the 13th, it carried out air raids on Japanese bases such as Saipan, Tinian, and Miyakojima. On the 12th, some ships also carried out shelling. The Japanese army in each area responded to the interception, sinking one enemy ship and shooting down more than 121 enemy aircraft, destroying three, and the Japanese side suffered slight damage.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) The American mobile force has repeatedly launched provocative attacks in the Japanese central Pacific. Following the attack on February 22nd, it reappeared in the sea east of the Mariana Islands on June 11th. The local Japanese garrison had already noticed it. Therefore, the Japanese army, navy, and air force cooperated fully on the same day and launched a three-dimensional interception battle against the enemy, sinking one enemy ship, shooting down 121 enemy aircraft, and destroying three enemy aircraft, achieving a great victory. The enemy ships and aircraft squadrons first repeatedly attacked the islands of Saipan and Tinian on the 11th. The Japanese garrison shot down ten of them with fierce anti-aircraft fire, and Japanese aircraft fought an air battle, shooting down four more and destroying three. On the 12th, enemy aircraft repeatedly attacked Miyakojima, Tinian Island, Saipan Island, and Rota Island.

### The Enemy Attempts to Carry Out a Feint Operation in the Central Pacific: Minister Matsushima Expresses His Views

Shanghai Dispatch The Axis forces are launching landings in Europe, and the other side is also attempting to open up the stagnant war situation in the Pacific, especially since the battle situation in western New Guinea has failed to progress according to plan, and they are veryç¦ç¼. Therefore, they are attempting to carry out a feint operation in the central Pacific, suddenly attacking the Japanese strongholds in the Mariana Islands in the central Pacific since the 11th. According to the Japanese General Headquarters, a total of more than 124 enemy aircraft were destroyed, inflicting heavy damage. Colonel Matsushima, the press officer of the Japanese fleet stationed in China, specifically expressed his views on this point on the 14th, and disclosed the Axis forces' determination to respond to each other from east and west and annihilate the enemy's combat power. The content of the statement is as follows: The enemy's headquarters has always advocated invading Europe while also taking the offensive in the Pacific. On June 11th, the enemy's powerful forces suddenly attacked our Mariana Islands. The enemy's operational attempt was to induce our naval forces to conduct a decisive battle in waters favorable to the enemy. However, the Imperial Navy will never be exploited by the enemy's strategy and will always give them a head-on blow according to the established policy, reaping great results, which have been announced in detail by the General Headquarters. However, in order to cover up the defeat, the enemy transferred its own losses to others, claiming to have shot down 130 Japanese aircraft, which only exposed a glimpse of the enemy's deceptive propaganda. On the other hand, the enemy on the northern coast of Biak Island, New Guinea, in the Southwest Pacific is also gradually losing its initiative under the strong pressure of the Japanese army. However, the enemy cannot permanently maintain a stagnant state in the Pacific, and since the landing operation in western æ­¡æ´² has been launched, they must not retreat easily. Therefore, the British and American sides must not simultaneously concentrate their forces on the eastern and western fronts. Our Japanese and German forces can only consistently induce the enemy to within our own power circle, responding to each other from east and west and completely annihilating them.

Stockholm, 14th (Central News Agency) - A Reuters dispatch reports that the Allied High Command announced on Tuesday night that German forces had launched counterattacks in two locations in the Normandy Peninsula: Montebourg and Carentan. The situation in both locations is unclear. Fierce fighting has also erupted south of Balleroy, a location 35 kilometers southwest between Bayeux and Saint-LÃ´.

Despite this heavy blow, the British forces did not slacken and appeared to adopt an all-day offensive, resulting in the loss of fifty-nine tanks and super-heavy tanks and being repelled, and were forced to terminate the flanking operation against the German forces east of Caen.

Supply Activities at Landing Points

### The Path Forward for Chinese Youth

â YÅ«matsu Entai

Lecture given at National Shanghai University on the 6th of this month

A person's life is determined by their youth. Those who spend their youth in a time of peace have different thoughts in their lives than those who greet their student years in a time of war and revolution.

You have spent these past few years welcoming and sending off the era of youth amidst war, and have probably encountered many hardships. Some people in China can probably still smell the scent of war today. War is a misfortune for humanity, causing the loss of many precious lives and properties. Although everyone knows this fact, you must deeply explore its causes as this war continues. This is the meaning and task of a youth.

The ideological meaning of war should be an academic impulse that prevents it from recurring.

The war between China and Japan is based on the premise of a greater cultural leap to a higher synthesis of the opposing ideologies held by the two countries. In order for the cultures of China and Japan to achieve such a leap in synthesis, such sacrifices are naturally required. Although cultural exchange could be achieved without the devastation of this war, the destiny of Asia and the world does not allow it. The thoughts of human nations can only clear their own dogmatism from painful experiences. China and Japan, therefore, through this war, pointed out each other's strengths and weaknesses, and understood the common form of the destinies of China and Japan. What caused the two countries to meet in battle was "non-Asians," and the cause was Anglo-American thought. This truth has become clear after great sacrifice. I believe that the leaders in Chongqing will soon reach the same understanding.

On December 8, 1941, the Greater East Asia War finally began due to Japan's decisiveness and courage. The precedent of a yellow race declaring war on the two largest countries in the world, England and America, has never been seen in Asian history. This war, as the name suggests, has a very deep meaning in the discovery and establishment of "Greater East Asian thought." That naturally requires driving out the political and economic greed of England and America from the lands of East Asia; but it actually lies in breaking the worship of Anglo-America, which is eating away at the minds of Orientals. It is of philosophical significance to eradicate from Greater East Asia the erroneous prejudice that has for centuries been superstitious about Westerners as superior people and Orientals as inferior people. At the same time, the various countries of "Greater East Asia" need to shake hands completely on the truth of the Eastern spirit, with a common intention befitting their name.

The Classical Spirit of China

After arriving in Shanghai, I asked a college student: "What do you praise China for?" But he did not give me a clear answer. Although they call themselves "Republic of China," the Chinese, especially the youth, lack confidence in their own culture. Boasting about the buildings and streets of Nanjing Road and praising the missionary universities are just praising Europe and America. What exactly do you praise China for? Whether you say it is a civilization with a history of five thousand years, or say "vast land and abundant resources," from the current organizational structure, those are presenting their opposite, the dark side. So, shall I answer for you? I think that throughout the lands and cities of East Asia, the classical spirit of China is still alive even today. The Confucian thought of Confucius and Mencius, the Taoist thought of Lao Tzu and Zhuangzi, and the Buddhist thought that prospered in China after being transmitted from Indiaâthese classical spirits of China are still alive today as Eastern ideals and are active.

The "Greater East Asia War," which was initiated by Japan's courage and confidence, is not for the benefit of Japan alone, but is for the happiness of the one billion people of East Asia. This war has a broad meaning, and is the same as China before the Qing Dynasty, in any era, taking all of East Asia as the object of thought and action. This is not China for China alone, but China for all of East Asia. That is why there is a meaning to the name "China". However, since the end of the Ming Dynasty, due to the input of Western civilization, China has abandoned its ideological autonomy. Not only have concessions and settlements been opened up in various parts of China, but even Chinese thought has become a colony of England and America, thus forgetting the classical spirit of China and falling into the worship of Europe and America. As a result, Chinese thought became humble and self-deprecating. The "China of Greater East Asia" kind of self-sacrifice on the part of Japan is to open up the true meaning of the "Greater East Asia War."

On January 9, 1943, the National Government had already noticed this deep meaning and declared war on England and America, and therefore you have become comrades in the Greater East Asia War. Japan's victory is China's victory. However, some of you may be misled by the news of Anglo-American propaganda, mistaken about the Anglo-American war power, and doubt Japan's victory. This is not unreasonable either. But if that is the case, you are not comrades. If you are comrades, you should worry about Japan. You should give advice and assistance. And there should be an organization of volunteer soldiers to destroy England and America. I understand your feelings, but it has been two and a half years since the boasting that three of them could defeat Japan in this war. The way things look, this war will be a stalemate for ten years. Victory or defeat is not only based on weapons and military power. The spirit of dying for the country is the final victory. "Japan's invincibility"âthis is what I can say definitively here. Only in this way can "Greater East Asia" be achieved, which is the goal of the Greater East Asia War.

Since the National Government declared war, as I said just now, although the mobilization of volunteer soldiers has not been heard, it has provided enormous material support to Japan to assist Japan's war effort. It has supplied a considerable amount of food to the Japanese army stationed in China, which should be thanked. Naturally, this may cause many difficulties for the Chinese people. However, China's ability to endure this suffering is evidence of participation in the war, and is a comrade's duty. Japan has already taken the lead in returning concessions to various countries, and further assists China's autonomy and independence. It would be a big mistake if Chinese youth see this as an act of drawing a lottery ticket. There will be no autonomy without price and sacrifice. To shed the character of a semi-colony of centuries is "this Greater East Asia War."

For the next ten years of war, followed by fifty years of economic and ideological war, it is necessary to win in order for China's independence and autonomy to be established. Japan is providing its blood and flesh for the sake of this Chinese autonomy.

I unconsciously said too much about the meaning of war and the political complexities. It's not that I said too many political things to Chinese youth. Why? This is because you think too much about politics. It's because you are precocious. Politics, as the word indicates, means "to correct with writing," which is its true meaning. What political movement should young people who lack education and have little experience do? Politics is based on "virtue." Political will naturally arise from the virtue of personality. People who are not elders cannot improve their noble morality. Chinese politics, to put it bluntly, cannot be said to be good. Because that is young people doing politics with signs and leaflets of propaganda. The best leaflet is one that does not need paper, the so-called "governing does not lie in many words." It is to show the people with a good example of oneself. Then, the people's livelihood and people's rights can be promoted smoothly.

Youth Should Bury Themselves in Learning

Naturally, I know why you are so concerned about politics. Today's events in China will naturally involve the youth in political movements. And that may find opportunities for one to rise. But I hope everyone will wait a bit. Young people don't need to rise early. Only poor youth can devote themselves to studying. I did not enter society until I was thirty years old, and I studied diligently. Naturally, young people's hearts will feel dissatisfied and excited about politics. This conscience is the important flower of youth, but this flower must never be picked early. Therefore, one should suppress one's feelings and bury oneself in the school window. Political movements are to find a shortcut to rise. If this is the case, good outcomes will be difficult to produce. If you want to build a real China in fifty years, the learning that should be done at present, rather than studying politics, it is more important to learn more about political history and political ethics. When highly educated Chinese talents emerge in large numbers, a new China will be produced.

I smiled when I heard that many people in Chinese universities major in politics and economics. Because this is very similar to the Meiji era in Japan. At that time, after the Meiji Restoration, young people had ambitions to conquer the Central Plains. However, soon, this trend stopped, and young people devoted themselves to basic and practical learning. As a result, Japan was able to leap forward, and a scientific Japan and a technological Japan were born. Which direction should Chinese youth move forward in the future? I would like to give some frank advice here. Politics is fine, and economics is fine. But superficial learning that wants to rise immediately after graduating is not possible. One should do a kind of basic, theoretical, and principle-based learning. Especially in Shanghai, because it is a trading port, commercial thinking is particularly strong. Although commerce is important, Asia cannot be a market for England and America in the future. Neither Japan nor China can but become a factory that supplies goods to the entire Asian market.

### Intensify Epidemic Prevention, Implement Comprehensive Inspection, No Passage Without Injection

Shanghai Special City Health Bureau. The Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee, in order to prevent the occurrence of epidemic diseases, has started cholera vaccination since the first day of last month. Now, in order to intensify epidemic prevention, starting from today (15th), a comprehensive general inspection will be carried out. Personnel will be dispatched to stations, wharves, and bridges to carry out inspections. Local police and pao-chia will assist at any time and place, and additional vaccination teams and mobile vaccination vehicles will be dispatched to intensify the vaccination work. Anyone who has not been vaccinated and does not carry a cholera vaccination certificate will not be allowed to pass, in order to be thorough.

### First District to Distribute Coal Balls and Coal Blocks Starting Today, Four Catties of Coal Balls, Three Catties of Smokeless Coal

The First District Public Office has decided that from June 15th to the 30th of the same month, each designated coal ball retail store in the district will distribute the fifth phase of allocated coal and coal balls. During the above-mentioned period, citizens can purchase three catties of Jiaozuo smokeless lump coal and four catties of coal balls at a price of 12.60 yuan (national currency) by presenting the fifth coal ball ration ticket with the registered number indicated on the ticket to the coal ball retail store. The coal balls should contain at least 50% coal dust, and the Jiaozuo smokeless lump coal should not contain more than 20% coal seams and more than 10% rock inclusions. Retail donations are exempted. If retail stores violate the regulations, citizens should immediately report it to the nearest police station for investigation.

Fifth Phase Household Coal Balls. In order to prevent the manufacturers of household coal balls from cutting corners and using inferior coal balls as rations, the First District Economic Bureau has specially instructed the Shanghai Coal Ball Factory Association to not add impurities. If there is any violation, it will be strictly investigated and dealt with immediately, and its qualification as a manufacturer of rationed coal balls will be revoked. On the one hand, it notifies each rationed coal ball retailer to pay attention to the allocated household coal balls. If there are any non-compliant ingredients, or adulteration of impurities, and cutting corners, they may refuse to accept the goods, and report it to the office for investigation. If the coal ball retailers fail to comply and privately receive inferior coal balls and distribute them to users, once verified or accused, the full responsibility will be borne by the retailers. Not only will their qualifications as retailers be revoked, but their deposits will also be confiscated without leniency. As for the rationed smokeless lump coal, which is Jiaozuo lump coal, the coal contains 20% rock inclusions and 20% coal seams. When citizens rely on their registration to purchase coal, they should pay attention to its composition. If inferior quality is found, they should immediately report it to the office, and it will be strictly investigated.

Zhabei Distributes Coal Balls, Soap

The Zhabei Township Office has successively issued the third phase of household coal balls and the first, second, and third phases of soap and matches certificates to citizens for purchase, and has decided to start issuing certificates from the 16th of this month and start selling from the 20th of the same month, ending on the 29th of the same month. Citizens may carry their purchase certificates to the designated merchants for purchase within the time limit. Each certificate can purchase ten catties of coal balls, one bar of soap, and one small box of matches.

### Japanese Army Press Department Held Regular Press Conference Yesterday

The Japanese Army Press Department of the Allied Japan in Shanghai held a regular press conference yesterday (14th) at 2:00 p.m. at the China Hotel on the 8th floor of Nanjing Road, inviting the Chinese journalist corps of the city. Lieutenant Sakaki of the military press department attended, and the speaker first gave a detailed analysis of the war situation in Asia and Europe, and also gave a detailed explanation of the Allied British and American troops' current invasion, saying that the German army has long made thorough preparations against the enemy British and American plot, and it is deeply believed that after the current aimless British and American counter-attack, they have indeed suffered great setbacks after a strong and powerful attack by the German army, and the losses of the British and American troops are particularly heavy.

### Health Campaign Conference, Exhibition Ends

The Municipal Health Campaign Conference, which opened on the 1st of this month, has achieved excellent results in various activities such as cleaning campaigns, rat and fly extermination campaigns, anti-spitting campaigns, and epidemic prevention campaigns, which have been organized by the authorities, various agencies, groups, and bao-chia service personnel, leading citizens to carry out the activities on schedule. However, the exhibition was suspended by the sports association due to the selection of the second round of Marseille ball games. After repeated requests for an extension from all walks of life, the health authorities approved an extension to the 15th of this month. The number of visitors in the past half month is estimated to be over 300,000. The next conference will be held on December 15th in accordance with central regulations. It is reported that the health authorities believe that it is necessary to expand and promote health education in the city, so after the conclusion of this conference, they will immediately prepare for various activities for the next conference.

### Finance Bureau Director Yuan Forbids Gift-Giving During Festivals

Yuan Houzhi, Director of the Finance Bureau, has repeatedly strictly prohibited the bureau's staff from giving gifts during the New Year's holidays, as well as the staff from taking advantage of their positions to receive gifts from merchants. Director Yuan, who also serves as the Director of the Finance Department of the First District, is deeply concerned that the staff in the department may continue this bad habit, so he issued a handwritten order, strictly prohibiting giving and receiving gifts.

### Nanshi Earth Wells Disinfected

Under the guidance of the Municipal Health Bureau and the Municipal Office, Nanshi District has launched a comprehensive epidemic prevention campaign. Over the past few days, people have been supervised to carry out earth well disinfection. All rotten earth wells have been filled in. As of yesterday, the first phase of disinfection work for all 258 earth wells in the district has been completed.

### Rickshaw Rent Increase Dispute Resolved Through Mediation

The Shanghai Rickshaw Company's single-seat passenger vehicles have always been rented by coolies for passenger business. The method is exactly the same as that of public rickshaws. In September of last year, a dispute arose between labor and management due to an increase in rent, which was resolved through mediation by the Social Welfare Bureau. In the previous month, the company charged rickshaw pullers a subsidy for tires and hardware due to the rising prices of tires and hardware parts, while the rickshaw pullers felt that the increase was too large and they could not afford it, and another dispute arose between the two parties. Later, the rickshaw pullers sent representatives to the Social Welfare Bureau to request handling. After the bureau convened the two parties for multiple mediations and gave sincere guidance, the bureau resolved the dispute through mediation the day before yesterday.

Ministry of Finance Strictly Prohibits Private Sale of Pledged Securities by Banks

Recently, emerging financial institutions in Shanghai have often used funds to engage in speculative trading or hoard materials, manipulating prices, and disrupting prices. After the Central Bank of China tightened interbank lending and restricted loan business, the hoarding of materials could not make their old tricks. Unexpectedly, some financial institutions have recently privately sold securities of collateral. This kind of behavior affects the entire enterprise and hinders the stability of finance. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance, in view of this, has specially ordered the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank to notify them separately, strictly prohibit them, and conduct random inspections at any time. If they dare to intentionally violate the regulations, they will be severely punished.

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Representative Assembly, Various Industries Send Proposals, Five Examination Committee Members Appointed

The Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce's current member representative assembly has been resolved by the fifth joint meeting of all directors and supervisors to be held at 2:00 p.m. on the 26th of this month, and directors and supervisors will be re-elected. As the conference period is approaching, all the conference order, meeting affairs report, and various preparatory matters are actively underway. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Industry, the Social Welfare Bureau of the Society, the Economic Bureau of the Municipal Government, and the Shanghai Branch of the New Luck Club to request that personnel be sent to attend for guidance, the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, the Food Bureau, the First District Public Office, and the First Police Station are also notified for reference. The proposal examination committee has been decided to be Wang Boyuan, Xu Xiaochu, Pan Xusheng, Chen Lengseng, and Wu Jieyu, and Wu Jieyu is designated as the convener. As various industry associations have successively sent proposals to the meeting, the proposal examination committee has scheduled the first examination meeting for 2:00 p.m. on the 19th of this month.

### People in Chinese and Japanese Buddhist Circles Must Unite: Professor Tomomatsu Expresses His Thoughts

Professor Tomomatsu, the second lecturer in the wartime academic lecture series co-sponsored by the Shinpao and this newspaper, is about to depart for Suzhou, Beijing, and other places in North China to investigate Chinese Buddhism. He regrets not being able to conduct a thorough investigation. I am quite interested in the Buddhist circles of your country and have discovered several unique characteristics, as follows: ãThere are extremely great figures in the Chinese Buddhist community, rare individuals in terms of both their character and learning. ãChinese Buddhism has a unique influence and maintains no relationship with the government or the military. ãBuddhism enjoys considerable faith among the general populace, thus the relationship between the people and Buddhist beliefs is very close. ãThe cultivation and practice of Buddhism are taken very seriously and profoundly, and practices such as Zen meditation have special significance. ãRegarding Buddhist scholarship, although the groups are not large, each has its own very profound research, making them invaluable to the world.

The above are all the advantages of Chinese Buddhism, but there are also some shortcomings. Namely, although the Chinese Buddhist community is limited in some ways, it lacks a unified national organization. It is hoped that a unified Buddhist organization can be formed quickly in the future. ãThe facilities for Buddhist education are not comprehensive enough. ãAlthough there are temples throughout China, there is no comprehensive Buddhist academy. ãThe research methods of Buddhist studies in various regions all adopt original, traditional methods, with little progress. ãThe theoretical schools of Buddhism and the practical schools of cultivation have not yet moved towards collaboration and cooperation.

From the standpoint of the Japanese Buddhist community, I will state frankly that I feel that Buddhist circles in both China and Japan must unite, communicate with each other, and cooperate with each other in the future. The methods of cooperation can be divided into two aspects: one is the academic aspect, and the other is the business aspect. Regarding the former, China and Japan must exchange Buddhist figures, such as the mutual exchange of Buddhist scholars and monks, and the exchange of published books on Buddhist research, all of which are urgently needed. Regarding the latter, such as social undertakings and charitable undertakings (such as hospitals and schools), China and Japan must cooperate and exchange in terms of methods, materials, and personnel. If there are various social undertakings that have not yet been launched and require assistance from the Japanese Buddhist community, Japan can send experienced people to provide assistance. At the same time, it is hoped that the Chinese Buddhist community itself can also be more enthusiastic about charitable undertakings. In this way, not only can it gain more popular support, but also China and Japan can cooperate with each other even better. If this is the case, a century of amity can naturally be achieved. I firmly believe that if the two major nations of China and Japan share the same faith, the friendship between the two countries will not be difficult."

Mr. Sasaki Returns Home from Shanghai

The wartime academic lecture series jointly sponsored by this newspaper and the Shinpao specially invited Dr. Sasaki from the Allied nations to come to Shanghai to give lectures. After coming to China, Dr. Sasaki lectured in various places in Beijing and Shanghai and was well received. Now that his itinerary has been completed, he is scheduled to return to his country today. Before leaving, he donated 2,500 yuan each to the scholarship fund of this newspaper and the loan fund of the Shinpao. His enthusiasm is commendable.

### Report on Donations to the Scholarship Football Charity Match

Ding Huikang and Xie Xiaochu, 10,000 yuan each. Anonymous person and Xi Jingji, 3,000 yuan each. Gongji, Sun Mingqi, Ding Huikang (Yuekang Electrical Appliance Store), and Shi Jingdao, 2,000 yuan each. Xueji and Zhongji, 1,000 yuan each. Tao Mujian, 500 yuan.

The above totals 36,500 yuan, and the previous total was 581,700 yuan.

Short Commentary

### Sending Off Dr. Sasaki

Considering the weak atmosphere of academic research in the Peace Zone, the Shinpao and this newspaper jointly organized the "Wartime Academic Lecture Series" in order to increase interest in academic research. The first lecturer invited was Dr. Sasaki, an agricultural expert from the Allied nation of Japan. The doctor arrived in Shanghai on the 18th of last month and left Shanghai to return to his country today, lasting for a month, and held lectures and seminars in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Suzhou and other places, and visited agricultural organizations and institutions. During this period, he traveled busily and did not have time to rest. He has had a great influence on Chinese agriculture, which is a gratifying thing in the midst of calls for increased agricultural production in China. It is not only a blessing for the Shinpao and this newspaper, but also for the entire country's agriculture.

Speaking of the main task of increasing production, technical improvement is of course necessary. According to Dr. Sasaki, the statistical comparison of agricultural and animal husbandry production between China and Japan is as follows:

(Note: One shi of milk equals two shi in China. The highest daily milk production in Japan is the world record.)

From this, it can be seen that Japan's technical improvements in agriculture and animal husbandry have achieved excellent results, and we should catch up. However, in China's rural environment, in order to achieve effective results in increasing production, in addition to seeking technical improvements, political improvements are also needed, such as establishing security, abolishing excessive taxes and levies, and the factors that lead to reduced production must be completely eliminated.

We deeply feel that what China needs most in Sino-Japanese cooperation is people like Dr. Sasaki to come to China to take on the task of practical guidance, so that the outdated phenomena of Chinese society can be effectively and scientifically improved and modernized. We have put forward this view before, especially since Dr. Sasaki's visit to China has shown a sincere and enthusiastic attitude, which has strengthened our view. We hope that those who care about cooperation between the two countries will pay full attention.

Secondly, before returning to his country, Dr. Sasaki specially donated 2,500 yuan each to the scholarship funds of this newspaper and the Shinpao. He also said that after returning home, he will fulfill his greatest teaching responsibility to Chinese students studying in Japan. This attitude of valuing education and being enthusiastic about education has especially moved us.

Finally, we would like to express our gratitude to the Ministry of Industry and its affiliated agricultural agencies, the Hangzhou Municipal Government of Zhejiang Province, and universities, agricultural organizations, and experts in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou for their great assistance.

Sports

### Scholarship Basketball Charity Match: West Youth Wins Over Central Youth, Each Wins One Game, Finals Tomorrow Night

In the second act of the scholarship basketball game of this newspaper, Central Youth and West Youth met again at the Central Youth Gymnasium yesterday. The audience was more crowded than the first final. As a result, West Youth triumphed with a score of 29 to 11, creating an equal situation of one win each. The Central and West powerhouses will have a final match at the same venue at 8 p.m. tomorrow night. Before the game, the winners of the Shanghai bodybuilding competition will perform as an interlude, which will be one of the highlights of tomorrow night's program. The following is a brief record of yesterday's battle:

Changing Situation

Referee Liu Hesheng and Yuan Zifang. The game started at 8 p.m. Central Youth had a strong momentum and took the initiative. Boutuo was called for hitting someone and returned to the game. Lin Weiting scored a point, opening the record. Then Yu Yuzi fouled, and West Youth tied the score. Oscar dragged the ball into the basket, and Ma Xi returned the favor. Yu Yuzi scored a free throw, and Central Youth led 5 to 3. West Youth called a timeout, and Zhang Jin entered the game to replace Li Donghe. West Youth's defense was as solid as gold. Central Youth repeatedly tried to break through the center but failed. After Ma Canxi established a merit by himself, the situation changed suddenly, and West Youth took the initiative instead. Kaijie Miluofu and Funike sang in harmony, and Yerong added the finishing touch. At the end of the first half, West Youth led 10 to 7.

Abnormal Performance

After resting and fighting again, the generals of Central Youth worked together with all their might to try to turn the tide, but the heavens did not help them. Yu Yuzi missed in the second zone. Kaijie Miluofu broke through the sideline and actually scored. Boutuo also shot from the middle line and scored. Funike ran around the court and scored three points. Central Youth gradually became inadequate. Only Shunzi managed to pull back two points. Then Yerong flipped over under the Central Youth basket and scored another one. Time was up, and West Youth triumphed with a score of 29 to 11. Central Youth's performance yesterday was very abnormal. There were a lot of wastes. They only scored five points out of seventeen free throws. West Youth's defense yesterday was excellent, and their victory was not accidental.

### Reader Scholarship News: Urging the Collection of Application Forms

Since the distribution of the application forms for the seventh session of the reader scholarship of this newspaper began a few days ago, many schools have collected them. All those who disclosed the number of applicants on or before the 13th have been checked. If you have not received it yet, please come and collect it immediately. Today is the last day for schools to disclose the number of applicants. Except for a few schools that have sent letters explaining the reasons for a temporary postponement, no more applications will be accepted after the deadline. However, for those who have already disclosed the number of applicants, the application forms will continue to be distributed in the future. Individual students who cannot apply to the school due to special circumstances can submit a handwritten letter stating the reasons and apply directly tomorrow or Saturday morning. This application is limited to a very small number of students, and it must be proved that they were not rejected by the school because they were unqualified, nor were they rejected because the number of applicants in the school was too large before they can be accepted. Since this type of student is not recommended by the school, the review must be particularly strict. Those who cannot confidently claim to be "poor and excellent" will definitely not be approved, please do not try, wasting time and energy.

Regarding the number of application forms issued, the office will issue 15 application forms per 100 students, unless the number of recipients in the sixth session has already exceeded this percentage, no exceptions will be made. However, additional application forms for graduates or transfer students account for one-fourth of the total number. A small number of schools did not clearly calculate the standards and thought that all the forms were discounted and issued according to the number of applicants, which is not the case. In fact, many schools have strictly limited the number of applicants themselves, and the office will issue them in full if the number disclosed is within the prescribed limit, without discounting. Some schools mistakenly included elementary school and kindergarten students in the calculation, and the result was of course very different, not because the office's arithmetic was wrong. In addition, the staff of the office have been busy issuing application forms in recent days. It is hoped that the school authorities, parents and students will pay attention to the news in this newspaper at any time and handle everything in accordance with the prescribed procedures. We apologize for not being able to answer every letter that asks questions or makes requests. The Health Exhibition will be open all day today only and will not charge admission. The Sun-Ya Pharmaceutical Factory has special offers for sale at the venue. Welcome to visit a corner of the Racecourse Health Exhibition (Sun-Ya Pharmaceutical Factory)

### The Responsibility of Directors and Supervisors of Limited Liability Companies

â De

The powers, responsibilities and tasks of directors and supervisors of limited liability companies are stipulated in the Company Law, which need not be repeated. However, most of the directors and supervisors of general limited liability companies today are directors in name only, and supervisors do not supervise. They only hold the titles of directors and supervisors and do not perform the powers, responsibilities and tasks stipulated in the Company Law. The reason why they can become directors and supervisors is either because the company values their social status and reputation, so that it is easy to raise funds and take on the role out of favoritism. Or, they use the purchase of company shares as a condition to raise their status. Or, they use the solicitation of funds as an exchange condition to recommend their children to take on important positions in the company. They never consider whether their children's talents and knowledge can be competent, let alone the interests of the company.

The board of directors is the head of the company's administrative system. All major tasks in the company are elected by the shareholders, and the directors and supervisors form the board of directors and supervisors, which bears the major responsibility. If they are not up to the task and abuse their power, they will only say yes or no at every meeting, echoing what others say, and abandon their responsibilities as directors and supervisors. They will take the will of the chairman or general manager of the company as their will. If the chairman or general manager of such a company is virtuous and capable, the business can still develop even if there is a board of directors and supervisors that is merely a formality. On the contrary, if power falls into the wrong hands, the person in power will regard the company as private property and the board of directors and supervisors as nothing. They will not convene meetings of the board of directors and supervisors according to the prescribed date. In the event of major business, they will not ask the board of directors and supervisors for instructions, creating a dictatorship. Moreover, if corruption arises, the company's future will be severely affected, and the shareholders' blood and sweat will be discounted. The personal reputation of the directors and supervisors will also be affected. Therefore, it is hoped that those who are currently serving as directors and supervisors of companies should pay attention to the importance of their own powers, responsibilities and tasks, and do not voluntarily give them up, which will be of great benefit to the company's future.

### The Chinese Moral Education Association Organizes Joint Free Clinic and Medicine Distribution

In addition to the long-term charitable activities of providing porridge, materials, tea, collecting infant corpses, small loans, and free schools, the Chinese Moral Education Association on Zhengyang Road (formerly Tongfu Road) is now planning to launch 12 joint free clinics and medicine distribution centers in the city and other cities, including Chengdu Road, Yongkang Road, Yangshupu, Kunshan, Wuxian, Wuxi, Yinxian, Changshu, Wujin, Wuxi Sanfo Temple, Wujin Shizhuang, and Wuxi Meicun, in order to save the poor and sick, as the weather is getting hotter and epidemics are difficult to avoid.

### Recent News from the Smoking Cessation Hospital

### Preventing Leprosy

The cause of leprosy is mostly due to the invasion of leprosy bacilli, and the route of invasion is often through broken skin or mucous membranes such as the nasal cavity and mouth. Therefore, leprosy is undoubtedly a contagious disease.

The public's prevention method is to confine the patients in one place, so that they are completely isolated from the general healthy people. Therefore, the establishment of leprosy sanatoriums is a beneficial method for both the general society and the patients. It is best to completely disinfect and remove the patients' belongings and contaminated items.

The personal prevention method is to prioritize cleanliness. Rats, flies, and mosquitoes are the media for spreading the disease and should be eliminated. It is especially important not to have direct contact with patients and their belongings, and to disinfect and wash them thoroughly.

If you find any suspicious signs, you should consult a specialist for examination. Once confirmed, you should be admitted to the leprosy sanatorium. This will give you hope for recovery and prevent the spread of the disease, which would otherwise be alarming to society. The China Leprosy Relief Association has leprosy sanatoriums and leprosy clinics. If you are poor and sick, you can receive free treatment. If you want to inquire or donate, you can go to the office of the association at No. 53, Lane 612, Jingan Temple Road.
