### Unyielding Perseverance

Perseverance is the primary element of all success, especially in this great era, for those who work for the liberation and revival of the nation and the country; everyone must have the courage of "unyielding perseverance" and "never giving up," and then they can succeed. When we read the revolutionary history of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and the national revival histories of various countries, we see that many people at that time devoted themselves to struggling, one falling as another rises, like a raging fire. The obstacles from all sides at that time, and the various setbacks, were truly a taste of all hardships. However, with a spirit of utter fearlessness, they endured hardships, strengthened their will, and advanced bravely, vowing never to stop until they achieved their goals. Finally, after enduring countless hardships and difficulties, the great cause of nation-building was successfully completed.

The Greater East Asia War is a resistance war of oppressed peoples, a revolutionary liberation war. From the principle of human equality, the emancipation of oppressed peoples is destined, and the failure of the colonial policies of the British and American enemies is also destined. However, on this road to liberation, those who are engaged in revolutionary work must cut through thorns and brambles, experience countless setbacks, and endure countless pains, before they can transform a road full of thorns and brambles into a broad and smooth avenue. The deeds of the people of this era will be written in the future history in a magnificent way, and these deeds will be written with blood and sweat. Future readers of history will see our current arduous struggles, and our current unyielding perseverance, just as we now look at ancient history, with general respect and admiration. This invisible power in the spiritual dimension encourages the current citizens to strive for the country, and also encourages future citizens to make constant progress. The continuation and perpetuity of the nation and the country lies in this.

To have an unyielding will, we must first establish our self-confidence. People who lose self-confidence are completely subject to the details of the environment, and as a result, there is no other way but to be slaves. People with strong self-confidence can control the environment, and as a result, they can be creators of the environment. Secondly, we must have a warm and persistent will, and continue to work tirelessly. Work that is abandoned halfway is equivalent to not doing it at all, and sometimes it is worse than not doing it. Only work that is consistent from beginning to end can succeed. The story of Foolish Old Man Moving Mountains in Liezi is difficult, but it is a fable that contains profound meaning. The Foolish Old Man was confident that he would succeed in moving the mountains, so even though he was old, he insisted on fighting the mountains. He also wanted his children and grandchildren to continue to struggle constantly. Strong self-confidence and warm perseverance moved the gods, and so the moving of the mountains was finally successful. Liezi's story only wants to use this to illustrate that even moving mountains, a task as difficult as defying Heaven, can be achieved if one is unyielding and persevering. Other things are easier than moving mountains. If one can be unyielding and persevering, how can there be any reason why one cannot succeed in their struggles?

Encountering difficulties and "turning back" is the most undesirable thing. People who have the idea of "retreating" can never move forward, and can never succeed. Countless major events in history have occurred when some people wanted to "turn back," while others continued to advance bravely. Without sufficient perseverance, one can never reach the ultimate goal. Therefore, in competitive events, the effort in the last five minutes of reaching the finish line is ten thousand times more valuable than the effort at the start. A person with unyielding perseverance does not know difficulties, but only knows work. Therefore, the more difficult the environment, the harder they work. There is no concept of danger in their hearts, so they treat danger as safety. There are no obstacles in their eyes, so they see obstacles as empty. Relying on a spirit of utter fearlessness, they continue to struggle permanently step by step. Advancing one step brings them one step closer to their destination. This is the effect of perseverance, and this is the success of perseverance.

### Mariana Islands Area: Japanese Garrison Fights Bravely, Fierce Battle on Tinian Inflicts 5,000 Casualties on the Enemy

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:00 PM on the 1st: The subsequent state of the brave fighting of the Japanese garrison forces in the Mariana Islands area is as follows: After the enemy troops landed on Omiya Island, they suffered substantial losses in the central areas of Akashi Street and Showa Street. The U.S. troops are currently consolidating and shortening their battle lines in the area north of Akashi and are engaged in fierce fighting. In the northern area of Tinian Island, since the enemy troops landed, our troops have used a small number of soldiers to prevent the strong enemy forces from advancing southward and inflicted heavy damage on them. On the 31st, the enemy troops broke into the "final resistance line" in the southern part of the island, and the battle lines are intertwined. The Japanese troops on Rota Island are bravely fighting to prevent the enemy's landing under the continuous fierce shelling and bombing by the enemy forces.

Central Pacific Base, 1st (Central News Agency) – The U.S. garrison on Tinian Island is still continuing to engage in fierce fighting with the enemy forces. Under the cover of aircraft and naval gun fire, the enemy has repeatedly attempted to break through. Since dawn on the 16th, our troops have firmly defended the central highlands, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy and repelling the enemy forces. Also, our troops, based on the Piaoshi Fang highlands, have inflicted substantial damage on the enemy and are still securing their original positions. The damage inflicted on the enemy on the 16th is estimated to be 700 deaths. Since the landing, the total casualties of the enemy forces have reached 4,900.

### Solemn Commemoration Ceremony Held Yesterday in Central Government for Restoration Day; President Wen Reads Chairman Wang's Address

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) – The 1st is our first Chinese Restoration Day. At this decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, our country has broken free from the shackles of the great powers' aggression and begun to restore its lost rights, completing an independent and sovereign nation. Its significance is self-evident. On this day, in addition to celebration ceremonies held throughout the country, the central government especially held a solemn commemoration ceremony at 9:00 AM in the auditorium of the National Government. More than a hundred officials from various ministries and departments attended. The conference began at 9:00 AM. President Wen of the Judicial Yuan led the proceedings, and after the ceremony, Chairman Wang's address was delivered (President Wen read it on his behalf). The conference concluded at 9:30 AM amid the resounding sound of military music.

Chairman's Address

Today is the first Restoration Day of the Republic of China, which is also the great commemorative day for the Republic of China to begin abolishing unequal treaties and completing independence, freedom, and equality. China has been shackled by unequal treaties for a hundred years. In these hundred years, because the territory and sovereignty were fragmented, political and economic development could not be free, and it was trapped in a state of prolonged chaos and poverty. Therefore, to revive China, we must first seek freedom and equality, and to seek freedom and equality, we must first abolish unequal treaties. This was the lifelong wish of the Founding Father, and the comrades of the Kuomintang have continued to work hard for decades, and it has been completely realized since the recovery of the Shanghai concessions on August 1 last year. From now on, China will have freedom and equality, and will begin to embark on the road to self-reliance and revival. This is still a landmark event in history.

However, the abolition of unequal treaties is only the starting point of the restoration undertaking. To complete the revival of the masses, we still need the continued efforts of comrades throughout the country and government officials. Today, China is facing the most serious era. Domestically, because the Yu faction continues to engage in resistance, the social and economic organization has been severely damaged. In the future, we need to intensify our efforts in two tasks: ensuring security and increasing production. On the foreign front, the Greater East Asia War has now entered a decisive stage. Although the foundation for victory has been established, the enemy is still using its abundant resources to continuously launch desperate counterattacks. To ensure the independence and freedom of the country, we must do our utmost to cooperate closely with our allies to seek the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.

Therefore, on this first Restoration Day, we feel excited on the one hand, and on the other hand, we feel the gravity of our responsibilities. We can only work together and move forward to revive China and defend Asia.

### Battles Near Hengyang Reach Climax

Japanese Army Base, 1st (Central News Agency) – In order to rescue the defending army of Hengyang, the Yu army launched an offensive from the direction of Liling and Chaling at the beginning of last month with the 44th, 58th, 20th, 30th, and 343rd armies towards the flank of the Japanese army, and the 62nd and 65th armies attacked the front of Hengyang from the south, causing the 10th army to move south. However, on the line connecting Liling and Chaling in the east and west, the Japanese army had laid down an iron wall of defense. For the Yu army that was sneaking in, the Japanese army began its attack on July 10, annihilating them everywhere. The southward advance troops attacked the main force of the 194th Division at Tonghuzhai Bridge (approximately 8 kilometers west of Hengyang) on the 20th, annihilating them. Part of the force is currently securing Xinyou (approximately 8 kilometers west of Hengyang), pursuing the remnants of the defeated 194th Division. Another force inflicted a devastating blow on the 162nd Division, which was constructing positions 2.5 kilometers northeast of Hengyang, and another force is attacking the main force of the 100th Army, which has infiltrated near Xiaoyun Mountain, 8 kilometers northwest of Hengyang. As such, the battle to annihilate the Yu army around Hengyang is gradually reaching its climax.

### Yu-US Aircraft Attack Wuhan

Hankou, 1st (Central News Agency) – From 10:30 PM on the 30th, approximately ten unified B-24 aircraft of the Yu-based US Air Force intruded into the Wuhan area for about an hour and a half, blindly bombing the river area. They were repelled by the fierce anti-aircraft fire of the Japanese army. The damage to the Japanese side was minor, but Chinese residences caught fire, and there were some casualties.

### Speech by Secretary-General Wu on the First Anniversary of the Recovery of the Shanghai Concessions

Fellow compatriots: Today last year, the two concessions in Shanghai were simultaneously returned to China. The central government believes that the significance of recovering the two concessions in Shanghai is very significant and has a great relationship with the future of the revival of China. Therefore, it stipulates that this day is the Chinese Revival Day, and today is also the first Chinese Restoration Day.

In the article "Changes in Municipal Administrative System in the Past Year" published by Mayor Chen today, the changes in the municipal administrative system in Shanghai over the past year since the recovery of the Shanghai concessions are explained very clearly and thoroughly. I am a member of the team that participated in the work of recovering the Shanghai concessions, and I have also participated in Shanghai's municipal work for the past year. I can deeply understand the "external difficulties" and "internal difficulties" that Mayor Chen mentioned at that time. Fortunately, after a year of efforts, under the leadership of Mayor Chen, with the assistance of friendly countries, and with the encouragement and support of the advisory committee members and citizens, it must be said that there has been considerable progress in important aspects. As Mayor Chen said: "Recalling the past year, although the period is not long, the effectiveness is remarkable. I can be comforted in my heart, and the municipal government can be declared innocent to the citizens." Today, we are excitedly celebrating the first Chinese Restoration Day and the first anniversary of the recovery of the Shanghai concessions for this reason.

Security and Economic Problems

However, although the Shanghai municipality has been completely unified, the "external difficulties" have been completely eliminated, and the "internal difficulties" can hopefully be gradually resolved, there is still a lot of work ahead, and we still need to continue the fighting spirit of the past year and work hard. What are the so-called works in front of us? That is, the "security problem" and the "economic problem" mentioned by Mayor Chen. The security problem is very important. We must first start with the security of the four townships. Only by achieving the security of the four townships can we seek the security of the urban area of Shanghai. Regarding this point, after the establishment of the Administrative Inspector's Office, it is expected that there will be better measures. Regarding the economic problem, the most important thing is probably the food problem. Regarding this problem, after the establishment of the "Commodity Rationing Office", it can also be hoped that there will be better solutions. The municipal government is not only considering how to continue the rationing of household rice, but also considering how to increase the amount of rationing. This point is worth mentioning to tell you all first. In short, the Shanghai municipal authorities are seeking effective ways to solve Shanghai's economic problems and all municipal problems every day. Because of various difficulties in the past, it could not be done at one time, which has aroused the doubts of some citizens. We certainly do not maliciously prohibit the emergence of doubts among the citizens, but sometimes, as Mayor Chen said, we can only "disregard it resolutely," because we have an overall plan for the reform and progress of the municipality. By following this plan, we can not only establish the credibility of the municipality, but also achieve genuine reforms. Therefore, we will never make reckless moves, nor will we be concerned about gaining the momentary joy of the citizens.

Restoring Citizen's Essence

As you all know, under the oppression of British and American imperialists for a hundred years, Shanghai has become a deformed and complex city. In order to promote various political and economic forces of aggression, Britain and the United States have made the Shanghai concessions the center for hiding dirt and harboring filth, and have invisibly changed the essence of Shanghai citizens with many corrupt habits of laziness, laziness, expediency, fortune-seeking, and indulgence, and indirectly made Shanghai a completely pleasure-seeking and corrupt city. At the same time, British and American imperialists used Shanghai as a base to spread corrupt habits to all parts of China, changing the original customs, habits, and culture of the Republic of China. Therefore, we can say that it is easier to govern other places, but Shanghai has been a stronghold for British and American imperialists to invade China for a hundred years, so we should also use all our strength to turn Shanghai into a pure Chinese-style market and an Eastern-style city, and make Shanghai a base for the revival of Chinese economy and culture. Only by doing this can we completely eliminate the forces of the United States and make China's main body independent and its people free.

Completing Great Mission

Speaking of our Chinese nation, in the training we have received in the Sino-Japanese War over the past few years, and in the practical lessons since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, although we have encountered unprecedented calamities, we have strengthened our determination to fight for the nation. Our pace has become more consistent, our will has become more unified, and our true understanding of the friendly country of Japan's assistance has become increasingly certain with the development of various facts. However, we should deeply reflect that a person must be insulted by others before they repent themselves, and a country must be attacked by others before they attack themselves. Only if we can cheer ourselves up, only if we can fight for honor, and only if our own family values it. The assistance of others, at that time, not only Shanghai's municipal problems can be solved easily, but the problems of the entire country can also be solved easily. At that time, the more than four million Shanghai citizens will jointly celebrate the Chinese Revival Day and jointly commemorate the recovery of the Shanghai concessions, which will of course be more meaningful and valuable. Compatriots, we must work hard, we must work together with one heart and one mind to build up Shanghai and complete our great mission.

### Burma Has Regained Freedom; Vows to Uphold War of Independence; Ba Maw Expresses Deep Gratitude to Japan in Broadcast

Rangoon, 1st (Central News Agency) – On August 1, the first anniversary of Burma's independence, Burmese Head of State Ba Maw made a broadcast speech, stating that Burma, which has regained freedom, is determined to uphold its independence and expressing the Burmese people's deep gratitude to Japan. The main points of his broadcast are as follows: The Burmese people are deeply moved to celebrate the first anniversary of independence. The Burmese people must quickly remember that Burma has returned to Burma, and with the assistance of years and months, the enemy will eventually be driven out of the country, and freedom will finally return. Those who have not experienced being conquered may not be able to understand the feelings of the Burmese people today. Now, what we rely on is only new unity. Burma has gained leaders in the past year. A new Burmese nation, built on Burma's constitution, national flag, politics, army, national language, and basic laws, has been born. Reform policies for general administration, finance, agriculture, industry, education, social welfare, and other basic matters have also been implemented. An army that can participate in modern warfare has also been formed. Burma has now gained international status and has become a free and healthy member of the Greater East Asian nations, that is, Burma for the Burmese people, and Asia for the Asian people, which is constantly changing and promoting its extension. On this day of great significance, we will always uphold the war of independence. In the future, in addition to adhering to the gains of the war, we must also be aware that any freedom must be sacrificed under the overall war. War is one of the most important parts of our lives. Burma is waiting for the war to enter the decisive stage, just like other war zones. Our war this time is for our own survival, and all Burmese people should deeply understand this principle. The Burmese people vow to fight to the end until the problems of Burma and Asia are thoroughly resolved. We are grateful to the underground heroes and the brave soldiers who fought on the front lines. At this moment, I not only remember the independence that the Burmese people should regain this time, but also the sacrifices made for it. Burma's independence depends on the aid of Japan in many ways. Regarding this point, I have mentioned it intermittently in the past, and on this Independence Day, the connection of thanking Japan most is the most appropriate time. After all, the rebirth of a country should be based on reality. However, this cannot be achieved by one-sided words. I often represent all the Burmese people on the Independence Day and extend my commemorative remarks to the Japanese people and the people of East Asia, as well as Germany and other comrades-in-arms who respect human rights and freedom.

### Japanese Prime Minister Broadcasts: Wishing Burma the Completion of Permanent Liberation

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – Japanese Prime Minister Koiso made a broadcast speech on the night of the 1st, wishing Burma good fortune and emphasizing his determination to complete the war and thoroughly implement the Greater East Asia Declaration in accordance with the established policy. The main points are as follows: The Burmese people, who have groaned under British oppression for many years, and whose traditional culture has also been trampled on, immediately rose up when the Greater East Asia War broke out and finally obtained the independence they desired, and their national ideals have also been realized. This close cooperation is based on the idea of Greater East Asia liberation, and the fundamental concept of building a world with moral spirit is consistent. The 17 million Burmese people have demonstrated their ardent patriotism and indomitable fighting spirit, and have been able to overcome difficulties, complete the great cause of building a new country, and actively cooperate in completing the common war, which has achieved brilliant achievements. In addition, the domestic construction is being prepared step by step, and the national life and spirit are showing vigorous signs. It is admirable to have these achievements in the current war situation, and it shows the future prosperity of Burma. Currently, the Greater East Asia War is becoming more and more intense in the Pacific and is entering an important stage. Japan, at this important stage, is determined to break through all difficulties, with the virtue of finishing what it starts, and make new efforts throughout the country. Recently, the cabinet has been changed, and I and General Yonai have been ordered to strengthen the domestic situation with national unity internally, and continue to advance towards the path of defeating the British and Americans in order to achieve the final victory. Externally, we will thoroughly implement the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere based on the established diplomatic policy. At this time, Japan has a full understanding of Burma, the front line of Greater East Asia. At the same time, the Japanese people have full respect for Burma under the guidance of the British Head of State, who can endure everything and make its national foundation increasingly firm. Indeed, glorious victory is won with great risks. Burma's independence will surely become more and more consolidated. Greater East Asia, united in moral spirit, should cooperate with each other to resist strong enemies. This is the way to victory. On the anniversary of the independence of our allied nation, Burma, in the midst of fierce battles, I sincerely express my happiness and wish Burma a strong nation, completing permanent liberation with an indomitable fighting spirit and promoting the Greater East Asian spirit.

### Ba Maw and 8 Others Given Decorations

### Burmese and Japanese Air Squadrons Bomb Enemy Airfields

A certain base on the Burmese Front, 1st (Central News Agency) – On the morning of the 30th, a Japanese fighter squadron bombed enemy airfields, material accumulation sites, and barracks in Ukiru (North Burma), India, and shot down two enemy B63 transport planes in the airspace southwest of the lake. No Japanese aircraft were lost.

### Soviet Vanguard Troops 10 Kilometers from Warsaw; German Troops Retreat from Kaunas

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) – Hai Tong News Agency reports: Soviet troops advancing towards Warsaw are within 10 kilometers of Warsaw. The situation inside the city is still normal. The sound of tank warfare can be heard from the east, causing people inside the city to panic.

East, 1st (Central News Agency) - Hai Tong News Agency reports: German troops destroyed all facilities and equipment before withdrawing from Kaunas (also known as Kovno, the capital of Lithuania). The people of Kaunas have been evacuated to the countryside. The houses in the city are closed or locked. The houses between the Neman River and the Vilija River are protected by strong iron bars. Only one house destroyed by bombs can be seen in the entire city. An old cleaner is still sweeping the garbage in the middle, as if he is indifferent to the evacuation of all the people in the city.

### Turkey Facing Major Crisis; German Ambassador Issues Warning

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) – Hai Tong News Agency reports: German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, visited Turkish Prime Minister Sukru Saracoglu because of rumors that Turkey wanted to sever diplomatic and commercial relations with Germany. Mr. Papen seriously told the Turkish Prime Minister that if Turkey took this step under British pressure, it would deprive Turkey of the freedom of action it had long enjoyed. Britain undoubtedly wants to force Turkey to join the war and make Turkey bear all the serious consequences. The Turkish government is now facing a major crisis.

National Assembly Convened Today

Ankara, 1st (Central News Agency) – Hai Tong News Agency reports: On Monday night, all Turkish cabinet members and representatives of the Turkish Grand National Assembly had arrived in Ankara. Turkey is now standing at the threshold of a major decision. Before the parliament meets, the parliamentary members of the Republican People's Party will hold a secret meeting, and the Turkish President will also participate, because he is the president of the party. It is likely that the government's decision will be submitted to the parliament for discussion. The Turkish Grand National Assembly is the highest authority in the country and is vested with legislative and executive powers. The final decision on important national events rests with the assembly.

Political Atmosphere Suddenly Becomes Tense

Budapest, 1st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Ankara: Although Turkish ambassadors and ministers to various countries have taken their vacations in advance, they have been returning to their posts one after another since the 29th. It has now been learned that Turkish Ambassador to Britain, Ali Kan, who returned home, arrived in Ankara from Istanbul on the 30th. Also, the ambassadors and ministers to various countries from the reverse factions held an emergency meeting on the morning of the 29th and reached an agreement.

### Minister Harada Subjected to Coercion and Humiliation: Japan Lodges Strong Protest, Pointing Out Violations of International Law by British and American Soldiers

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – Regarding the incident in which British and American forces, upon invading Rome, violated international law by intruding into the residence of Minister Harada, the Japanese envoy to the Vatican who enjoys complete extraterritorial rights, and subjecting him and his staff to violent actions, the Foreign Ministry, after contacting the Spanish government, lodged a strong protest with the two countries. On the afternoon of the 1st, a statement regarding this unlawful behavior was released as follows: "According to a telegram received by the Japanese government through the Holy See in Rome from Minister Harada, the Japanese envoy to the Vatican, he and all members of his staff have been confined to the diplomatic residence (within Rome) since the British and American forces invaded Rome around June 6th. Furthermore, American soldiers have repeatedly intruded into the residence. The Minister condemned their unlawful actions and demanded their withdrawal. However, they not only insulted the Minister with extremely rude language but also threatened his safety. According to international norms, diplomats of belligerent nations in occupied territories are entitled to the same treatment as those from neutral countries. This is universally acknowledged. Moreover, these diplomats are distinct from ordinary enemy nationals and should be treated with special respect. For instance, at the outset of the Greater East Asia War, British and American diplomats in China received roughly the same treatment from local authorities as their counterparts in Tokyo. After the American occupation of Rome, Minister Harada should have received the same treatment before relocating to the Vatican. Particularly, as Minister Harada is accredited to the Holy See, and the 'Lateran Treaty' recognizes his diplomatic status within Italian territory, even the U.S. government cannot completely disregard this treaty. The actions of the American soldiers mentioned above completely disregard international law regarding the special treatment of diplomats. Furthermore, the commanding officers failed to prevent such barbaric acts by soldiers who are ignorant of the international etiquette of civilized nations. The Japanese government, citing the lack of discipline and order among the troops, lodged a strong protest with the U.S. government through the protecting power, Spain, denouncing their inappropriate behavior. Minister Harada and his staff were finally allowed to move to the Vatican on July 9th, and it is now confirmed that they are no longer in danger."

### Administrative Unification of Northern and Southern Jiangsu Province

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) – On the 29th, the Jiangsu Provincial Government received an order from the Executive Yuan regarding the administration of Northern Jiangsu, authorizing the Special Inspector of Pacification for the area to handle matters as appropriate. Now, due to the establishment of administrative inspectors in the Northern Jiangsu area, Hua Zhendong, the Special Administrative Inspector of the Seventh District, Zhang Beisheng, the Special Administrative Inspector of the Eighth District, and Zeng Jinggai, the Special Administrative Inspector of the Ninth District, will relinquish their posts on the 13th of this month. The previous order authorizing the Special Inspector of Pacification for the First District to handle matters will be revoked starting from August, and normal operations will resume. From now on, the administration of Northern and Southern Jiangsu Province will be unified and entirely under the jurisdiction of the Jiangsu Provincial Government.

### First Restoration Day Celebrated Enthusiastically Citywide; Mayor Chen Delivers Earnest Speech to Municipal Government Staff

Yesterday marked the inaugural Restoration Day, celebrated enthusiastically by the entire populace. National flags fluttered, and prominent intersections were adorned with celebratory banners by propaganda units, creating a solemn atmosphere. In addition, slogans plastered on the walls of streets greatly boosted public morale. On the municipal government's side, to concentrate efforts, the city government relocated to the original site of the First District Public Office on Jiangxi Road yesterday. The Restoration Day memorial ceremony was held in the main auditorium. Mayor Chen, accompanied by Secretary-General Wu, attended punctually. Over two hundred officials above the rank of department head participated. The police band played music on-site, and the ceremony proceeded as prescribed. The entire assembly wished the Chairman good health. Afterwards, the Mayor delivered a speech, and the ceremony concluded after half an hour.

Mayor's Address

Mayor Chen addressed the city government staff, saying: "Secretary-General, Directors of Bureaus and Departments, and fellow staff members, today is the first day of the true unification of the Shanghai Municipal Government. The details of the changes in Shanghai's municipal system over the past year, as well as my ideals and policies for Shanghai's administration during this year, have been documented in my article 'The Changes in Shanghai's Municipal System in the Past Year,' which I believe you have all seen in the newspapers today, so I won't go into further detail. Over the past year, we have exerted our due efforts and fulfilled our responsibilities, enabling the rapid unification of Shanghai's municipal government today. I would like to express my gratitude to all of you, and to both the departing and remaining Japanese staff members. What I want to discuss today are the internal issues of the municipal government, in other words, the problems of the municipal government itself, which are also the problems of the civil servants themselves. First, since its establishment, the Shanghai Municipal Government has been incomplete in its administration. For example, the scope of its jurisdiction was limited to areas outside the two concessions. In the past, the Chinese side also had two policies to deal with the concessions. The first was to encircle the concessions, which involved building Jungong Road, now Zhongshan Road, to enclose the concessions within a certain area. This was because the concessions were constantly seeking to expand, so it was necessary to adopt a policy of 'encirclement and restriction.' The second was to isolate the concessions, which involved the construction of the city center, namely, the construction of the Jiangwan Municipal Government. At that time, industrial and commercial zones were designated in the city center, and the Qiujiang Wharf was built, with the clear intention of developing Shanghai outside the concessions and cutting off the concessions' industry and commerce through water and land transportation, thereby isolating the concessions. These two policies to deal with the concessions were well understood by anyone concerned with municipal affairs. However, the plans that accompanied these two policies inevitably had a state of distorted development and forced facts. This was unavoidable at the time, but it is now in the past. I hope that municipal government staff, after the recovery of the concessions, will view Shanghai as a whole and correct the previous notions of forced facts. We should make a natural plan for the future development of Shanghai. This is a fundamental problem for Shanghai's current and future municipal administration, and I hope everyone fully understands it.

Discard Preconceptions and Break Old Habits

Second, the Shanghai Municipal Government today includes three groups of staff: one group is the old municipal government staff, one group is the old Public Concession staff, and one group is the old French Concession staff. Each of these three groups of staff has its own experience and habits. In short, based on my observations over the past year, each has its own advantages and disadvantages. The advantages need not be said, but the common disadvantage is that preconceptions are too deep. The old municipal government staff tend to overemphasize official documents and neglect administrative efficiency, while the staff from the former two concessions tend to be too biased towards established practices and disregard Chinese laws and regulations. Now that the municipal administration has been unified, I sincerely hope that everyone will not only work together harmoniously but also discard preconceptions and break old habits. Local administration needs to be dynamic. Because it needs to be dynamic, we should strive for efficiency and reform in daily official documents. Local administration needs to have a system. Because it needs to have a system, we should strive to base everything on and unify Chinese laws and regulations. Everyone should not disregard the facts, nor should they neglect Chinese laws and regulations. We should constantly strive for progress, in order to respond to the actual situation in the locality and provide reference for the central government and local authorities. Third, I hope that everyone will strive to become good civil servants. This is the painful experience of half my life and also my hope for the future of Chinese politics. According to my experience, whether in the central government or local authorities, it is difficult to find even one good civil servant out of a hundred people. It can be said painfully that there is not even one good civil servant out of a thousand people.

Everyone is Absent from Everything

China was originally an agrarian society, and the people, due to their environment, tend to be dreamy and neglectful of reality. The civil servants I have seen are often ambitious but lack talent, greedy but unfocused. No one is willing to fulfill their responsibilities in their positions, and no one is willing to abide by their duties. Therefore, from the central government to the local authorities, everyone is absent from everything. No matter how good a country's politics are, administration must have people. Now that the people are gone, the government ceases. Even if the people remain, the government does not act. If everyone is willing to strive to be a good civil servant and knows how to be a good civil servant, not only Shanghai will have hope, but also the future of China. Now that Shanghai's municipal administration is unified and the administration is entirely in the hands of the Chinese people, I hope that everyone will build on the achievements of the past year and work even harder. In this way, you can live up to the nation and the citizens. In the future, Shanghai will have endless progress, and I will share in the glory."

Grand Tea Party

### Shanghai Municipal Police Department Officially Established Yesterday; Citywide Police Administration Now Unified

The Shanghai Special City Police Department was formally established yesterday, the first Restoration Day of the Republic of China, and commenced operations immediately. A tea party was held at noon, with Director Chen personally attending and delivering an address. Details are recorded below:

High Morale Among All Staff

The Shanghai Municipal Police Department was officially announced yesterday morning. Director Chen and Deputy Directors Lu and Su arrived at the bureau to inspect matters. All newly appointed personnel of the various sections and offices of the bureau reported for duty. Around 11:00 AM, Director Chen received his subordinates in batches, led by Deputy Directors Lu and Su. Director Chen extended his encouragement, and all attending personnel were deeply moved and their morale was particularly high. In the afternoon, due to the Restoration Day, a half-day holiday was granted, and work was suspended to celebrate the occasion.

Director Chen's Address at Tea Party

Around 11:30 AM at noon, all staff members gathered in the Police Club on the seventh floor for a tea party. After the entire group paid respects to Director Chen, personnel from the First and Second Police Bureaus exchanged greetings. Director Chen then rose to deliver the following address: "Director Lu, fellow directors, and officers, today the police administration of Shanghai, like the municipal administration of Shanghai, has been declared unified. I sincerely want to express my expectations for all of you in the future.

First, some of you serving in the Police Department today are staff from the First Police Bureau, some are staff from the Second Police Bureau, and some are staff from the Third Police Bureau. I know that every unit must have its own history, and with the history of a unit comes the habits and views of that unit. Moreover, the First Police Bureau was reorganized from the Public Concession's patrol station, the Second Police Bureau was renamed from the original Municipal Government's Police Bureau, and the Third Police Bureau was a continuation of the former French Concession's patrol station. Each has its own different rules and different training. Today, unification and merger are announced, and in the future, perhaps everyone will have something they are not accustomed to. But although each has its own history and habits, the goal of serving the locality and protecting the people is the same. Today, Shanghai's police administration has been unified, and I hope that everyone will discard their past preconceptions, abandon their past habits, and move towards unification under Chinese laws. China has its own police laws and regulations. Everyone should act according to their past experience and follow the rules, and Shanghai's police administration will surely make significant progress. At the same time, I hope that everyone will forget past boundaries and not dwell on whether you are from the First Bureau, the Second Bureau, or the Third Bureau. You must know that today everyone belongs to the unified Police Department, and there is no longer a distinction between you and me. Secondly, everyone should know that the police are civil servants of the country, not controlled. Whether the director, the department head, or the police officer is a civil servant, even a police soldier is a civil servant. Civil servants have their identity in the country, their position in the government, and their responsibility in themselves. In the past concessions, they inevitably focused on military training and neglected the cultivation of civil servants themselves. Now that the concessions have been recovered, all of you are local officials who have responsibilities and must abide by them, not controlled. I hope everyone understands this thoroughly and makes sure that all police officers understand it thoroughly.

Third, there is a saying in ancient Chinese books: 'When entering a country, ask about its prohibitions; when entering a home, ask about its customs.' Prohibitions mean what should not be done, and customs mean what should be done. Prohibitions and customs can indicate whether a country is orderly, and from the expression of order, one can deduce the strength of a country. The police have both prohibitions and customs in their duties. Maintaining public order is certainly the responsibility of the police, but the police also have officers responsible for rectifying customs and guiding culture. In the past, the magistrate was considered the official closest to the people, but in today's China, no one is closer to the people than the police. From this, we can see how great our police's responsibilities and tasks are. We certainly cannot disturb the people. In addition to protecting the people, we also have the responsibility of guiding the people. For a year, I have been a police officer, but I am responsible and self-reflective. Shanghai's police administration has really not yet achieved what the average person ideally wants. Today, police administration has been declared unified. From today on, I hope everyone will be vigilant in protecting and promoting Shanghai.

Since the recovery of the concessions last year until today, everyone can be said to have worked tirelessly to maintain security and order. Today, at the time of police unification, I should thank everyone. I hope that everyone will work even harder after unification. You must know that securing Shanghai is securing the rear of Greater East Asia, and reviving Shanghai can also revive China. I wish you all success and look forward to your bright future."

Governing Police Administration of All Districts in the City

The bureau has unified jurisdiction over the police administration of all districts in the Shanghai Special City, including the city center (urban area) and suburban areas under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Special City Government.

Short Commentary

### Casting a Brick to Attract Jade

The selection examination for our newspaper's seventh scholarship fund is underway, and the funds will be distributed as soon as the procedures are completed. However, based on the estimated number of qualified applicants and the assumed scholarship standard, the current amount of deposits received is still significantly insufficient. We earnestly rely on the enthusiastic efforts of our readers to continue contributing.

We recently learned that our colleagues at the Xinlie News have established a Rescue Out-of-School Youth Volunteer Team and a Popularization Team to raise funds for student loans, with remarkable results. This shows the enthusiastic public sentiment towards rescuing out-of-school youth. On the one hand, we feel that society values education and shares the great vision of cultivating the most valuable source for future revitalization. On the other hand, we deeply admire the effective appeals of our colleagues. Standing in the position of helping students, we feel even more that we have the same goal and share the same comfort.

However, in order to quickly reach the end point of the same goal, we are also constantly trying our best to race forward. Therefore, on the one hand, we still rely on the continuous donations of our readers. At the same time, our staff has voluntarily collected 100,000 yuan to contribute to the scholarship fund, expressing our humble intention of contributing both effort and money. If this can serve as a catalyst to attract even greater donations from all sectors, this is what our staff hopes for.
