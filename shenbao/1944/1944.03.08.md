### Extraordinary Measures

Since Japan recently determined measures to strengthen the domestic situation, the government submitted a fifteen-article outline of extraordinary measures to the cabinet meeting on February 25. After the Prime Minister stated the purpose and implementation methods, it was immediately decided and began to draft various concrete measures. On February 29, five completed cases were announced, and on March 3, the cabinet meeting approved three specific outlines (the above sections can be found in the Central News Agency telegrams from Tokyo published in this newspaper on February 26, March 1, and 4). From this, it can be seen:

The Japanese government, mindful of the greatness of the current era and the far-reaching consequences of the war, deeply feels the necessity of strengthening the domestic situation. Therefore, within a week after the outline of extraordinary measures was proposed, several concrete plans were continuously passed in the cabinet meeting and implemented separately. This spirit of acting decisively and moving from words to deeds is worthy of our admiration and emulation. Especially in this extraordinary period, an attitude of meeting without discussing, discussing without deciding, and deciding without acting, or being perfunctory and putting on a show, cannot achieve practical results.

Articles 4, 5, 6, 7, and 13 of the outline of extraordinary measures focus on increasing production and reducing consumption. From elementary school children onward, a simple life is encouraged, and all high-end restaurants, cafes, and geisha houses are closed down, all of which enable the national population to cultivate perseverance and develop a sense of transcending peacetime. In addition, the full utilization of land, the expansion of the scope of prohibited manufacturing items, the standardization of item types, the active utilization of preserved materials, and the saving of resources can improve the efficiency of the use of inherent resources and promote the production of materials to consolidate the material conditions necessary for modern warfare.

Articles 8 and 9 of the outline of extraordinary measures focus on the flexibility of maritime transport. The shortening of sailing days, the increase of handling capacity in major ports by 50%, and the encouragement of the morale of crew members all enable the rapid flow of materials and fulfill the mission of mutual communication and corresponding supply and demand.

Article 3 of the outline of extraordinary measures focuses on the safety of residents in the rear. The strengthening of the air defense system and the promotion of general evacuation enable densely populated areas to prepare for the worst and avoid unnecessary sacrifices.

The realization of all plans and ideas depends on the power of politics, and the speed of their realization is judged by the size of political efficiency. Therefore, Articles 10, 11, 12, and 14 of the outline of extraordinary measures focus on the rapid handling of urgent matters and the simplification of administrative procedures.

Japan, with all its spirit, is giving full and positive renewal and improvement to all domestic policies and systems that directly contribute to enhancing combat power, making this year "the year of diligence" to complete its decisive battle policy. Our country, which is in the same region as Japan, should be vigilant and take good care of itself! What is the way to take care of oneself? It is: "Start with all innovations"!

### Southern Military and Political Regions Urgently Seek Resource War Potential

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain Japanese army base in the South, the conference of the heads of general affairs departments of the military and political regions of Malaya, Sumatra, Borneo, and Java was held on the 3rd and 4th, deciding that the Japanese Southern Army's administrative policy for the 19th year of Showa is to cooperate with the combat units to rapidly transform the resources of the occupied territories in the South into war potential, paying particular attention to the enhancement of transportation capacity, the construction of wooden ships, and the local self-sufficiency of major materials. Regarding the self-sufficiency of food on the ground, needless to say, efforts will be made to increase the production of coal, iron ore, soil, oil, cement, etc. In terms of iron production, in addition to increasing small smelting furnaces, small smelting furnaces of 15 to 20 tons will be rushed. For cement, easily replaceable substitute cement will be produced in various places.

### Central Reserve Bank Tightens Lending, Prices Fall Sharply

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - Recently, the money supply in Nanjing and Shanghai has been extremely tight, and the head offices of various banks have been quite short of funds. As a result, I visited the financial authorities to inquire about the truth. According to them, the recent suspension of interbank lending by the Central Reserve Bank has caused speculators who use bank funds to hoard goods to be unable to circulate their funds. Therefore, they have released domestic goods, which has had a significant effect on suppressing prices. In order to implement the goal of stabilizing people's livelihoods, the authorities will continue to adopt effective measures. After the Central Reserve Bank tightens lending, the government's financial and monetary policies will become more consolidated.

### Shanghai Section Chief Case Sent to Court for Investigation

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Construction previously received a secret report stating that Shi Fu, the former section chief of the Shanghai section of the Guan Police, had committed various illegal acts. Special investigators were sent to Shanghai to investigate separately and secretly. According to the investigation, there was indeed evidence of embezzlement and extortion. Minister Chen was greatly angered and immediately ordered the Department of Roads and Administration to summon Shi, the former section chief, to the ministry for questioning. The official admitted that during his tenure as section chief, he had stolen, sold, and arbitrarily disposed of a large number of controlled goods such as rice and cotton cloth, and extorted various non-controlled goods from passengers. The Ministry of Construction yesterday prepared a document in accordance with the Regulations on Punishing Public Officials for Embezzlement and sent the official to the court for investigation. Li Junduo, the director of the Road Police Administration Office, was dismissed for failing to supervise his subordinates and failing to report them in advance, dereliction of duty. As for how to deal with it, because there are other cases, it is being submitted to the Yuan for approval.

### Beijing and Tianjin Newspapers Reduce Page Count

Beiping, 7th (Central News Agency) - The newspaper industry in Beiping has undergone several changes since the incident. Recently, the authorities, in view of the current wartime system, and in order to save paper, stipulated that from March 1, the Beiping Xinmin Bao will be changed to a small four-page daily publication, and the Tianjin newspapers will also issue four-page editions like the Xinmin Bao. The Beiping Citizens' Daily and Shishi Bao will both be changed to eight-page editions, but the price will remain the same.

### Manchuria and North China Negotiate Material Trade

Xinjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - Manchuria and North China Negotiating Bureau in order to establish each other's trade plan for this year, was held in two o'clock in the afternoon on the 7th of Manchuria and North China Trade Agreement, first by the Manchurian State Guhai Secretariat Deputy Minister made a speech, namely separate meeting of Manchuria's import materials discussion meeting, and the Financial Subcommittee meeting held to reach an agreement, the Manchurian State import materials discussion meeting, during which in addition to reviewing last year's results, more in this year's expectations are ore and coal as the center, to review this year's plan for the number and transport issues, and the Financial Subcommittee export materials mobilization materials discussion, the last session was held to coordinate overall issues.

### A New Phase in European Air Warfare

Recently, "European air raids against Germany, which originally always consisted of indiscriminate blind bombing at night and in bad weather; but recently, fighter planes have been dispatched on a large scale to engage in direct combat with German fighter squadrons, while accurately bombing German aircraft factories during the day. The distinctive feature of the anti-Axis side entering this new phase is that the losses suffered when the Axis air raids on Germany are intercepted by German fighters are increasing daily.

In the anti-Axis air raid on Germany on February 20, 600 aircraft were dispatched, and 79 were lost, reaching more than 10%. This is really not worth the loss on the anti-Axis side. Especially in the recent air raids on Stuttgart, Leipzig, Munich, and Western Europe, the anti-Axis forces have lost a total of 5,000 large bombers.

The increase in the number of these losses is due to the fact that the German side recently recalled some of the fighter planes that were dispatched to the Eastern Front and the Italian Front to defend the mainland, imposing a heavy "transit tax" on the invading anti-Axis bombers, making it impossible for the anti-Axis side not to increase the number of fighter planes to protect the bombers. The anti-Axis side is attempting to destroy the aircraft manufacturing plants in Germany that produce fighter planes, which is the most effective way to avoid the transit tax.

One way to remove German aircraft from European skies."

However, the air force has already figured out this air raid attempt by the anti-Axis side, and recently began a large-scale air raid on London, causing most of the anti-Axis fighter planes to be disrupted and controlled in the UK mainland to defend London, hindering the fighter planes from participating in the air raid on Germany. In addition, the German side knows very well that the anti-Axis side has a very developed detection organization for German bombers, and when the enemy planes bomb the German mainland, they also air raid London at the same time. The recent London air raid planes usually fly over the target area at the same time when the anti-Axis planes return from the German mainland, causing the British sound monitoring network to fall into confusion and taking the opportunity to strike.

Therefore, it is not easy for the anti-Axis side to find out about the invading German bombers. The British plan is to bomb during the day and put Germany in a state of destruction, to gain air supremacy, and to use it as the basis for the "European Unified Operation". However, due to the fierce counterattack of the German Air Force, the British plan failed, and the anti-Axis forces' plan to invade Europe was permanently buried. (Xiang: Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi on February 25)

German Aircraft Bomb London in Force

The German Air Force bombed London on the night of February 22. In terms of the number of participating aircraft and the intensity of the situation, it was the largest bombing since the autumn of 1940. The German military authorities said when meeting with foreign reporters on the 23rd:

The number of aircraft participating in this bombing is the largest ever seen in the bombing of London. However, the losses from this "massive bombing were extremely light, which is noteworthy. The Su Air Force used new incendiary bombs in this bombing of London and confirmed its great power.

According to German intelligence, the German Air Force attacked London with hundreds of aircraft in the evening of February 22, causing great damage to the entire city. The southeastern areas of the city were the worst hit, with large fires breaking out everywhere. According to the military authorities, the above-mentioned bombing effect was due to the German bomber squadron using a new strict technique. A second war against England will therefore be launched on a large scale as a result of this bombing. (Xiang: Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi on February 25)

### Fierce Fighting in the Ukrainian Front, A Soviet Army Unit in the Northern Route Surrounded

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - Marshal Zhukov of the Soviet Army responded to the First Ukrainian Front Army, which had launched a major offensive on the great battlefield from Hrypetovka, 170 miles west of Kyiv, to Proskurov, southwest of Kyiv on the 4th. On the 6th, the German army revealed the current situation of the war as follows: The Soviet army on the vast battle line west of Shepetivka and north of Proskurov continued to launch a large-scale offensive on the 5th. After several hours of fierce fighting, the German army retreated about ten kilometers to the south. Because the German army only used a grenadier division to fight against more than two Soviet tank divisions in this battle, it finally retreated after a long period of fierce fighting. However, the German army took the opportunity to cut off the connection between the Soviet tank units and the infantry units. The Soviet infantry units immediately counterattacked to restore the connection, but failed and suffered concentrated artillery fire from the German army.

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities announced that the focus of the northern war on the 5th was concentrated on the two cities of Pskov and Narva. The Soviet army in the Pskov area attempted to break into the city from the southeast and northeast with several units, but was repelled by the German army. Although the Soviet army in the Narva area launched a counter-agricultural attack, it failed to advance because the German artillery fire was concentrated on it. Two days ago, the German army had already carried out annihilation operations against the powerful Soviet units under the German encirclement, gradually shrinking the encirclement.

The Southern Railway Line is Strategically Contested

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Maritime News Agency, the last offensive of the Soviet army's winter offensive has begun a few days ago. Its initial goal is to break through the southern route stack to open the road to invade Romania. Although the Soviet army has made progress, it is still far from its goal. The marshy land in the south has not hindered the march of the German mechanized units, and the severe cold of the winter of 1941 to 1942 has not affected the German army's operations. The problem now is the enemy's supply problem. I still remember that a year ago, General Mengstein used the enemy's difficult period to break into the side of the Soviet army's position in Kharkiv, and finally recovered the city. The terrain of the southern road is special, and the communication problem between the two sides is the reason why the Soviet army attacked from three points at the same time. The Soviet army launched an offensive in Shepetivka on the 5th, using the Kyiv railway as a supply line. Twenty-four hours later, it set off and advanced from the Zvenigorodka area. General Veshatin failed to prevent the German army from exiting to the west of Kasey's small encirclement bag. The phenomena that Zvenigorodka must have, but the German reserve unit may not be able to arrive at the time. As for the fierce breakthrough plan, it has not been successful.

### Major Air Battle Occurs in the Suburbs of Berlin, Several American Aircraft Shot Down

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - Maritime News Agency reported that the latest news last night was that 108 American aircraft were shot down yesterday in the raid on Berlin.

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to military sources, a large number of American aircraft entered Germany yesterday and were intercepted by German fighters, resulting in an unprecedented fierce battle. The battle zone covered the entire northwest and central Germany, with the most intense fighting between the Zuiderzee and Lake Havel near Berlin. The air raid alarm was issued in Berlin at 1:00 PM. German fighters and anti-aircraft guns forced the enemy aircraft to change course from time to time. When the enemy aircraft flew to the suburbs of Berlin, many had already been shot down. Although there were many enemy aircraft, they were scattered and could not concentrate their bombing, and no damage was caused. This air raid was the least important of all the air raids Berlin has experienced. The large number of fighters protecting the American bombers flew very high, some as high as 10,000 meters or more, so German aircraft had to ascend to high altitudes to engage them. Most of the air battles around Berlin took place at an altitude of 8,000 meters. Although there was a haze in the sky at times, the shadows of the enemy aircraft could still be seen.

### Turkey Refuses to Join the War, British Military Delegation Returns Home

Zurich, 7th (Central News Agency) - A United Press reporter in Cairo reported that the Turkish government had frankly refused to join the war before a large number of military supplies had been completely delivered and had given the anti-Axis powers a base. The transportation and preparation of use of this military supplies takes a fruit moon, The British military delegation has encountered a lot of political difficulties and has recently left the country empty-handed. The Turkish General Staff refused to adopt the British estimate of the forces that the German army could use against Turkey. News of the communication pointed out that in the possible air war, Turkey's estimate of Germany's strength was ten times higher than that of the British intelligence officers. At the same time, according to London news, Turkey will soon send a delegation to London to negotiate the resumption of military supplies to Turkey.

Ankara, 7th (Central News Agency) - Maritime News reported that after the recent deterioration of British-Turkish relations, 400 British people will soon leave the Turkish capital, most of whom are advisors, experts, technicians, and engineering decorations working in Turkey as stipulated in the British-Turkish agreement.

### Rice Control Association Holds Symposium with Purchasing Merchants from Various Regions Yesterday: Report on Implementation Measures for Exchange of Purchased Goods

To ensure smoother progress in future procurement operations and to provide guidance on the purchasing policies for purchasing merchants, the Rice Control Association held a symposium yesterday at 2:00 PM in the Li Chay Hotel, second floor, gathering all preparatory committee members from both Area A and Area B purchasing industries. The attendees included Chairman Yuan Ludeng, Vice Chairmen Guangye Junyi and Chen Guoquan, Committee Member Ueda Kenjiro, Secretary-General Zhou Chunyu, Deputy Secretary-General Yang Rong, heads of various departments, and over 150 preparatory committee members from Areas A and B purchasing industries. Tang Wenhua served as the master of ceremonies, Jin Zhan and Zhou Jiru recorded the minutes. After the formal greetings, Chairman Yuan delivered the opening remarks, followed by speeches from Military Representative Staff Officer Inoue, Captain Anan, Counselor Okazaki from the Embassy, and Committee Member Ueda, all delivering earnest and encouraging words. Secretary-General Zhou then reported on the implementation measures for the exchange of purchased goods, after which the meeting adjourned. The following is the original text of Chairman Yuan's instructions: Since the establishment of this association, in the past five months, thanks to everyone's efforts in their respective roles, we have achieved some success in procuring rice. I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation on behalf of the association. However, this association bears the full responsibility for the nationwide rice control. We must implement the planned arrangements effectively for military grain, civilian food, and grain for the military and civilians of allied nations, to achieve the intended goals. The past five months were just the beginning of the overall operation. In the future, we will have even more significant tasks. We still need everyone's continued efforts. Now, I will elaborate on the key points of this meeting:

Strive to Fulfill the Great Mission

First, regarding the previous procurement situation for the purchasing merchants, some slightly exceeded the planned amounts, some submitted the required amount as per the order, and some delivered half or less of the ordered quantity. The situations varied, and the results were naturally different. As for profits, some have already obtained considerable surpluses, while others have incurred losses due to difficulties in obtaining goods. The association fully understands this. We hope that you will continue to work hard in the future. Those who profited previously should be even more enthusiastic and procure even larger quantities than before. Those who suffered losses previously should study remedial measures this time, seek opportunities for compensation, and fulfill your ultimate responsibilities together to accomplish this great mission.

Thorough Assistance for Smooth Progress

Second, regarding the many obstacles encountered in procurement in the past, we have decided to do our utmost to break through all barriers in the future. You must promptly cooperate with the association, take joint and practical responsibility, and work hard together. In addition, we will ask our allied military police to use greater force to thoroughly assist us, so that we can make rapid and smooth progress. Third, the association will reward those purchasing merchants from various regions who have excellent performance and can fulfill their responsibilities and also protect their rights to the best of our ability. We hope that you will invigorate your spirits and continue to move forward. Do not retreat in the face of difficulties. If you encounter slight difficulties or suffer minor losses, do not be discouraged or lazy and request to withdraw. That would be a great disservice to the country and the people. The above three points are my sincere contributions to everyone. I hope we all have a spirit of dauntlessness and advance bravely together. Know that a bright future is in the near future.

### Municipal Civil Defense Headquarters Plans Women's Air Defense Clothing: Universally Worn on Three Air Defense Days

A person in charge of the Shanghai Special Municipality Civil Defense Headquarters made the following statement regarding citizens wearing air defense clothing:

Since the Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Command announced Announcement No. 21 on the first of this month and implemented blackout measures throughout the Shanghai Special Municipality from the third of this month, Shanghai has gradually entered the decisive stage of the war. This is a battle to defend Greater Shanghai and protect the lives and property of five million citizens. All kinds of civil defense activities should be carried out with utmost effort and without the slightest negligence. The Civil Defense Headquarters, in preparation for any eventuality, has been reorganizing all preparations. In order to prevent citizens from being injured and to facilitate initial fire prevention, evacuation, and rescue operations, the issue of citizens wearing air defense clothing is considered an important part of the air defense effort. We hope that citizens will strive to prepare it and wear it universally on the third "Air Defense Day" on March 9.

Remake Old Clothes to Save Resources

What the headquarters believes is urgently needed is the standard air defense clothing for Chinese women, which should be formulated as soon as possible. Therefore, we have repeatedly convened representatives from large department stores, social organizations, women's groups, and news reporters to discuss and integrate opinions from all parties so as to tailor air defense clothing that is adequate to the reality. As a result of the discussion, we first trialed a sample of the standard air defense clothing as shown in the photos below. However, considering that it is extremely difficult to purchase cotton cloth at this time, and prices are unusually high, it would be quite difficult to tailor new air defense clothing. To be economical and practical, old clothes can be remade. We hope that citizens can refer to the attached drawings, use the completed style as a blueprint, use old fabrics to make clothing similar to the standards, or create their own appropriate clothing and wear it regularly in preparation for any eventuality.

Key Points for Designing Air Defense Clothing

The design of air defense clothing is very important, and attention should be paid to the following: The exposed parts of the body, such as the head, face, hands, and feet, should be covered as much as possible to avoid burns and reduce the impact of shrapnel and gravel. The clothing should allow for extreme ease of movement, such as hiding in air-raid shelters or appropriate shelters, dodging shrapnel and rocks, or engaging in initial fire prevention or rescuing the elderly, weak, and young. Air defense clothing should be wearable in all seasons, regardless of the climate, and should be made of durable materials that can withstand long-term wear. If you can pay attention to the above points and make proper clothing for application, that will be the best policy.

Actively Prepare to Prevent Disasters

Chief Sun of the Headquarters General Affairs Office stated on the 4th of this month that the Greater East Asia War is not limited to the central or southwestern Pacific and the border of Myanmar. This city has also become a battlefield, so enemy planes may appear over this city at any time and drop bombs indiscriminately. To cope with this, it is necessary to conduct air defense training. At the same time, women and children should also wear air defense clothing. Do not neglect this at ordinary times, and actively prepare to prevent the disasters you may suffer. This point should be fully realized. All measures are for your own sake. We hope to devote efforts to the preparation and wearing of air defense clothing.

### Colleagues in the Industrial Raw Material Market Contribute Over 50,000 Yuan in Scholarship to Benefit Poor Students

This newspaper received a letter yesterday from colleagues in the Shanghai Industrial Raw Material Market, stating: "In recent years, the cost of living has soared. There are countless families who cannot afford food and clothing, and the number of out-of-school children is increasing daily. Youth dropping out of school is not only a personal loss but also a loss to the country and society. Your newspaper's initiative to set up a scholarship is well-intentioned. The colleagues of our industry, after admiring it, have initiated a movement to support the scholarship.
