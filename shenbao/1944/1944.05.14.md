### Indifference

— Tōsuke Yoshida

Someone once asked me: "If the situation in East Asia continues as it is, the Chinese will never actively participate in the war. The Anglo-American style of hedonism is still rampant in Shanghai. Why are the Chinese intellectuals witnessing this national demise without resolutely rising up?" Not only this Japanese person, but also many Chinese people, are thoroughly criticizing Chinese intellectuals for their passive attitude towards the current political situation. Among the Japanese, there is a prevailing discussion: that the current Chinese politics are bad, and it is the responsibility of Chinese intellectuals to correct this, but Chinese intellectuals are just standing by and watching the suffering of the general public, and hoping for the improvement of the current political situation is like "waiting for the Yellow River to run clear." I would also scold such an attitude of Chinese intellectuals as "sitting on the fence," but to be honest, the responsibility for Chinese intellectuals holding this "sitting on the fence" attitude cannot but be attributed to the attitude of the Japanese as well. But the reason why I have not asked the Japanese side to conduct self-criticism, I think anyone who thinks about it a little will understand immediately. Confucius also said: "If one does not say, 'What shall I do? What shall I do?' I can indeed do nothing with him." (Wei Linggong) If the other party only says what they want to say, and has no intention of discussing "What shall I do? What shall I do?" even Confucius has no way to deal with such a person. In other words, before implementing a "policy change," there is a tendency among the Japanese to only say what they want to say. Many Japanese people do not want to listen to the opinions of Chinese people on the Chinese issue, but only push out the Japanese Greater East Asia ideology, and fabricate the idea that Chinese people "must do this and that." Any Chinese people who do not conform to this idea are deeply resented and severely suppressed. Therefore, at that time, Chinese intellectuals did not want to have a head-on theoretical conflict with the Japanese on Chinese issues and East Asian issues, but thought that it was better to avoid provoking the Japanese and to get away from them as soon as possible. However, Chinese intellectuals do not harbor irreconcilable national hatred towards the Japanese, nor do they have a permanent attitude of shared hatred. Because they all know that without the Japanese Meiji Restoration, the entire Asia would have become a colony of Britain and the United States long ago. At the same time, they also understand that if Japan were to be destroyed, China alone would absolutely not be able to maintain its independence and freedom against the attacks of Anglo-American financial capital. Only on this point are they sincerely willing to assist Japan. Since assistance is needed, the Japanese should listen fully to the opinions of Chinese intellectuals with a friendly attitude. If the Japanese are willing to listen to such national demands of China with a friendly attitude, I believe that Chinese intellectuals will always be sincerely willing to talk to the Japanese openly and honestly. Conversely, if the Japanese are always like a fierce wild bull, just rushing around according to their own goals, and always respond to what Chinese intellectuals say with indifference, then they can only politely step aside. Because if they engage in theoretical struggles with the Japanese head-on, it will only result in being hit over the head and will not help the situation, so the best way to deal with the Japanese is to respect them and keep a distance.

I also know this Chinese mentality very well. I often ask people in high positions of power for their opinions on Chinese issues. I certainly don't have the authority to deal with this issue, but I know that the Chinese issue is a major issue that affects the fate of the motherland, so I study it with enthusiasm. For this reason, no matter how high or powerful the person is, I will not hesitate to give advice and persuade them. However, if the other party's understanding of the Chinese is too superficial, and they stubbornly cling to their own superficial views and do not listen to me, I can only consider myself unlucky. At the same time, I think that the best way to deal with such Japanese people is to avoid offending them as much as possible, implement a policy of respecting the gods and keeping them at a distance, and only put on a forced smile and mechanically repeat what the other party says. I believe that this attitude and spirit is the Chinese intellectuals' attitude and spirit of individualism or self-preservation in dealing with the Japanese. Chinese intellectuals have the most brilliant performance in this attitude and spirit, which is very different from clumsy people like us. Zeng Guofan believed that if one encounters a foreigner who insults one in person, the best method is to smile gently and pretend to be a fool who does not understand their words. Chinese people who have received this kind of education believe that when the other party cannot be reasoned with, they use the "perfunctory" method to deal with everything. This has the same meaning as "dealing with" in Japanese. However, educated Chinese people never show this kind of "perfunctoriness" on the surface, but express it in a very polite and respectful way, so that the other party who is being "dealt with" does not realize that they are being "dealt with." Gu Hongming used the term "polite evasiveness" to describe this technique of the Chinese. When Chinese and Japanese celebrities gather for a meal, I often humbly occupy the last seat as an interpreter, but what amazes and admires me is that all the Chinese celebrities are genius experts in using "polite evasiveness"—it would be more appropriate to use the term cunning old foxes here.

Only the blind cannot see the Chinese's polite evasiveness in the Chinese intellectuals' passive attitude towards the current political situation. If Chinese intellectuals are experts in "perfunctoriness," then Japan can only deal with this with "sincerity." Because sincerity does not allow any deception. As for why the Chinese avoid the Japanese, it is because they believe that the Japanese are unreasonable. Therefore, before the Japanese say what they want to say, they must first let the Chinese say what they want to say. At this time, even if what the Chinese say is fundamentally different from the Japanese opinions, even if there are things that make people's hair stand on end, do not immediately raise your hand and give them a punch, but use theoretical struggle to persuade the other party, or be persuaded by the other party. In short, it is necessary to seek a common "reason" between the two major ethnic groups in theory. If the Japanese can prove to the Chinese that they understand reason, then Chinese intellectuals will not quietly avoid the Japanese like avoiding a bull, and will definitely take a step further and begin to engage in head-on theoretical struggles with the Japanese. This is the best way to eliminate the political passivity of Chinese intellectuals and make them participate in East Asian politics. (Translated by Lu)

### Japanese Troops Attack Assam: Bloody Battles Around Kohima; Enemy Supplies Increasingly Difficult Due to Approaching Rainy Season

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 13th – The offensive and defensive battles in the Kohima area are becoming increasingly fierce due to the approaching rainy season. The enemy is actively counterattacking in order to prevent the Japanese troops from attacking Dimapur and to recapture Kohima, in order to open up the supply route to Imphal. The Japanese troops are both engaging in counterattacks and actively advancing into Assam. As a result, bloody battles have erupted around Kohima. Currently, the enemy troops are trapped in a Japanese encirclement. At the same time, the 40,000 British troops whose retreat routes and ground supply lines have been cut off were originally only supplied with materials by air. Now, due to the arrival of the rainy season, aerial resupply is hindered, making it even more difficult. Therefore, the enemy's only hope is to open up the highway from Imphal to Dimapur. The enemy has no other way to rescue the Fourth Army except to recapture Kohima. Therefore, since May, the enemy has been actively counterattacking, not only continuing to dispatch troops from Chittagong and Shillong (west of Kohima) to reinforce Dimapur, but also gradually transferring troops from the north to the south to watch Kohima. The enemy troops in the area north of Dimapur to Kohima include the Fifth Division and the Forty-Fourth Division of the Fifteenth Army, which were previously in the Chittagong area, as well as the Forty-Second Independent Tank Corps with mechanized units. These forces are repeatedly counterattacking with the highway from Kohima to Dimapur as the center. In addition, the enemy artillery north of Zubza (10 kilometers northwest of Kohima and between Jotsoma) is fiercely shelling the Japanese positions day and night to support the defense of a corner of the 4600 high ground. At the same time, they are also using elite infantry units and well-trained air force units to attack the Japanese positions south of the 460 high ground west of Kohima and the 5129 high ground east of it. In addition, the enemy troops advancing southward from the Mokokchung Bridge (90 kilometers north-northwest of Kohima) are moving around in the area north of Narma, and part of them have infiltrated the dense forest area between Longkhum and Tsomi, attempting to disrupt the Japanese rear. However, the Japanese units not only inflicted heavy damage on the enemy troops, but also strengthened their offensive against Dimapur.

### Corner of Enemy Linear Defense Line Broken Through

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th – According to reports from the Indian front, the enemy troops around Palel have now received reinforcements of about 1,000 troops from the Wakching (15 kilometers north of Palel) area and are continuing their efforts to resist. On the morning of the 8th, well-trained Japanese troops dispatched aircraft to attack a corner of the linear defense line of Senaamk-Taglaam-Kankuno south of the highway, which the enemy was desperately defending. They broke through several barbed wire fences, opened a breakthrough route, and then launched a fierce attack on the 4562 high ground, completely occupying it. Another Japanese unit fiercely attacked the Sabam (9 kilometers southeast of Palel) fortress north of the highway and brought it under control. As a result, a corner of the linear defense line where the enemy was attempting to make a last stand was broken through by the Japanese troops, threatening the central part of the line. In addition, the enemy troops at the Palel and Imphal airfields east of the highway and at the Kyakhaung airfield are relying on strong fortifications to resist. Japanese aircraft have been continuously bombing them since the 9th, and ground attacks have also inflicted heavy damage. Enemy trucks are fully loaded with wounded soldiers and are being transported towards Imphal. The fierce fighting in the final stages of the battle of Palel is evident from this. The Japanese troops have recently received reinforcements and are now fiercely attacking the defeated enemy.

### Japanese Appoint Envoy to Promote Pan-Asianism: Mr. Godo Arrives in Manchuria

Central News Agency, Xinjing, 13th – Mr. Takuo Godo, the Japanese envoy dispatched to Manchuria to promote Pan-Asianism, arrived in Xinjing by plane at 4:00 PM on the 12th. He is scheduled to stay in Manchuria for more than ten days. In addition to personally visiting various agencies in Xinjing to hold cordial talks and gatherings, he also plans to travel to Harbin, Anshan, and other places, or hold lectures, and investigate the actual situation in various places. He is scheduled to leave Xinjing and return to Japan on the 26th.

### Situation Consolidated in Central Pacific: Enemy Aircraft Attack Rabaul and Truk

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th – Although the war situation in the Pacific has remained tense in the past one or two weeks, there has been no significant movement. This indicates that while the enemy wants to advance quickly, their actions are gradually being limited. The Japanese side is turning all resources in the occupied territories in the south into combat power and actively producing war materials. On the contrary, US military production has now reached its peak, which is actually a major obstacle to the enemy's counterattack attempt. Japan's strength is still steadily increasing, which is the opposite of what they imagine. For example, the fact that the Japanese army launched the Imphal operation this time and was able to launch large-scale operations at the same time is proof of the strong strength of Japan. The Japanese army's position in the Central Pacific is now becoming more and more consolidated. The elite Japanese army and navy are determined to crush the enemy's movements at any time and anywhere. In short, there is no major shift in the war situation in the Pacific. There are only guerrilla-like movements by the enemy. Currently, the enemy mobile units are gathering in the Marshall Islands, and on the northern coast of New Guinea, they are still trying to advance at any opportunity. The situation of the movements in that area is recorded as follows: In the Solomon Islands, Rabaul is still the center of enemy air attacks. The number of incoming aircraft in the past was 900 per day, but now it has been reduced to 100. Each time they attack, many are shot down or destroyed by the Japanese garrison. From May 6 to date, a total of 30 enemy aircraft have been shot down. In addition, the Japanese army sank an enemy torpedo boat and destroyed an enemy destroyer in the Santa Isabel area on the 6th. In the New Guinea area, enemy aircraft occasionally attack in numbers of 20. In the past week, the Japanese army shot down and destroyed 6 enemy aircraft in that area. In the Banda Sea area, Ambon, Ternate, and other places are also occasionally attacked by several to a dozen enemy aircraft. From May 4 to 8, the Japanese army shot down and destroyed 6 enemy aircraft. In the Central Pacific area, enemy aircraft are only conducting small-scale guerrilla actions against Ponape, Truk, Mili, Mortlock, and Guam.

Central News Agency, Rabaul, 13th – On the 10th and 11th, 100 enemy aircraft attacked Rabaul each day. The Japanese army in that area immediately engaged in counterattacks. It is estimated that 5 enemy aircraft were shot down and 4 destroyed on the 10th, and 2 were shot down on the 11th. There were no losses on the Japanese side.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th – According to reports from a certain Japanese base in the Central Pacific, approximately 26 enemy aircraft attacked Truk Island on the morning of the 10th. Three were shot down by the Japanese army and two were destroyed. The Japanese side suffered minor losses.

### Joint British-American Air Fleet Heavily Damaged in Attack on Burma

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 13th – On the afternoon of the 12th, the Japanese fighter squadron received an alert that enemy aircraft were attacking and immediately dispatched to a certain area. They encountered 12 enemy P-38 and 12 P-51 aircraft and engaged in a fierce air battle, shooting down 7 enemy P-51 aircraft (including 4 unconfirmed) and repelling them. In addition, the enemy aircraft that attacked the area on the 11th were a joint British-American fighter squadron. The upper formation was composed of Hurricane aircraft, the middle formation was composed of North American aircraft, and the lowest formation was composed of Lockheed P-38 aircraft. They attacked in three-tier formations. This was the first joint operation by the British and American armies and is of great importance. Five of the eight British Hurricane aircraft in the top tier were shot down, suffering heavy damage.

### Prime Minister Tojo to Explain "Beliefs Regarding the Current Situation": All-Japan Uprising Rally to be Held This Morning

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th – The Central Headquarters of the All-Japan National Uprising Movement will be held solemnly at the Hibiya Public Hall here at 8:00 AM on the 14th, under the auspices of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the Imperial Rule Political Association. At that time, Prime Minister Tojo will frankly explain "Beliefs Regarding the Current Situation," emphasizing that in order to defeat the stubborn enemies Britain and the United States, the people of the country should recognize the current situation and make efforts in all aspects of production. Those attending the meeting include officials from the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, the Imperial Rule Political Association, and other government officials, as well as representatives from various important industries, a total of more than 5,000 people from 50-odd cooperating organizations. After the meeting, representatives will be selected to go to the Ise Grand Shrine and the Meiji Shrine to offer prayers for victory.

### Appropriate Time for Reflection by Chongqing: Recluse of Jiangnan

The troops of Tang Enbo in Chongqing were known as the Iron Army, brave and good at fighting, but in the Henan front, they were effortlessly defeated by the Japanese army in less than twenty days. The Japanese army drove straight in and occupied 60,000 square miles of land. This achievement shocked the world.

The anti-Axis side has now recognized that the Japanese army still has strong potential on all fronts. On the one hand, it is criticizing the leaders of Chongqing, believing that Chongqing is no longer trustworthy. It should be known that the failure of the Chongqing army on the Henan front was actually deceived by Britain and the United States, and Chongqing should reflect on this. Chongqing knows that the reason for the weakness of its military strength is due to the US military's stingy assistance. In the Henan campaign, Tang Enbo's army suffered heavy losses because of the lack of military equipment. This blow prompted Chongqing to re-examine the question of whether the so-called assistance from the United States was "sincere." In fact, they have long expressed dissatisfaction with the United States, and some even advocate reconsidering their attitude towards that country. The Ta Kung Pao said in its May 10 editorial that since October of last year, the United States, according to the Lend-Lease Act, provided 40 percent to Britain, 21 percent to the Soviet Union, and China received only 2 percent. The decisive moment of the Pacific War is approaching, and Chongqing is an important country in East Asia, and should receive greater military aid from the United States, etc. The above remarks are enough to represent Chongqing's dissatisfaction.

Chongqing Lacks Military Equipment

At a reception for foreign reporters held by Zhang Pingqun, spokesman for the Executive Yuan of Chongqing, on the 10th of this month, someone asked, "Will the victory of the Japanese army in Henan prompt Chongqing to ask the United States to train its troops?" Zhang replied that training cannot be victorious if military equipment is lacking. Now that the Chongqing army has no heavy weapons such as tanks and is in an unfavorable environment, it has suffered heavy losses. We sincerely hope that the Allied countries will provide assistance quickly to avoid further defeats. However, the government and the people are convinced that the supply of weapons depends on the smooth flow of transportation, and the blockage of transportation is currently the most serious problem." In fact, there is currently no transportation route that can directly reach Chongqing. No matter how loudly the leaders of Chongqing cry out for help, they cannot obtain sufficient military equipment, and their anxious state of mind is self-evident. Furthermore, the US Lend-Lease Act stipulates that repayment must be made with materials, which shows that the United States wants to treat China as a colony after the war. Not only that, Chongqing has two infantry training schools supervised by US military officers, and four more are planned to be established. The Sino-British mixed aviation team has also been established. The equipment of the Chongqing army has also been Americanized. The Chongqing army currently does not need this kind of training, but it is being subjected to Americanized training. What is its political intention? There is no doubt that the United States wants to seize power in China after the war. Zhang Chuanshi's mention of this point was indeed filled with poignant irony.

The leaders of the Chongqing regime should know what steps the United States is taking in order to achieve its ultimate goals in China. If the leaders of Chongqing have not yet realized the intentions of the United States, then with the battles on the Henan front raging, now is the most appropriate time to reconsider the true intentions and motives of the United States.

### Japanese Troops Southeast of Dengfeng Shrink Encirclement: Tang's Troops Trapped and Lose Combat Power

Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 13th – The Japanese troops southeast of Dengfeng have encircled Tang Enbo's army and have recently been pressing them further. Tang Enbo's army is the elite of the Chongqing army, but since the Japanese army began the Yellow River crossing operation and the encirclement operation in the Funiu Mountains, only a little over two weeks have passed. 170,000 people have lost their combat power.

Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th – The elite units of the North China Japanese Army crossed the Old Yellow River and the New Yellow River on a large scale on the 18th of last month, and swept across the Henan Plain. Chiang's direct line troops under Tang Enbo's command, who were stubbornly defeated, are now trapped in the Funiu Mountains. Another unit of the Japanese army chased fiercely to Xuchang. The fleeing defeated troops moved south along the Beijing-Hankou Railway, causing the strong enemy in Yancheng to collapse. The elite units of the Central China Japanese Army moved north from Wuhan, dispersed the Fifth War Zone Army under Li Zongren's command, and made rapid advances. The invincible Japanese army, the northern and southern armies, met on the 9th of this month at Queshan on the Beijing-Hankou Railway. Here, the transportation hub from Wuhan to North China has been completed, and the transportation of troops and offensive operations can be carried out freely, and the threat to the enemy is constantly increasing.

Commander-in-Chief Hata Arrives at the Front

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th – The Japanese Resident Army Headquarters in China announced at 2:00 PM on the 13th that Commander-in-Chief Hata had arrived at the Henan front in North China on May 8 to guide the operation in the Henan area.

Central News Agency, Hankou, 13th – The Japanese Central China Army, in response to the offensive of the North China Army, suddenly launched a full-scale offensive against the Fifth War Zone of Chongqing on May 1. The Chongqing army under Li Zongren's command retreated without any resistance. Since the Japanese army began its operation, it has occupied two places in just a few days, and the Japanese army is still advancing fiercely towards a certain important point, and a part of it has already joined forces with the North China Army in Queshan.

Japanese Aircraft Shoot Down Attacking Enemy Aircraft

Central News Agency, Tai'an, 13th – The Japanese Air Force units intercepted a joint squadron of US Air Force fighters and bombers stationed in Chongqing, consisting of 11 P-40 aircraft and 5 B-25 aircraft, attacking east of Luoyang at 2:30 PM on the 11th. At the same time, Japanese aircraft intercepted them over Quyang and Mianchi. After a fierce air battle, one of the P-40 aircraft was shot down, but this has not been confirmed. The Japanese side suffered no losses in this battle and safely returned to their positions.

### Military Political Department Repeatedly Cracks Down; Chongqing Communists' Reactionary Conspiracies; Many Cases Cracked in Half a Year

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, since its establishment, has been in operation for half a year. Staff in various locations, under the leadership of Director Huang Ziqiang, Deputy Director Yang Zhen, and Bureau Chiefs Wan Lilang and Hu Junhe, have all been diligent and dedicated, burying themselves in hard work, and vigorously advancing their fixed work. They have repeatedly cracked down on the conspiracies and assassination cases of reactionary elements from Chongqing and the Red Communists. The problems are nipped in the bud and public safety is relied upon. Apart from a portion of the above-mentioned cases that still require investigation and are not yet suitable for publication, the names, locations, firearms, and ammunition of the perpetrators in the cases cracked by the department in the past half-year are disclosed below:

Zhou Polang, the Director of the Self-Defense Association Reorganization Committee of Zhuji County, Chongqing, collected 150 enemy soldiers from the former Zhuji County Self-Defense Force and reorganized them into a special task force. Equipped with two light machine guns and over thirty rifles, he dispatched Chen Yueliang as the captain, and they roamed around various townships in Zhuji County, including Changji, Changhe, Pule, and Dongping, specializing in harassing the local area and plotting against our peace workers and transportation personnel. Recently, it was reported that internal factions caused rifts. Members of the former Self-Defense Force and Zhou Polang's direct personnel discriminated against each other due to unequal treatment, creating an irreconcilable situation. At the end of February, the enemy clashed in a certain location, resulting in Zhou Youliang, the squad leader of Zhou's direct line, being killed by Chen Yueliang. The soldiers under his command harbored different intentions and deserted with their weapons. The remaining twenty or so people were all former members of the "Self-Defense Force." The situation had reached a point where retreat was difficult. Chen had no choice but to lead the force to sneak to a certain location, hesitant about their next move. Seeing that the opportunity was ripe, our side dispatched twenty-five working comrades, equipped with weapons, at dawn on March 11th, rushing to the destination in the rain. They arrived at approximately 8:00 AM and carried out a lightning-style encirclement. At that time, the enemy was still asleep, caught off guard by the unexpected turn of events. From the captain, Chen Yueliang, down to twenty-three individuals, all personnel and equipment were captured by us without anyone escaping. The names of the captured Chongqing special task force members and the confiscated firearms and ammunition are listed below: (1) Captured Personnel: Chen Yueliang (Captain), Zhao Tieshan, Hong Huaishui (Squad Leaders), He Sen (Adjutant), Zhang Yitian (Intelligence Team Leader), Cai Zhi, He Chunshui, Shou Zhong, He Xiong, Xuan Tiejun (above are Platoon Leaders), Yu Fushan, Zhu Dingcai (Light Machine Gunners), Wu Sen, Zhao Ziyou, Wang Licai, Zhang Yong, Zhang Zaiyang (above are Private Soldiers), Zhou Quanpin, Guo Liang (Private First Class), Yang Rengui, Guo Hongshan (Ten Household Heads), Zhen Xian, Chen Xingliang (Messengers). (2) Confiscated Ammunition and Firearms: One Czech-style light machine gun, ten Zhongzheng-style rifles, one No. 2 wooden case, one spare machine gun barrel, four magazines, one magazine loader, 937 bullets, one bayonet, one bugle.

Shen Yihang, leader of the demolition group of the Chongqing Loyalty and National Salvation Army's Cheng-Xi-Yu Office's training battalion, along with group members Zhang Mingsheng and three others, carried one five-pound thermos and one milk bottle each, filled with explosive materials, and infiltrated Wuxi city on December 3rd of last year, attempting to sabotage the city before the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. They were arrested on December 7th, and two blocks of explosives were seized.

Liu Guanghua, the investigation organization chief of the Chongqing Jiangpu County government, under the orders of County Magistrate Yao Jinghan, infiltrated the capital city to transport weapons to the north of the Yangtze River. Personnel were dispatched to arrest the suspect and apprehend accomplices Liu Jinbao and Wan Zukang.

Wan Ziliang, a Chongqing guerrilla member, under the command of Yang Taigui, the battalion commander of the 2nd detachment of the 10th column of the guerrilla force, infiltrated the capital city to purchase handguns. Personnel were dispatched to arrest the suspect and apprehend accomplices Tian Chou, Tang Zhusan, Zhang Dachun, Li Ruiren, Liu Yongnian, and five others.

Smugglers of military supplies Shi Jiasheng, Zhang Renju, and others were smuggling explosives across the river to aid the enemy in the outskirts of Qixia Mountain. Personnel were dispatched to arrest the two suspects on the evening of December 15th and confiscate one hundred sticks of explosives. They claimed that "the explosives were purchased from a person named Shi Jia, a ship boss, at ten yuan per stick and resold to the Red bandits for profit. Shi Jiaye was ill, so they were transporting them on his behalf." The suspects were transferred to the Capital City Local Court for trial. Furthermore, the department, with leniency, treated young offenders in all cracked cases who were weak-willed and had strayed from the right path, giving them an opportunity to repent, transferring them to reformatories, reforming them, and expecting them to serve the country after their rehabilitation.

### Major Battle Begins on the Road to Rome; German Troops Defend New Positions in the Apennines

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Reuters reports: A correspondent for the American Columbia Broadcasting System in Italy reported that the anti-Axis forces had launched a major offensive on the Italian front. Although they had superior manpower and resources, they were defeated at all points shortly after the start. The German army used flamethrowers to fight and launched a fierce counterattack starting at dawn today. The main force of the anti-Axis forces advanced towards the defense lines of Cassino and Albano, both of which were on the road to Rome, 75 miles from Rome.

According to a Friday report from the German News Agency in Berlin, since Thursday afternoon, fierce battles have been taking place in the lower and middle reaches of the Garigliano River on the southern Italian front. Although this battle is currently local in nature, there is no doubt that it is a prelude to a long-planned breakthrough attempt by the British and American armies. Preparations for this new offensive were completed about a week ago. Since Wednesday afternoon, General Clark's US Fifth Army has launched several reconnaissance battles against the German outposts in the Tyrrhenian coastal area, especially the coastal highway and the areas of Minturno, Castelforte, and Sant'Ambrogio, all of which were repelled. Furthermore, the enemy's attempt to advance in the western Apennines was also futile. The German army in the central Apennines has abandoned its positions held for four months and retreated to new positions on the Aventino River. Claims by the British and Americans of a successful advance in this area are inconsistent with the facts, as the enemy was unaware of the German retreat and no fighting took place there. The enemy has made no attempt to cross the Aventino River to date. In the Nettuno landing head area, the enemy's repeated attacks on the Tolentino-Ardea-Aprilia road were unsuccessful. In the southeastern part of the landing head, German stormtroopers penetrated the American fortifications southwest of the intersection of the Borgo Sabotino road and annihilated the enemy troops there.

Importance of the Battle

Reuters also reports that the British and American armies began their offensive with elite troops on the western section of the southern Italian front on Thursday night. Because the battle has been short and swift, Berlin military officials have yet to comment on its direction. Whether the summer offensive in southern Italy has begun with this attack will be clear within the next twenty-four hours. After the anti-Axis forces failed to attack in the Cassino area for several weeks, they attempted to open the road to Rome on a clear moonlit night by bombarding the German positions with artillery fire, followed by an infantry attack, but were unsuccessful. Looking at the overall situation of the Italian campaign, the following two points remain unchanged and will be more important in future battles: 1. The geographical situation has not changed. The British and American armies must attack uphill against the well-fortified mountainous positions of the German army, with only a few roads leading to the north. 2. The German army had anticipated the enemy's attack and understood the enemy's reconnaissance and reorganization. Therefore, the German army was not shocked by the enemy's attack. The situation on the southern Italian front is special. Most of the British Eighth Army has been transferred from the eastern wing to the western wing. For months, the British army has been blocked on the Sangro Valley front on the Adriatic coast, unable to break through, while the US Fifth Army has fought bloody battles in the Cassino area. As of the current situation, the Liri Valley area near Cassino (a vital point on the road to Rome) and the coastal road of Formia will be new battlegrounds.

### American Planes Attack Germany in Broad Daylight; 91 Aircraft Shot Down

Berlin, 13th (German News Agency dispatch) - According to German military authorities, American planes attacked central Germany and Brussels on the 12th, causing considerable damage to the civilian population. In the aerial combat, German planes and anti-aircraft guns shot down a total of 91 enemy aircraft. Last night, British planes attacked the northern coastal areas of Germany and Belgium, and 13 were shot down. The continuous bombing of the western occupied territories by British and American planes can be seen as preparations for the invasion of Europe. From May 1st to May 10th, a total of 182 enemy aircraft were shot down, of which 120 were four-engine bombers.

### Turkey Suspends Shipment of Chromium Ore; Germany Lodges Protest

### Anti-Axis Launches Psychological Warfare Against Small Countries; Attempts at Coercion and Inducement Fail

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since the appointment of Eisenhower as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, there have been various rumors about the opening of a second front. On the 12th of this month, they jointly issued a new psychological warfare-style advice to Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland, demanding that they immediately break away from the Axis powers. The declaration was simultaneously released by the US State Department, the British Foreign Office, and the Soviet Bureau, and its main points are as follows: 1. The people of all countries should immediately abandon the war and stop assisting and cooperating with the German army, so that the burden on the people of all countries can be reduced. 2. If the people of all countries cannot quickly break away from the German army and continue to cooperate with the German army, the result will be even more unfavorable to the people of all countries, and the future of the people of all countries will be even more unimaginable. Although the anti-Axis forces have exhausted their means of appeasement and suppression, launching a psychological offensive against the Axis powers, the Axis countries that are striving to uphold European civilization and build a new European order will never slacken their resolve. It is expected that the anti-Axis powers will continue to resort to similar base means in the future.

### Wartime Impressions of a Fortress in the Southern Theater

At a time when the enemy's all-out counterattack is becoming increasingly fierce, Sumatra is Japan's lifeline in the southern theater, both in terms of its location and in terms of the inexhaustible resources hidden within it. Recently, a reporter inspected a portion of the island's most important areas. The following is a record of what I saw and heard:

Driving into the Oil Field

On a certain day in a certain month, at 11:10 AM, we departed from a certain location and drove through a jungle lined with rubber trees, coconut trees, and chocolate trees, followed by a flat road. Before 1:00 PM, we arrived at a certain oil production area, the first stop on our journey. We visited the garrison office and listened to a conversation with a certain lieutenant.

It is said that the oil here is of very high quality. The crude oil that gushes out of the ground can be refined without much effort and supplied to aircraft. Moreover, the location of the oil field, the oil refinery, and the export port for transporting oil to Japan and other nearby occupied territories are all scattered and not concentrated in one place. From a defense standpoint, this is ideal. Several iron pipes are laid from the oil refinery to the port, and oil is continuously transported through these pipes. For example, if one of them is bombed and damaged by enemy aircraft, it is extremely easy to restore it to its original state, making it even more secure.

We left the area at 2:30 PM and headed to another location. The winding roads were all paved with asphalt, which made us feel even more that this place, being an oil-producing area, had always focused on automobiles for transportation.

Stretchers Made with Local Materials

On a certain day in a certain month, the local garrison, centered on the medical corps, gathered fourteen or fifteen non-commissioned officers through the mediation of Lieutenant Tomita before noon and held a symposium. All the attendees had been away from their home country for several years, having fought in battlefields from the mainland to Malaya. They talked freely about their heroic achievements, forgetting even the time for lunch, and did not disperse until nearly 4:00 PM.

Since being deployed on the front line of Sumatra's defense, this unit has been collecting local materials and, based on abundant experience and research, has produced thousands of stretchers, which have been distributed to various units to transport the wounded and sick to the rear in the event of an enemy counterattack. Several Australian prisoners of war, under the supervision of this unit, were transferred elsewhere after several months. A farewell performance was held for the prisoners, showing the warmth and unique characteristics of this medical unit, which also boosted the morale of other units.

Praiseworthy Volunteer Corps

On a certain day in a certain month, we departed from a certain location and arrived at another location three hours later. We visited the headquarters of the guard unit and, guided by Lieutenant Kato, met the unit commander. It is said that none of the local residents do not admire the power of the Japanese army. A lieutenant said: "I often tell my subordinates that you must cherish the natives. The Dutch only insulted them in the past and did not care for them, so the residents could never sincerely obey." These words truly contain appropriate meaning. The total length is about ten kilometers.

Great Effort in Building Fortifications

According to the unit commander, the construction of fortifications was a painstaking effort. For example, the iron barbed wire strung along the coast would be washed away by the tide at night during the work, or half buried in sand, or washed away by the waves, and we would have to start all over again the next day. Covering bunkers and various gun emplacements was also very difficult. Those decorated with grass leaves must first be inspected and checked from the sea, and also from the air. However, all the adverse conditions were overcome by the Japanese military spirit. Now, the impregnable iron wall is ready for the Japanese army to land on the beach and leave the enemy corpses on the coast.

Sincere Cooperation of the Natives

On a certain day in a certain month, our car sped along, kicking up a cloud of dust. To the right was a cliff several tens of feet high. Suddenly, looking down the coast, we saw vast waves roaring. To the left were overlapping mountains and an ancient dense forest. In front of the car, wild monkeys or six-foot-long lizards scuttled across the road and disappeared into the grass. Soon, we reached a flat area with simple houses dotting the landscape. Along the road the reporter traveled, there were natives everywhere, repairing damaged roads or bridges in groups of several people. When they saw the car, they shouted "Nippon" and saluted, imitating the military's salute. Smiles appeared on their faces, and their hearts were sincerely cooperating with Japan.

### Japanese Residents in Shanghai Hold Memorial Service for Marshal Koga; Solemn Ceremony Held in Hongkou Park

### Shanghai Post Office Announces Increased Postage Rates; Postal Authorities Discuss Postal Losses

Regarding the increased postage surcharge, the Ministry of Construction had previously submitted to the National Government for approval the new surcharge of 200% on the basic postage listed in the rate tables for each type of mail: First Class (delivery within the local jurisdiction of each post office), Second Class (domestic inter-office mail), Fourth Class (Japan, Korea, Kwantung Leased Territory, Taiwan, and Hong Kong), and Fifth Class (Macau and Guangzhou Bay), and their original surcharges. The Shanghai Postal Administration officially announced the implementation yesterday (13th).

Statement by Postal Authorities

Since the last increase in the postage surcharge, the post office originally expected the postal economy to improve. However, in the past six months, prices have soared again and again, and postal transport costs have increased sharply. The post office's losses have increased daily. If remedial measures are not taken urgently, there will be a risk of bankruptcy. The Ministry of Construction had to request the Executive Yuan to increase the current postage by two times from the 16th of this month. Considering the current prices and the cost of postal operations, it is indeed impossible to lower it further. This is to minimize the burden on the public as much as possible while making up for postal losses. In addition, the outside world often asks about the declining speed of postal delivery. The main reason is that the current transportation conditions are not as smooth as before, which affects the transportation of mail. However, the postal authorities will continue to urge their subordinates to make extra efforts to ensure speed and accuracy, in order to meet public expectations.

### Collection of Assistance Fees for Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff: Education Bureau Plans to Formulate Collection Guidelines

The salaries of teachers and staff in public and private primary and secondary schools in this city are meager and cannot sustain their livelihoods. On the 5th of this month, Mayor Chen and Director Ding hosted a tea party to discuss various assistance principles in 14 points with various sectors of society. It is now known that the Education Bureau, in order to promote the implementation of this measure from this month and to avoid abuses, has carefully formulated one type of "Guidelines for the Collection of Living Assistance Endowments for Teachers and Staff in Municipal Primary and Secondary Schools" and one type of "Guidelines for the Collection of Living Assistance Endowments for Teachers and Staff in Private Primary and Secondary Schools", which have been submitted to the government for record and have been communicated to all schools for compliance. The two guidelines are listed separately below:

Shanghai Special Municipality Guidelines for the Collection of Living Assistance Fees for Teachers and Staff in Private Primary and Secondary Schools

Private primary and secondary schools should follow the Shanghai Special Municipality's Donation Method for Living Assistance Fees for Teachers and Staff in Public and Private Primary and Secondary Schools to handle the collection of living assistance fees for teachers and staff in their respective schools. Private primary and secondary schools (hereinafter referred to as "schools") should, before collecting living assistance fees for teachers and staff (hereinafter referred to as "assistance fees") from students' parents, closely contact local people and students' parents in the vicinity to discuss and determine the monthly donation amount for each parent. Students' parents should fill out a "Living Assistance Fee Donation Confirmation" (format attached) and keep it on file at the school. Before May 25th, the school should report a list of parents' confirmed living assistance fees (format attached) to the bureau for record. The principle is that the assistance fees for the three months of May, June, and July of this year should be collected by each school in one go by the end of May. For the sake of facilitating the collection of fees by schools quickly and saving procedures, schools are temporarily allowed to print their own receipts according to the three-part receipt sample issued by the bureau, affix the school's seal, and submit it to the bureau for inspection and stamping before they are allowed to use them (if a school's living assistance fee receipt is found without being inspected and stamped by the Education Bureau, it will be subject to punishment). However, after the donation has been collected, each school should still submit the receipt stubs, together with a list, to the bureau for record. (Note) Receipt inspection and stamping procedures: 1. The serial numbers of the three-part receipts should be based on each school as a unit, and each school must use a certain character from the school's name as No. 1 to No. 0, which should be determined by each school itself. Each book is limited to 50 pages. 2. Each school should prepare a document together with the blank three-part receipts for the living assistance fee and send them directly to the Secretariat of the Bureau for inspection and stamping, and issue a temporary receipt. Pick it up the next day with the receipt the next day to pick up the stamped receipt. 3. When each school submits the receipts, the personnel in charge of sealing should count them and register them at any time. The person claiming the receipts should sign and stamp the receipt. Each school should deposit the living assistance fees collected each day in the name of the school's teachers' living assistance fee account, with the consent of the school's financial audit committee, into the Fuxing Bank or another bank, but it is not allowed to use it until the school affairs meeting has resolved the distribution plan. Of the assistance fees collected by each school, 90% of the total monthly amount should be used to subsidize the living expenses of teachers and staff on average, and 10% should be used to subsidize the school's office expenses. After each school deposits the collected assistance fees into the bank, it should immediately convene a school affairs meeting in accordance with the above standards to discuss and determine the distribution plan, and submit a report on the individual situation of the teachers and staff to be distributed to the bureau for record. If each school has any suggestions for changing the distribution standard of assistance fees due to special circumstances, it must submit a school income and expenditure report, attach sufficient reasons, and submit it to the bureau for approval and implementation after deliberation and resolution by the school affairs meeting or the school board. The collection and distribution of assistance fees by each school should be audited by the school's financial audit committee to verify the income and expenditure accounts (the bureau has issued a training order No. 4 of the Education Department to all public primary and secondary schools on January 10th of this year, requiring them to follow the regulations of the Ministry of Education for primary and secondary schools from this semester, and uniformly ask the principal to inform the full-time teachers to publicly elect three to five people to form a financial audit committee to take turns serving as chairman, responsible for auditing the school's income and expenditure accounts, and hold a meeting once a month), and the list of committee members should be reported to the bureau for record before the end of May of this year. If a school falsely reports the collection of assistance fees, or changes the distribution standard without permission, or underpays the living expenses of the staff, the donors or teachers and staff may file a complaint to the bureau, and if the bureau finds it to be true after investigation, it will be punished. The above four items of separate transfer amounts will be approved and implemented by the bureau at any time. After each school receives the living assistance fee from the bureau, it should distribute it to all employees within three days. The standard for the distribution of assistance fees to all employees should be based on the principle of equal distribution according to the number of employees, but each school worker should be calculated according to half the number of full-time teachers, and each school principal should be calculated according to two full-time teachers (including collection fee office expenses). Elementary school directors and senior grade teachers should be calculated according to 1.2 people. Elementary school Japanese teachers and other full-time teachers should be calculated according to one person. Part-time Japanese teachers shall not receive concurrent payments. Part-time middle school teachers should calculate the part-time allowance according to the ratio of their teaching hours to the teaching hours of full-time teachers (for example, if a full-time junior high school teacher should teach 18 hours per week, and a certain part-time teacher only teaches 6 hours per week, then it should be calculated as one-third of a person, but it should not be less than one-quarter of a person). Full-time teachers and Japanese-Japanese teachers or staff should be calculated according to one person. After each school has distributed the auxiliary allowance, it shall prepare a distribution report showing the distribution and report to the Bureau for record. The collection and distribution of assistance fees by each school shall be reported by the principal to the school affairs meeting. If there is any false reporting or unauthorized change in the distribution method, the donors or teachers and staff may file a complaint with the Bureau, and the Bureau shall investigate and verify the facts and punish them. The living assistance fees for teachers and staff recognized by social parties other than the neutral primary and secondary schools shall be handled by the Bureau by setting a deadline for consolidation.

Shanghai Special Municipality Guidelines for the Collection of Living Assistance Fees for Teachers and Staff in Municipal Primary and Secondary Schools

Municipal primary and secondary schools should follow the Shanghai Special Municipality's Donation Method for Living Assistance Fees for Teachers and Staff in Public and Private Primary and Secondary Schools to handle the collection of living assistance fees. Municipal primary and secondary schools (hereinafter referred to as "schools") should, before collecting living assistance fees for teachers and staff (hereinafter referred to as "assistance fees") from students' parents, closely contact local people and students' parents in the vicinity to discuss and determine the monthly donation amount for each parent. Students' parents should fill out a "Living Assistance Fee Donation Confirmation" and keep it on file at the school. Before May 25th, the school should first report a list of parents' confirmed living assistance fees to the bureau for verification. The principle is that the assistance fees for the three months of May, June, and July of this year should be collected by each school in one go by the end of May. After collecting the fees, the school should give one copy of the three-part receipt issued by the bureau to the parents who donated (or donors who are not students' parents), keep one copy at the school, and keep one copy of the stub (the stub should be submitted to the bureau together with a list after the funds are collected). Each school should deposit the assistance fees collected in the name of the school's teachers' living assistance fee account (Municipal School Teachers and Staff Living Assistance Fee) into the Fuxing Bank (the intersection of Henan Road and Sanma Road) or any of the following offices of the bank before the end of May of this year: 1. The South District Office of Fuxing Bank (the intersection of Taishan Road and Madang Road, formerly Avenue Joffre and Rue Massenet), 2. The North District Office of Fuxing Bank (inside the Zhabei Central Market), 3. The West District Office of Fuxing Bank (the intersection of Jing'an Temple and Yuwei Road). However, when withdrawing money, it should be paid with the seal designated by the Municipal Education Bureau. Each school should complete the collection and deposit of the assistance fee for this semester before the end of May of this year. If there are special circumstances and it is necessary to postpone part of the collection, in addition to depositing the received part once before the end of May, the remaining funds should be completed before June 15th. After each school remits the funds to the bank, it should send the bank's remittance report (format attached) by mail registered on the same day to the bureau for collection or send it by special delivery for preparation for verification and distribution. If each school can collect all the assistance fees and remit them to the bank before the end of May, the three months of assistance fees collected will be verified and issued to each school for collection in June; otherwise, they should be verified and issued to each school for collection in two installments in June and July. The total amount of assistance fees collected by each school, in addition to deducting the total amount of receipt printing fees, should be 90% of the assistance fees collected by each school to be used as the living expenses of the staff of the school, and 10% should be used as the following expenses: A, Transfer the living assistance fee for the staff of the school with the least income, B, Transfer the living assistance fee for the staff of the social education institutions that have not collected assistance fees, D, Transfer the bonus for schools with particularly excellent collection results.

Short Commentary

### Wartime Wastefulness is Shameful

We have repeatedly pointed out that during this wartime, we should absolutely practice thrift and economical living. Taking banquets as an example, their purpose may be to gather and discuss affairs, or to connect emotionally. In principle, they are still necessary and should not be overly criticized. However, the form of banquets must adapt to the meaning of wartime thrift. Because wartime wastefulness is most shameful. Therefore, we strongly advocate that all banquets should be mainly tea and snacks. A cup of clear tea and a plate of simple snacks can equally express intentions and achieve the purpose of gathering and connecting. Expensive coffee and abundant sandwiches are unnecessary waste.

Secondly, if there is a need for a meal, then it should be mainly simple food. A few dishes of home-style dishes can also equally express intentions and achieve the purpose of chatting. As for messy plates and a table full of grand dishes, it is also unnecessary. Drinking alcohol at noon is even more strictly prohibited.

Looking at the abolition of high-end Japanese bars in Hongkou, it is even more of a declaration to practice thrift. We hope that Chinese people, whether as hosts or guests, must be self-conscious and pay attention to thrift. At the same time, we feel that public officials (of course, referring to high-ranking officials) must be even more thrifty in banquets. As hosts, they should be thrifty, and as guests, they should also be thrifty, declining lavish banquets. They must also consider the preciousness of official time, because numerous banquets can take up time and delay work.

Finally, invitation cards should also be thrifty. Simply write down the time on a piece of white paper. Elaborate paper and beautiful printing are wasteful.

### Landlord Increases Rent: The Problem of Subtenants' Allocation

My residence is currently located on a certain street on Xinchang Road. Recently, the landlord has doubled the rent, and the secondary landlord has also ordered us three subtenants to pay double the rent accordingly. This kind of situation, where everything rises with the tide, seems quite reasonable at first glance. However, according to Shanghai's common practice, the rent for subtenants generally includes rent, property tax, utilities, miscellaneous fees, and the secondary landlord's legal profit. Since only the rent has been increased this time, it is reasonable to first deduct the various expenses from the subtenants' monthly rent, and then double the rent alone, or add the amount newly increased by the landlord, plus a legal profit, and then divide it equally between the secondary landlord and the subtenants, which would be fair. However, the secondary landlord insists on not calculating it this way, and if we argue with them, they threaten to refuse to accept the rent. In this way, the secondary landlord not only suffers no loss from the rent increase by the landlord, but can also increase their income, while those who suffer are entirely us subtenants. How can this be considered fair? (A Subtenant)

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

Takao's workplace was the advertising department of the Parisian Cosmetics store on Ginza Street. His job was to paint the patterns on cosmetic bottles and advertising illustrations according to the instructions of the department head, Deka. The work itself was quite bland, but his colleagues were all pretentious and arrogant types posing as artists. Takao now knew more about the temperament of the upper class and the airs of painters than he did when he was at the Ichiki's house. At the same time, the gallery in the Parisian Cosmetics retail department often held solo exhibitions of Western paintings, so he became acquainted with many painters. Tsuruhara Keiichi, who treated him to roast chicken, was one of them.

Although Takao learned about various new painting styles and techniques, his own work was not affected in any way. In his apartment in Koenji, he continued to work hard on Sundays and at night, but he remained an old-fashioned painter. He deserved the recognition of the Ichiki painter, but Takao himself could not feel satisfied.

That spring, his work was selected for the first time at the Spring Nikakai Exhibition. Fearing that people in his hometown would find out, he submitted his work anonymously. For some reason, his delicate work received considerable praise in the eyes of art critics at newspapers.

This gave him courage, and he decided to submit his work to the Autumn Bunten Exhibition. The Ichiki painter also greatly encouraged him. Assuming he was selected for the Bunten, he would use this opportunity to write a letter to his sister Eda, apologize to his parents, and then return to his long-abandoned hometown. At the same time, his conscription age was approaching. Even if he was selected and examined in Tokyo, he would still need the understanding of his parents. (Even though he is not yet an established painter, he has reached this point through self-study. Returning to his hometown would not be disgraceful. If he could be selected for the Bunten, perhaps his father would recognize him as an accomplished artist and forgive him.)

He felt that there was light ahead and was about to paint when his heart suddenly felt like it had been stabbed with a knife and began to ache dully.

The reason was a question raised by someone in the advertising department when he started painting.

"Is it okay for us to be painting pictures like this now?"

This became the center of conversation among his colleagues.

"Taking this opportunity, we must work harder and study the beauty of nature."

"Aren't painters also members of the nation? It is right for us to take up the paintbrush instead of a gun to fight on the front lines."

"Then, at this time, current affairs paintings participating in exhibitions would be the most appropriate works."

"No, it can't be said that that's all there is to it. However..."

The discussion continued without scope or limit.
