### Mr. Sun Yat-sen and Rice

— Yoshida Toho Report

"After the revolution succeeds, we will all have affordable rice," this common saying contains truth. Because after the revolution succeeds and the Principle of People's Livelihood is implemented, the people will be able to eat truly cheap rice. (Sun Yat-sen)

The recent soaring rice prices are truly a crime being instigated. Three or four weeks ago, everyone was shocked by the price of 2,500 yuan per dan (unit of weight) of rice, but today, they no longer find it strange that the price has doubled again. If this continues, even reaching 10,000 yuan per dan of rice will not be the ultimate limit. The price of rice is the foundation of all commodity prices. Following the price of rice, an era where toilet paper is used as currency (the barter era) will arrive. This kind of soaring price will definitely cause society to form a "criminal calculus." That is to say, one cannot maintain a life with just legitimate income, and one cannot survive without doing evil. Suppose there is a junior company employee with a monthly salary of 1,000 yuan, who eats only large pancakes and fried dough sticks every day. Even the thinnest pancakes, which can be blown away by the wind, cost five or six yuan each. Then, even if he eats five pancakes per meal, it will still cost 75 to 90 yuan a day, which amounts to 2,250 to 2,700 yuan a month. But this is only for single people. If that junior employee has a wife and children, then relying solely on normal income, the whole family can only sit and wait for death. If he and his family have not starved to death, then he must have some "hanky-panky." But this "hanky-panky" is determined by his economic status. He does not have the economic power of wealthy people to subscribe to shares of industrial companies or hoard goods, so he uses his profession to commit the easiest "crimes." The oil skimming of tram conductors and the bribery of electricity company inspectors are mainly due to this kind of economic difficulty.

This kind of economic difficulty is by no means limited to junior employees. Even middle-level and senior employees, no matter how much normal income they have, cannot keep up with the recent soaring rice prices. For example, the highest-ranking cadres of the police bureau have an income of nearly 10,000 yuan, but at the current price of rice, it is only equivalent to more than two dan of rice. As for middle-level cadres, they work hard for a month and can only get one dan or half a dan of rice. How can they maintain the minimum standard of living for a police officer? From this point of view, the phenomenon of not being able to eat on legitimate income is becoming increasingly widespread. In order to maintain life, those in higher positions rely on large illegal income, and those in lower positions rely on small illegal income. In such a society, "integrity" only leads to starvation. If such economic conditions are not changed, but only asking others to be "honest," it is unreasonable. This is not a generalization, but specifically refers to lower-level employees who cannot guarantee the minimum cost of living. Mr. Chen Youren once said: "Life without food is death." In order to survive, anything can be done. There are probably not many saints who would rather be "honest" and wait for death without guaranteeing the minimum standard of living! Therefore, to hope that lower-level employees are "honest," it is necessary to guarantee at least the minimum cost of living. Words like "When clothing and food are sufficient, then one knows etiquette" and "With constant property, one has a constant heart" simply and clearly illustrate this point.

Then, what is the minimum cost of living in China? Let's look at the proportion of food to clothing and housing in the cost of living for workers in various countries: In the United States, food costs account for 38.2% of the entire cost of living, in Germany, it accounts for 44.3%, in China, it accounts for 57.5%, and in India, it accounts for 59.2%. In short, the larger the proportion of food costs in the cost of living, the more it means "able to take care of eating." Therefore, scholars call this ratio the poverty rate. According to the figures listed above, more than half of the cost of living for Chinese workers is spent on food. This is a pre-war statistic, but according to the recent soaring rice prices, China's poverty rate is probably close to 100%. It wouldn't be a big mistake to rewrite the word "food" in Shanghai as "rice." Specifically, as long as Shanghai guarantees that there is rice to eat, it is actually guaranteeing the minimum cost of living for everyone. Therefore, in the final analysis, the question is how to guarantee that there is rice to eat. Some people say that guaranteeing rice for Shanghai is impossible, but I dare to say categorically that it is not impossible. Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said the following about this issue:

"...The biggest reason for the high price of rice in Guangzhou at present is due to merchants' monopolies and officials dwelling between the people and the government, enriching their own pockets, that is, the harm of accepting commissions. If you want to remove this harm, then workers and farmers must cooperate. In order to make workers and farmers understand how to cooperate, it is necessary to publicize this principle. Now most of the workers in our country have considerable knowledge, so it is easy to publicize. The difficulty lies in publicizing to farmers. According to the original price produced by farmers, one yuan can directly buy 20 catties of rice. Buying from merchants indirectly, one yuan can only buy 10 catties. The middlemen merchants earn half of the profit. Therefore, in order to achieve fair rice prices, there is only one way: workers and farmers organize a cooperative. Then the tools manufactured by workers and the rice produced by farmers can be directly exchanged. In this way, merchants will not be able to profit from it, and the price of rice will be suppressed to the maximum extent." (Excerpt from a speech given by Mr. Zhongshan to members of the Chinese Kuomintang on December 30, 1923)

The method advocated by Mr. Zhongshan cannot be said to be unsuitable for present-day Shanghai. Suppose that individual trade associations such as match factories and textile factories each organize cooperatives, and then establish contact with farmer cooperatives, and carry out mutual exchange of products within the common livelihood organs. Then farmers can obtain cheap industrial products, and factory workers can buy cheap rice. Naturally, it is impossible to carry out universally at first, and it is okay to start partially. Recently, due to the pressure of objective circumstances, major institutions in Shanghai have been organizing consumer cooperatives like bamboo shoots after the rain. For example, the police bureau also wants to organize a "police officers' cooperative," and the *Shen Bao* newspaper has the *Shen Bao* consumer cooperative, etc. Of course, this is not the exchange of products, but the purpose is to eliminate middle squeezers and guarantee the minimum standard of living. If these types of organizations develop among production enterprises, and then the government unifies them nationwide, the rice price problem will naturally be easily solved, and at the same time, the source of crimes that are now considered inevitable will be invisibly reduced. There may be many people who think that such a big plan is "easier said than done." For these people, I will quote the following words of Mr. Sun Yat-sen again as the conclusion of this article.

"If the price of rice is fair, the interests of workers and farmers will increase. To achieve this goal, there must be a group. To make a group, they must be made to join the party. After joining the party, consultants should be hired to train them. How we implement this method, what kind of country is created after implementation, etc., are not difficult matters. The difficulty lies in 'not knowing,' not 'impossible to do.' It is because of not knowing 'how to implement it.' Mencius said: 'To carry Mount Tai to leap over the North Sea is not that it cannot be done, but that it is not possible. To break a branch for an elder is not that it is impossible to do, but that it is not done.' If we thoroughly understand, then we won't not be able to do it. The so-called not being able to do it is not like carrying Mount Tai to leap over the North Sea, which is impossible, but like breaking a branch for an elder, which is not done." (Lu translation)

### The Japanese Headquarters Announced Yesterday the Battle Results on the Buthidaung Front: The Japanese Army's Defense Line Will Be Further Strengthened in the Future

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 4th that in the operation of annihilating the British Indian 7th Division on the Buthidaung front, the war results obtained so far are as follows: Approximately 7,000 enemy corpses were abandoned (including approximately 3,000 British), approximately 600 prisoners were captured, and the following weapons were seized or destroyed: more than ten cannons and fifteen howitzers, twenty artillery pieces, six anti-aircraft guns, thirty-four mortars, thirty rapid-firing guns, 1,950 rifles, forty-five tanks, 660 vehicles, seventeen boats, and sixty-two aircraft were shot down. There were also many other weapons, ammunition, and clothing.

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The British Indian 7th Division moved out to the Buthidaung area on February 4th. Before three weeks had passed, it was surrounded by the Japanese army in the Maungdaw Mountain Range and the Kyauktaw Basin and was routed. The second tragedy of Arakan was staged again, and the glorious war results obtained by the Japanese army were announced by the Japanese Headquarters on the afternoon of the 4th. The success of this operation by the Japanese army can be seen from the specific figures announced. The enemy's losses in this battle, as far as have been ascertained, are approximately 7,000 corpses, of which there are many British, even 3,000. If the 600 prisoners are included, then the enemy's troop losses should reach about 8,000. The enemy's casualties are indeed heavy, so the enemy's 7th Division, which had about 10,000 troops before the war, can be said to have been completely annihilated after this battle. Furthermore, judging from the enemy's weapons seized or destroyed by the Japanese army, the enemy's entire equipment has been destroyed. The success of the Kyauktaw annihilation battle can be imagined. However, the Japanese army is not satisfied with this and is still continuing to mop up the remaining enemies in order to completely destroy the British Indian 7th Division. Therefore, the war results of the Japanese army will be even greater in the future. Also, the war results of this battle include those obtained by the Azad Hind Fauj, which cooperated with the Japanese army.

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from New Delhi, the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Command announced the battle situation on the Arakan Line on the 3rd, stating: The Western Akyab garrison is currently fighting on the Kaladan River and is suffering strong pressure from the Japanese army northwest of Awaauk.

The British Main Force Annihilated in the Kyauktaw Basin

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a certain base of the Japanese army in Burma, the British 7th Division previously echoed the British 5th Division's attack on the Maungdaw area, launched an advance operation on the entire Buthidaung line, and clamored to recapture Nitzan. The Japanese army launched a breakthrough operation against the enemy at 2:00 PM on the 4th of this month. In just 20 days, the main force of the enemy in the Kyauktaw Basin was reduced, and the Japanese army's reduction operation was largely concluded. The mopping up of the remaining enemies is still continuing, and the British army is staging the second act of the Arakan tragedy here. After the British army was defeated in Arakan last spring, it still attempted to counterattack from the western front of the Indian-Burmese border in order to attack and advance its air bases. The Japanese army then carried out a blitzkrieg operation to encircle the enemy and cut off the British army's retreat at three locations west of Tongubazar, Ngakyedauk, and the Kyauktaw Basin, completing the encirclement and annihilating the enemy's main force. Although the enemy was extremely cautious beforehand, it also had a sense of arrogance about this blitzkrieg operation. A large unit of the enemy's brigade was chased and attacked by only a small unit of twenty or thirty Japanese soldiers, and they were in a state of extreme embarrassment. This was the first time this had been seen in this operation. Lord Mountbatten personally went to the front line to direct the operation in December and encouraged the front-line troops. He actually regarded the Japanese army's strategic retreat in Maungdaw as their recapture of the area and even proclaimed to the world that the British Indian side had opened up a resource area and opened up a blood transfusion route to the besieged side to cut off the connection between the Japanese mainland and the supply route in the south. All of the above ambitions have now completely failed. This kind of stupid move is tantamount to digging one's own grave, and the Chongqing side is also gradually recognizing the crisis of the anti-axis air force on the Indian-Burmese battle line and is extremely dissatisfied with the incompetence of the British Indian army. They frankly admit that the Japanese army still holds the main force of the war situation. They also point to the fact that Japan's combat power is strong. Even though the Japanese army is currently inviting and attacking the enemy's American army's general counterattack in the central and southern Pacific, it can still smash the British army's more than ten-month counterattack preparation in one fell swoop, which is enough to prove that the Japanese army still has a huge combat power. Therefore, the enemy side may also know that a frontal attack on the Nu River and Myanmar from land will have no effect in the end. Even if the British Indian army launches a third counterattack, there are only three months left before the rainy season, and preparations for battle cannot be completed during this dry period. Furthermore, the Japanese army's defense line will only become stronger and stronger in the future. This operation only lasted 20 days (the previous operation lasted two months). Subhas Chandra Bose also led the Indian National Army, holding high the banner of "Overthrow Britain and Liberate the Motherland," and cooperated with the Japanese army in the operation. The three-color flag of Independent India is flying in the sky above Arakan, and the situation of attacking Chittagong has been completed. This has given a great response to the Indian soldiers who have been suffering under British repression for many years and have been thinking of severely attacking the British. Recently, Indian soldiers in the British Indian army have been surrendering one after another, so the future trend of the war is quite worthy of attention.

### Conflict Between British and American Generals Over Delayed Offensive in Burma

Geneva, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to information obtained by the Belgians: A serious conflict has occurred between General Lord Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander of the Anti-Axis Southeast Asia, and General Stilwell, the Supreme Commander of the American Army in India. Mountbatten dispatched his Chief of Staff, General Weitanja, to act as a mediator. General Stilwell criticized Mount for not launching a major offensive to retake Burma. General Tanyia stated in Washington that Mount was unable to act cautiously due to a lack of ships, thus hindering his preparations. The American War Department also agreed with this explanation. Mountbatten's main objective is to retake Burma and Malaya, while Stilwell's objective is to retake Burma as the starting point for launching an offensive in East Asia, because if Burma can be obtained, supplies can be transported to Burma, making a major offensive against Japan possible.

Xuzhou, 4th (Central News Agency) - All the officials and people of the Xuzhou alliance, based on the spirit of fostering and supporting, gave their full support to our country's policy of promoting the unification of the Huaihai currency.

They were very satisfied because there were no violations. It is also learned that the Chamber of Commerce sent a respectful telegram to Chairman Wang to show its cooperation with the government's economic policy. The original telegram is as follows: To Chairman Wang of the National Government: The authorities of the Republic of China are actively promoting the realization of economic policy, especially currency adjustment, in the Huaihai area, and the Japanese authorities are also doing their utmost to provide assistance.

### Fierce Defensive Battles on the Eastern Front: Soviet Offensives Repulsed in the North and Center

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities explained the situation on the Eastern Front on the 3rd, and also pointed out the reality that the Soviet army was frustrated in its attempt to cut off the German front lines in the north and center, as follows: Although the large-scale offensive by the Soviet army against the German positions on the northern front, such as Narva and Pskov, has not ended, a second winter offensive has now been launched on the central front. The German army's withdrawal and shortening of the front line in the Lake Ilmen area has been completed, and the Soviet army's attempts to break through into the Baltic states in that area have been frustrated. On the northern front, the Soviet army has achieved some success by attacking with a very large number of troops, and the Soviet troops that have advanced to the west bank of the Narva River have been stopped by the German army's strong defenses. In recent days, the Soviet army has launched a large-scale attack. The Soviet offensive on the central front is closely linked to the offensive in the north. The Soviet army, with large units of tanks and infantry, has launched a fierce attack on the north of Nevel. The Soviet operational goal is to put pressure on the right flank of the German army on the northern front, and at the same time break into Latvia and reach the Baltic coast to encircle the German army on the northern front. The Soviet offensives launched in recent days in the Vitebsk and Bobruisk areas are aimed at encircling the German army on the central front. However, the Soviet army's breakthrough offensives in the Nevel and Rogachev areas have been brought to a standstill due to the German army's tenacious counterattacks.

### British Newspaper Harshly Criticizes Turkish Policy

Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuter's report from London: British newspapers have been criticizing Turkey, and the "Yorkshire Post" openly threatens Turkish foreign policy, saying that "if Turkish policy is not coordinated with British and Soviet policy, it will lack one of the conditions for lasting success." The newspaper is the mouthpiece of British Foreign Secretary Eden, and the publication of these unusually strong remarks is obviously the intention of the government. The newspaper declared that Britain's cessation of supplying Turkey with war materiel shows that the Turkish government does not want to make its greatest contribution to the anti-Axis powers in the "short period" before the opening of a second front.

America Will Follow Britain's Lead and Stop Supplying War Materiel

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuter's report, well-informed sources in Washington say that Britain has never announced the quantity of war materiel it previously supplied to Turkey.

### Bulgarian Ambassadors to Foreign Countries Return Home to Report

Sofia, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuter's report: The Bulgarian ambassadors to Slovakia and Portugal have returned here to report to the government. The former was received by the Regency Council, and other ambassadors will also return home.

### Sweden Denies German Request for Passage

Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Swedish government has categorically denied the British report that the German government requested the Swedish government to allow General Dietl's German troops to pass through Swedish territory.

### Stimson Advocates Extension of Lend-Lease Act

Amsterdam, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Washington: U.S. Secretary of War Stimson told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Friday that if the Lend-Lease Act, which expires on June 30, is not extended for another year, the result will be to prolong the war and increase America's financial and human losses.

### Situation on the Italian Front Presents a Muddled Picture: German Army Secures Initiative

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - A Reuters correspondent on the Italian front reported: "The Third Kesselring Offensive," which began on February 29, ended on the 2nd of this month after 36 hours of fierce fighting. German military authorities have announced that the German army has secured the initiative in the operation. On the 2nd, due to the activities of assault troops, new positions have been occupied. A Reuters reporter also silently acknowledged this fact and stated that the main force of the anti-Axis army in the Cisterna-Aprilia area, which the German army began attacking on the 29th, was the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division.

40,000 Bombs Dropped on the Nettuno Area

On the 2nd, the anti-Axis army mobilized an unprecedentedly large air force on the Mediterranean front and dropped 40,000 twenty-pound shrapnel bombs on the Nettuno area. From this, one can see how anxious the anti-Axis authorities are to open up the deadlocked battle situation.

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - A German news agency reported: On the Nettuno beachhead, active local battles continued on the 2nd, and the initiative there is still in the hands of the German army. No major changes have occurred there, but a large number of German stormtroopers launched a fierce attack on the Anglo-American defenses on both sides of the Aprilia-Anzio highway, and finally advanced the German line. West of Cisterna, an attempted attack by U.S. paratroopers failed despite being covered by heavy artillery fire. Further east in the same area, a strong unit of U.S. stormtroopers was wiped out. Only one thing is worth mentioning on the southern Italian front: in the Atri area, a unit of German stormtroopers penetrated deep into the British lines, destroyed a British ammunition depot, captured many British prisoners of war, and returned to their own positions.

### Pope Protests Indiscriminate Bombing of Rome

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Rome: After the anti-Axis air force recently carried out an illegal bombing of Monte Cassino, Cardinal Maglione, the Vatican Secretary of State, personally delivered the Pope's letter of protest against this indiscriminate bombing to the anti-Axis diplomatic representatives stationed in the Vatican.

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Rome: On the 3rd, the anti-Axis air force again indiscriminately bombed the Vatican, damaging the windows of St. Paul's Outside the Walls and killing 40 refugees and wounding 200.

### Large Numbers of Wounded Soldiers Arrive in Gibraltar

Madrid, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Algiers: A British and American hospital ship, carrying a large number of wounded soldiers, arrived in Gibraltar on Friday from Nettuno.

### U.S. Plans to Lay Oil Pipeline in Mexico

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to the "Daily Mail," the U.S. Petroleum Department suggests that in order to prevent the oil needed by the Pacific theater from being cut off during the blockade, an oil pipeline should be laid in Mexico. The Mexican government has not yet given its permission. The Petroleum Department's move has not been supported by private oil companies, which believe that it interferes with private interests. However, they also fear that Interior Secretary Ickes will implement it decisively, as he has said that both the Army and Navy departments support the plan. Private companies argue that if the plan is implemented, the United States will have disputes with the foreign countries through which the oil pipeline passes.

### British Casualties Now Reach 170,000

Amsterdam, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from London: British Home Secretary Morrison revealed in a speech in London yesterday that in the first three years of the war, the British army suffered a total of 138,844 casualties, including 73,477 deaths, 15,204 missing and captured, and 50,163 wounded. In the Italian campaign, the British army suffered a total of 7,635 deaths, 5,708 missing, and 23,233 wounded.

### Palestine Under Strict Security

Ankara, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Jerusalem: Since the end of February, the British military authorities in Palestine have implemented a number of military security measures. At present, Jerusalem, Haifa, Jaffa, Tel Aviv, and other cities are under military control, and mechanized units with machine guns patrol the streets every hour.

### U.S. Intelligence Chief in Turkey, Littman, Arrested

Rome, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuter's report from Rome today: The news of the arrest in New York of Littman, the Jewish U.S. intelligence chief in Istanbul, has aroused great interest among the Romans. During the reign of former Romanian King Carol, Littman rented a gambling den in Sinaia and defrauded the government of large sums of money. Shortly before the outbreak of the European war, Littman went to Turkey to take up his current post, where he revealed several secret documents, which were later found to be forged. Local newspapers believe that although Littman has been arrested, he will not be seriously affected, as U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Steinhardt is also Jewish and will certainly make efforts to save him.

### Reviewing the Must-Win Life

The news of the enemy army landing in the Marshall Islands has come, and the war is gradually approaching Japanese territory. But at this time, we should not panic, nor is there any need to shout slogans. So, what should we do? Where is victory? If we calmly reflect on our lives, we can discover that the path to victory is right beside us, and everyone can know it, as long as we firmly grasp this opportunity and resolutely implement it.

The Revolution of Life

Everyone hopes to eat refined white rice and fill their bellies, and everyone hopes to travel and be idle, which may be human nature. And hearing the children wanting to eat snacks, and being dissatisfied with the rationing system when there are no snacks, may be understandable. But taking this opportunity of the enemy army attacking the Marshall Islands, let us think about it again. If the enemy's ambition extends to our homeland, what will happen then? At that time, what fate will befall you who eat white rice and feel full, or you who have taken a happy trip home, or the children who eat the snacks they struggled to buy in the crowded market? The enemy openly shouts the audacious slogan of "eradicating the Japanese race." Let us calmly reflect on this insolent statement by the enemy. Shouldn't we restrain all desires and endure pain? Every citizen should calmly think about that last penny. Taking this opportunity of the enemy army attacking the Marshall Islands, we should sincerely abandon our corrupt past life of yesterday. That is for the sake of the country, for the sake of yourself.

This is a Victorious Life

Then, in order to achieve victory, what kind of life should we live? This is not a difficult thing. No, you have already experienced most of it. On February 5, Mr. Kawano Mitsuru said the following on the Diet floor in his words of appreciation and encouragement to those who were conscripted: "In a certain coal mine, the wife of a conscripted person saw that her husband was hungry, so she reduced her three meals to two meals, and ate thin rice porridge every day, in order for her husband to complete the task of coal mining." This passage moved everyone in the room to tears. The life of this wife is also one of the paths to victory. In other words, do your best in your own life, and live and work with an "attitude and spirit of martyrdom." In any case, hold the magnificent spirit of not being defeated by foreign devils. I know that people in rural villages, factories, and tribal gatherings all have this kind of spirit, but are there any places that are not thorough? Think about it yourself, start a new life by fighting with the "enemy within your heart," and build a victorious life that has no gaps in any place within 24 hours. There is no other beneficial way.

Areas for Reform

To give an example, the factory workers who directly produce aircraft in military factories are truly honorable. But what if they don't go to the factory because they have a minor illness, or live a life of leisure because they have a high income? That would be an "American comrade." Furthermore, what if a guidance official who shouts to the people during the day to "reform their lives and promote production" lives a lavish life? We must always remember our current lives and work for the country. At the same time, do we have even a bit of the "enemy's comrade"? We don't need to talk about other people's lives. We should reflect on ourselves and reform.

If every one of the 100 million citizens reflects on themselves in this way, it will be the path to victory. There is no need to criticize others, teach others, or have any discontent or dissatisfaction. The points that should be reflected upon, we have already heard until our ears are calloused: "Conserve war clothes," "Don't take useless trips," "Buy government bonds," "Strive for savings"... Everyone knows these things well enough. If we think of the worst-case scenario, we should earnestly carry out what everyone can do from tomorrow. Moving forward is victory.

Some may think: "Okay, let's do it. But is the current rationing adequate?" "Can production be increased at that price?" "The sailors in the Northern Kuriles are fighting the war against the severe cold, wearing newspapers and rags on their feet, and silently engaging in battle. Can this not be improved?" At the must-win Diet session on January 21, representatives presented all these questions to the government. People who heard the Q&A in detail that day felt: "The authorities also frankly accepted the voices of the people and revealed what they believed." Thus, the representatives of the 100 million citizens and the government have reached a resolution.

Victory is Imminent

The enemy army has attacked the Marshall Islands: We must revolutionize our lives. This is a very important opportunity. There is no need to worry for no reason, nor to be pessimistic. It is boastful to say that the number of aircraft is large. Last December, only 9,000 aircraft were produced. Moreover, these fighter planes must be deployed in Europe and elsewhere. With the efforts of 100 million citizens, mass production can be achieved soon.

Save gas and electricity, and contribute to production. Recycle metals and contribute resources. Respond to the call to increase the production of resources and coal, do not take wasteful trips or hoard goods to increase transportation capacity. Those who have not completed labor management, regardless of gender, should all contribute labor to the country. Then, the enemy's mass production is also not to be feared. Only determination and effort are needed. Before people ask me, we should contribute first. If we can endure one or two years of hardship and have the spirit to persevere, then victory is imminent. Japan has a world-unique national polity, and the frontline fathers have the world's best army and navy. From now on, the 100 million citizens in the rear should thoroughly implement a "war life!" (Translated by Hong from the Asahi Shimbun, February 7)

### Social Welfare Bureau to Handle Rent Disputes: Proposes Four Measures for Dispute Resolution

Regarding the handling of rent disputes in the city, the former Social Welfare Bureau had drafted seventeen articles of the "Provisional Regulations for Handling Rent Disputes in the Shanghai Special Municipality," which were submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. However, now that Districts One and Eight have merged, the Social Welfare Offices of the two District Governments have been abolished, and their original functions have been taken over by the Social Welfare Bureau. However, since the city is a mixed residence of Chinese and foreigners, rent disputes often occur in which both parties or one party is a foreigner. Therefore, the Bureau has drafted four measures for adjusting the handling of rent disputes, which have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and notification to the First District Government for compliance in order to unify the handling. The adjustment measures are as follows: 1. The mediation of rent disputes handled by the former Social Welfare Office of the First District Government should be stopped immediately and handled by the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau in order to centralize authority. 2. Rent disputes involving foreigners may be handled by the First District Government at the discretion of the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau. When mediation fails and the case is submitted to the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau for arbitration, the First District Government should be requested to send representatives to attend the arbitration. 3. The rules for handling rent disputes involving foreigners will be drafted by the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. 4. Before the implementation of housing sublease licenses in the city, the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau may temporarily entrust the First District Government to handle them. Therefore, in the future, all rent disputes in the city, whether both parties or one party is a foreigner or both parties are Chinese, will be handled uniformly by the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau.

Furthermore, since being ordered to handle rent disputes in the city, the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau has only mediated all disputes as much as possible. If mediation fails, the cases are submitted to the Municipal Rent Dispute Arbitration Committee for arbitration in accordance with the law. In January and February of this year, the Bureau accepted a total of sixty-seven rent dispute cases, of which thirty-two cases were resolved through guidance for self-settlement or mediation (including seven cases in which one party was a foreigner). The Municipal Rent Dispute Arbitration Committee accepted a total of thirty-five rent dispute cases, of which six cases were settled on the spot and eight cases were adjudicated, all in accordance with the law and impartially.

### Epidemic Meningitis Has Spread to the Southern District: Health Office Engaged in Suppression

According to the Central News Agency, several cases of the dreaded epidemic meningitis have occurred in the Southern District, and the situation is extremely rampant. The Southern District Health Office is now actively engaged in suppression. The Southern District Isolation Hospital has begun to admit patients with meningitis.

Cases of Meningitis Have Been Discovered

Several cases of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, commonly known as meningitis, have been discovered in the Southern District. Investigations have revealed that Yu Xinglong, a nine-year-old child living at No. 5 Yongshou Lane, Fangbang Road, and Yu Didi, a three-month-old boy, Meng Fu, an eighteen-year-old youth living at No. 789 Minguo Road, and a certain family living at No. 657 Fangbang Road have all contracted the disease. The patients have been sent to the Isolation Hospital for treatment, and their residences have been disinfected by personnel from the Southern District Health Office to prevent the spread of the disease.

Symptoms, Current Situation, and Prevention Methods

Epidemic meningitis is extremely contagious. With slight carelessness, one can be infected. Patients are mostly children. The initial symptoms of the disease are headache, fever, palpitations, stiff neck, and frequent nausea. If the pupils do not react, it is clear that the disease has been contracted and should be sent to the hospital for treatment immediately. The disease is most easily contracted in public places, including theaters and streetcars. For prevention, both adults and children should pay attention to the cleanliness of their sensory organs. They must wear masks when going out, with a little peppermint oil dripped inside the mask, so that the patient's saliva will not infect others. If one is unfortunately infected, in addition to sending the patient for immediate treatment, the room in which the patient lives must be disinfected to prevent a second infection.

### District Household Rice: Payments Must Be Made on Time

The City Food Bureau, in order to implement per capita grain distribution every period, found that a small number of public offices failed to remit payments quickly, which was sufficient to affect the scheduled sale of household rice. Therefore, at 3:00 PM yesterday, the Bureau convened a meeting of responsible personnel from the joint offices of the various district governments in its conference room, stipulating that rice payments should be remitted on time in the future without further delay. Representatives from the various public offices unanimously agreed with this move by the Food Bureau. Therefore, the handling of per capita grain distribution in the various districts can be gradually improved in the future.

Recently, prices have skyrocketed, and the lives of civil servants have become extremely difficult. The municipal government has now issued a method for increasing pay to adjust the livelihood of each employee, and at the same time, it has issued an order to all affiliated agencies to reduce redundant personnel, setting the standards for layoffs, with the principle that work efficiency will not be affected. The salaries of the laid-off redundant personnel will be added to those who work diligently. It has been found that the standards for these layoffs are: 1) those who do not come to the office every day, or are often late or leave early; 2) those whose positions are light and have no actual work; 3) those who frequently ask for leave and have demerits; 4) those who have weak abilities and are incompetent. Each agency should formulate a plan in accordance with the above standards and submit it to the municipal government for approval and implementation.

Yesterday's telegram special question 7:25

### Implementing Light Control Sun Life Talk Deeply Hope to Carry Out the Full Work

Mr. Sun Life, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Shanghai Special City Civil Defense Headquarters, made the following statement on the implementation of light control this time:

Has profound meaning

Yesterday was March 3rd, and Shanghai has entered the sub-war stage. According to the notice No. 21 issued by the Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Command on the 1st of this month, from the 3rd of this month, every day from sunset to sunrise the next morning, light control will be implemented throughout the territory under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government.

It has been found that light control has been held several times in Shanghai in the past, and it is well known to the citizens. Especially after January 9th this year, the anniversary of China's participation in the war, was designated as "Air Defense Day," light control matters became an important part of air defense training, and it was implemented in quality. However, the light control implemented this time is suitable for wartime light control and has a semi-permanent nature, which is fundamentally different from what has been held in the past. This section should be deeply understood by the citizens.

Past training light control was only held on a designated day and time, and the time was very short. Even the extremely simple method of turning off the lights was used to deal with it in order to fulfill the responsibility. The light control that is rewarded this time is not the case. It has a deeper meaning and should be controlled every day, not just held for a short time. In other words, it should be regarded as an important part of citizens' daily life with a semi-permanent nature and implemented until the Great East Asia War of the two countries of China and Japan achieves the final victory.

Strive to defend the sky

Since China and Japan have been working together and standing at the critical moment of life and death to declare war with Britain and the United States, it has been more than one year and two months. Since the beginning of the war, Shanghai has been within the scope of the war and has been clearly seen to be in danger of being bombed by enemy aircraft at any time. However, the citizens of Shanghai are almost the same as usual and have continued their normal lives, thinking that light control matters, like those held during training, can be done at most once a month, which is really unthinkable and cannot be used as a lesson. It is now felt that it is already too late to implement wartime light control.

In any case, the current combat area is not very far from Shanghai, and Shanghai is also a battlefield. Moreover, the sudden national air force is aiming to carry out the largest air raid to disrupt peaceful areas, staring at it and waiting for an opportunity to move. It is very obvious that Shanghai will become one of the most important wax battlefields, and it is not necessary to repeat it.

The war in Europe and the war in Greater East Asia are all wars for nations to fight for survival, and the Great East Asia War jointly fought by China and Japan has its special purpose, that is, to fundamentally eliminate the policy of aggression against East Asia by Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands for a hundred years, so that the liberated nations of Greater East Asia can unite and build Greater East Asia as an ideal, and seek the independence of all East Asian nations.

In order to seek the independence of all East Asian nations, and to fight for the highest ideal of building a liberated Greater East Asia, our country has risen up again to work with Japan. Under the leadership of Chairman Wang, we are marching on the road to completing the war. Therefore, even if Shanghai becomes a major battlefield today, because the citizens of China really have a firm secondary heart, it is not affected in the slightest. We citizens can only use an attitude of non-busyness and non-disturbance to move forward on the road to defending the sky over Greater Shanghai under the wise guidance of the Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Command and the Shanghai Special City Civil Defense Headquarters for things that are expected to come and have already arrived.

Hope citizens cooperate

Since the defeat of the United States at Pearl Harbor, it has been defeated repeatedly. Only now has it gradually recovered from its initial tragic defeat. It is only relying on its world-shattering material resources and madly calling out the slogan of the general counterattack in the Pacific. With the central and southwestern Pacific as the main battlefields, it is re-enacting the great job of corpse mountains and blood seas. The elite land and naval forces of our ally Japan are not afraid of the strong and are dealing with the enemy. The Japanese people are holding on to the determination to "fight to the end." Although the current situation is uncertain, our East Asian nations have no doubt about the final victory. However, while the United States is frantically calling for a counterattack in the Pacific, it is also working to strengthen its air force in China and is always attacking important cities in Japan and peaceful areas.

The light control this time is implemented in view of the reckless state of the US Air Force in China, in order to protect Greater Shanghai, which is at risk of being attacked by air at any time, and to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the five million citizens. This is a necessary move. Our citizens participate in this move, which is to protect their own lives and property. In Greater Shanghai, even a little carelessness and the leakage of a ray of light will become a good target for air raid bombers and plunge the city into flames. I hope that all citizens can fully understand the position of Shanghai under the Great East Asia War and the importance of light control in air defense, and sincerely cooperate with this control in order to achieve good results.

The Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Command, in view of strategic relations, especially adheres to the proposition and earnestly implements light control. In order to cooperate in completing the defense of Shanghai, the Air Defense Headquarters will severely punish those who violate it. We hope that all citizens can understand and cooperate.

Maintain night work

The following are some points that citizens should pay attention to when implementing light control: The general principle for residential houses during light control is to cover all windows (including skylights) with black cloth and blinds. However, indoor electric lights, such as those with less than 20 candlepower, covered with black lampshades with an angle of more than 20 degrees, and whose roofs do not reflect light, do not need to be specially covered with black cloth blinds. From this point of view, this electric light control is said to be much more lenient than what was held during past training.

However, the Great East Asia War has entered the secondary war stage, and the US Air Force in China is still reckless. The citizens of Shanghai urgently need to prepare materials for light control, so that at any time, they can turn from the current preparatory control to the real air raid control. It is very expensive for citizens to buy new fabrics, so they must try to make use of waste. Even under light control, it is still necessary to increase production and maintain other necessary night work without being hindered. Based on the experience gained from past training, work hard.

It is expected that citizens will feel various inconveniences due to light control. However, this is a self-defense measure that should be taken by the people in the rear to ensure their own lives and property and to strive for victory in the war. Even if there is confusion, it is not enough to care about it. I deeply hope that you will work hard, implement the control, and complete the full work. This is my most sincere prayer.

### Largest Scale Institution for Refugee Children: Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute

From the terminus of the Third Tram Line at Macgregor Road to Wuding Road, stepping onto the black, fine-sand Macgregor Road, less than two hundred steps, on the left wall, the white characters on a blue background "Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute" stand out prominently. Walking into the Fang Ji Warehouse, pushing open the door on the right, one finds a spacious and bright campus. Including the thirty-five Western-style houses, the grand and new-style refugee children's dormitory building stands before one's eyes.

Establishment and Development

The heroic and robust middle-aged Mr. Lu Zhong'en, the Chief Executive of the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute, after a warm greeting, spoke about the story of the birth of this largest-scale refugee children's educational institution in Shanghai, amidst many difficulties.

It was in the 27th year of the Republic (1938) that Shanghai was filled with wandering, destitute refugee children, but there were very few shelters and educational institutions. In May, Li Ruzhang and others began preparations for its establishment, and on the 15th of July, the "Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute" was announced in the Leshan Temple on Jin Shenfu Road, clearly stating its purpose as "to shelter refugee children from families in financial difficulty and unable to raise them." At that time, due to various limitations in terms of funding, personnel, and the location of the institute, the total number of refugee children sheltered was only twenty-seven. Six months later, Lu Wen took over the task, and as people from all walks of life gradually became aware of the institute's work, destitute refugee children flocked to it like streams returning to the sea. The number of children sheltered increased to three hundred and six. In the 28th year (1939), efforts were made to rent the current site at No. 99, Lane 25, Wuding Road, and twenty-seven dormitory buildings and ten single-story houses were built, and the scale gradually became complete. As Mr. Lu Zhong'en spoke, he specially led us to view the construction of the dormitory building. It is worth noting that the institute's toilets have underground septic facilities and do not have the unpleasant odor common to ordinary toilets, which is rarely seen in Shanghai charitable institutions. At that time, it was donated by a certain construction company, and the cost was more than ten thousand yuan!

In March of the 30th year (1941), Mr. Gao Huailiang succeeded as the director of the institute. With his ability, he further reorganized the institute's affairs and developed the educational work, adding eight new dormitory buildings. Recently, in order to facilitate access, an agreement was reached with Fang Ji Warehouse to borrow No. 601 Macgregor Road as the main gate of the institute, making the refugee children's academy appear even more dignified and solemn in form. In terms of scale, it does not lose its status as "the first in Shanghai."

Disciplined Life

The Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute currently houses a total of two hundred and fifty-four male and female refugee children. The three aspects of nurturing, managing, and educating are all the responsibility of staff members assigned by the institute. There are two departments, the Nurturing Affairs Department and the Education Affairs Department, to oversee these matters.

In terms of nurturing, the main task is to pay attention to the overall physical health of the students in the institute. Many of the refugee children who first enter the institute suffer from scalp infections, conjunctivitis, and skin diseases such as scabies. These must first be treated, otherwise they will spread. Last year, they underwent thorough isolation treatment, and most have now recovered. There are still a few who are isolated from healthy students.

In order to ensure the constant health of the children, the institute has a medical room with a row of bright rooms on the second floor, including a general medical clinic, an ophthalmology, otolaryngology clinic, and an operating room, etc. All treatment equipment can be said to be readily available. Next to the clinic is the pharmacy. Several medicine cabinets are filled with various Western medicines. It is said that these were purchased in the past and are still sufficient for use. The children's illnesses are mostly skin and surgical conditions, so surgical supplies such as ointments, gauze, and absorbent cotton are insufficient. Doctors come to examine the children every day, and most of them offer their services without any remuneration, in the spirit of sacrifice. There is also a pharmacist in the institute who is responsible for medical and pharmaceutical matters.

In addition to medical care, attention is also paid to the cleanliness and hygiene of the students' daily lives, and reasonable rest times. The toilets have a special squatting structure to avoid the spread of skin diseases that are easily transmitted by general sitting toilets. Bathing is compulsory every day or every other day in the summer, and has been changed to once a week since autumn. After the bathrooms are used by different grades and groups at specific times, they are immediately locked to prevent the children from wasting water and to maintain the cleanliness of the bathrooms. The students' clothes are also washed at specified times, so although they are rough cloth uniforms, they are all neat and clean, and the incidence of disease is naturally reduced.

Every day, in addition to lectures and work, the children have a certain amount of time for games and sports. The campus still looks newly opened, is very large, and is an excellent place for sports. If some sports equipment and supplies could be added, the lives of the refugee children would surely be more meaningful!

Due to financial constraints, the institute's food is quite simple. Parents and children alike eat three meals of porridge a day, relying entirely on household rations, supplementing them with some purchased items, and also preparing some vegetables. Look, three pots of porridge are being cooked in the kitchen. When the lid is lifted, the heat rises, and it is not clear what the ingredients are. Several large buckets of cooked, dark yellow, thick porridge are on the ground, giving off a slight aroma. Piles of cabbage in the cupboard are the only vegetable dishes.

All the bedrooms are furnished with double-layered iron beds, with snow-white sheets spread on the mattresses. The same applies to boys, girls, and faculty members. After getting up, they are all locked, and are not allowed to be entered privately except at bedtime or in special circumstances, thus maintaining cleanliness. Autumn is already deep, but the students do not yet have quilts on their beds. According to Mr. Lu, they will be distributed in winter.

Life is disciplined in the collective, but it is all for the benefit of the students. Love is full of discipline.

New Educational Methods

The nurturing at the Refugee Children's Education Institute has created a big family for the children in distress. The staff inside have become the mothers, sisters, and nannies of the children. However, the children also need spiritual food, intellectual enlightenment, and moral training. Therefore, the Refugee Children's Education Institute has also become an academy.

The Education Affairs Department is the highest leadership organization for educational work at the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute, including fifteen male and female teachers, who divide the work and cooperate to carry out educational affairs, dividing the two hundred and several dozen refugee children into six grades, forming the structure of a regular complete elementary school. Originally, the year was divided into two semesters, consistent with regular elementary schools. However, in practice, it was found that during the winter and summer vacations, students could not attend classes normally, played around without anything to do, and wasted their time, which was a pity and unreasonable in terms of educational principles. Therefore, starting last year, the vacation was cancelled and the year was changed to three semesters. In this way, the students' period of study is actually shortened. The complete elementary school curriculum, which can be completed in six years in ordinary schools, now only takes four years. If necessary adjustments are made to the curriculum, and if cramming-style education is not used, so that the students do not feel that the curriculum is too heavy, and they can fully absorb, digest, and apply what they have learned, then it would not only be a new method worthy of imitation in refugee children's education, but also a research necessity in ordinary education.

A neat row of school buildings is distributed among the classrooms of each grade. From the slogans on the square pillars in the corridors to the forms and charts on the classroom doors and interior walls, they all show the characteristics of a school that is run in the most spirited manner. It is exam time, and the children sitting neatly in each classroom are all focused on the mimeographed exam papers. Some are writing quickly, while others are tilting their heads and thinking. The teachers are also busy, some answering individual questions in a low voice, and others watching the students' actions.

There are even classrooms for the first and second years of junior high school, and older students are also taking classes. Mr. Lu said that originally, after the students graduated from senior elementary school, they were allowed to apply to the corresponding middle school, and all expenses were fully borne by the school, which became the students' "reborn parents." Later, due to practical needs and possibilities, starting from the last semester, junior high school was run in-house, so that students could continue their studies at the institute after graduating from complete elementary school. However, in order to facilitate future schooling and supplementary classes, the curriculum items arranged by the institute, the textbooks used, and the daily teaching hours are completely the same as those of ordinary schools! This is all for the future of the students, which is also very rare.

In addition to academic education, considerable attention is also paid to the students' daily lives, personality cultivation, and group life. The teachers are responsible for moral, physical, social, and intellectual development, so that each student can become a healthy citizen of China in the future. It is said that the first and second graduating students of the institute, nine in total, were all admitted to the Xin and Shen Newspaper scholarship and loan programs. The five most outstanding students were also admitted to the Uncle Pin Public Scholarship. Currently, six people have found jobs, and the remaining three are still studying at the San Cai Middle School in this city. From this, one can see a glimpse of the institute's educational achievements.

Crafts and Labor

In order to meet the special needs of refugee children, the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute, like other refugee children's educational institutions, teaches crafts and technical skills in addition to regular academic education, so that these poor children can learn considerable work skills at the institute, so that they can go out and earn a living independently if they cannot go to school, and serve the society. However, what is different from other educational institutions is that it does not implement a complete work-study program, but a "study-oriented, work-secondary" system. The time for studying is completely the same as that of ordinary schools, and time is not taken out for work. Only a certain amount of time is stipulated outside of academic time for learning crafts. This method naturally has its own good intentions in caring for refugee children.

In terms of craft education, the main subjects are sewing and weaving, which are only taught to girls. Next to the classrooms, in a sewing room, several sewing machines are displayed. Next door, two rows of sock-knitting machines are displayed. Every night is their time to learn crafts. It is said that the results are quite good, and their products can now be supplied for internal use in the institute. After reaching the level of "self-sufficiency" in the future, they may also be able to serve the society.

The boys' craft education does not seem to have started normally yet. Currently, the institute has organized a music team, selecting some children with musical talents to give them special popular music education, musical knowledge, and discipline. It has now been trained and has accepted requests from all walks of life to participate in weddings, funerals, and various ceremonies, which is highly praised by all parties, and there is also some income that can be used to subsidize the institute.

In order to cultivate the students' habits of self-help and helping others, and to strengthen the efficiency of the students' practical life education, the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute adheres to the principle of having the students automatically handle all affairs in the institute. Therefore, in a large institution with two or three hundred people, only two employees are hired to provide guidance and assistance. All the cleaning work, washing, organizing, arranging, moving, and other daily labor tasks are completely undertaken by the staff members, who guide the students themselves. The aim is to ensure that everything is handled in an orderly manner. The overall impression of all parts of the institute is that they are neat, clean, and artistic, which shows the self-governance and self-help ability of the children in distress. Of course, the staff members must have spent a lot of effort in organizing and guiding!

"Everyone has work to do, and everyone has food to eat." Mr. Sun Yat-sen's political ideal has finally been realized in the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute.

Perfect Organization

The highest organization of this large-scale refugee children's education institute is the Board of Directors, which elects the president, who is responsible for the overall administration of the institute. The current president is Mr. Gao Huailiang. Under the president, there is a chief executive (currently Mr. Lu Zhong'en) and a secretary, who assist the president in managing and planning the overall administration of the institute and supervise the various tasks of the institute. The above-mentioned directors, president, chief executive, and secretary are all willing to sacrifice and serve the refugee children's education cause without receiving any remuneration or salary.

The affairs of the entire institute are managed by the Administrative Affairs Department, which is parallel to the Education Affairs Department and the Nurturing Affairs Department. It includes six staff members, each of whom is given a salary of between one hundred and twenty yuan and one hundred and fifty yuan, for a total of only seven hundred and fifty yuan per month. In reality, they are completely sacrificing and serving. The administrative work is divided into five sections: the accounting section, which has one accountant, one cashier, and one collector. The accountant is responsible for preparing account books and rigorously verifying various receipts. The cashier is responsible for handling cash inflows and outflows, but all expenditures must be approved and signed by the chief executive. The collector is responsible for collecting any donations.

The documentation section has only one staff member, who is responsible for drafting daily external official documents and for recording the institute's daily logs for future reference. The registration section also has one staff member, who is responsible for registering the entry and exit of students and for investigating the detailed situation of the students' families.

In addition, there are also purchasing and storage sections. The former handles the purchase of all items needed by the institute, and does not have a dedicated staff member. It is currently handled by joint deliberation of the various sections. Purchased items are transferred to the latter, the storage section, which has one staff member. Any items needed by the staff members of the institute must be requested with a requisition form, which is approved and issued by the section. All students' clothing and other items are numbered, classified by grade, and stored in rows of large cabinets, which are kept by the grade teachers.

The fifteen teachers in the Education Affairs Department have monthly salaries ranging from one hundred and eighty yuan to three hundred and twenty yuan, totaling no more than two thousand eight hundred and fifty yuan. The lives of teachers are already very difficult today. The highest monthly salary for a teacher at the institute is only three hundred and twenty yuan, which is not much better than at ordinary schools. However, in terms of work, because the three-semester system is implemented, there are no holidays throughout the year, and their hard work is naturally even more admirable.

All staff members of the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute are serving under the principle of "division of labor and cooperation." Due to the perfection of the organization and the soundness of the spirit, it is no wonder that it has been able to occupy a considerable position in the refugee children's education cause.

### Navy

— By Iwata Yu, Translated by Hong Yang

Wearing the summer uniform, hanging a short sword, swaying on the streets of my hometown, it was only the first day of returning home, and the day was also for visiting Marshal Togo Heihachiro's tomb, Yasukuni Shrine, and the graves of ancestors.

"Why don't you wear a military uniform?" When visiting my sister's house and my uncle's family, I received the same question. I could only smile.

To be honest, I couldn't say what the reason was myself. I always felt shy. If I were to be polite, perhaps it was out of respect for my comrades in the military class during my fourth year. Weren't they still in the fifth grade of the Second Middle School?

"Your color has darkened, and you've become fatter. People will mistake you."

When visiting the Ogata family, I was also wearing the brownish-gray uniform from my Second Middle School days. Mr. Ogata didn't seem to mind the attire. He was probably on vacation, so he was very amiable. "You must wear your formal uniform for me to see!"

Only his wife didn't allow it. "You must wear your formal uniform for me to see!"

He went to the real person's room on the sweltering rooftop and forced him to take it out. And like when the real person first entered school, he drew out the short sword and looked at it, and admired the shoulder boards with the insignia. In the end, the wife forced the real person to lend him his uniform to try on.

"It looks good! With glasses, you look like a medical officer."

Seeing the wife wearing the military uniform, the real person said jokingly, but the wife said very seriously, "On such a military cap, you just need to put two more white coins..."

A military cap with white coins was the uniform of a student at the Naval Accounting School. In terms of the real person's physique, it was only a matter of ten days. The real person recalled with amusement the day a year ago.

After trying it on, the wife opened her mouth and said:

"Whenever I see the naval summer uniform, I think of that officer..."

"Who?"

"The training officer who gave the speech when we went to Etajima for a tour."

"Ah, that training officer..."

The real person would never forget the speaker of that deeply moving speech either. Ever since entering the school, he had closely observed the training officer's face, but he had never seen him again. At the Naval Academy, the training officers were rotated before the moisture even dried, and their terms were extremely short. "Before the moisture even dried..."

The wife shook her head, deeply moved.

(Omission)

I often heard upperclassmen say that when they went home, they always felt that the time was too long and boring. Now, looking at it, it was indeed true. I couldn't help but recall the Etajima life where I had to make use of every second.

"Mom, let me deliver rice." The real person said this to his mother one day.

"There's no need. You don't have to work," his mother said.

"Because you've come home on vacation, you can rest."

His older brother, Yoshi, also chimed in.

But the real person refused. Wearing a white shirt and the gray-blue trousers from his Second Middle School days, he came to the counter.

"If you want to do it yourself, then do it." With that, his mother couldn't force him to stop.

The real person heard his brother say that the customer's family was going to load three one-to bags of rice onto the rack of the bicycle. He was hunched over, wearing rough clothing, and at first glance, he looked like a rice shop delivery boy.

"I'm going." As he jumped onto the pedals of the bicycle, his older brother, Yoshi, watched from behind and laughed.

Two of the customers were unfamiliar, so he was very calm, but in the end, he was discovered at the last house.

"Mr. Real Person, you've become a naval student, and you're still coming to deliver rice."

"Yes." The real person blushed and smiled, his expression unchanged, as he placed the stamp on the delivery slip for the customer.

The deliveries were all completed, so the bicycle was light and he was happily speeding down the street near the Second Middle School. From behind, someone shouted loudly, "Hey! Tani!"

The real person gently stopped the bicycle by the side of the road. There, standing on the roadside, was Komori, wearing a white upper body and a black formal skirt. He was also returning home on vacation from the Army War College.

"It's been a long time. When did you come back?"

Because the other party was also a soldier, the real person spoke without ceremony. Komori was the same, also without ceremony. Both of them felt a sense of pride in being soldiers.

"I was just about to go to your house. The students from the military class at the Second Middle School are planning to have a hot pot dinner tomorrow night by the river, centered around you, me, and Kumazawa. So, I'm here to tell you." Komori said this with a very smug expression.

National Forum

### Examination of Rice Production Increase

— By Wang Dacai

Regarding the increase in rice production, we can divide it into three aspects: increasing sources, reducing waste, and adjusting distribution, to seek progress together.

Increasing Sources:

Zi (1st Heavenly Stem): Cultivation of Wasteland. Our country has a vast land and a large population, and there is much that can be utilized. In particular, the area of wasteland in North China and North Jiangsu is quite considerable. According to statistics, the area under cultivation in North China has increased by 1,291,200 mu, and in North Jiangsu, it has also increased by 30% of the original area. This is of course due to the government's attention to cultivation, but the people's needs are still not met. It is hoped that the government can further pay attention to cultivation.

Chou (2nd Heavenly Stem): Increasing Yield of Existing Land. Past facts tell us how significant the damage to crops is. Taking the area around Hunan last year as an example, the soybeans that died from red rust disease and the rice that was submerged by water, according to statistics from Wu County alone, amounted to more than 50 million yuan. This number is astonishing, and it forces us to pay attention to increasing crop production. Crop production can be discussed in two ways. Positively, we should emulate Japan's intensive farming system, using various scientific methods to make the most of the land and produce the greatest possible yield. Of course, these so-called various scientific methods include various aspects, such as fertilizers, seeds, and storage. With regard to seed improvement, attention should be paid to the following points: A. Cultivation of new varieties. B. Exchange of seeds. C. Inspection and selection of seeds. D. Storage of seeds. Two. Negatively, we should pay attention to water conservancy and insect extermination. The regulation of water and drought, and the prevention of locusts, etc., are particularly urgent matters.

Reducing Waste:

Zi (1st Heavenly Stem): Restriction on Rice Use in Restaurants. We would rather have no rice sold in all of Shanghai's restaurants than allow it to be wasted at will. It is advocated that restaurants specializing in selling rice be set up separately from restaurants, and if there is any surplus on that day, it must be moved to the next day, rather than allowing it to be wasted at will.

Chou (2nd Heavenly Stem): Prohibition of Brewing Alcohol. In today's situation of rice shortage, even the use of rice for the sole purpose of filling the stomach is not enough. However, in the face of the abnormal development of the liquor industry, it is still not declining. Therefore, in order to adapt to the wartime system, we should resolutely prohibit brewing alcohol and maintain the lives of the people and the survival of the nation.

Adjusting Distribution:

Jia (1st Celestial Stem): Restricting Private Sale of Rice and Increasing Rice Ration per Household. The private sale of rice has created a black market for rice prices. As a result, ordinary farmers, tempted by the high prices in the black market, sell rice and refuse to buy it, which affects the Rice Control Association's ability to purchase rice. Therefore, prohibiting the private sale of rice is tantamount to opening a shortcut to increasing the rice ration per household.

Yi (2nd Celestial Stem): Striving for Simplicity in the Distribution Mechanism, Residents Organize Cooperatives According to Their Place of Residence. Striving for simplicity in the distribution mechanism does not necessarily mean losing its confidentiality, but rather seeking to increase speed. In addition, it can reduce some malpractices. Past experience tells us that retailers sometimes cheat. Therefore, I now advocate that residents in Shanghai should organize consumer cooperatives according to their addresses and in accordance with the Baojia system, either one Bao or one Lianbao each (temporarily naming it as the Consumption Cooperative of Lianbao (Bao) No. in District No. ), with each resident as a member, and then the government will distribute rice and other daily necessities according to the number of members. In addition, one point that is linked to this is the need to achieve openness, otherwise it will be no different from a disguised grain store.

Bing (3rd Celestial Stem): Investigation and Statistics of Rice. To solve the current food problem, we must first solve the production problem, as mentioned earlier. The second is the distribution problem. However, how much is our country's total grain production? Today, we should first conduct on-the-spot investigations. For provinces and counties with insufficient grain, on the one hand, we should increase production, and on the other hand, we should adjust the surplus and make statistics for experts to study.

Ding (4th Celestial Stem): Organization of Storage Facilities at all levels.

The ancients said, "Three years of farming yields one year of storage, and nine years of work yields three years of storage. Even if there are floods and droughts, people will still have a healthy complexion." From this, we can know the importance of accumulation. For today and for the future, we should seek to improve the effectiveness of the warehouses established in various provinces, counties, townships, and villages.

Wu (5th Celestial Stem): State-Run Food Supply. Under the current state of war, the price of food is bound to skyrocket. In order to alleviate the suffering of the people, the government can establish a "food subsidy" to keep the price of rice low, and use this fund to compensate the losses of the factory owners. This is a temporary measure to keep the price of rice down. In addition, the government should purchase food. This has already been done through the organization of the Rice Control Association, but it is even more necessary to establish a state-run food supply, or use this food factory to directly distribute to various new consumer cooperatives. On the one hand, it can stabilize market prices, and on the other hand, it can control the mixture of other ingredients in rice flour to make food.

The above-mentioned points, some of which the National Government is currently carrying out or preparing to carry out in the future, and the other items, need to be planned by the authorities and supported by the government and the public in order to achieve significant results.

Social Services

### Physicians' Volunteer Medical Service

Doctor Ding Fubao, in order to serve the Acupuncture Association, will be in charge of all patients with lung disease or neurasthenia residing in the Fuguang Sanatorium. He will not charge consultation fees and will use hygiene, self-cultivation, health, longevity, and other methods to help patients get rid of their suffering as soon as possible. The sanatorium is located at 123 Route Masnan. In addition, the hospital, because of the soaring prices of medicines and the lack of medicinal materials in the market, has established a Department of Mental Treatment, headed by Doctor Chen. He will use methods such as meditation, breathing, massage, hypnosis, etc., to radically cure insomnia, neurasthenia, gout, anemia, and various chronic diseases.

Our specially contracted dentist, Li Fei, previously treated Mr. Ban [likely a typo, should be Pan, translater] a clear-minded debater for this newspaper. Now, in order to continue his service, he has decided that from March 1st, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM, teachers of primary and secondary schools or poor people with bad teeth can request a certificate from this office and go to Dr. Li's clinic for free treatment, limited to three people per day. The clinic is located at Room 411, No. 451 Jiangxi Road, Chenchen Building.

Lectures

The Moral Lecture is scheduled for every Sunday morning from 9:00 to 12:00, focusing on self-cultivation. In addition to the two main lecturers, Sun and Yang, biologist Mr. Gu Zhongchao will give a lecture on what biology tells us about human nature. Address: Cangzhou Shuchang, Chengdu Road.

For the purpose of promoting Buddhism in this city, the Jing'an Temple has specially invited Master Xingci, a contemporary master of Tiantai Buddhism, to come to the temple to lecture on the entire Ksitigarbha Sutra starting tomorrow. It is said that Master Xingci has been promoting Buddhism in Shanghai for more than 40 years, with profound doctrines and high morality. The number of people who have taken refuge under his guidance is no less than hundreds of thousands.

### Friendship Day Gathering of Elders

— Sun Choucheng

On Friendship Day, the elders of the Qiying Society held a tea party at the Victory Tea House yesterday morning at 9:00 AM to celebrate. In the afternoon at 5:00 PM, Mr. Chen, the president of the Zhongbao Newspaper, hosted a banquet at the Industrial and Commercial Association to entertain the attendees. More than ten people attended, including Sun Fumin, Zhu Juefo, Zhao Ximing, Sha Shilang, Zhang Le'er, Huang Jingwan, Ma Wenwo, Chen Qianming, Li Qiyun, Li Shencai, Hu Weiqing, Cai Rongsheng, Zhang Youliang, Shen Hongkang, Yan Boxun, Yu Shaoqiao, Wang Zhendong, and Pan Xingqiao. In terms of origin, there were eight provinces, including Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as Shanghai. In terms of age, two were over 70, three were over 60, five were over 50 and five were over 40, and one each were over 30 and over 20. In terms of gender, one-eighth were female. Although one dare not say that all the talents were present, it could be called a gathering of young and old. Mr. Huang Jingwan stood up to give a speech, saying that today is March 3rd, the 33rd year of the Republic of China, the tenth week of the International Friendship Day. He has served for 33 years, so he initiated this gathering of friends, starting with the six "Zheng" characters: "Zheng" the heart, do "Zheng" things, be close to "Zheng" people, walk the "Zheng" path, write "Zheng" books, and cultivate "Zheng" Qi. He also recited an ancient poem: "Friends who are only interested in power and profit should not be close, make friends with older and more mature people. Goodness naturally has the fragrance of orchids, and mutual dependence reveals true nature." Then, Li Qiyun, Sun Fumin, Ma Wenwo, Zhao Ximing, Zhu Juefo, and Wang Zhendong gave speeches, all emphasizing that friends occupy the most important position in the five relationships. The friendship between Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya and Chen Lei is universally praised. The friendship that transcends age is like a breeze. Gather through literature, build neighborliness through virtue, converse like water, and share interests like orchids. Foster association based on harmony, not driven by profit, to achieve mutual assistance and benefit each other. Nowadays, people's hearts are not as ancient, customs are declining, especially in Shanghai. There are many people who only seek power and profit, indulging in wine and meat. It is truly sighing. The gentlemen who came today are all indifferent to fame and fortune, so the dishes served are only six bowls and one soup, costing only 50 yuan per guest, without drinking alcohol or smoking, practicing thrift, which is a great example to follow. Mr. Huang's emphasis on the six "Zheng" characters corresponds to the three words "Liu He San Gu." Checking, three is an auspicious number, heaven, earth, and man are called the three talents, sun, moon, and stars are the three lights, and the Zhuanghui solution is called the three yuan. A gentleman has three joys, and we wish and praise the three flowers. Even in terms of making friends, the Analects discuss gains and losses, also starting from the three characters. There are three kinds of beneficial friends and three kinds of detrimental friends, so the number three is definitely related to Friendship Day. I hope that all of you present will remember today's gathering and not forget it. The meeting adjourned at 7:20 PM. Originally, it was supposed to be a time of ten thousand lights, but unfortunately, there was a blackout that day, so it was pitch black outside, making it difficult to walk. I said that when moving forward in the dark, one should pay more attention, muster spirit, and grope forward. Everyone agreed, and then they parted ways to return home, already at 8:00 PM.
