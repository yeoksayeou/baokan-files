Among them, two aircraft sank one enemy battleship, and three aircraft each sank one large transport ship. In addition, one battleship or cruiser was damaged and caught fire. Afterwards, two Japanese escort fighters have not yet returned. (2) The members of the Jingguo Flying Unit participating in this attack are as follows: Army Second Lieutenant Akira Otsubo, Tsugihiko Hata, Army Corporal Kazuto Ishii, Hideo Matsui, Tadamasa Terashima, and Tetsuzo Kawashima.

Philippine Japanese Military Base, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force fiercely bombed enemy naval forces reinforcing Leyte Island on the 27th.

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese new Type 1 land-based attack aircraft team has repeatedly achieved remarkable feats since the start of the war. The Type 1 land-based attack aircraft is a twin-engine, mid-range attack aircraft with excellent performance. The aircraft's shape resembles a cigar's wrapper, but on the front lines, it is affectionately called the "Type 1 Attack Aircraft." It can effectively perform bombing and torpedo attacks. Therefore, since the start of the war, it has roamed the skies and achieved remarkable feats. This attack squadron has also participated in operations, causing enemy hearts to tremble with fear.

Tominaga Lieutenant General Expresses Determination

Philippine Base, 30th (Central News Agency) – Lieutenant General Tominaga, commander of the Japanese Air Force in the Philippines, when meeting with a group of reporters on the 29th, expressed his determination as follows: The air battle is decisive. There cannot be a second time in this battle. This time, our army's soldiers will form special attack units several times, using a tactic of one plane against one ship, which is unparalleled in its bravery. This spirit will naturally make the Philippine battle situation increasingly profound. However, with this spirit of self-sacrifice, we will surely be able to defeat the enemy who relies on material strength. If every soldier has this fearless spirit, they can put down their firearms and, lightly armed with bombs, charge towards enemy tanks and artillery positions. This has been seen repeatedly on the Leyte front. Our army can only retain food and ammunition. I am certain that we will win this war.

### Leyte Island Japanese Suicide Squad Raids Enemy Flank; American Supply Route Has Been Cut Off

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – After the Japanese army built a strong defensive position on the high ground west of Tagami on Leyte Island, they invited attacks from the enemy and repeatedly penetrated deep into enemy positions, inflicting heavy blows. They once braved heavy rain to charge into enemy positions and launch fierce attacks, achieving great results. An eight-man suicide squad led by Second Lieutenant So-and-so braved the rain on the 17th, carrying two light machine guns, and penetrated deep into the forest, climbing rocks, and circling around to the enemy's flank. At that time, the enemy, believing that the Japanese army would not attack due to the heavy rain, gathered in tents to chat. The Japanese army continued to advance and ordered two machine gunners to guard key points. The other six men, led by Second Lieutenant So-and-so, advanced. After the Second Lieutenant gave the order, the six brave warriors suddenly advanced, approaching the enemy's tents. At this time, the enemy, unprepared for the sudden Japanese attack, fell into chaos. After discovering a retreat route, they scrambled to escape. At this time, the two machine gunners, who were waiting in ambush, fiercely strafed them, leaving behind fifty or sixty bodies. The eight Japanese soldiers were not injured and safely returned to their defense.

Philippine Base, 30th (Central News Agency) – The American forces along the coast of Carigara Bay on Leyte Island have suffered heavy losses due to prolonged fierce attacks by the Japanese army after their land supply routes were cut off. However, they continue to resist. In particular, the American forces in the Managanas area are even more helpless. They previously attempted to advance towards the area around Limon with a portion of their forces, but were quickly repelled by the Japanese army and fled into the deep mountains to the northwest. After the Japanese army cut off the road from Carigara to Hinamungaran on the 20th, they further penetrated into the American positions, achieving great results and continuing to attack the American left flank south of Managanas. In addition, the Japanese army is advancing from the east and will continue to pursue the enemy in the mountains. There is no major change in the battle line in the Buri-Tagaami area. The Japanese ambush team in that area penetrated into the coconut groves around Halo, destroyed two enemy howitzers, and then returned. On the western Leyte coast, in the mountain area, on the morning of the 25th, with artillery support, the Japanese army broke into Dam County near Waigak and occupied the area. Also, the Japanese army advancing eastward from the south of Catandatan has broken into enemy positions near the Istan River, causing great confusion. The Japanese army is still continuing its fierce attack.

A Certain Japanese Military Base in the Philippines, 33rd (Central News Agency) – On the afternoon of the 27th, around 8:30 PM, the Japanese air force bombed the enemy airfield in Tacloban and the material storage depots in the city, causing fires and destroying more than four facilities.

Japanese Army Carries Out Surprise Attacks on Two Routes

A Certain Japanese Military Base in the Philippines, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese garrison in northern Leyte is still fiercely attacking the enemy forces in Capoocan and Carahag, and on the 27th, they cut off the highway between these two locations and the highway to Managanas, completely isolating the enemy. Therefore, the enemy forces in the Managanas and Li- areas can only contact the rear through the roads. In central Leyte, after the new Japanese troops arrived in Caridad, they are landing in Papa and putting pressure on the enemy. By the 27th, they had still defeated the enemy retreating to the high ground north of Caridad and advanced to the outskirts of Caridad, continuing to attack the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of the enemy's 7th Division. Because of the Japanese attack, the enemy withdrew to Timla-an and set up a defensive position facing the sea to prevent Japanese attacks, and had fourteen 10-inch howitzers. However, on the night of the 27th, the Japanese army launched a surprise attack on the enemy with new troops, and successfully attacked both flanks. The main force of the enemy in that area is still under attack.

Leyte Operations: Characteristics – Remarks by a Japanese Military Staff Officer

A staff officer from a certain Japanese military base recently returned from the front lines of Leyte Island. Regarding the battle situation on the island and the fierce fighting of the Japanese army, he said: The characteristics of the Leyte operation are: First, the American supply route is too long, and the Americans must engage in combat at the front end of this long supply route. The airfields that can be relied upon at this front end cannot be fully used, so the enemy is suffering deeply. However, the enemy is trying to compensate for its weaknesses with material strength. On the other hand, the Japanese army is fighting within its own sphere of influence, and the rear has air force bases. Second, the enemy relied on superior mobile forces to overwhelm the Japanese air force during the landing on Leyte Island, but suffered repeated setbacks, so its landing operation did not proceed as scheduled. Third, this operation is different from the battles in New Guinea, Saipan, and other places, because the Japanese army was able to deploy a large combat force from the front to fight hard under various unique circumstances, and also adopted tactics of hand-to-hand combat and surprise attacks. The success of the Japanese assault troops on Peleliu Island is unprecedented. At the same time, Japanese aircraft are also unusually active, and the Navy is also responding and deploying. Moreover, the number of volunteers for the Leyte Island assault team is now greater than before.

However, some fires were immediately extinguished, and those that were still burning were extinguished around 5:30 AM. There was no damage to important facilities, and personnel injuries were very minor.

### Soong Mei-ling Separated from Chiang

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) – Soong Mei-ling went to South America from Chongqing this summer and also visited the United States. She was in New York in early September for medical treatment. Regarding this matter, the Daily Mail of Calcutta reported that Soong Mei-ling's trip to the United States was not just for medical treatment, because Chiang Kai-shek has separated from Soong Mei-ling. Soong Mei-ling is planning to reside temporarily in the United States, fearing that she will stay there for a long time, so she will give speeches related to the Chinese situation. However, according to the Chongqing Central News Agency's Washington dispatch, Kong Xiangxi, the former Minister of Finance of Chongqing stationed in the United States, denied this, saying that Soong Mei-ling intends to reside for a long time on the coast of Miami, Florida, and that the news that Soong Mei-ling wanted to return to Chongqing was purely false.

### Chongqing Conceals the Reasons for Kong Xiangxi's Dismissal

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) – In the recent reorganization in Chongqing, the dismissal of Military Affairs Minister He Yingqin and Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi is most noteworthy. According to a Chongqing dispatch: Zhang Pingdeng, a spokesman for the Chongqing authorities, stated to a group of reporters on the 29th as follows: The changes of He Yingqin and Kong Xiangxi were both requested by the individuals themselves. Zhang also speculated on the reasons for He Yingqin's resignation in his capacity as a spokesman, saying that it was because he had concurrently held the positions of Minister of Military Affairs and Chief of Staff for the past two years. Also, Kong Xiangxi resigned from his position as Minister of Finance due to poor health, and at the same time left his position as Vice President of the Executive Yuan. The successor has not yet been selected.

### Revised Method for Receiving Telegrams

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Greater East Asia Electrical Communications Conference was previously held in Tokyo, where it was decided to fix the calculation method for telegram place names, that is, regardless of the number of words in the name and address of the recipient, a fixed number of words will be charged for the telegram. It is now learned that the Huazhong Electrical Communications Department has decided that starting today, all telegrams sent to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, whether in Chinese or Japanese, will be calculated using a fixed number of words. As in the past, Japanese telegrams will charge two words for the name and address of the recipient. For Chinese telegrams, starting today, the name and address of the recipient will be charged at a fixed rate of three words, regardless of the number of words. This move greatly reduces the burden on Chinese people sending telegrams, and all parties express their extreme satisfaction. However, telegram senders should strive to write the recipient's name and address as simply as possible, and the telegraph office has the right to delete words. It is hoped that all circles will pay attention to this point.

### Special Fundraising Team for Scholarship Funds

The Shēnbào Readers' Scholarship Fund Achievement Exhibition opens today at the YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge, and at the same time, we are launching the Eighth Shēnbào Readers' Scholarship Special Fundraising Team. See page 3 of today's newspaper for the regulations.

With full enthusiasm, we hope that readers will help us—no, help the entire society, the entire China—with scholarship work. In recent years, the movement to rescue young people from dropping out of school has become a general social consensus of "intercommunication," and it has become a "mutual assistance" work for the general public. The achievements of the scholarship movement can at least be said to be the greatest of many "intercommunication" and "mutual assistance" movements. Taking this newspaper as an example, the amount of scholarship funds was 33,73.60 yuan in the first session, 51,587.50 yuan in the second session, 147,531.50 yuan in the third session, 236,431.00 yuan in the fourth session, 1,382,547.00 yuan in the fifth session, 3,256,316.00 yuan in the sixth session, and 14,193,160.00 yuan in the seventh session. The number of students receiving scholarships was 1,005 in the first session, 984 in the second session, 1,156 in the third session, 1,629 in the fourth session, 4,013 in the fifth session, 4,621 in the sixth session, and 4,658 in the seventh session. Whether from the perspective of the amount of money or the number of students, the achievements of each session have always exceeded the previous session by several times. On the one hand, this shows how eager society is for assistance, and on the other hand, it shows how hard the Shēnbào readers have worked.

Since the need for scholarships is so pressing, and the increase in tuition fees is an unavoidable fact, before the end of each semester and before the start of the next scholarship campaign, we see the achievements of the scholarship students and receive requests for continued support. Everyone is always happy and surprised. What the readers and we are happy about is that the achievements of the scholarship students have all reached everyone's expectations, and many have even exceeded general ideals, making everyone feel that these donations, this work, can create such great results. At the same time, what readers and we are surprised about is that in such difficult circumstances, there are so many people in need, and the amount of money needed is so huge, how should everyone continue to work hard. However, based on the results of the past seven sessions, what everyone thought was surprising finally turned into happiness. The amount of donations not only allows the students who have already received assistance to continue their studies, but also allows it to be expanded to new poor and excellent students. The spirit of mutual assistance shown by the Shēnbào readers in such a difficult and challenging environment is not only the glory of this newspaper, but it can also occupy the most glorious page in the history of new Shanghai and the history of new China.

Now the spring semester of the 34th year of the Republic of China is about to begin. A part of the gratifying achievements has been displayed in the exhibition, which is something that the readers of this newspaper believe is worth congratulating to the people of Shanghai and China. At the same time, the surprising facts are also immediately placed before us. According to the current number of students receiving assistance, the amount of donations, and the trend of tuition fee documents in the next semester, the time to the real start of school is only two months, the time is so short, the number of excellent students in need of assistance now is so large, and the amount of donations needed is so large. This is really the most urgent, the most difficult, and the most challenging thing. However, with our consistently unwavering confidence in the past and with the full enthusiasm of the people of Shanghai, we can make the hearts of the people of Shanghai interconnected, and we can all work together to do this work of mutual assistance. We firmly believe that this work of rescuing the urgent, the suffering, and the needy will surely have unexpected results.

1,000 teams and 20 million yuan is just a minimum. Together with the existing donations, it is only enough to maintain the existing scholarship students to continue their studies. Because these many students are flowers that the readers have personally cultivated and irrigated with their blood and sweat over the years, no matter how difficult it is, we must not let them wither and wither, and make everyone give up their previous efforts. This newspaper and its colleagues are ashamed of their meager resources, and we will each donate 100,000 yuan to organize two teams. We dare not say that it is a promotion, but we dare to express our meager intentions. We firmly believe that the scholarship movement is already everyone's joint work, and educating the next generation is the only and most practical thing on the road to nation-building. At this critical moment, everyone will surely be able to use the power of the masses to promote this joint work and complete this common ambition.

We respectfully request readers to donate more.

### Japanese Air and Land Forces Fiercely Attack; Enemy in Morotai Threatened; Djalaluddin Airport Can No Longer Be Used

Southern Front, 30th (Central News Agency) – The losses of Leyte Island and the surrounding areas of the Philippine Islands in recent days have been announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters successively. Among them, the most noteworthy is the most important supply base of the enemy, Morotai Island, which is closest to the Philippine Islands. The elite troops of the Japanese army, with high morale, have been conducting fierce surprise attacks around the enemy airfield, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. At the same time, the Japanese air force has continued to attack day and night, causing the enemy to lose many aircraft. Especially since the large-scale bombing on the night of the 22nd, the continuous bombing has made the supply base ineffective. The firepower of the enemy base cannot withstand the fierce attacks of the Japanese air and land forces. The battle line has been reduced, and strong defenses have been established around the airfield, adopting a tactic of avoiding war as much as possible. The enemy forces, which have always been arrogant, have now turned to the first priority of defense.

Southern Front Base, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army air force has been fiercely bombing the enemy airfield in Djalaluddin on Morotai Island for days, and the army assault teams have launched surprise attacks. The airfield can no longer be used completely. The enemy forces have been rebuilding the airfield for days as a supply base for Leyte. Since the 26th, the aircraft concentrated on the island have been flying in the air day and night as patrol aircraft to prevent attacks by Japanese aircraft. At the same time, land forces have been concentrated around the airfield to prevent Japanese surprise attacks. Therefore, Morotai Island, the enemy's supply base, is clearly threatened.

Southwest Pacific Base, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese air force fiercely bombed the enemy airfield in Morotai around 1:00 AM on the 29th, completely hitting the airfield while braving the enemy's fierce anti-aircraft fire. All Japanese aircraft returned to their defenses safely.

Japanese Military Achievements

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese garrison on Morotai Island has been conducting large-scale aggressive attacks since the enemy began landing, causing the enemy to tremble with fear, and has been conducting large-scale bombings of enemy ground facilities with powerful firepower. At the same time, the new Japanese reinforcement troops have also made reverse landings and have been successful. In addition, some enemy airfields can no longer be used due to attacks by Japanese ground forces. The Japanese military achievements from the enemy landing on September 15th to November 21st are as follows: (1) The Japanese army killed 2,831 enemies. (2) The Japanese army captured 2 enemy mortars and 14 boxes of ammunition. (3) Destroyed 2 enemy heavy artillery pieces, 4 anti-aircraft guns, 1 machine gun, 5 boats, 1 tractor, 1 power supply vehicle, 1 wooden house, 73 military camps, 5 covered positions, and 1 material accumulation area.

A Certain Japanese Military Base on the Southern Front, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese air force has been fiercely attacking Morotai Island for days, and the enemy's aircraft supply base has completely lost its function. Sergeant Ota Bin, of a certain unit of Japanese aircraft participating in the attack on the 27th, talked about the fierce attack as follows: When my plane invaded the local airspace, it was illuminated by a bright moon. Sparks came out of the shelter on the north side of the enemy airfield, and then the fire expanded horizontally. This was caused by a bomb dropped by my friendly aircraft hitting the enemy aircraft inside the shelter and igniting it. Soon the fire expanded, and a fierce pillar of fire soared into the sky, and at the same time it exploded with a roar. The shelter area was surrounded by fire. Looking back on the return trip, I saw that the airfield was a river of fire.

### Enemy U.S. Fleet in Disarray, Japanese Forces Launch Annihilation Campaign, Minister Matsushima's Congratulatory Speech at Joint Exercises
　　Minister Matsushima, the press officer of the allied Matsushima Fleet, spoke at the second Shanghai citizens' rally to celebrate the elimination of the British and Americans, recounting how the Japanese Navy had valiantly engaged and decimated the enemy U.S. fleet in the Pacific, starting from the waters off Ryukyu and Taiwan on October 10th of this year and continuing through fierce battles in Leyte Gulf in the Philippines. The results were remarkable, and the enemy U.S. fleet is now in a state of disarray. Details are as follows:

　　Enemy U.S. Losses in Three Stages
　　Minister Matsushima stated, "I am deeply grateful to all of you for your enthusiastic participation today. I will now provide a comprehensive report on the current situation in the Pacific and the future course of the Greater East Asia War. The current battle between Japan and the U.S. began on October 10th of this year and has been extremely fierce. We can divide it into three stages: first, from October 10th to October 30th; second, from November 1st to November 15th; and third, from November 15th to the present. The enemy U.S. operation was intended to assist General MacArthur's landing operation in the Philippines via New Guinea. The U.S. risked everything, deploying its entire navy and the most elite troops. In this operation, the enemy U.S. forces attacked from both north and south. In the north, the Third Fleet led by Halsey and the Fifth Fleet led by Spruance suffered losses of no fewer than 250 warships and over 1,500 aircraft, not to mention other losses. The enemy's forces, starting from Ryukyu and Taiwan on October 10th, were met with a head-on attack by the Japanese forces, who decimated the enemy U.S. Third Fleet. In the south, from New Guinea to Leyte Gulf, the second stage of the operation began on November 1st and lasted until November 15th. From the battle off Taiwan to the battlefield in the Philippines, the Japanese Navy, under the command of the Combined Fleet, annihilated the enemy U.S. Navy. In the third stage, the enemy suffered heavy losses, including 15 battleships, over 50 aircraft carriers, over 300 other ships of various sizes, and over 1,000 aircraft. The magnificent results were achieved by the heroic kamikaze special attack units, who conducted suicide attacks with their aircraft. It is noteworthy that the Japanese Combined Fleet, which had been built up in secret for years after the Washington Naval Treaty, appeared off the eastern coast of the Philippines and struck a blow to the enemy U.S. fleet. The battles on November 25th and 26th were particularly fierce, and the enemy U.S. Navy in the Pacific was seen fleeing at the sight of the Japanese forces. General King of the enemy U.S. praised the Japanese forces for their courage in the face of extreme difficulty, which shows the enemy's own difficulties and heavy losses. They have lost five aircraft carriers, leaving them with only ten, so they are no longer capable of naval operations. This decisive battle is now in its final stage, and the enemy's plans are unlikely to succeed.

　　Enemy U.S. Attempts to Cover Up Defeats
　　Initially, the enemy launched a fierce attack on Leyte Gulf with three divisions and a desperate invasion with transport convoys. To date, they have landed ten divisions, which shows the heavy losses suffered by the enemy U.S. and the intensity of the battles between Japan and the U.S. In the current situation in that area, the Japanese forces still control the sea and air, and are launching annihilation campaigns on land. The enemy U.S. is attempting to cover up their defeats. President Roosevelt is vague about the Pacific campaign, which shows the difficulties the enemy U.S. is facing. In the wake of their defeats, the only base tactic the enemy U.S. has is to bomb the Japanese mainland and Shanghai in order to undermine the Japanese military's morale and agitate the people of Shanghai, which is not worth taking seriously. The enemy is resorting to any means because they have achieved nothing on the battlefield, so they will likely engage in more foolish actions in the future, especially in the Pacific and on the mainland. It is worth noting that the U.S. military's purpose in invading the Philippines was to transport large numbers of troops to China in the first place to turn Chongqing into a battlefield and harm innocent Chinese civilians, and to cut off Japan's mainland from its southern resource areas. However, the enemy U.S.'s plans have failed. With the fall of Guilin and Liuzhou, the enemy U.S.'s air bases in Chongqing have been completely destroyed, and they have been unable to cut off Japan's mainland from its southern resource areas. In the past, the enemy planes and submarines bombed indiscriminately in the South China Sea, and their bases were in Guilin and Liuzhou. The successes of submarine activities were also achieved there. Now, the loss of Guilin and Liuzhou has dealt a fatal blow to the enemy.

　　Actually Interfering in Chongqing's Internal Affairs
　　In the future, the enemy will be unable to act on the mainland, except to attempt to use B-29 long-range bombers. They will also use political strategies to incite disturbances in Chongqing. For example, Nelson's visit to Chongqing was intended to resolve the diplomatic tension between Chongqing and the U.S. after Stilwell's unhappy return to the U.S., and to plan future operations. In addition, they are pretending to increase Chongqing's production, but in reality, they are interfering in Chongqing's internal affairs and seizing control of U.S. power in Chongqing. Ultimately, the Chongqing regime will be manipulated by the U.S. Song Ziwen's statement in the U.S., at the last time, that China would not allow foreign interference in Chongqing's internal affairs at any time, shows that Chongqing's internal affairs are being suppressed and encroached upon. Even the U.S.'s establishment of a wartime production bureau in Chongqing must have the following four conditions: (1) capital, (2) labor, (3) production facilities, and (4) transportation. Except for labor, the remaining three are all in Japan's hands. Even production facilities must rely on the U.S. How can Chongqing's combat power be replenished? Even if it is transported from India via the Himalayas, the total amount is only over 20,000 tons, which is only one-tenth of what Chongqing needs. According to a Chongqing dispatch on the 29th, the Propaganda Department, fearing Liang Han Cao, made a statement to the press: The Chongqing government has a deep understanding of the current situation in China and is confident of final victory. China must also be strengthened in the world war, and the U.S. is also very concerned about China's mainland operations. However, material assistance will surely be realized in the future, and the U.S.'s military agreement with Chongqing can also be strengthened. This shows that in the past, the U.S.'s material assistance to Chongqing has not been realized at all.

　　Japanese Forces Wipe Out British and Americans
　　In the current mainland operation, Japan is not targeting China, but is wiping out the British and American forces in Chongqing. The Chongqing side relies on British and American military assistance, but it is not satisfied and is willing to be enslaved by the British and Americans, causing the people to suffer needlessly. Japan has never stopped planning to assist China, and the 450 million Chinese people also hope that full peace will come soon. Regarding the European war situation, the mistakes and complications of the British, American, and Soviet Union mean that when the situation comes to an end, the British and Soviet Union will not send a single troop to the Pacific to help. Therefore, Japan will not stop until the final victory, no matter how the situation changes in the future. At the same time, we have the cooperation of the allied Chinese people, and we will advance together towards the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War with the spirit of living and dying together. The enemy is resorting to all kinds of divisive tactics, such as air raids and spreading rumors, in order to stimulate prices. This absurd rumor is no more than deceiving children. At this time when China and Japan are fighting side by side in unity, this rumor will be dispelled by itself, and we firmly believe that final victory will belong to us. We hope that in the future, we will maintain a sincere and united spirit to save China, achieve genuine and complete peace, and complete the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.

### Enemy U.S. Operational Situation Has Fallen Into Disarray
　　Minister Izubuchi's Congratulatory Speech at Joint Exercises
　　Minister Izubuchi, the press officer of the allied Japanese Army in Shanghai, gave the following speech at the second Shanghai citizens' rally to celebrate the elimination of the enemy British and Americans:

　　Clearing Out Enemy U.S. Forces in China
　　The purpose of the current operation by our forces in Hunan and Guangxi, as stated by the Imperial Government and the operational forces at the beginning, is to thoroughly destroy the U.S. forces in China and leave not a single soldier on the Chinese mainland. Because we recently occupied Guilin, Liuzhou, and Nanning, and destroyed the many air bases built by the enemy U.S. Air Force in southwestern China to the greatest extent, it can be said that one of the purposes of this operation has been completed. Of course, this does not mean that the operational mission has ended. The enemy U.S. Air Force attempted to carry out encirclement bombing of Japan from the Chinese mainland, and to import aircraft into China to seek air bases in China. They first chose the southwest and southeast regions centered on Guilin and Hengyang. This area is the most appropriate location for spying on our mainland and for coordinating with Pacific operations. The enemy first chose this area, with Guilin and Hengyang as the core, and cleverly deployed many air bases. Thus, they brazenly called it an air fortress. However, the fall of Guilin, Liuzhou, and Nanning revealed that the enemy's boasted mainland air fortress was so fragile that it collapsed. This huge military failure cannot be denied by anyone. If we conclude from this that the U.S. military has retreated from the mainland, this is naturally an impermissible mistake. We can imagine that if they lose the first air base, they will seek the second and third bases and desperately hold on to them. Therefore, our operational forces will not stop pursuing the enemy as long as a single U.S. soldier remains on the mainland.

　　Chongqing Regime Leads Wolves into the House
　　The purpose of this operation, as mentioned earlier, is to clear out the enemy U.S. forces on the Chinese mainland. However, our current major enemy is the Chongqing army, and the battlefield is still Chinese territory. This is an unavoidable thing in the current stage of the war, and it is also a heartbreaking thing. If the Chongqing regime had not led wolves into the house by introducing the enemy U.S. forces into the Chinese mainland, perhaps this operation would not have been necessary. At the same time, if the Chongqing army had not assisted the U.S. military, had not defended its air bases, and had not resisted our Imperial Army, it would not have suffered this disastrous defeat, nor would it have sacrificed countless innocent soldiers. But what has put the Chongqing army in such a tragic situation is really due to the cunning British and American conspiracies to sacrifice other nations and races and carry out their war plans. For example, Britain often drives Indian or African soldiers to the front line to fight, and the U.S. drives Filipinos to fight in the Philippines. On the Chinese mainland, the U.S. drives the Chongqing army to fight against our Imperial Army and allows them to bleed and sacrifice. This is really a cunning British and American conspiracy to fool and sacrifice the Chongqing army. We have only feelings of hatred and pity for Chongqing, but if Chongqing continues to assist the enemy U.S. forces in resisting the Imperial Army, our army can only reluctantly strike them.

　　Brutal Aggression, Reckless Bombing
　　However, after recovering from the pain, what makes people's hair stand on end is that innocent people have suffered from the war, lost their homes, and lost their lives because of this operation. Our army, which regards the U.S. military as its only enemy, originally does not hate innocent people, but tries its best to protect them. Sometimes we even endure operational disadvantages and try not to destroy the lives and property of residents. But contrary to the benevolent policies of our Imperial Army, the Chongqing regime specializes in destroying cities, massacring people, and burning property. The U.S. Air Force, which they consider an ally, has recklessly bombed and destroyed cities such as Changsha and Hengyang, exceeding the necessary limits of enemy U.S. operations. This kind of tyranny is truly intolerable. Yesterday, the cities that were still under the control of the Chongqing regime were operating diligently, seeking prosperity and development. Once they fall into the hands of the Japanese army, they are bombed desperately without hesitation the next day, wishing to completely bomb them into flat ground. In their eyes, Chinese culture and the lives and property of Chinese people are not worth considering at all. When we see their brutal situation, we cannot imagine that it is what people do to people. Then why do they dare to do such brutal things? In short, they believe that Chinese territory, people, and the entire Greater East Asia are nothing more than targets of their aggression. So they have no heart to respect Chinese culture, and they know nothing of human love other than enslaving and exploiting people.

　　They see that their own situation is becoming more and more unfavorable, and they are losing every battle, so their brutality is becoming more and more intense. Recently, when the enemy U.S. Air Force appeared over Shanghai, they blindly bombed residential areas and machine-gunned pedestrians on the road, massacring a large number of innocent citizens and destroying the peaceful life of the citizens. These are all self-destructive behaviors that they have made because they have been defeated everywhere, and they are also strategic psychological warfare tactics to cover up their military failures.

　　The Activity of the Special Attack Force
　　Looking at the overall situation of the Greater East Asia War, in coordination with the operation to crush the U.S. forces on the mainland, and in the Pacific, following the great victories off Taiwan, and in the Philippines, due to the activity of our kamikaze special attack forces and the army special attack forces, the war results are gradually expanding. Currently, the enemy U.S. Pacific Fleet has lost most of its military strength. The U.S. military under the command of General MacArthur, who landed on Leyte Island and wanted to recover the Philippines in one fell swoop, is currently in a desperate situation. Under the fierce attack of our air and land forces, in order to rescue this group of soldiers who are lingering, dying, and injured, transport convoys are flocking to Leyte Gulf, and one by one they have become the best targets for our torpedo squadrons and special attack squadrons to bomb, and they are all buried in the bottom of the sea.

　　Looking at the above-mentioned overall situation of the Greater East Asia War, if we describe the enemy's strategic situation as a human body, then the general counter-offensive in the Pacific is the right hand, and the mainland invasion force is the left hand, and they want to strangle Japan with these two hands. But the right hand in the Pacific has been cut off its fingers by our Imperial Army and has lost the function of the hand. The left hand on the mainland has been completely broken and has become a useless object. Now the enemy U.S.'s strategic situation has fallen into disarray and is incurable. In the face of our inevitable victory, they are only walking on thin ice, like facing a deep abyss, and have become startled birds and exposed fish.

　　As announced by the Japanese General Headquarters at 3 p.m. today, the Japanese Army's special attack unit, the Yasukuni Corps, attacked the enemy fleet in Leyte Gulf, sinking one battleship, three transport ships, and destroying one battleship and one cruiser each, causing them to catch fire and burn.

　　The final decisive battle is getting closer and closer. Our army will expel the enemy British and Americans from the Chinese mainland? from the entire Greater East Asia without leaving a single soldier, until they are unable to invade the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere again. Even if we fight for a hundred years, we will not hesitate. Our 100 million people have the same determination as the soldiers on the front line, and we also deeply know the spirit of the special attack forces active on the front line of the Philippines, and we will charge into battle with the spirit of 100 million suicide squads and defeat the British and Americans. As for the allied China, we earnestly hope that every compatriot will enthusiastically assist the Greater East Asia War and achieve the final goal.

### Grand Occasion of Rally to Eliminate Enemy British and Americans, Japanese Military Authorities Attend and Give Speeches
　　The Shanghai News Federation, China Film Company, Federation of Industry and Commerce, Citizens' Welfare Association, National Diplomacy Promotion Association, and other groups, in view of the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, the allied Japanese army exerting its divine power, giving the enemy British and Americans a fatal blow, repeatedly winning battles, and laying the foundation for inevitable victory, specially organized the second citizens' rally to celebrate the elimination of the enemy British and Americans. It was held at the Majestic Theater on Jiangning Road yesterday (30th) at 6:30 p.m., and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. The chairpersons of the rally were Kuniosaka Yoichi, Kawakita Nagamasa, Wen Lanting, Funatsu Tatsuichiro, Lin Kanghou, Feng Jie, Moriyama Takashi, Xu Liqiu (representing Yang Huilang), Jin Xiongbo, Chen Riping, Huang Jingqi, Yuan Shu, and Lu Feng. The general secretary was Ren Lingpeng. First, Lu Feng, the representative of the presidium, gave a speech. Then, Minister Matsushima of the Fleet Press Department, Minister Izubuchi of the Army Press Department (speeches see page 2), Minister Matsudaira of the Information Department, Captain Hida, Lieutenant Nakagawa, and Chen Binsu, a standing member of the Municipal Advisory Committee (speech see page 4), gave speeches on the recent war situation and the knowledge that the people should have. Finally, a current affairs film, "The Naval Battle of the Philippines: The Departure of the Kamikaze Special Attack Force," and a new film from Huaying, "Remnants of Spring on the River," were shown. The rally ended at 8:30 p.m.

　　Lu Feng, the representative of the presidium, said in his speech, "The main significance of the joint holding of the second citizens' victory celebration by various groups today is to enable citizens to understand the development of the current situation and strengthen their belief in the victory of the Greater East Asia War. In the past month, the decisive situation of the Greater East Asia War has developed to the highest stage. In the Pacific, the enemy British and Americans' attacks on Leyte in the Philippines have been repeatedly defeated, especially the brave attacks of the Japanese special attack forces, which have achieved brilliant results. On the Chinese mainland, the Japanese army has successively captured Guilin, Liuzhou, and Nanning, and is continuing to advance towards Guiyang. The enemy British and Americans' air bases on the Chinese mainland are almost completely destroyed. At this stage of successive victories in the war, our hope and efforts should be to prompt Chongqing, which is attached to the British and Americans, to wake up from its dream immediately, to realize full peace immediately, and to unite Chinese forces to cooperate with the allies and jointly shoulder the sacred hope of 'East Asians defending East Asia.'"

### Minister Tsuchida's First Broadcast to Japanese Residents in Central China, Striving to Practice Wartime Structure
　　After taking office, Minister Tsuchida, the allied Plenipotentiary Minister to Shanghai, broadcast to Japanese residents in Central China for the first time. His speech is as follows:

　　Completing the War
　　On the occasion of the third anniversary of the Imperial Rescript declaring war, I would like to briefly describe my thoughts on being appointed to this new position to the Japanese residents in Central China. The Imperial tradition of world policy is to first ensure the stability of East Asia, and then seek for all nations in the world to obtain their own place, support each other, base their international justice, and establish world peace. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration of November 6th of last year is based on this spirit, and expresses the common beliefs and determination of the countries of Greater East Asia. On the occasion of the first anniversary of this declaration, the Imperial Government will reaffirm its commitment to building a world order of civil administration, progress, and prosperity based on the spirit of this declaration, eliminating all aggression, threats, monopoly, and exploitation, and respecting the independence and characteristics of all countries. The Greater East Asia War was started because the Japanese Empire was forced to fight due to the unethical oppression of the British and Americans, and for the sake of national defense and self-preservation. At the same time, based on the Imperial tradition of world policy, we have liberated the nations of Greater East Asia from the colonial domination of the British and Americans, and have spared no sacrifice in the war. The countries of Greater East Asia are actively supporting the Japanese Empire in completing the war with a sense of common destiny and solidarity in the alliance. Regarding the relationship between China and Japan, since China entered the war on January 9th of last year, China and Japan have been comrades-in-arms who live and die together, and are truly the main force in carrying out the Greater East Asia War. They have also concluded the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty to establish a permanent friendly relationship between the two countries. However, it is most unfortunate that the leader of China, Chairman Wang Jingwei, passed away on November 10th of this year. The Chinese National Government still inherited his will and issued the following statement: "We vow to lead the military and civilians of the entire country to inherit his will, no matter how difficult, to cooperate with the allies and all friendly nations, to complete the war, and to strive to achieve China's equality and Asia's independence and liberation." I express my deep respect for the Chinese National Government's determination.

　　Decisive Battle Period
　　At the current stage of the Greater East Asia War, which has lasted for three years, the enemy American counteroffensive operation has been underway for one year, and we have entered the decisive battle period. The large-scale victories that have shocked the world off the eastern coast of Taiwan and the coast of the Philippines have opened the prelude to the decisive battle. In Leyte Gulf, Japan has achieved unprecedented large-scale victories, and the loyal and brave kamikaze special attack forces, unseen in ancient and modern times, have appeared, causing the enemy forces to tremble with fear. This pure loyalty and great virtue will be remembered for all time. In addition, on the Chinese mainland front, Liuzhou and Guilin have fallen one after another, and the southern Chinese bases of the US Air Force in China have been completely destroyed, completing the great operation to cut off the Chinese mainland. Furthermore, the foundation of the war has been established firmly and unshakably. The main force of the enemy's Pacific Fleet has already been destroyed, and the enemy's air bases in China have also been destroyed. The enemy, boasting of its abundant resources, will surely reorganize its forces and attempt a second and third counterattack. We must take advantage of this momentum, gather the total strength of Greater East Asia, and increase our combat power in order to achieve final victory. The ultimate outcome of this war depends on the strength of our will to fight and the strength of our decisive battle system. Therefore, we must make continuous efforts with a renewed determination to achieve the sacred goal of national defense and East Asian prosperity. The wartime consciousness and wartime structure of the Japanese residents currently residing in Central China are regrettable compared to those in Japan. However, I am pleased to see that you have recently been working hard to accelerate the realization of the wartime structure. The Japanese residents in China are promoters of friendship and goodwill between the peoples of Japan and China. They should reflect the image of a bright and cheerful great nation in the eyes of the Chinese, deepen the Chinese's trust in Japan, and ensure their cooperation with a large and friendly national demeanor. Japanese residents in China must thoroughly implement the spirit of the Alliance Treaty, and each Japanese resident must be based on this awareness, with unity and gathering of total strength as the foundation, and open up the path of Sino-Japanese friendship and war power. Strengthening the path to victory requires Japanese residents in China to embody the spirit of the Great Decree and express their devotion to public service. At this time, it is even more appropriate to elaborate on the main points of the local measures.

　　Working Together
　　The first is to increase combat power. In the Central China region, we must obtain national defense resources, and military officers and civilians must work together to overcome difficulties and seek rationalization of operations. Especially with regard to strengthening transportation, we must eliminate transportation obstacles and vigorously develop the spirit of standing up and serving the wartime transportation. In order to increase combat power, enterprises must also gradually strengthen and should use your strengths. You must be aware of being rear-line soldiers and take pride in increasing combat power, stand up and serve the public, and engage in the work of increasing production and increasing transportation. The second is to maintain and develop the economy of Central China. The current economy of Central China, especially in terms of industry and transportation, is in a state of stagnation, and we must make special efforts. Industry operators must do their utmost to cooperate in completing the decisive battle of operations. In order to enhance combat power, not only military officers and various agencies, but also national policy companies and private companies, must cooperate closely with the military, promote the Yamato spirit, and deal with it decisively in order to achieve the highest degree of success. The speculation, hoarding, and raising of prices that hinder the smooth operation of the Central China economy must be resolutely banned. The Chinese side has worked hard to implement it, and we must also work hard, and Japanese residents in China must never engage in such behavior. Finally, I hope that Japanese residents will strengthen their individual decisive battle lives, and should never tend to loosen up due to recent price issues, but will implement the same decisive battle life as their compatriots in Japan, and join hands with Chinese allies to achieve final victory. I hope that you will be ready to face the situation and move forward also.

### Following Chairman's Last Wish
　　A Letter to the People from the Chinese Nationalist Party
　　Nation-building must have peace
　　Counteroffensive is the priority
　　Since the peace movement started, it is known that "there is no nation-building without peace, and no peace without anti-communism." The declaration of the Sixth National Congress of our party severely condemned the "strategic line of the Chinese Communist Party," which used resistance to expand its strength, overthrow the government, artificially communize, obstruct Sino-Japanese peace, and act as an internal traitor for Soviet plots. Today, even those who have repeatedly tolerated the communists in the past have reached a point where they can no longer tolerate them. And those who proudly think they can hold the Communist Party hostage will also realize that they will ultimately not be tolerated by the Communist Party and will deeply regret that they were actually fooled by the Communist Party, falling into their deadly trap of defeating them one by one and peeling them layer by layer. The "full text of the CCP's resolution" openly and wantonly insults and scolds its so-called right-wingers. For its so-called left-wingers, it personally praised them, but secretly despised them, which is even more vicious and sinister than the "strategic line of the Chinese Communist Party." And the so-called "using war to deal with war" is already an open secret. This kind of plan is not so much a strategy as it is a political conspiracy. During the paper war, the external war will not have ended and the internal war will have already begun, so how can the so-called resistance camp stand it? After the paper war, the external war will have just ended and the internal war will follow, so how can we take care of the aftermath after being devastated and falling back into a situation of division and disintegration? How can we not feel chilled when we think of this? This is the story of our chairman leading the anti-communist struggle after the death of the premier. This is what all our comrades and compatriots should inherit and carry through to the end.
　　The struggle in the second half of the national revolution is directly focused on seeking freedom and equality for China. The more intense the revolution progresses, the more severe the counter-revolution will be. The more careful and firm our response must be. Looking back at the past twenty years, the strategies of the imperialists against us can be roughly divided into four periods: The first period was a frontal attack, trying to frustrate the budding of revolutionary forces and prevent them from developing and growing. The demonstration of warships in Bai'etan, Guangzhou in the winter of the twelfth year, and the mutiny of the merchant corps in the autumn of the thirteenth year, started the beginning. The May 30th Massacre in Shanghai in the fourteenth year, followed by the June 23rd Massacre in Guangzhou, ran rampant. However, the imperialists' cruel and ferocious violence was unable to resist the torrent of the revolutionary masses, and they listened to their commands in order to obstruct the corrupt forces of the revolution. In front of the revolutionary masses, they finally collapsed and fell apart one by one. The recovery of the Hankou Concession in the spring of the sixteenth year was an example of the imperialists' failure in this period. The second period was a lateral incitement. After the failure of the initial seven attacks, the imperialists knew that the radical progress of the revolution could not be contained, so they had to strategically retreat, change their appearance, and implement their cunning plan of drawing firewood from under the pot. At first, they split the revolutionary camp in order to soften the people's fighting spirit. Then, they shifted the target of the struggle in order to create opportunities for manipulation. During this period, the most unfortunate thing was the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations. The May 3rd Jinan Incident, the September 18th Incident, the January 28th War, and the battles at various passes of the Great Wall all occurred at this time. All of these gave the imperialists an opportunity to take advantage of. We cannot say that the imperialists' incitement and temptation did not contribute to their evil cause. (To be continued)

### Economic Authorities Strictly Prohibit Rumors and Incitement of Prices
　　Determined to Punish According to Law

### The Japanese Army Completely Occupies Nandan Airfield; Chongqing-US Air Force Suffers a Major Blow

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - Since capturing Hechi on the 23rd, the Japanese army has continued to pursue the remnants of the Chongqing army. On the 28th at 10:00 AM, they completely occupied Nandan, the last stronghold in Guangxi Province, and its airfield, capturing machine guns, tanks, and other military supplies.

Guangxi Frontline, 30th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing army in Nandan, a strategic point in the border region of Guizhou and Guangxi provinces, mobilized instructors and students from the Dushan branch of the Central Military Academy a month ago. They forced civilians to construct over ten miles of fortified trench positions along the Southwest Highway, deploying elite Hu Zongnan troops and several divisions of the Central Direct Lineage Army. They cooperated with the Chongqing-based US Air Force in an attempt to mount a stubborn resistance, but they were violently assaulted by the Japanese army and fled in disarray.

South China Frontline Base, 30th (Central News Agency) - The elite Japanese forces in South China captured Nanning, a Chongqing-US Air Force base, on the 24th. On the 28th, they occupied the Nandan airfield in northern Guangxi Province. With the exception of the Baise airfield, all US Air Force bases in the province have collapsed. The Baise airfield, located in the border region of Yunnan and Guangxi provinces, and Nanning were both forward bases for the Chongqing-US forces. After the Japanese army occupied Guilin, Liuzhou, and secured Nanning and Nandan, its importance has been completely lost, greatly hindering the US Air Force's future attempts to launch counterattacks from Baise.

Japanese Air Force Attacks Yunnan Airfields

Burma Frontline Base, 30th (Central News Agency) - On the Burmese front, the Japanese Air Force attacked the Yunanyi Nan airfield, an important stronghold of the Chongqing army along the India-Chongqing air route, on the night of the 28th. Braving the Chongqing army's anti-aircraft fire, they dropped several bombs, causing four large and four small aircraft stationed at the airfield to catch fire. Three large and five small aircraft were destroyed. Furthermore, they inflicted damage on ground facilities. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.

### War Situation on the Western Front and in Hungary

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) - According to the Overseas Chinese News Agency: A German military spokesperson stated: Although the American and French tank forces in Alsace have struggled to break through in a pincer formation, they have not yet converged, so they have not been able to complete the encirclement. The German army is separately engaging the leading edges of the enemy's two pincers near Strasbourg and Mulhouse to prevent them from converging. The German forces on the Vosges front are still able to move freely in the rear. Although the battle of Alsace is a mobile war, the situation lacks change. In Lorraine, the German forces are moving closer to the Saar, which is within the Siegfried Line, while the battles of Lorraine and Alsace are still being fought in front of the Siegfried Line. There has been little change in the Battle of Aachen on the thirteenth day. Although the American army has deployed vast manpower and resources, there has been no large-scale development in the Aachen-Julich-Stolberg area.

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) - Overseas Chinese News Agency reports: A German military spokesman pointed out yesterday that the Soviet army's advance to Fonfokschen City, 150 kilometers south of Hungary, is a very insidious action. The purpose of the Soviet army's advance is either to bypass both sides of the Danube and probe into Hungary, or to directly approach Plattensee City. In any case, this action carries a serious risk, as they hope to achieve a quick victory and end the Hungarian war before a large contingent of German troops can withdraw from the Balkans.
