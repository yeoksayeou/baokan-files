### Reputation First

There is a common saying, "Don't worry about people not knowing, unless you yourself do something." It means that any secret matter, though subjectively you may think no one knows, will eventually be discovered by people after it is done. Therefore, only by not doing it in the first place will it not be discovered. However, the "doing something" mentioned here, that will always be discovered, does not only refer to bad things. Of course, it also includes good things. Doing good deeds, even if one does not want to be known, will earn people's respect when discovered. Conversely, doing bad things, even if one wants to hide them, will earn people's contempt when discovered. The former enhances one's reputation, while the latter ruins it. Which to abandon and which to follow, we believe everyone has the reason to choose. However, people often overestimate "secrecy," do things that are contemptible, and end up ruining their reputation. This single difference in thought has ruined the reputation of so many people; one must be cautious.

"Corruption" is a disgraceful thing. We can assert that even those who commit corrupt acts understand that they are doing something disgraceful, and they regret it. However, if we further analyze the motivation for corruption, part of it is based on the pressure of life. Although they know that corruption is bad, they cannot resist the pressure of life and take the risk of corruption. This kind of corruption can be said to be "corruption for the sake of life." There is also a part that does not have any problems with life at all, but knowingly engages in corruption. This kind of corruption can be said to be "corruption for the sake of corruption." Compared with each other, they are certainly both disgraceful corruption, but there are some differences in their motivations. Therefore, there are also some differences in the loss of reputation.

Secondly, pursuing speculative profits is also a disgraceful thing. Compared with corruption, it seems to be slightly better objectively. In fact, those who pursue speculative profits inevitably resort to unscrupulous means, disregard the public, harm others for their own benefit, and only seek private gain. Their intention of harming others for their own benefit is no different from that of corruption. Therefore, we can say that profiteers and corrupt people are all destroyers of reputation. If one must measure which is higher or lower, it is simply a matter of fifty steps versus one hundred steps.

For example, Gu Shiheng and Zhou Naiwen, as ministers and vice-ministers, willingly engage in corruption. They did not initially know that it was a disgraceful thing, but mistakenly thought it was secret, and mistakenly believed that their position could cover up everything. After the case was exposed, when Gu's residence was searched, it was said that more than thirty women's fur coats were found. From this, it can be predicted that in the place of wealth, the motivation for corruption is definitely not the pressure of life, but corruption for the sake of corruption. Once they become prisoners, how can they not ruin their reputation?

Also, in the current economic circles of Shanghai, it must be admitted that many people pursue speculative profits unscrupulously, only seeking private gain. As a result, legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises are stagnated and not on track, gradually leading the entire economy to collapse. The profiteers themselves may think that there is nothing disgraceful about this. However, this is completely an illusion. As mentioned earlier, their intention is to harm others for their own benefit, which is indeed as disgraceful as corruption.

Life should regard reputation as the most important thing. The overturned cart ahead is a lesson not far away. We hope that senior government officials and the upper class in Shanghai's economic circles will cherish and value their reputation, especially in this decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, in this time of national survival, think more about the national economy and the people's livelihood, think more about the public interest, and not engage in corruption or speculative profits.

### A Scene from the Air Battle in Northern Burma - Enemy Super-Heavy Bomber Shot Down -

On April 26th, the Japanese Air Force shot down an enemy's new type of super-heavy bomber in the mountains of Northern Burma for the first time. The following is a discussion of the fierce battle by Japanese Air Force soldiers who participated in the battle.

Captain Enbe led a plane patrolling at an altitude of about 4,500 meters above the battlefield on this day. Around 12:00, while flying over Bankamba (30 kilometers northeast of Imphal), Lieutenant Kimura, the comrade of Captain Kurosawa, suddenly sent a signal that an enemy plane had been discovered. Looking over, a huge four-engine bomber was flying from the direction of Dunskiya or Digbo about 500 meters above and to the right of the formation, escorted by two fighter planes.

It was a Douglas aircraft. They immediately attacked it together. The escorting fighter planes immediately turned around and fled westward. The remaining large plane increased its speed and tried to escape in its original direction. The Japanese plane pursued closely, and when it reached the airspace of the Arakan Mountains, Captain Nakamura fired the first shot. At this time, the distance was only twenty or thirty meters. The enemy plane fired back wildly from its belly and tail. Captain Nakamura was hit by several bullets fired from the machine guns at the rear of the enemy plane and could only disengage. The enemy is now escaping along the China-India air route all the way to China. Next, Lieutenant Sumino fiercely fired from the front of the enemy, but the fuel had been almost exhausted during the previous patrol. Therefore, they divided into two teams, Captain Kurosawa's team circled to the front, and the rest attacked from the front and rear. All the bullets hit, but the enemy's armor was so thick that, although various parts were riddled with bullets, it continued to fly horizontally at its original altitude as if nothing had happened. It was forced for 450 kilometers from Bankamba and was almost near Fort Hertz in northern Burma. The enemy began to falter, and its massive body gradually became unstable. Lieutenant Sumino added the final blow, and finally black smoke began to billow out, and the inner right engine stopped. The black smoke gradually thickened, and the massive body swayed and fell. At that time, the fuel of each aircraft was almost exhausted, and the engines were burning hot. The entire team then triumphantly returned to base. (Sho; translated from the Asahi Shimbun, May 2)

### Japanese Army Air Force Attacks Ramu Airfield and Bombards Enemy Artillery Positions

Rangoon, 11th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Air Force in Burma, in coordination with ground troops, has continued to attack the enemy for days. On the morning of the 10th, they attacked an enemy artillery position in a certain area again. Braving fierce defensive artillery fire, they continuously dropped heavy bombs, causing two fires in the enemy position. Two or three enemy tanks assisting in the battle were also damaged.

### Epidemic Spreading in Nanjing

It has not yet been confirmed what kind of pathogen it is. Patients have headaches and high fevers. Several members of a family become ill at the same time, which proves that the disease is an infectious disease. The Central Hospital has been constantly admitting patients with the disease for treatment. However, except for fever and headache, there have been no deaths as of the 11th. It is said that the disease is transmitted by unclean fish.

### Japanese Army Detachment Approaching Luoyang, Expanding Results in the South of the City

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army on the Henan front is still making smooth progress. According to a Chongqing dispatch from the United Press on the 10th, a detachment of the Japanese army, echoing the Japanese army approaching the outskirts of Luoyang, is expanding its results in the southern area of the city.

Deteriorating Friction Between Chongqing and the Communists

Xinzheng, 11th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from the front line in Henan on the 11th reports that since the Chongqing army and the Communist army called for a general summer counter-offensive, they have been actively expanding their military preparations. According to reports from prisoners of war here, the 14th Army of Henan moved to Shaanxi on March 17 under orders to blockade the Communist Party. At the same time, the Communist army, under the pretext of a general counter-offensive against Japan, is vigorously building Chen areas in the south of Yan'an and plans to use northern Shanxi, the northern corner of Shaanxi, and the new Yellow River as the last line of resistance in case of failure in operations against Chongqing. Also, the Communist Party seems to be building positions in the western part of the Northwest Military Region. The so-called general counter-offensive against Japan is just a signboard for Chongqing and the Communist Party to strengthen their own forces.

Regarding conscription, it has been implemented simultaneously on both sides since last year, but the results have been quite poor. Even the quality of the soldiers used for the general counter-offensive is very low. Cai Jianming, commander of the 4th Division of the 13th Army of the Chiang system, once had a dream of thorough training and ordered his subordinates to not slacken in the training of soldiers this spring. Another major difficulty in the expansion of the army is the lack of soldiers' salaries and ammunition. The First War Zone once tried to deduct 20% of the soldiers' salaries, claiming it was for a counter-offensive fund, and ordered the return of two-thirds of the existing ammunition for the purpose of the general counter-offensive. It is conceivable that the general counter-offensive is used to cover up the expansion of military preparations and the shortage of materials. In addition, the four major banks in Luoyang—Central, China, Farmers, and Siming—have all been ordered to move to Xi'an due to the plan for the general counter-offensive. It has also been decided that various economic-related agencies will also gradually begin to move. This improper measure of retreating before the battle will only lower the morale of the people resisting the war.

Chongqing Has Not Recognized the Japanese Army's Intentions

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army suddenly launched an offensive in Henan Province, Chongqing fundamentally failed to recognize the Japanese army's intentions. According to a Reuters dispatch, Liang Hancao, Minister of Propaganda of Chongqing, stated when meeting with foreign reporters on the 3rd that the Japanese army's move was an attempt to open up the Pinghan Railway. Therefore, the military authorities observed that Luoyang was not the target of the Japanese army. Although the strength of the Chongqing army was not as good as that of the Japanese army, its intelligence was superior to that of the Japanese army, and it was believed that the Japanese army could be repelled. However, as the Japanese army's operations progressed smoothly, Chongqing was shaken. According to a United Press dispatch, Zhang Pingqun, counselor of the Chongqing Executive Yuan, told reporters on the 10th that he hoped that the United Kingdom and the United States would urgently rescue the Chongqing army. According to a dispatch from the Chongqing visitor of the Christian Science Monitor on the 7th, after the collapse of the First War Zone in Chongqing, the Japanese army had begun to advance westward from the Longhai Railway. From a strategic point of view, it was also keenly felt that the Chongqing government urgently needed to be reorganized. The Daily Telegraph on the 9th also wrote an article saying that the Japanese army's operations in Henan Province were progressing very rapidly. In the past three weeks, the Japanese army had advanced a total of more than 300 kilometers in various directions. Although it has not yet been determined whether the Japanese army is aiming at Xi'an, it has been confirmed that the Japanese army intends to use similar blitzkrieg tactics in the Chinese battle line. The current offensive of the Japanese army in Henan Province is fundamentally different from the operations launched by the Japanese army in the spring and autumn seasons of the past four or five years to reconnoiter the military situation of the Chongqing army and ensure resources. It cannot be compared with the battle of Changsha, because the Changsha area is either hilly or swampy and is not suitable for the use of modern weapons.

Judging from the current reality, the U.S. Air Force cannot hold airfields near the battlefield, so it cannot cooperate with the ground forces of the Chongqing army during actual combat. The Japanese army's offensive this time was something that the military authorities of Chongqing and foreign military authorities did not dream of. It also caused great shock within the Chongqing authorities. Sun Ke's recent speech in the Chongqing Legislative Yuan and the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in Xi'an are a manifestation of Chongqing's desperation.

Henan Province is the famous Central Plain in Eastern history, and the Japanese and Chongqing armies can gather a lot of weapons here. Therefore, the combat power of the Japanese and Chongqing armies can be clearly understood by observing the progress of this operation. The Japanese army has widely used mechanized forces and is advancing from the Pinghan Railway to Luoyang, making full use of the firepower and maneuverability of mechanical vehicles. In just 20 days, the Chongqing army between the Yellow River and Xinyang was completely wiped out in fact. Also, the New York Times Weekly has reprinted news from Chongqing as follows: Recently, the Japanese army seems to be trying to open up the Pinghan Railway, and the purpose of the Japanese army's attack on Luoyang this time is to protect the main force's operations from the side. It is still impossible to estimate whether the Japanese army will permanently occupy Luoyang this time. In addition, the Chongqing army's operational plan is also very unclear, because the spokesman for Chongqing only said that the Chongqing army did not want to fight along the railway line. However, the Japanese army's first adoption of German-style blitzkrieg made the Chongqing army, which was content with the status quo, panic.

### Abundant Resources in Burma Awaiting Cooperative Development: Advisor Ogawa Speaks in Osaka

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Ogawa Gotaro, Japanese economic advisor to the Burmese government, recently returned to the country to discuss important matters. He reported on the general situation of Burmese industry and economy at the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry Economic Council on the 9th as follows: Burma is a world-renowned country for rice, jute, chestnut trees, and mineral products. In particular, mineral resources such as lead, aluminum, tin, and tungsten are extremely rich in military supplies. Unfortunately, they have been hindered by British-Indian colonial policies and have not been developed. Therefore, it has not yet escaped the state of primitive industry. However, once it has technology and capital, it can be developed immediately. This is the uniqueness of Burma's industrial economy. What we should pay attention to now is that Burma is striving to make its industrial economy independent. Therefore, Japan's strengthening of trade relations with Burma and active export of technology and capital are what the people of Burma, including the head of the Bhamo administration, are eagerly hoping for. Naturally, in today's decisive battle, it is quite difficult, even impossible, to realize this due to transportation capacity. However, it is the duty of Japan, the leader of East Asia, to overcome these difficulties and guide and assist Burma's industrial economy to develop into complete independence. In addition, Burma feels that there is a great shortage of clothing, and it is necessary to be self-sufficient in local cotton. In addition, Burma is eager to import technology and capital from Japan, such as building wooden ships, dredging ports, strengthening land and water transportation and water conservancy power generation, and mining and oil production. There is a need for Japanese-Burmese cooperation in all aspects.

### German and American Aircraft Dogfight East of the Alps; Italian Front Quiet

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency, according to authoritative sources here, German aircraft intercepted American aircraft in the eastern Alps yesterday morning, and a fierce air battle occurred. The American aircraft suffered heavy losses, and the anti-aircraft artillery was also very active, shooting down several American four-engine bombers.

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency: The war situation on the Italian front is quiet. Whether the intensified activities of reconnaissance teams and commando teams in the south and Natuo are a prelude to a large-scale war is still unknown.

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: In the fierce air battle over the Alps yesterday, 42 American aircraft were shot down, including 35 bomber aircraft. The German fighter squadron cooperated with the air defense forces to launch a close-range attack on the aircraft squadron. Many American aircraft crashed into the mountains and were destroyed, and the personnel in the aircraft were killed. Some pilots who jumped from the aircraft were rescued by rescue teams.

### British Release of Gandhi Aimed at Suppressing Popular Sentiment: Section Chief Isono's Remarks

Tokyo, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch – Isono, Section Chief of the Third Section of the Cabinet Information Bureau's Foreign Reporting Department, met with the China-Manchukuo press corps on the afternoon of the 10th. He made the following remarks regarding the unconditional release of Gandhi by the Indian Governor-General's office: As the war situation on the India-Burma border intensifies, and anti-British sentiment among the Indian populace rises daily, with many Indians harboring goodwill towards the Provisional Government of India, and with numerous Indian soldiers successively joining the ranks of the National Army, the enemy, Britain, in a state of panic and helplessness, has unconditionally released Gandhi. We can further examine the motivation for this release and explain it in the following two points: First, the entire Indian populace views Gandhi as the savior of India and reveres him like a god. Gandhi is now old and frail. If he were to unexpectedly fall ill and die in prison, the entire Indian nation, in anger and resentment, would surely launch a punitive expedition against the enemy, Britain, to hold them accountable. Therefore, the enemy, Britain, fearing such an eventuality, has resorted to this strategy. Second, as the Japanese-Indian Allied Forces are now steadily approaching Delhi, the entire Indian populace is showing signs of wavering, and the number of those joining the Indian National Army is increasing daily. The enemy, Britain, to prevent any eventuality, has unconditionally released Gandhi in order to stop the wavering of the entire Indian populace.

### Agricultural Production Increase Committee Holds Symposium

Nanjing, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch – In order to launch agricultural production increase efforts within five kilometers along the railway lines, the Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan held a symposium this afternoon (11th) at 3:00 PM.

All funds will be allocated by the Central China Railway Company, and any shortfall will be discussed and raised separately. Regarding the production increase plan, the Ministry of Construction's Railway Protection Money Working Committee will invite relevant agencies to discuss and formulate it. The promotion of the work will be mainly based on the relevant agencies, and relevant parties will be invited to assist.

### Balkan Axis Powers Make Full Preparations; Major War on Southern Front Imminent

Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch – Since the German-Romanian forces withdrew from Sevastopol, the Eastern Front situation has entered a new stage. German military authorities on the 10th explained the points to be noted regarding the future war situation as follows: The main battlefield of the Eastern Front, stretching from the Gulf of Finland in the north to the Black Sea in the south, remains calm, but this state of affairs is unlikely to last. In the near future, the Soviet army has the possibility of launching an attack on German positions on the southern front. Comprehensive information from various sources indicates that the Soviet army will also launch offensives on fronts other than the southern front. From a strategic point of view, it is conceivable that the Soviet army is attempting to use the ports of Sevastopol and Odessa as bases for the Black Sea Fleet and Air Force to increase pressure on the Balkan countries. At the same time, it is also attempting to launch a major offensive from the eastern Carpathian Mountains towards the central part of the Balkans. Reuters Moscow correspondent reported that the Soviet command is currently targeting the Balkans. However, several divisions of German and other Axis forces in the Balkans have made full preparations. If the Soviet army launches an offensive against the Balkans, it must launch an unprecedented war.

Boat allocation measures include: Regarding boat allocation matters, the allocator should base on the decisive battle transportation, with the principle of public interest first, as the main purpose of implementation, which is to be handled by the China Central Inland River Private Boat General Association. The implementation of carrying boat allocation receipts: Starting from today, boat allocation receipts will be implemented for all private sailing boats in the Shanghai area. After implementation, those who do not carry boat allocation receipts will be prohibited from sailing. It is prohibited for cargo owners and boat owners to directly make agreements. For the transportation of military supplies and civilian supplies, no matter what the reason, each commercial firm must not directly make agreements with the boat owner, in order to avoid conflicts between cargo owners and boat owners. For the transportation of military supplies, the industry association will handle unified freight and boat tax in accordance with the boat charter contract, but if there are special circumstances for the cargo owner's variable side, the agreement must be understood and agreed by the Private Boat General Association.

### US Aid to Chongqing is Purely a Malicious Conspiracy: Spokesman for the Japanese Army Reporting Department Remarks

The spokesman for the Japanese Army Reporting Department stationed in Shanghai elucidated in detail on the recent political and economic trends between Chongqing and the United States at yesterday's regular reporting meeting. The details are recorded as follows:

Sacrificing Chongqing to Preserve Self

Zhang Pingqun, a consultant of the Chongqing Executive Yuan, acting as a government spokesman, raised the question to the press corps at the regular press conference held on the 26th of last month, namely, "The United States' aid to China has not been sufficient in the past two years, and there is no hope for a rapid increase in the future. Then, when will our 'resistance' continue?" He answered in an extremely somber tone, "When China initially decided to 'resist,' there were no Allied countries in existence. China was already fighting independently before there was any hope of external assistance." In this question and answer, we can understand that those who question the meaning of continuing the war of resistance are not only the people in our peace area, but also the people in the war zone. It is undeniable that the Chinese people and the government had a reliance on the future aid of Britain and the United States at the beginning of the war of resistance. As of today, the government has stated that there was no predetermined alliance with other countries at the beginning of the war of resistance, and it does not dream of external assistance. This statement is sufficient to show that the people have doubts about the aid from the United States, and the Chongqing government is very disappointed with the aid from the United States. The United States' aid to China has never been practically and actively shown in this incident. It was not until the Great East Asian War broke out and it repeatedly lost to Japan in the Pacific that it wanted to use the Chinese mainland as a base for attacking the Japanese mainland. The so-called aid to China, which was launched in various ways, was intended to sacrifice others and counterattack in order to survive when it was at the end of its rope. This conspiracy was only recently exposed by Chongqing. Wu Guozhen, the Foreign Minister of Chongqing, made a more profound mockery of this, saying that at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese incident, Britain and the United States underestimated our combat power and adopted a cold attitude. After the outbreak of the Great East Asian War and the Pearl Harbor debacle, they suddenly praised our resistance and won our hearts. This kind of mockery indicates that today's cooperation between China and the United States has reached the point of being outwardly united but inwardly divided. The United States, on the surface, wants to strengthen the anti-Axis front, but in its heart, it is eager to use the Chinese mainland as a battlefield to launch a counterattack against Japan. On the surface, Chongqing is perfunctory to the so-called "Allied countries," but in its heart, it deeply feels that the "Allied countries'" aid is meaningless in this Sino-Japanese incident, and it is even more afraid of being maliciously used by them. Therefore, Wu Guozhen solemnly pointed out again that China is fighting for China's independence and freedom, and this purpose has never changed. Jiang Jieshi also first proposed in "On China's Destiny" that China must rely on its own efforts to alert the people to rise up.

Crushing the United States' Conspiracy and Ambition

The recent trend of political relations between China and the United States is like this. Looking back at Japan's operation in Henan this time, it fully shows that it only wants to crush the United States' ambition to launch a counterattack against Japan by using China's land and Chinese people. In other words, although Japan is fighting on the Chinese mainland today, its real enemy is definitely not the Chongqing army, but the British and American forces of aggression in China. This point is also clear to Chongqing, so the political theories of important Chongqing officials recently began to repeatedly state that China's desire is for independence and that China must rely on its own efforts. We hope that Chongqing will always be wary of the British and American ambitions to invade China, and we especially hope that Japan's operations in China will change its character with a sharp turn, and change into helping Chongqing to expel all foreign forces of aggression in order to lay the foundation for the lasting peace of East Asia.

Deterioration of Economic Relations Between Chongqing and the United States

In Sino-US relations, not only the political actions of the United States in China have made Chongqing feel that it has no use in this incident, but also the economic disruption of the United States in China has made Chongqing more and more annoyed. Now let's look at the recent economic disruption of the United States in Chongqing. The number of US Air Force personnel stationed in Chongqing and other related personnel has recently increased, and other military, diplomatic, news, and communication personnel are frequently coming and going, so they brought huge amounts of gold yuan to Chongqing, Kunming, Guilin, and other places. At first, the US Air Force also saw that the items that could be purchased for one yuan in the United States had to be spent 250 yuan in legal currency or even 300 yuan in Chongqing, so the US Air Force also had its own injustice and pain at this time. At that time, Chongqing's general speculators were enthusiastic about speculating in gold public bonds and customs gold. Seeing these buyers coming with huge amounts of US dollars, they rose up to search for them as the object of their speculation. Taikan Gold Public Bonds and Customs Gold, although based on gold yuan, cannot be directly circulated on the market. Now that gold yuan is coming directly, Chongqing merchants are concentrating their idle funds on this gold yuan speculation. On the one hand, Americans bring US dollars, although there is an official exchange rate for legal currency, that is, one to two, and the actual purchasing power of legal currency is seen by Americans as only 200 times, and they still feel that it is low, so they are not willing to exchange at the official rate and allow general merchants to search for it. The black market for gold yuan has soared to 200 and several dozen yuan, and as a result, the general public feels that the credibility of the old legal currency has been swept away, and the government is clearly aware of it and rushes to clean up, but it is too late, and price controls have also failed. On March 8 of this year, Zhang Pingqun, a consultant of the Executive Yuan, announced that the wholesale price index was 230 times that before the war, and the price of rice and coal had risen by 60% compared with the end of last year, the price of matches was 600 times that before the war, and the price of native cloth was 340 times that before the war.

Chongqing's Finance Falls into Chaos

The reason for this skyrocketing price is actually the rampant black market for US dollars. The intrusion of this poisonous force from the United States has made Chongqing's most effort and the most concerned financial policy fall into chaos. Prices have risen endlessly, and there is nothing more serious than the suffering of the people.

Recently, there has even been such a strange phenomenon in Chongqing, that is, the general public is most envious of those who live on US dollars, and they are called the new comprador class. For example, the lowest-level personnel employed by the Chongqing US Information Office to write and print can earn 100 US dollars per month, which can actually be exchanged for 18,000 old legal currency in the black market. Even special officials of the government do not have such a high price, so it is no wonder that they are envied by everyone.

The officials know that the statutory exchange rate cannot satisfy the enjoyment and purchasing desire of the US Air Force personnel stationed in China, so they have set up a subsidy system, but they still cannot prevent the direct exchange of gold yuan with black market merchants, so financial chaos and price increases, Kong Xiangxi specially flew to Kunming in March to study this countermeasure, and immediately announced the prohibition of the circulation of US dollars and suppressed black market transactions, so it can be seen that the economic relations between China and the United States in Chongqing have recently deteriorated.

Looking at the Sino-US relations in Chongqing, and speculating on its future, it must be as Wu Guozhen said, the United States only knew to sympathize with China's resistance and reward China's resistance after the Pearl Harbor debacle. On the contrary, once it can prepare for a counterattack and there is a slight clue that it will change the past trend, then it does not know where it will put Chongqing again. The recent various accusations and attacks on Chongqing in the United States have revealed that the British and American views on Chongong have returned to calm, and all reality has only made them feel the sorrow of disillusionment. As for those who provide the information for this kind of accusation and attack, they are actually the foreign news reporters stationed in Chongqing. They themselves created the prices in Chongqing, and now they are suffering from it. Because of the suffering, they provide materials to their own countries to attack Chongqing. Its meanness can be seen, and the general public in Chongqing is suffering.

### The Current Four Major War Zone Situations

India-Burma Front - One Central War Zone - Five regiments of the Japanese Army's elite troops are conducting a large-scale annihilation battle on the Manipur Plain. The Imphal general offensive is roughly divided into the following three routes:

(A) The unit that cut off the Imphal-Kohima Road at Michun on March 28th is returning south to Imphal.

(B) A powerful unit northwest of Tamu is tracking and pursuing the retreating enemy, and is successively advancing north.

(C) A unit that defeated eight units of the enemy in the Tunzang area broke through the border north of Tunzang on April 3rd and continued to advance north towards the Tunzang-Imphal Road. In this way, the Japanese army is encircling the enemy from three directions, and the main force of the Fourth Army's 21st Division is about to be annihilated.

Two - Northern War Zone - The Japanese Army Air Force is cooperating with ground units to narrow the encirclement of the enemy's airborne commando near the Jiagada team in northern Burma. Therefore, the fierce attack is gradually disintegrating the enemy's forces.

Three - Southern War Zone - The Japanese-Indian Allied Forces, which annihilated the enemy's 81st West African Division in the Kaladan Valley, have joined forces with the powerful army advancing from Haga, aiming at Chittagong, and want to break into the state of Bengal.

### Central Pacific

On March 19th, a powerful American mobile unit advanced to the sea south of the Japanese-held Caroline Islands, where Japanese naval air forces destroyed four battleships and sank several cruisers, as announced by the Imperial Headquarters. However, Admiral Nimitz's counteroffensive in the Central Pacific theater will undoubtedly continue.

In response, the Japanese Navy will engage in interception warfare, inflicting casualties at every opportunity.

Admiral Nimitz, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, stated upon his return to Pearl Harbor from Washington: "One of our operational goals is to use submarines to threaten Japan's supply lines. Disrupting Japanese military logistics is crucial to the success or failure of future operations."

Therefore, the enemy's intention is to strengthen guerrilla warfare and increase Japanese attrition. Simultaneously, they are reinforcing supply lines from the southwestern United States, passing through Hawaii, Palmyra, Phoenix, Samoa, Fiji, to the Solomon Islands, as well as in the central Pacific, from Hawaii through Nikumaroro, the Gilbert Islands, to the Marshall Islands, or from Hawaii through Midway Island to the Marshall Islands. They aim to gain a favorable position and then launch a powerful mobile unit in one fell swoop, passing through the Inner South Seas and the Philippine Islands, to open up a corridor that cuts across the Central Pacific.

### German-Soviet Southern Front

On the southern German-Soviet front, the German army's right flank is at Nikolaev, and the left flank is at Kowel. The 250 kilometers from Nikolaev to Pervomaisk constitutes the right flank sector. From there, via Balti in Bessarabia, crossing the Dniester River, reaching Bălți, then through Chernivtsi, Kolomyia, Stanislaviv, to Ternopil, is the central sector, covering 500 kilometers. From Ternopil to Kowel, the left flank sector extends for 300 kilometers.

The Soviet forces have deployed Malinovsky's Second Ukrainian Front in the right flank sector, Koniev's Second Ukrainian Front in the central sector, and Zhukov's First Ukrainian Front in the left flank sector, and are currently attacking. The most important of these three sectors is the central sector, located between the Dniester and Southern Bug rivers. Soviet forces have seized Bălți, with some units crossing the Southern Bug River and advancing towards the Romanian plains. After the German retreat from Chernivtsi, Soviet forces are directly advancing on Kolomyia at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains, heading towards Lunghin.

The Soviet objective is to capture the Romanian oilfields and encircle the German forces on the Ukrainian front. However, Germany has prepared for this, deploying troops to Hungary, and deploying new elite units in the Carpathian Mountains to stand ready for a head-on assault in cooperation with Hungarian and Romanian forces.

### Italian Theater and Second Front

Due to the Soviet advances in the southern sector of the German-Soviet front, the Soviet Union is taking advantage of the wavering Balkan states to engage in communist political activities.

However, after German troops entered Hungary, they eliminated dissent and maintained close contact with Romania, adjusting relations with Bulgaria and Turkey. Germany's position in the Balkans is becoming more secure.

In response to the Soviet advance south, the Italian front has completely stalled.

The areas of Nettuno, Anzio, and Cassino remain in German hands. Especially in the Cassino sector, Anglo-American forces have retreated due to the fierce German attacks. There are also various rumors regarding the location of the second front's landing. The most likely locations are the ABCD coastal area of northern France and the Dalmatian coast of the former Yugoslavia, invading across the Adriatic Sea from the Italian front.

However, the Italian front has the German 25th Division led by Field Marshal Kesselring to stop the enemy. The Balkans have 18 elite divisions under the command of General Löhr of the Luftwaffe, standing in readiness. Therefore, the enemy's hope of opening a second front from the Italian front, regardless of the timing, has little chance of success.

### Sumatran Defense – A Glimpse

The Flame Trees are blooming with bright red flowers, as I walk through the shady groves, the sea finally comes into view. After several days of travel from a certain location, I finally arrived at the coastline. At 2 PM, I arrived at a certain location to observe the defensive array of Sumatra. Unknown creeping vines grew as tall as a man. It is truly amazing that amidst the growth of these vines, the sand dunes or rocky terrain were carved out to complete solid fortifications. Countless solid fortifications capable of withstanding direct hits from bombs of several kilograms are found in this area alone. Not only along the coastline, but also in the hilly areas behind it, similar fortifications have been completed. Excellent fortifications are also being constructed on the promontory to the right. The reporter took the road back from this fortification, with fields on both sides. These are cultivated by the original inhabitants.

Under the guidance of Lieutenant Iwaaki, adjutant of the garrison unit on this side, I observed the defensive situation in this area. The defensive array in this area is just as excellent as what I have seen and heard in the past few days. It is said that taking out such an excellent fortification, whether by air or by other means, is quite difficult. In addition, special attention must be paid to wild beasts and malaria. The king of beasts is the tiger. This area, throughout the island of Sumatra, has an especially large number of them. There are also many fish, wild boars, and pythons that feed on wild boars. One soldier, after studying and improving the tiger traps commonly used by the natives, created a new trap and captured a tiger alive. Another corporal killed a python in the dense forest and brought it back as a local product. It is not uncommon for soldiers from a certain unit to encounter a large python eating a wild boar and easily capture it while marching in the dense forest (弘謮 from the April 18th Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun)

### Preparations for Landing Operations

The call that the Allied forces' landing operation in Europe is imminent has been growing louder recently. As for the time, location, and scale of the landing, the enemy seems to be in frequent consultation. The latest issue of the American magazine "Life" contains an article titled "Preparations for Landing Operations," which uses the North African campaign (from the winter of the previous year to the spring of the following year) as an example to discuss the complexity and difficulty of landing operations in terms of "troop organization." An abridged translation is provided below:

Landing operations, carried out at a specific time and location, absolutely do not waste war materials. In that North African campaign, the Allied command held meetings and selected three locations on the North African coast (later changed to twelve locations) for simultaneous landings. The landing date for the first American expeditionary force was scheduled for November, which was decided in the early summer of 1942. This is a period of about four months between decision and implementation. Such preparation is necessary to carry out a large-scale modern invasion.

Operational Plan

First, the military authorities must establish a comprehensive operational plan. Therefore, in the various offices of the U.S. Army, many officers held day and night meetings to repeatedly discuss the war. The next step is to determine the strength and branches of the troops to be used, and to calculate the appropriate composition of ground forces, air forces, and special forces. Taking ground forces as an example, the size of its forces must be coordinated with anti-aircraft units and mechanized units. The proportion of this coordination must be adapted to the various conditions of the landing site.

Combat Troops

Next is the question of what kind of special troops will be coordinated with the front-line combat troops. In the North African campaign, this included engineering units for bridging and medical units for the wounded. After this decision, the Army Department and the operational military authorities confirmed the deployment of troops.

But at all stages of the operational plan, troop equipment, personal equipment, and their supply are the most important issues.

Personal Equipment

The personal equipment of the soldiers participating in the North African operation, from knives and guns to woolen socks, exceeded fifteen kinds, and the types of clothing reached three hundred and ninety kinds. The various materials required by the communications unit, such as radios, telephones, and wires, totaled 10,000 kinds. The necessities of the medical unit reached 68,000 kinds. The bridging materials, excavators, and searchlights required by the technical unit amounted to about 100,000 kinds. Regarding weapons, tanks, artillery, ammunition, spare parts, and other various items and materials, there were approximately 250,000 kinds.

The amount of gasoline consumed by a unit is eighty times greater than that of a unit of the same strength in the previous World War. The weekly consumption of each division landing in North Africa was 4.2 million gallons of gasoline, 20 million pounds of food, and 37 million pounds of clothing and equipment. Personal equipment has also increased fivefold compared to the previous World War. The total personal equipment of soldiers in all branches amounted to 700,000 kinds.

During the North African landings, the goods loaded on transport ships occupied a volume of six tons for each soldier's equipment. In addition, one ton each was required for food, clothing, and ammunition.

It is a major issue to transport troops and supplies to the appropriate location at the appropriate time. For this reason, the officers of the transportation system must spend weeks carefully paying attention to ship production and transportation planning schemes.

### Illness

— Rotten Stone

I am lying in a dark corner of a corridor. I have a fever and can barely breathe. The heavy footsteps of people passing by in the corridor on the uneven floor strike my wounded heart. Unconsciously, I became tired, dizzy, temporarily lost consciousness, and closed my weary eyelids.

"Damn it, little brat, not even sick, just sleeping. How comfortable."

"Yeah, he came here, definitely not to study, but to enjoy himself."

"Hahaha..."

Those words suddenly startled me awake. I opened my eyes and looked at the people who were just saying bad things about me. Who else but two senior classmates. My heart eased a little, and I wearily closed my eyes again.

When I woke up, it was already dusk. My stomach was rumbling, as if urging me to quickly put some food in it. I had no choice but to reluctantly crawl up. As soon as I stood on the ground, I felt dizzy, unsteady, and lightheaded. To eat, I had to slowly lean against the wall and stagger into the living room.

The living room was already full of people eating. I still sat in my usual seat. I was aware of the disdainful gazes, but I ignored them and just ate my rice. But after eating half a bowl, I was full. I had to force down the remaining half bowl.

"Sick, sick, can eat rice, what kind of sickness is that?" The senior classmate muttered disapprovingly, but I didn't care what he said and just put the bowl of rice into my stomach.

After eating, I felt even worse. Suddenly, a chill came from inside my body, and I trembled. The rice I had just eaten came right back up. My head spun, and before I knew it, my eyes blurred, and I couldn't stand. I had no choice but to return to the corridor and lie down again.

When I woke up at midnight, I discovered that someone was talking next to me.

"Tell the teacher tomorrow, sick, sick, what kind of sickness is that?"

"Yes, good, let the little brat know our power, hahaha..." Those words were clearly directed at me by the two senior classmates.

The next afternoon, when I was burning with fever, my junior classmate ran over to me and said:

"Brother A Gui, the teacher is calling you."

When I heard the teacher call my name, my heart started pounding, as if I had committed some crime and was going to receive judgment from a judge. I wanted to escape, but I couldn't. I had no choice but to stand up and go to the accounting room to listen to the strict judgment. When I ran into the accounting room, the first thing he said to me was "Sick!"

"Yes, teacher," I replied faintly.

"How long has it been?"

"Almost a week," I answered directly, and then said, "Teacher, I will get better." Because I was afraid of being scolded by him, I added another sentence.

"Silly child, of course you will get better, but the air here is not good, and the place is small. It's inconvenient for you to be sick. If you have relatives here, it's better to go to your relatives' house for a few days, and come back when you are well." The teacher's words were very pleasant to hear, but in reality, they sentenced me to death. I didn't answer, pushed out of the accounting room, returned to where I slept, and lay down. I don't know what thoughts were disturbing me, preventing me from closing my eyes. My heart was burning like fire; my head was pounding like a hammer. Sadness, anger... came from the bottom of my heart, and finally I spoke a sentence:

"You, these demons... ghosts, are you... are you trying to force me to death?" As a result, a bout of dizziness and unconsciousness took me away, taking me into the thick fog of my mind.

### Words of a Substitute

— Xu Ru Xun

My name is "Pen." Pitiful and regrettable, I am an orphan whose own parents are unknown, and of course, I have no surname or pedigree. However, I can describe the past of mankind in great detail, as if it were recorded. It is truly "doing too much for others, and too little for oneself."

After silently nurturing me, and after passing through many years in a muddled state, I found a benefactor who raised me among the trivial hairs. That was General Meng Tian of the Qin Dynasty. During a hunt in the southern expedition to the Chu Kingdom, he accidentally discovered that the fine hairs of beasts could cultivate my temperament, enrich my nutrition, and complete my "pen life." Therefore, he selected the finest rabbit and deer hairs, brought them back to the capital to be bound and sealed, and meticulously innovated me, giving me a new life. The gratitude I feel for his painstaking efforts cannot be described by myself or even by Master Huan. Calamity unexpectedly descended: I was actually used to write for others in order to gain favor. The greedy Qin Shi Huang sullied my nobility. He treated me like a master enslaving me. Edicts and laws – all the murderous demons – were all issued and executed by my labor. Under the situation of daring to be angry but not daring to speak, I finally became an accomplice to cultural destruction. This is my greatest shame!

I was temporarily silent. The dark rule cannot last long. After that, I devoted myself to cultivating my character and nourishing my mind. In addition to the pure and clean tip of the pen, the suit of armor, I added a long bamboo stem that was straight and hollow, standing tall and graceful. I felt more and more refined and aloof. At this time, I began to come into contact with human history. I understood that as early as the end of the Zhou Dynasty, China's most sacred teacher, Confucius, had used a pen to write the "Spring and Autumn Annals." I would use this as my first contribution when I first entered the world.

The Wei, Jin, and Southern and Northern Dynasties were the peak period of Chinese calligraphy and also the period when aesthetic literature flourished. The intersection of these two high tides formed the golden period of my youth. Sucking the milk of ink and bathing in the moisture of the inkstone, I became stronger, fuller, more lively, and more unrestrained. Galloping on the snowy white paper, I had the feeling of the meeting of wind and cloud, and the spirit of soaring into the sky. I especially felt grateful for meeting the great calligrapher Wang Xizhi. He was considerate of me, treated me kindly, and cherished me. He possessed a unique talent, spent decades of hard work practicing, and with my great ability, he developed the immeasurable glory of the Sage of Calligraphy, firmly stepping onto the constellation of art.

Later, my heroic posture attracted a loyal companion: Mr. Han Changli, the great Confucian and master of ancient prose in the Tang Dynasty. He wrote a short biography for me - "Biography of Mao Ying", bestowing a surname and name, counting the classics and recording the ancestors. Although it was a playful essay, it did indeed increase my value once it passed the dragon gate.

The rapid passage of time has kept me in a state of leaping advancement. In response to the development of the times, the evolution of materials, and the demands of human society, my categories have become increasingly complex. By the time the doors were opened, European winds blew eastward, and the alarm bells of revolution echoed throughout the ancient land, awakening a group of people who were living in a drunken dream. Old models were no longer sufficient, and new transformations prompted me to create all kinds of fresh and beautiful subtle variations. I took a giant step again, and rationally jumped onto the international stage. Compared with other actors, I not only had no qualms, but also maintained the traditional quality, using both strength and flexibility to display extraordinary skills. Striding across the center of the century, observing the realm of culture, looking around, I couldn't help but feel complacent.

The world is innovating, and sometimes it is also destroying. Culture is becoming brighter, and sometimes it is also declining. History is developing, and sometimes it is also regressing. This should not be my fault, right? I have already dedicated my valuable life, for the noble ideals of heaven and earth, and exhausted my labor as much as possible, squeezing out the last drop of blood. For humanity, the "spirit of all things", how can I shirk my responsibility?

### Kite

— Cao Yu Xun

— Who has abandoned leisure for a long time? Every spring, the tunes still sell.

The spring breeze has swept through the corners of the earth again, and the days have been clear. In the evening, on a barren field by a cliff, you can often see groups of three or five children jumping and scattering in the sunset. They look up at the sky, and there are a few simple paper kites in the sky. The kites take advantage of the wind, floating and swaying. The children clap their hands and laugh.

When I came back from my official duties, I often lingered by the roadside, watching them play this game; — and the memories were so melancholy.

Like the children in front of me, so innocent and carefree, they also played, and could also make kites — folding bamboo strips, bamboo frames, pasting paper. Especially Min, he had a clever skill, cleverly making butterfly-style and eagle-style designs, and adding suitable rubber bands to the top of the paper. In this way, when the kites flew into the sky, they would make a humming sound. So the children happily pulled the string, running and jumping on the street until the sun set into the valley, and everyone would reluctantly pack up and go home.

Because of this, Min and I became close friends. Min was not only a smart child, but also a good student in school. His family circumstances were very bad, and he could not concentrate on studying. In the early morning, he had to help his parents carry the plow and lead the cattle to the mountains before going to school. But the teachers therefore valued him even more.

I don't remember from what day Min suddenly stopped coming to school. After school, when we gathered on the grass, we didn't see his shadow.

"Min isn't coming anymore!" The children said regretfully. I felt even more lost holding the broken kite he made.

After a few more days, I was flying a kite in the fields again when I suddenly saw Min walking on the road with his father. I was excited and ran to him, shouting.

"Min, why aren't you going to school?"

"Min is no longer studying. Now he has to go to Xicun to look after cattle for others. He will come back to play with you in a few days." The answer was from Min's father, an honest middle-aged man, with a forced smile on his face. "Ah! Really?" I asked in surprise.

Min didn't speak, just nodded. I wanted to tell him many things — for example, that a rib of the kite was broken and needed him to repair it; there were also… But looking at his depressed face, I stopped. Finally, I held his hand: "Min! When can you come again?"

"I'm afraid…" He looked at me emotionally, "I regret it now, why did I love to play so much before and didn't study hard; now I have no chance to study."

A feeling of sympathy, sorrow, and self-reproach swept over my heart. What more could I say? In silence, we waved goodbye. I watched the backs of him and his father disappear in the sunset.

After that, I left my hometown to study in Shanghai and never received any news from him. Later, I was also affected by the war and illness and had to drop out of school. I drifted in this turbid business world, tasting the bitterness of life.

The memories of old friends and the sadness of dropping out of school often intertwined in my gray mood. When I saw these children playing kites, I thought of Min, I thought of Min's words:

"...Why did I love to play so much before and didn't study hard; now I have no chance to study!" (Reprinted from Yi Huo Xue)

### Desert Night

— Hu Ruo Liu

Black sand,

Black desert,

Black desert night;

There is a wanderer carrying a heavy load groping in the boundless black desert.

…… ……

No moon and stars,

The desolate black night of the desert,

There is a wind like the howling of a desperate soul,

And a wind like a mythical beast of the sky.

"Terrible desert night," you say,

But, you cannot sigh nor can you stop. Behind the forever desolate desert,

Is the beautiful country of hope!

Do not say that your legs are extremely sore,

Do not say that even the juice of life is gone from your mouth!

Let tomorrow be your comfort,

Summon the footsteps of a warrior!

The oasis in your imagination,

Will appear at the first sunrise tomorrow.

Black sand,

Black desert,

Black desert night:

There is a wanderer carrying a heavy burden,

Groping on the boundless black sandbar.

### Commentary on the North-Central vs. Ren Yu Decisive Basketball Game

The championship final of the Shanghai Open Basketball Tournament, Group A, between North-Central and Ren Yu, was held at the China Youth Gymnasium on the 10th (Wednesday) at 8:30 PM. All proceeds, in addition to the original face value of 40 yuan per ticket, will be used for the newspaper's scholarship fund (tickets at 200 yuan). To increase the donations, the newspaper's president, Mr. Chen, auctioned off the game ball midway through the match, which was purchased for a huge sum of 150,000 yuan, setting a new record for basketball auctions. The enthusiasm of the public is something for which we, on behalf of all impoverished students, express our respect. The event was unprecedentedly grand, and the game was exceptionally exciting. In the end, North-Central, relying on its rich experience, narrowly won by a score of 36 to 35, a one-point victory. Here, the reporter comments on the grandeur of the event and evaluates the tactics of the North-Central and Ren Yu teams.

### North-Central's Rich Experience Ultimately Secures the Championship

North-Central team's style has always been known for its speed, but its tactics are primarily based on stability. However, they seem somewhat unfamiliar, leading to less-than-perfect execution. Li Zhenzhong received three fouls in just over ten minutes, limiting his ability to display his heroic prowess, which inevitably diminished the team's performance. However, Zhenzhong did not change his approach because of this, but proceeded with special caution, managing to play until the end, truly embodying the cultivation of a true warrior. Otherwise, the consequences of North-Central losing Zhenzhong due to fouls would have been unthinkable. North-Central's defense was mainly based on man-to-man marking, but the marking was not particularly brilliant, especially with Li Saizhong unable to stop Lin Weicong's attacks. However, relying on Shen Weigong as the key to scoring, they were still able to meet expectations. Weigong lived up to expectations, shooting with accuracy, and was truly a great contributor to securing the victory. Most notably, when North-Central was behind by nine points (32-23), the entire team was not flustered, but bravely moved forward, ultimately turning defeat into victory. This is truly the result of rich experience. If it were a team with less experience, they would have likely been defeated. In terms of individual technique, North-Central should have won, but considering the course of this battle, North-Central's victory was not without luck. Now that North-Central has won the Shanghai championship and has worked hard for the newspaper's charity game for scholarships, we can all congratulate them.

### Ren Yu's Excellent Performance But Missed Free Throws

That evening, Ren Yu's players showed excellent skills, both audibly and visibly. During the attack, the two forwards penetrated deep into both corners, the center forward stood firmly under the opponent's basket, and the two guards circulated the ball outside, seeking opportunities to attack. In defense, they adopted a five-man joint defense, cooperating to block and never relaxing. This "steady and methodical" tactic greatly troubled Zhongbei. Yu Huanzi, as the commander, directed calmly, showing the demeanor of a veteran, which was truly remarkable. Zhuo Guorong and Ma Canxi, one firm and one gentle, were exceptionally composed. Their dribbling and interceptions were unique and could be called a pair of "iron guards." The young player Lin Weisong was smart and nimble, penetrating everywhere. His sudden attacks and shots were unpredictable. His achievements might not be inferior to those of Zhongbei's national players Feng Nianhua and Wang Hongbin, and his future is immeasurable. Li Zhaohe suffered a lot from his nearsightedness. His movements were sluggish and he repeatedly missed opportunities, making him one of the weakest members of the team. Perhaps he was intimidated by the strong opponent. During the attack, he always stood behind Zhen Zhong, which was a mistake. If he could have been more active, quickly moving forward to block Zhen Zhong when Huanzi got the ball, allowing Huanzi to take the opportunity to shoot, they would have scored more points and victory would have been within reach. The team's failure to make most of their free throws was also a major reason for their loss. When the score was tied at 34-34, Zhongbei's players committed a foul, and Huanzi had two free throws. If he had made both, they would have taken a two-point lead. Although Yu Gong tied the score, time was running out. In overtime, they could have fought to the end, and the outcome would have been uncertain. Unfortunately, he only made one, and time was up. The buzzer sounded, and they lost by one point, which was tragic. Looking at the course of the game, Ren Yu repeatedly had the upper hand. In the second half, the largest point difference was 32-23, leading by nine points. If they could have maintained the lead at that time, switching from offense to defense, adopting delaying tactics, not easily losing the ball after tiring the opponents, and luring the enemy to steal the ball in order to take advantage of the situation, victory would have been certain. But they failed to come up with this plan. Even Huanzi, with his seniority, failed to adapt to the situation. One wrong move led to lifelong regret. Was this fate or a mistake in strategy? We sincerely hope that Ren Yu's players will not be discouraged and will continue to work hard. The future is long, and there is great hope. We also express our sincere thanks to the team for playing for the charity match of this newspaper!

### Donghua: Two Masterpieces

Since its formation, the Donghua team has been invincible and its reputation has spread far and wide. Recently, it has achieved two more masterpieces. As a reporter, I am pleased and offer some comments as a memento.

### Representing the Chinese Team: Overcoming Portugal

Last Sunday (April 30), our Chinese team competed with Portugal in the international cup football final at the racecourse. As a result of the hard battle, our Chinese team relied on the combined efforts of the three armies, displaying its divine power, and finally defeated the stubborn enemy with a score of 2-1, forcing them to sign a treaty of surrender. They avenged three consecutive defeats and finally achieved their wish, which was truly gratifying. No wonder more than 10,000 fans were so excited and cheered thunderously, resounding through the clouds. Some people even set off firecrackers to celebrate. Their joy and dancing were beyond description. On that day, the Chinese team's lineup was entirely composed of Donghua players. The coordination was more sophisticated, and the attack and defense were orderly. In addition, the Donghua team's momentum and spirit were like the rising sun, invincible. This time, facing a strong enemy, they had no choice but to fight back. They were determined to fight to the death and not return until they had defeated the enemy. Therefore, although Portugal was stubborn, how could they not be defeated?

In this match, both teams had clear movements and were able to pay attention to sportsmanship, fully displaying their excellent football skills, which is especially worth writing about. The game was thrilling, and we were always in a state of shock. At that time, the reporter felt dizzy and blurred, and even his breathing became rapid, reaching the extreme of tension. When our team won the game with a score of 2-1, the pressure on my chest was relieved, and my breathing gradually returned to normal.

Speaking of the two teams' styles, both excelled in subtlety, lacking the boldness of great generals and focusing on skillful passing. Therefore, the battle was like glue, inseparable. The success of our Chinese team had its reasons.

The defense adopted by our Chinese team on that day was based on man-to-man marking, with the defenders guarding the enemy's wings and the midfielders marking the enemy's two inside forwards, closely following the enemy's center forward. The Portuguese team planned to use a tactic of flanking attacks and a central breakthrough. The Portuguese team's right wing was stronger than its left wing, but its right wing happened to meet our captain Li Ning, so they were helpless. The enemy relied on Da Chong Fafanxiao for central breakthroughs, but Fafanxiao was closely guarded by our generals Xin Fuzhen and Zhang Lin'gen in rotation. Because of this, the Portuguese team's offensive failed. To evaluate the team's offensive strategy, it also used the rapid advance of both wings, with Han Longhai and Shu Jin as the main players, which often created threatening scenes. Longhai was able to pay attention to offside, as I suggested, so he was very successful. The enemy team suffered a lot, and we should all recall this. The ability of Youliang and Li Yao on both wings to pass the ball early was most commendable, because the enemy's defense was purely based on experience, and this was the only way to control them. Finally, there are two points worth mentioning: one is the beauty of the Hua team's third defender system. The third defender was first created in Shanghai by "Dan Weisi," and the first to test it was Feng Yunyou. In my memory, the purpose of both using and advocating it was to have the center back defend the rear, but this time, the Hua team's third defender system was used with great flexibility. When Xin Fuzhen retreated, Zhang Lin'gen followed suit to take the center position to assist the forwards. Conversely, when Zhang sometimes retreated to act as the third defender, the old Xin returned to his original position. The two handled the situation skillfully, and the enemy generals were temporarily unable to figure it out. What must be mentioned is that the goalkeeper Zhang Banglun had unexpected feats that day. Xiao Zhang had such achievements and was enough to be proud of.

### Mayor's Cup Quarterfinals: Defeating the Police Again

Last Sunday (July 7), Donghua played against the police in the Mayor's Cup quarter-finals. Donghua had lost twice to the police in the league, but had narrowly won 3-2 in both games with some risks. In this game, Donghua showed its power and won 3-1, leaving the police defeated for the third time.

It is said that Donghua's offense is better than its defense, but I think the team's offense and defense are absolutely equally developed in the current state. Looking at the defense of Li Ning, Zhuang Ji and Ren Zhi in covering the goal area, it is beyond the reach of other teams in Shanghai. Zhang Banglun's writing is getting better and better, saving dangerous balls repeatedly, and his contribution is not small. He is able to save the ten shots of Xiao Huangmao, that is, Donghua's forwards are very good at attacking people's weaknesses with their own strengths. The reason why they have been able to win repeatedly in the past is based on this. In this game, Dong mostly used the central breakthrough, and the shot also took a low ball, because the opponent's guards paid attention to Donghua's wings. The enemy's goalkeeper is only good at high balls, but cannot save low balls. Because of this, Donghua won a great victory.

Now that the Chinese team has won the international cup final and the Donghua team has also reached the final of the Mayor's Cup, they will both compete with Italy for the constellation. The Mayor's Cup will be decided this weekend (July 14). I sincerely hope that the Donghua soldiers will continue to work hard, take advantage of the victory and go straight to the end! (Mei Bixian)

### Tidbits from the Stadium

After the match between Zhongbei and Renyu ended, Zhongbei's coach, the big fat Dai Changdi, and the little fat Xu Zhaotai, embraced and kissed, which shows the innocence of the people in the sports world.

When Zhongbei was nine points behind, the team leader Wang 君義 did not hesitate to ask to join the battle. Sure enough, Zhongbei took the lead, and Wang was satisfied.

Some people feel sorry for Ren Yu, who easily gave up the championship. If Zhongbei had failed, someone would have stood up for them. Therefore, the most innocent people in the world are fans.

The order in the stadium that evening was very good, which shows the hard work of the staff. The police's performance in guarding the gate was especially good (Lü Cheng)
