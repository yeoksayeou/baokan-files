### Editorial: The European War Situation and Political Situation

A: The European war situation seems quite dull these days. What are your observations?

B: Recently, the European war is indeed developing subtly. On one hand, the Soviet Union's winter offensive is about to reach its climax, and its future is worth noting. On the other hand, the atmosphere of a so-called "second front" is becoming increasingly intense, and the European situation is rapidly moving towards a decisive battle stage. Therefore, what you call "dull" may just be the calm before the storm!

A: Yesterday, I saw in the February 4th Asahi Shimbun that the Soviet army on the Eastern Front is said to be focusing its offensive on the central, southern, and northern sectors, advancing fiercely on the weaker parts of the German defenses. The German side is currently not optimistic. However, if we say that the British and Americans taking this opportunity to advance their offensive in Western Europe would threaten Germany's war capabilities, I'm afraid that is an exaggerated illusion, right?

B: Yes. Therefore, when we observe the war situation, we must also pay attention to the subtle political relationships and trends between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union behind the war. From the Soviet perspective, they are urging Britain and America to open a second front, but on the other hand, they still adhere to a policy of self-determination, making every effort to advance in order to create a certain fait accompli before the formation of the second front, so as to smoothly implement their world policy towards Europe. Therefore, it has coordinated with the winter offensive and actively launched its political offensive against Europe.

A: No wonder the newspapers recently reported extensively on the Soviet Union's Supreme Soviet meeting, which decided to grant the republics participating in the Soviet Union independent rights in foreign affairs and military affairs. It turns out that the Soviet Union hopes to use this new political strategy to deal with Britain and America!

B: This decision by the Soviet Union naturally startled Britain, America, and even the world. Allowing each country participating in the federation to build its own national defense forces and handle its own foreign affairs will have a significant impact on some small European countries, especially regarding the Polish-Soviet dispute and other issues, putting Britain and America in a very awkward position!

A: Naturally, the main target of this new move by the Soviet Union is the small European countries, attempting to incite rebellion and facilitate the advancement of its offensive. However, this political offensive will not have much effect on Germany. The silence of various Eastern European and Balkan countries in recent days shows that the success lies elsewhere. However, strangely, there are rumors circulating about Finland!

B: The reason is also very simple. The United States has never let go of Finland. Now that the Soviet Union has launched its political offensive, Britain and America, feeling threatened, have no choice but to play along and put some effort into the Finnish issue! However, rumors are most afraid of facts, and the facts will answer within a few days, so there may be no need to be surprised.

A: That's right, yesterday the newspaper already had news of Germany refuting all rumors of peace talks. I think that on the eve of this decisive battle in Europe, with these political and diplomatic maneuvers between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, I cannot help but doubt what you just said about the European situation rapidly moving towards a decisive battle!

B: This is because you overestimate the internal contradictions within the anti-Axis powers. In reality, it is a fact that the political relations between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union will also encounter limitations as the war situation develops. This is not only a matter of the power relations between the three countries, but also a matter of the opposition of political ideologies. The declarations by people like Wendell Willkie that the Soviet Union's westward expansion threatens Britain and America refer to this. However, today, Britain and America have no way to escape the tragic fate of their situation, and they have the painful necessity to quickly launch an offensive in Western Europe. The saying "taking a desperate gamble" is not wrong at all!

A: However, Germany is smoothly implementing its strategy of "maintaining war capabilities." Just watch, and it will give the adventurers who attack Western Europe a suitable response.

### Fierce Battles in Arakan: Japanese Aircraft Fiercely Bomb Enemy Positions, Three Military Facilities Set Ablaze

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese army base in Burma on the 13th: The fighting on the Arakan front has been exceptionally fierce recently. Japanese army aircraft bombed an enemy base on the night of the 11th, setting fire to three enemy military facilities. At the same time, enemy transport ships on the Naf River were also hit and caught fire. Furthermore, other aircraft squadrons also launched a large-scale attack on enemy positions east of Maungdaw, inflicting heavy damage on the retreating enemy and setting two places on fire. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.

Hanoi, 13th (Central News Agency) - American air force planes from Chongqing twice attacked the northern region of Vietnam on the 12th in the morning and afternoon, bombing Duc Son, Quanan, and Vinh Yen, but the Japanese side suffered almost no losses.

### Japanese Navy Aircraft Bomb Magas Again: American Newspapers Praise Excellence of Japanese Aircraft

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese naval base in the South Pacific: Japanese naval aircraft bombed enemy positions at Magas Corner and Arokan on New Britain Island at dawn on the 12th.

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from New York: The American magazine "Newsweek" recently commented on the excellence of Japanese naval fighter planes, the main points of which are as follows: The strong combat power of Japanese naval fighter planes is an undeniable fact. If an American plane fights against a Japanese plane, it will definitely be shot down. In the Battle of Guadalcanal, the American air force had no power to fight Japanese fighter planes alone. Japanese fighter planes have extremely high maneuverability, so they are superior to the fighter planes of any anti-Axis army. If American fighter planes want to fight against such excellent fighter planes, they have no other way but to fight with a ratio of two to one.

### The Defense and Offense of European Fortresses (6)

Asahi Shimbun Roundtable Discussion

Asahi Shimbun: The Balkan operation will sooner or later correspond to the South Italian front and the second front, and will be implemented soon. From which direction will the British, American, and Soviet forces come to attack?

Special Correspondent Sasamoto (Berlin): Since November of last year, the British and Americans have continuously bombed the Thessaloniki area and Sofia. For a week from January 15th, there was continuous bombing of Dalmatia, exposing the British and American coveting of the Balkans. However, after the British and American forces lost their island bases in Leos and Samos to the German army in October and November of last year, the operation in this area is very difficult. Therefore, the only relatively easy area for the British and American Balkan operation is the Dalmatian coast. The possibility of landing in this area, following the British and American advance northward in Italy, is gradually increasing.

The German army has long prepared countermeasures against the enemy's attempts on Dalmatia. They quickly dealt with the crisis when Badoglio withdrew, occupied the island of Corfu and other islands defended by Badoglio's troops, and maintained strict vigilance.

Balkan Trends

Asahi Shimbun: The anti-Axis powers are using strategic warfare to detach the Balkan countries from the Axis, targeting Turkey, Bulgaria, Hungary, etc. So, will Turkey stand on the side of the anti-Axis powers and participate in the war?

Sasamoto: Turkey's objective situation today does not allow it to decide its actions solely by its own will. Turkey itself is very clear about this.

So, under what circumstances will Turkey participate in the war? First, even if the British and American Balkan operation does not directly require Turkey's military cooperation, it will inevitably demand the use of Turkish sea and air force bases and the recognition of the passage of troops. In that case, the German army will immediately counterattack. Second, while the British and Americans are landing in Dalmatia, which has no connection with Turkey, to attack the Balkans, the Red Army will invade Romania and further south, plunging the Balkans into chaos. In this case, Turkey, in the name of maintaining order in the Balkans, will cooperate with the British and American forces in taking action.

However, the German army is standing by in the Balkans, and a direct conflict with the German army is very dangerous for Turkey. Turkey is also well aware of this. When considering future issues with the Soviet Union, Britain and America do not want the main force of the Turkish army to be destroyed by the German army. Therefore, the second scenario is a strong reason for participation in the war.

Asahi Shimbun: What are the trends in Bulgaria?

Umeda: Bulgaria aims to recover lost territory and build a Greater Bulgaria. However, there is a high level of pro-Soviet sentiment in the country, and it is the only Slavic country that is not at war with the Soviet Union. However, caught between Germany and the Soviet Union, Bulgaria is also subject to British and American terror bombings. The spiritual suffering that the country has endured in the past six months is truly worthy of sympathy.

Asahi Shimbun: What is the state of Hungary?

Umeda: Hungary, whether from an economic or operational point of view, is the gateway for Germany to enter and exit the Balkans. The two countries are not only united by previous traditions, but are also bound by a fate of inevitable cooperation. After the Italian coup, Hungary cannot but make considerable efforts to seek political stability. However, the power of the opposition to the government is also quite strong, supported by 1.5 million minority Jewish people, and the government has not yet announced basic laws on suppressing Jewish people. Another difficulty is the territorial dispute with Romania. These are all difficult problems to solve in the future. The day will soon come when these many Balkan countries are firmly united by the Danube River and become the cornerstone of a new European order.

### Party Workers Training Corps, First Term Begins

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, in order to adapt to the decisive battle system and enhance the capabilities of party affairs workers, so as to strengthen party affairs and complete the mission of revitalizing China and protecting Asia, has specially organized the "Central Party Affairs Workers Training Corps," which will train workers from party headquarters at all levels in three phases.

### Agricultural Production Increase Association Formulates Guidelines for Promoting Production Increase

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - Since its establishment, the Executive Yuan's Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee has been actively formulating regulations and policies to promote production increase, in order to ensure smooth progress under unified guidance and promotion. It is learned that the committee has now formulated "Guidelines for Promoting Agricultural Production Increase" as a standard for promoting work. The content of the guidelines is to establish an overall production increase plan, review the agricultural production increase plans of the country and various provinces and cities, concentrate funds to encourage production increase, and simultaneously predetermine 30 counties with good public order and convenient promotion in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, in order to utilize local cooperative branches, production mutual aid societies, township agricultural promotion associations, and other grassroots organizations to jointly promote production increase, and to further enrich the content of various farms as a model for farmers. As for the agricultural production increase targets, they are divided into three categories: first, food crops such as rice and wheat; second, oil crops such as oilseeds and castor beans; and third, fiber crops such as cotton and hemp. In order to enable farmers to spontaneously understand the relationship between agricultural improvement and production increase, the authorities will provide assistance at any time, adjust the purchase prices of various agricultural crops, and carefully consider the smooth allocation of agricultural and daily necessities. Those who excel in production increase will be rewarded, and extortionate taxes and miscellaneous levies that exploit farmers will be abolished, so as to ensure that people do their best and land is used to its full potential. Therefore, it can be predicted that after the promulgation and implementation of these guidelines, the two major goals of stabilizing people's livelihood and ensuring military needs will be achieved. In addition, the committee has also formulated a "Schedule for Promoting Urgent Production Increase for This Year" to supervise and urge relevant agencies to implement it according to the schedule in order to achieve success.

### British Military Mission Returns Home, British-Turkish Negotiations Stalled, Turkey Decides on Measures to Defend its Territory

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Ankara: The British military mission and the Turkish General Staff held secret military talks for a month. These talks have stalled for some reason. The British military mission, led by Generals Lindset and Penley Wang, has departed from Ankara on its way back to England. The reason for the stalling of the talks seems to be the unsatisfactory resolution of the issue of Britain supplying military supplies to Turkey. According to well-informed sources, Britain wanted to supply the Turkish army with captured goods, but the Turkish side felt that this was a violation of the announcements made at the Adana and Cairo talks. He was going to return to England to take office, but each time the military talks between the two countries were postponed until blood was spilled. Now the army has decided to depart for London on the night of the 14th to take office. At the same time, Turkey is stationed in Iran.

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to Ankara: In order to defend its territory, the Turkish government has recently submitted a bill to parliament granting the Turkish army the right to requisition land and buildings when necessary.

### Tank Battle on the Upper Reaches of the Bug River, Street Fights for Jia are in Progress

Stockholm, Sweden, 13th - The Soviet 1st and 2nd Armies on the Ukrainian front, in cooperation, launched an encirclement of the German army west of Cherkassy, which has become increasingly fierce as of the 12th. The Soviet army then launched a fierce attack on Kolsny, a stronghold west of Cherkassy, from the directions of Dakanci and Miropoliere. According to a communique from the Soviet Information Bureau on the night of the 12th, the German army constantly sent large armies of tanks and infantry from the east of Hesikov to launch fierce counterattacks. Furthermore, approximately 1,500 German and Soviet tanks engaged in an unprecedented decisive battle on the upper reaches of the Bug River on the 12th. According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, the Manstein army is constantly sending reinforcements, posing a great threat to the rear of the Soviet army attacking Kolsny, and the outcome of the battle is difficult to predict. Furthermore, on the northern front, after securing the Leningrad, Badiejka, and Moscow railways in the Luga area, the Soviet army is planning to advance westward to recapture Luga, but the German army has stopped the Soviet army's advance in the eastern part of Luga, and fierce street fights are currently in progress.

### Japan's National Savings Amount Will Definitely Be Successfully Completed

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - Japan's national savings target for this year was decided at the cabinet meeting on the 12th to be 36 billion yuan, and was formally announced by the Information Bureau in the afternoon. Regarding increasing national savings, Finance Minister Kaya advocated very actively. He explained at this parliament meeting that, based on the state's financial position, 28.5 billion yuan of public debt funds this year, 6 billion yuan of expanded production funds, and approximately 7 billion yuan of funds released for the rectification of enterprises, totaling 35 billion yuan, must be planned from the national total income of 60 billion yuan this year. Later, he also advocated in parliament that, given the current purchasing power, private funds from the people should be actively absorbed. In addition to the 35 billion yuan, 1 billion yuan of ordinary private funds absorption was added, and it was decided that the national savings target for this year would be 36 billion yuan. This figure is 9 billion yuan more than last year's 27 billion yuan. Last year's target was successfully completed. This year is the decisive year, and the Japanese people across the country have always been known for their sincerity in contributing to the country. It is expected that this year's savings target will definitely be completed.

### Tram Company Adjusts Various Implementation Measures

To Be Implemented Separately Starting on the 16th

Central News Agency Report: The Shanghai Tram Company, in order to unify fares, eliminate ticket scalping, and improve the routes, has made separate adjustments to the above points, and has scheduled them to be implemented from the 16th of this month. The company's implementation methods are specially recorded as follows:

Unified Fares

Starting on the 16th of this month, the company will completely abolish the original zone-based fare system for all tram lines, both rail and trackless, in the city, and implement a uniform fare system regardless of distance for each line. The rates are: First class, 1 yuan (military ticket 5 jiao); Third class, 5 jiao (military ticket 3 jiao). As for monthly and quarterly tickets, they are divided into two types: full line (universal for all lines) and one line (designated for one line). The prices are as follows: (First Class) Adults, full line, 160 yuan per month, 385 yuan for three months; one line, 80 yuan per month, 195 yuan for three months. Children, full line, 80 yuan per month; one line, 40 yuan per month. (Third Class) Adults, full line, 80 yuan per month; one line, 40 yuan per month. If companies, businesses, or organizations have more than 20 people, the company can give preferential discounts after requesting them. In addition, the monthly and quarterly tickets for this (February) can still be used as before without the need to increase the price.

Adjusted Routes

Passengers using monthly student tickets must show the ticket to the ticket seller or ticket inspector when boarding and alighting.

### Strict Prohibition of Peddling Stamp Tax Tickets

Tax Bureau Asks Police Bureau for Assistance

The Jiangsu Stamp, Tobacco, and Alcohol Tax Bureau recently received a secret report stating that someone outside is falsely using the name to peddle stamp tax tickets to residents and shops. This is a violation of tax policy and will inevitably affect the entire tax revenue. Therefore, yesterday, the bureau separately sent letters to the various police bureaus in the city, instructing their respective branches to provide assistance within their respective jurisdictions. Conduct investigations and prohibitions at any time, and if discovered, immediately detain and severely punish them to achieve organization and prevent abuses.

News was Released Yesterday at 7:30 PM

### Sports: Second Act of Charity Soccer Match: China Loses to Portugal

Score: 4 to 3

The second act of the charity soccer match organized by the Shanghai Football Association, China vs. Portugal, was held at the Yiyuan Stadium at 10:30 AM yesterday. The referee was Xuan Gu Zhengzhu. Portugal's ability to defeat China 4-3 was by no means a fluke. China's defeat by 4-3 was also not unjust. Although China tried to save the decline, it was helpless against the crowd (China only played with ten people). Portuguese goalkeeper A. Luo Chailiao was agile and rescued many dangerous balls, completely different from the past. The team's victory was entirely due to Luo Chailiao's功. V. Su Ruo commanded the three armies and was very organized. The front five forwards were in control of the whole field. Ma Xiaor was worthy of the veteran style, and his positioning and blocking were excellent. Da Chong Fa Fanxiao was also not weak, and the remaining players were all above average. During the opening ten minutes, Liu Zubei of the Chinese team was injured and left the field, so only ten players were playing. The Chinese team was based on the entire Donghua team, supplemented by Maisen from the three provinces. The Liaison generals did not come to the battle. In terms of personal technique, Han Longhai was the best, playing both as a general and a minister. Tan Fu did not show any brilliance. Mai Youliang, although brave, missed two excellent opportunities, 功败垂成. Zhang Banglun was disappointing. Banglun should be responsible for half of China's defeat. In the first half, Old Portugal led 3-1. In the second half, China pulled back two goals. As for the front field, Portugal scored another goal, resulting in a 4-1 defeat for China.

### Western Youth Basketball Group A: Dongfang vs. Sanlun Tonight

There is a large annual volume of import and export trade between this city and North China and Su Huai, and it is of great importance to the exchange of goods between the North and South. With the guidance of relevant authorities, the two trade associations of North China and Su Huai import and export merchants were established in Shanghai yesterday (13th).

They reported on the preparations and passed the draft articles of association. The best candidates for supervisors were elected. The North China Import and Export Trade Association was established at 1:00 PM. The presidium included Zhang Jingli, Jin Zhigong, Meng Tai, Wang Dong Sheng, etc. After the entire organization was formed, they reported and elected the supervisors, which took two hours.

### Ministry of Finance Approves Silver and Money Industry Request for Extension of Capital Increase Deadline

Deadline Extended to the End of March This Year

In order to strengthen the financial institutions of the silver and money industry, the Ministry of Finance stipulated that all banks and money houses that do not engage in savings and trust business must increase their total capital to 6 million yuan and must first collect one-half of the amount. All banks and money houses have complied with the order. When submitting the report to the Ministry of Finance to change the registration after the capital increase is completed, the Silver and Money Industry Association will verify the amount of the capital increase and provide a certificate. Because the deadline for the capital increase was originally set at the end of December of the 32nd year, and some banks and money houses used the surplus distributed to shareholders at the end of the year for capital increase, the deadline was inevitably too short to complete the process. Therefore, the two associations jointly submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance to request an appropriate extension of the capital increase deadline. The extension was approved to the end of March of the 33rd year. Since the deadline has been extended, it is possible to handle the matter calmly. After all the capital increases have been completed, the organization will be more substantial, and the overall finance will be more stable.

### Last Week's Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Situation: Black Market of Public Bonds Subsided and the Situation Stabilized

In the Shanghai financial and industrial market last week, after the start of business after the New Year holiday, the silver and money industry treated loan business with special caution, so the tight monetary conditions did not ease, and transactions could not be carried out. However, those with funds, judging that the market was difficult to activate, were persuaded by general market buyers to speculate. The illegal transactions in the black market of public bonds caused market prices to rise sharply, causing panic and unrest. Fortunately, the Bureau of Economy discovered this and immediately used decisive means to detain the illegal red-chip and bond brokers and issued a severe warning. The black market of both red-chip and bond were completely eliminated. Therefore, the financial situation became more stable. Stock market prices also fell at any time due to the authorities' strict ban on speculative trading and the crackdown on illegal stock listings. The industrial and commercial sectors had sufficient inventory before the end of the Spring Festival, so transactions were small. However, due to various bad rumors, prices continued to rise. The authorities are now paying attention to cracking down on merchants who raise prices without authorization, otherwise, they will be severely punished.

### Various Trade Associations Review Membership Qualifications

In order to fix prices on time, the major commodity trade associations in this city have convened joint meetings of directors and supervisors. They strictly review the qualifications of trade members, and consider the business nature, whether retail or wholesale. They will assess whether the types of goods sold should be included in the association, and whether the articles of association are in conflict. They will also review whether members have complied with the price limits set by the association, and various measures. They will ensure that the member's shops have the goods they need and whether they use standard weights and measures. If a member is found to be in non-compliance with any of the above, they will be ordered to withdraw from the association and stop enjoying various interests.

### Second Savings Campaign Extended by One Week

The second savings week sponsored by the Central Savings Bank has been decided to be extended for another week from today (14th) to the 19th, so that those who are interested can have the opportunity to participate in the prize-winning savings. It is reported that the banking and money industry associations have issued circulars to their member banks and money houses, requiring them to recognize the amount of fixed-term savings deposits if they have not recognized the amount of fixed-term savings deposits during the savings cycle from January 17th to January 22nd, and they must recognize the full amount within this week.

### Coal Slag Industry Association Plans to Formulate Industry Regulations

The Shanghai Special Municipality Coal Slag Trade Association, in order to seek the welfare of the industry and standardize the market price of coal slag, has been actively formulating "Industry Regulations for Buying and Selling." It was submitted to the competent authorities for filing on the thief's day. Hereafter, all member businesses must follow the draft rules set by the association for transactions and must not outwardly comply but inwardly disobey.

Arabian Sea - Record of a Japanese Submarine's Gallant Fight

In a certain month, the raging waves of the Indian Ocean made the soldiers on board feel greatly distressed. Our objective was to advance westward from the Arabian Sea toward a certain bay and launch an attack. One day, just past noon, the first prey was discovered on the horizon. As expected, we encountered an enemy ship departing from Colombo.

The enemy's air patrols were becoming increasingly intense. A 10,000-ton cargo ship gradually appeared in the periscope. The torpedoes that were fired struck the enemy ship in front of the bridge and at the stern. In an instant, the ship tilted and sank. After a while, the ship regained its balance, and the enemy, sending out distress signals, immediately launched two small wooden boats and began to flee. Our captain decided to carry out a gun battle during the day and ordered preparations for a rapid surface gun battle. Our usual training was fully utilized at this time, and we immediately subjected the enemy ship to intense shelling. The shells hit their mark, and fire broke out from under the bridge, engulfing the ship in black smoke, and it gradually sank into the sea.

Treating Prisoners Favorably: According to the captured captain, the ship was originally a Dutch vessel, but upon the outbreak of the war, it was ordered by the British to transport military supplies, and it was on its way from Colombo to Durban. We gave him a room and a blanket and treated him with the food and drink of an officer, and we treated him with the respect due to a captain.

At night, the lights were turned on, because the ship was near Ceylon Island. Fearing that an enemy flying艇母艦 would be on night patrol, we immediately prepared for a torpedo attack, but upon approaching, we saw that it was an enemy hospital ship, with a snow-white hull displaying a red cross. This was probably escorting wounded British soldiers from the Indian border. The enemy countries of America and Britain had attacked our hospital ships several times, and we were holding great regrets, but the Japanese Navy was fighting for justice, so we silently let it pass, hoping to sink enemy ships another day.

Surfacing During the Day: Breaking through the Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea, we entered a certain destination. No matter how strict the enemy's air patrols were, in order to achieve great results, the captain decided to surface during the day, so that enemy ships could be quickly discovered in the wide field of vision. The captain then ordered the lookouts to be strictly vigilant in the air, and he guarded the command tower himself. As a result, the morale of the entire ship was greatly boosted. Several times enemy planes were discovered, and the ship quickly submerged.

One day at dusk, a 10,000-ton cargo ship left port. At night, because the air was misty, the visibility suddenly became unclear. The preparation for launching torpedoes was already complete. After the captain looked through the periscope, when approaching the enemy ship, whether the enemy ship had noticed or not, it suddenly changed direction, thus missing a good opportunity, but our ship immediately surfaced to chase. Soon, the front of the enemy ship was hit by shells, and it seemed that the propeller rudder had malfunctioned, and the ship began to circle around. The ship gradually rose, and the propeller became visible.

The captain stared at the periscope, preparing to deliver the final blow. But two enemy planes came in quick succession, interrupting the thought of attacking, deeply submerging into the sea, unable to witness the final sight of the enemy ship. However, since the bow of the enemy ship had sunk into the sea, it would inevitably sink. Later, although we encountered enemy ships twice, we lost the opportunity to attack because of enemy air cover.

Lightning Attack: Once, hearing the shout of the guard, the captain fired out and saw a 10,000-ton cargo ship reflected in it, and upon closer inspection, he knew that it was a specially equipped gunboat disguised as a merchant ship, with one large gun each in the front and rear, and five linked machine guns in the center. If we attacked and failed to sink it, we would be subjected to a fierce counterattack, so the captain's policy of launching an attack was very cautious. The torpedoes also seemed to have a spiritual mind, hitting the bow and center of the ship squarely. In an instant, a huge explosion occurred. Looking at the bow of the ship sinking, the entire ship sank. This was only a matter of a few minutes, a lightning attack that was so fast that one could barely catch one's breath.

Like a ferocious and brave lion, the captain, disregarding personal danger, drove the boat to the entrance of a certain bay. Sure enough, a very large transport ship was discovered, almost as large as a battleship. In the bay, with the sun shining directly, the enemy ship did not expect a Japanese submarine to come here. The deck was covered with tarpaulins, and the cannons were also covered. The torpedoes we fired hit below the bridge, and the enemy ship, fully loaded with heavy oil, immediately caught fire in a few moments, and sank. The heavy oil flowing into the sea also caught fire, and the fierce fire at sea gradually expanded its scope, presenting a tragic scene of a fiery hell. Now our long-range submarine has established brilliant achievements in a certain port. Although the enemy planes on patrol dropped two bombs on us, they did not hit. We quickly and skillfully navigated away, feeling very satisfied in our hearts, and quietly walked on the seabed. (Hong Ren from the January 20 Asahi Shimbun)

### Bougainville Island - Record of Six Naval and Air Battles

Very close to the anniversary of the great naval battle of Hawaii, on December 3rd, the Japanese eagles (navy planes) again established glorious battle achievements on the Solomon Sea, sinking three enemy aircraft carriers, one battleship, and one large cruiser. In addition, one large cruiser and one destroyer also seemed to have been sunk, and one battleship was also damaged by bombing. This great achievement is a shining testament to the valiant fighting of the Japanese naval air force defending the South Pacific, following the successive brilliant achievements of the Bougainville Island aerial battle in early November, adding a brilliant page to naval battle history.

The report of the appearance of the enemy's mobile unit was transmitted to the 〇〇 base on that day's clear morning. The enemy was a powerful unit with aircraft carriers and battleships as its main force. Since the fifth Bougainville Island sea battle on November 17th, the seamen, fully prepared, had been paying attention to the enemy's movements. After receiving this report, they believed that the expected fact had appeared and were determined to annihilate the enemy, stroking their iron arms and listening to the news. Once the order was given, the sortie preparations of the sea eagle torpedo squadron were quickly completed. The enemy had already suffered such great damage in the first to fifth Bougainville Island sea battles, but they continued to regroup and challenge the southern defense line. Such a persistent offensive and the successive dispatch of fleets must be severely hit and reduced.

"One plane to take out one ship! Torpedoes must hit! Take them out without fail!"

Before the sortie, the commander of the day, 〇〇 Captain, gave a very short speech to his subordinates, but the awe-inspiring spirit in it conveyed a strong belief. Before long, the time for departure had arrived. The sea eagles spread their silver wings and soared into the sky. The fierce battle situation narrated by the brave sea eagle torpedo squadron warriors who fought to the death in that day's attack, and jointly defeated the enemy aircraft carrier group with friendly forces, is summarized as follows.

Sea Eagles Sortie: The sea eagle torpedo squadron departed from the base at 〇〇 hours 〇〇 minutes, advancing towards the target sea area in continuous succession. Before long, the sunset of the South Sea had sunk below the horizon, and the afterglow of the western sky gradually faded, as dusk slowly descended upon the deep blue sea. In a moment, the dark shadow of 〇〇 Island was seen ahead. The planned battlefield was over there. We carefully scanned the sea, but did not find anything resembling an enemy ship. The planes continued to fly towards the island. Suddenly, the glare of a searchlight shot out from the land, and the barrage of anti-aircraft guns almost simultaneously unfolded beneath our feet, exploding one after another. Several enemy fighters attacked us from the side. We used clouds as cover while continuing to search for enemy ships. Before long, four or five enemy transport ships were found on the sea between the broken clouds. They recklessly opened fire with anti-aircraft guns without considering their own capabilities. We ignored them and continued to advance, gazing at the sea without blinking for a moment. Sure enough, dark ship shadows were soon seen lined up ahead, undoubtedly the enemy fleet. At a glance, there were more than ten ships. Destroyers were deployed around them, cruisers guarded the front and sides, and aircraft carriers were in the center. They stirred up white waves on the dusky sea, sailing northwest. Looking further ahead, ship shadows that seemed to be battleships could be seen. Haha, the enemy we were searching for had finally been found. The time was exactly twilight, a perfect time to launch an attack, 〇〇 minutes after sunset. "All units attack!" The commander's plane issued this order at exactly 〇〇 hours 〇〇 minutes in the afternoon. With so much prey, our formation immediately dispersed, and each plane identified its target and plunged in one after another.

At this time, red flares, like bright red lanterns, hung high above the enemy fleet. They were dropped by the preceding search planes. The commander's plane, leading the remaining sea eagles, rushed towards the enemy ship formation indicated by this fireball. At this time, the enemy ships, already aware of our attack, simultaneously unleashed a barrage of anti-aircraft fire. To avoid our fierce attack, anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns were used, not to mention even the main guns were fired wildly.

Once the commander's plane identified a target and prepared to launch a torpedo, it sought accuracy in its attack, rushing through the scarlet screen of iron and fire, boldly speeding through the center of the enemy fleet, turning the plane, and again掠敵艦 in the opposite direction. However, Commander 〇〇 Captain believed that the angle was still insufficient, so he rotated the nose again, corrected the course, and plunged in at the best position. Unexpectedly, another enemy ship suddenly appeared in front, and after being obstructed by it, he had to correct the direction again. This time, he flew out in front of the enemy ship formation, attacked from the left side between the giant ships, and released the torpedo that was guaranteed to kill. The enemy ship concentrated even more intense fire on this rapidly turning commander's plane.

All Units Attack

At this time, the dusk on the sea was thick, and the sky was almost completely covered by clouds. A crescent moon like a comb occasionally peeked out from between the clouds, casting a faint light on the sea. The planes of the torpedo squadron, following in the footsteps of the commander's plane, each attacked their targets with their lives and carried out daring attacks. The enemy ship's defensive fire became more and more intense, with flames constantly erupting from the sea, surrounding the aircraft carriers in the center, drawing a fiery wheel on the sea. In this way, about 〇〇 minutes after the order to attack all units, one enemy ship had been hit by a torpedo, and its giant body soon disappeared from the dimly lit sea. Then, an aircraft carrier was also hit by a torpedo that was guaranteed to kill, and a column of fire shot up into the sky from the center of the ship. Its deck was turned into a sea of fire, and then the entire ship was engulfed in flames. A moment later, the hull of another aircraft carrier was hit by a torpedo, and with a loud bang, a large fire immediately broke out. Bright red flames soared into the air. At the same time, two friendly planes were unfortunately hit by enemy bullets in this fierce battle, turned into fireballs, and plunged into the enemy陣營, completing a heroic suicide attack. The commander's plane, having completed the torpedo launch, was hit in twenty places by bullets, and the gasoline tank was also broken, with gasoline dripping out, but it still leisurely soared above the battlefield, until it had verified the above results, before leaving the battlefield illuminated by the raging fires of the enemy aircraft carriers and returning to base in triumph.

The roaring sea eagle spirit of the commander who corrected his attack four times in the enemy's fierce fire was shared by all the team members. One of the torpedo機, determined to take out the enemy aircraft carrier, rushed forward fiercely, searching for an aircraft carrier, regardless of what the opponent was doing. In the midst of dodging the enemy's fierce防砲火 and searching for an aircraft carrier, the scheduled attack time had passed, but in order to ensure that the released torpedo would hit its target, it had to be extremely cautious. The sea was already very dark, and even the ship shadows were not very clear. This plane still circled left and right, continuing to search for an ideal target. Later, the enemy ship in front was hit by a巨彈, and suddenly burst out with raging flames. Flying closer to observe carefully, it turned out to be an aircraft carrier. Behind this burning aircraft carrier, there was another aircraft carrier, so it identified its target, launched an attack, released a torpedo that was guaranteed to hit, dodged the intense defensive fire, and quickly turned back.

Torpedo Hit

The torpedo did indeed hit, exploding with a roar. Two large explosions in quick succession shook the sea. Flames spread left and right on the deck of the aircraft carrier. In an instant, only the bridge on the left side was not yet burning, but it was soon affected, and the entire ship was finally wrapped in flames. This torpedo plane, from the time it attacked the enemy fleet, to the torpedo, was 倍見悽凉. (Special Correspondent Sasaki) (Ji: Translated from the January 12 Mainichi Shimbun)

### Thief

— Liang Xiaoping

A fierce northwest wind, carrying gray sand, flew madly on the street; the sky was dark and gloomy, coldly. The few pedestrians on the road, their hands shrunk in their sleeves, their shoulders raised high, struggled in the cold wind. The rickshaws, dragging empty vehicles, swayed in the middle of the street, waiting for the calling customers. Occasionally, a car sped past, like a wild beast, breaking through the gloom and bringing a tense atmosphere.

It was a calm, sinister, and lifeless early winter evening.

Old Wang was calculating accounts at the counter, constantly making the monotonous sound of the abacus; Little Mao was dozing off at one end of the counter, sleeping soundly; I sat in a corner, lowered my head and silently read a magazine, my heart seemed to be immersed in another world, but I felt the suffocation and dullness of reality. The wind rushed in and swirled, and the cold pressed in tightly.

Occasionally a customer came in, looked at the bookshelves for a while, and went out. After a while, another one came in, casually flipped through a few books, put them back on the shelf, and slipped out.

The surrounding air was scattered, cold, and desolate.

A blue shadow flashed in my eyes, I异的 raised my head, and glimpsed a gap left on the outermost bookshelf, a book was missing.

"Thief!" I exclaimed. I jumped up suddenly, dashed out of the shop door: north, yes, I seemed to see it flash north. Little Mao ran out behind me.

I jumped into the middle of the street, like the sharp eyes of a hunting dog searching for prey, scanning to the left, to the right, forward, and also quickly backward.

A blue long gown! With a thick book tucked under his arm! That red-faced complete works of Shakespeare! Now he stopped at the entrance of the barbershop, greedily looking behind him. I quickened my pace, avoided his gaze, and as I approached his side, I pounced on him fiercely, one hand forcefully grabbing his back collar, and the other hand grabbing one of his arms.

"Ah!" A cry of panic, and the book he was carrying slapped onto the ground. Little Mao picked it up and helped grab his other arm.

After a few futile struggles, he絕望地 looked at me once, and then slumped down, like a defeated hero, completely losing the ability to resist.

"Go," I shouted sternly, grabbing him tightly with both hands, almost using all my strength, even though he no longer struggled stubbornly. Wearing only two layers of thin clothing, I felt that I was grabbing his硬的 skeleton; his whole body was shivering, trembling my hands一阵阵.

Under the gaze of many curious passers-by, the pride of victory floated on my face and glowed. Thoughts quickly swirled in my mind, and blood surged through my body, rushing to my face in waves of heat.

"Please, let me go, this is my first time, I'm really hungry and I don't know what else to do," he pleaded in a trembling voice.

I ignored him, not loosening my grip at all, and cursing this lowly, shameless behavior. I pushed his body step by step towards the shop; as we approached the shop door, Old Wang stretched his neck and waited.

Pedestrians stopped, crowding around to watch, one layer, two layers,……

"Please, let me go, I…"

"Crack" "Slap," two loud sounds in quick succession; "Dare you come again next time?" Old Wang angrily made the first move.

"I won't, I won't. I…"

"Crack" "Slap," again two hits, this time打的是阿林 next door, "Damn it, you don't do proper business and do this kind of thing." 阿林 said straightly.

The red hung down from his nose; flowing down to his chin, dripping onto the stone steps.

"Oh! Oh! Please, let me go, I still have……".

"打" "打". Heavy fists, hitting the back with roars; one, two, Old Wang's fist, 阿林's fist next door, Little Mao's fist, and even the fist of a Western行人 joined in; towards the back, chest, head; like a dense rain, just as fast.

"Oh, help, let me go, I won't come again," pleading, loudly, trembling. Like the miserable cry of a wounded dog.

Fists, as dense as rain, just as fast; and a large black leather shoe foot joined in, kicking wildly at the thighs and buttocks.

Suddenly衝出了重國, staggering, dragging hasty steps,撲着 running south; I watched his blue back shadow disappear in the crowd.

"So young, doesn't do good things, engaged in this kind of勾當," the Western行人, looking at his back shadow, cursed hatefully, and hurried on his way again.

"Didn't send him to the police, got off cheap." One said.

"Really gave him a break, didn't beat him half to death." Another said.

"Haha, I think this beating is enough." Yet another said

"……"

The matter ended like this; 阿林 went back next door. The围着看的八 gradually scattered, Old Wang went back to the counter to calculate accounts again, Little Mao……

The air gradually relaxed from solemn, and gradually became quiet from noisy.

My agitated heart also gradually regained its calm; as if I had escaped from a bizarre dream. But the red fresh blood remained on the stone steps, not yet trampled clean, frustration, pain, remorse, intertwined in my heart.

It is my sin, the sin of that book thief, the sin of Old Wang, the sin of that 西装行人,……, I stared blankly at the sky.

The sky was dark and gloomy, coldly. Gray sand flew on the street.

### Socks

— Pei Ji

After English class, I found someone laughing behind me. When I turned around, two elegantly dressed female classmates were casting their gaze on my heels. It turned out that I was wearing a pair of torn socks. My mother had patched a large piece of blue cloth on the back of the heels. When I lifted my heels while walking, the entire patch was exposed, and the two oval dark blue patches were quite eye-catching.

The pretty girls found it funny, I wonder if they ever thought that these patched socks were sewn by my dear old mother—the needlework of the only woman in the world who has loved me the most since I was a child. They found it funny, but when I lowered my head and looked at my feet, I swallowed two grateful tears into my stomach. A warm feeling echoed in my heart, and I didn't feel uncomfortable at all. I only felt comforted and encouraged; I wasn't embarrassed at all, I only felt a force in my heart that lifted my head higher. I was proud because I had a mother, this was the needlework of a loving mother!

My socks were all old ones that I had been wearing for several years, because I often wore hard leather shoes, the heels of my mother's socks were worn through with large round holes due to friction. I didn't have money to buy new socks. New socks that cost more than thirty dollars a pair were as useless as paper, and they would break and develop holes in less than two weeks. Having holes with the skin exposed outside like a pair of duck eggs was secondary, but the skin being chafed by the leather shoes was unbearable, so my mother suffered again. The considerate and thoughtful heart of a loving mother is worthy of praise and worship: I never complained to her, and she leaked out more than a dozen pairs of old socks from the clothes chest, and every hole was sewn up by her.

Every cold winter evening with frost and wind, when I finished my homework and went to bed to rest, Dad's snoring was already rising from my mother's room, and the five-watt table lamp on my mother's bedside was still shining listlessly. She sat on the bed mending my torn socks or knitting a woolen sweater for my younger brother. Scraps of cloth, torn socks, scissors, long needles, short needles, wool yarn, and other things were piled messily on the bed, which looked uncomfortable, but my mother always calmly and quietly picked one stitch after another, patched one piece after another, and knitted slowly. She always put on a pair of reading glasses, closed her lips tightly, and worked there silently. The yellow lamplight shone on her face, and her forehead was covered with凹的凸凹的 wrinkles. Every time I walked into her room, she always hung her head and didn't notice me, as if all her energy was concentrated on needlework, until I got close to her, then she smiled and said to me: "Go to sleep quickly: it's getting late." And I always vaguely didn't know what to say to my mother.

During the day, my mother was so busy with trivial housework that she didn't have a moment of leisure. She could only squeeze out some time to sew before going to bed at night, but the time in the evening seemed to be still not enough. Early in the morning, before dawn, she had to put on her clothes and sew a few stitches on the bed. Time, in my mother's eyes, was 貴 than anything else.

Tense work can make people feel refreshed, but it can also make people feel tired and sick. Thinking of my mother, I always secretly bless her health. Two months ago, her eyes had been ill for a month due to overwork, and she shed many tears and suffered a lot of pain. The doctor advised her to rest more and eat more nourishing things, but my mother wouldn't listen to the doctor.

With money, anything can be　得了, it is easy for rich people to buy dozens of pairs of new socks of various colors, but now I don't have money to buy new ones, and my dear old mother mends the old ones pair by pair for me to wear. This is such a laborious time, and moreover, she uses her dim老花眼 to補 in light in 　光熹　中 or under the灯下 where the柝声 has敲过, a son lives for more than twenty years and still has to depend on　 a pair of old and poor parents, how can one not be grateful! How can the young masters and misses who wear silk socks in the university understand me?

### The Cry of a Slave

— Yang Daming

Swish! Swish!……The whip flashes before my eyes,

Roaring above my head. Ah! This piercing, heart-shaking song! Swish! Swish!……The old, the weak,

Die under the lash; the young, the strong,

Survive by stealth under the lash. No groaning allowed. Sighs and complaints,

Only tears, work. Not a single day of relief, of sickness,

Death—answers for all! Even cattle and horses have a day to chew their fill,

And a time to breathe freely, but slaves are not even this good—

Precisely because their master is… must! Swish! Swish!……The whip kisses the flesh,

Is the price of labor! The whip's brand,

Is the reward for toil! No fatigue, no sickness. A bucket of ice water

Awakens muscles not yet dead! Under the whip, like a lamb,

Obediently, like an old ox, laboriously. No weeping, no groaning allowed,

This is a futile gesture insulting the master. Swish! Swish!……The whip already sings

A "dew" song for the old and weak! Swish! Swish!……The whip again plays

A "welcoming slave" tune for the strong! Alas! Alas!……Generation after generation as slaves! Alas! Alas!……Generation after generation as cattle and horses! Alas! Alas! When will we shake off the shackles of slavery? Rush

To the broad wilderness, breathe the air of freedom!

### To "Tropical Island"

— Zhuge Xin

Have you ever seen the soaring wings of the Peng bird? Have you ever seen the petrel in the icy ocean struggling with its pure white wings against the collapsing ice floes…? Have you ever heard the song, the collision, of the northern wilderness wind in the trees…?

Don't boast about your body covered in golden threads, don't be greedy for your emerald little arms, don't think of using the sweetness of the lakes and mountains to deceive you or others into being silent. Our beauty is not these, our praises are not these.

Although we also love warmth, we value physical strength even more; although we also need rest, we are eternally unceasing; although we hate hardship, we are even more determined to overcome it…

Don't boast about the sweet fragrance under your red branches, don't show off the big muscles in your little skin, don't sing in a low voice about the triviality of the ocean… You have no angry silence, no roar, you are not worthy, even if you are a heroic lover, they will not love your songs when they want to wield their swords.

### Forward

— Cai Yanyan

Although, today, I am scattered in a distant corner,

The sigh of a dying insect brushes against my heels,

Yet I have not waved to the sorrow of despair.

Whenever the black shadow of tongue-numbing pain comes to invade my spirit,

I always sing old, impassioned short songs,

Drawing some courage, drawing some strength,

To move forward again, forward again! One step is two steps…

### Spring in the Pawnshop

— Wu Tao

If there were no calendar to remind them, the people in the pawnshop might never realize the arrival of spring.

Look! Those high, deep walls, the grim iron bars on top, are just like a prison. And the people inside—especially the apprentices—become prisoners serving indefinite sentences; because the pawnshop system stipulates that apprentices cannot step out of the pawnshop at will. Except for a few days' holiday during the New Year, they are always imprisoned in the ancient pawnshop, unable to get a bit of sunlight, unable to smell a trace of fresh air. The whole world in their minds is just this small pawnshop. Alas! This rule is cruel, feudal, dyeing the lives of the apprentices entirely in a gray color; ruthlessly destroying, burying their youth. Moreover, there is fundamentally no term limit for apprenticeships; those who advance slowly may still be apprentices even at thirty or forty years old.

And I, am one of those imprisoned under this feudal, poisonous system! An apprentice. I understand that if my life is to be lived with even a little meaning, I must resist this feudal demon, and I absolutely cannot obediently become its sacrifice again. So, partly due to the impulse of a desire for knowledge, and partly wanting to have more contact with the wider world outside, I joined three older fellow apprentices who sympathized with me, and made an unprecedented request to the rigid, stern, old manager:

"Sir! We humbly believe that we are very superficial in all aspects of knowledge and experience. Working in this increasingly complex society is truly inconvenient in many ways. Therefore, we now respectfully make a presumptuous request to you: please allow us to read some books in nearby tutoring schools in our spare time in the morning or evening…"

Before I could finish speaking, he became enraged like a mad lion, kicking his feet and shouting:

"You lunatics! You actually have the wild idea of going to school to study. You must know that once you become an apprentice, you must wholeheartedly serve the shop loyally. How can you go outside to study and fool around again? Hahahaha! You are really crazy, crazy!"

A surge of resentment, a surge of doubt, filled each of our hearts. He kept scolding us "crazy". Did we become thieves? Commit crimes? Go mad?

"You're really bold, you're just daydreaming!" After taking a puff of his pipe, he mumbled a few more words. Then, he asked in a stern voice like a judge interrogating a robber: "Who started this?"

"It was me!" I immediately roared out, my voice particularly strong.

"Oh, it's you, I didn't see that you were small, but you're really bold, if you want to study, you can just go back to your hometown. My shop, cannot tolerate you being so free." The old man, while clenching his fist and pounding the table, kept scolding me angrily.

I really couldn't bear this unreasonable scolding from him, I wanted to resist, wanted to thoroughly strike and stab his stubborn mind. But when I remembered my mother's instructions to me when I came to the shop, "My child! You must be cautious in your work, listen to what people say, and never make Mom sad!" My courage completely turned into trembling and hesitation. Not only did I not dare to argue with him, I didn't even have the courage to look at him. My face burned red, I just stared blankly at the corner of the wall.

After a moment, he suddenly waved his hand and told us to leave, so I, like a prisoner who had been pardoned, hurriedly left the room.

From then on, this group of us old apprentices became even more cowardly. A passive atmosphere filled everyone's words and ambitions: because we had realized that our lives would forever be controlled by the magic grip of this stubborn and autocratic old man. We also wanted to struggle, also wanted to create our own new paradise, but, heavens! With our skills trained under the slow and rigid pawnshop business, where in society is our place to eat? Where can we create new glory? Therefore, whether we are active or passive, life is always so gray, without the slightest color.

The spring of 1944 came slowly again, she bestowed upon this world, this humanity, much comfort and beauty. But we have failed her. The warm spring sunshine, the spring colors on the streets, the spring scenery of nature: are only things we yearn for in our minds, who says "spring is ours"!

On the monotonous journey,

When you occasionally stop to rest,

You also think of the old lamplight,

The magnificent songs of the oxen,

The laughter in the light boat:

Perhaps, these fragmented memories disappear in the magnificent painting,

For justice, for survival,

Knowing only to move forward in the vast wilderness—

Not stopping to rest for a moment,

Exhausting all your life's energy to rush forward,

Seeing the torch of light,

Is the true symbol of your existence.

There is paradise in the clouds over there,

There are banquets on the mountain peaks,

There are the high songs of the youth,

There is the laughter of the free,

Making you younger, healthier,

In the distant heaven,

May the strong men of the country take care!

Ah! I have tightened my pace forward even more,

Similarly pursuing the front line of light with you.

### Early Rising

— Xu Zhai

A recluse rises early to take advantage of the clear sky, a line of morning light breaks the dawn mist, indistinct mountains swallow the night's sleep, rippling Green Creek absorbs the flowing spring. The moon's roundness gradually decreases like a waning ring, the wind's sharpness can dispel the approach of heat, if one's actions concern the nation's fate, the rooster's crow should spur one on like Zuti's whip.

### New Cold

— Cao Yuning

Vast floating clouds stir in the four corners, a new cold crept onto the tower last night, the moon over the waterside pavilion is unintentionally green, the wind on the desolate city deliberately destroys. The cloud-veiled mountains of the old country after the tide recedes, news from afar arrives with the flying geese, lately I alone feel the emotions of the New Pavilion, often shedding tears as I toast a cup.

### Athletes Should Not Desert Their Posts on the Eve of a Game

—Thoughts After Watching Yesterday's China-Portugal Match—

Yesterday at half-past ten in the morning, there was a wonderful soccer match at Yiyi Field, between the Chinese team and Portugal, as part of a charity match organized by the Football Association. The audience, awed by the reputation of both teams and the impressive lineup announced in the newspapers, came flocking. The stands were packed, creating an unprecedented scene. Unexpectedly, of the twenty-one players selected for the Chinese team, only eleven arrived, and with one player injured, they had to fight with only ten players from beginning to end, inevitably suffering a crushing defeat, which cannot but give one pause.

Absence on the Eve of a Game Shows Poor Spirit

The players who were absent from the Chinese team were Li Tiansheng, Cai Shengmiao, Gao Baozheng, Fei Chunhua, Zheng Yingquan, Liu Xianhan, Qu Yongfu, Zhuang Youren, Liang Shutang, Wu Qixiang, and others, a total of ten people. Among them, Zhuang and Liang, according to Jia Yougen's words to reporters: both could not spare time due to temporary matters. The rest of the eight top players, who all belong to the same team. The reporter witnessed that most of them arrived at the field, whispering to each other, seemingly an organized absence, or perhaps they had their own difficulties, but we always feel that their spirit is not commendable. The most important thing for soccer players is spirit, followed by the performance of skills, and victory or defeat comes after these two. The players who were absent this time are all top-notch players, and also eagerly anticipated by fans. Failing to fight on the eve of a game is not only a bad spirit, which will forever remain in our minds, but also how can we face the thousands of fans who came from afar and suffered disappointment? Moreover, this battle is also to represent the Chinese team, to win glory and wash away shame, and should know its importance. For first-class players to have this kind of performance, I think it is a big mistake. Now that the matter has passed, we, standing on the position of a third party, very much hope that they will correct their mistakes, pull back from the brink, and not lose their heroic character. Sincerely hoping!

The players who attended, fighting against the odds, were able to fight bravely to the end. In the end, even in an absolutely losing position (three - 〇) they were able to tie the score (three - three). Their courage is worthy of praise. Unfortunately, they lost one point at the end, inevitably suffering a crushing defeat. However, the fans in the stands were all satisfied, admiring the spirit of the fighting players beyond victory or defeat. In addition to these thoughts, I will briefly describe the process of yesterday's battle.

At the Start of the Game, the Portuguese Team Showed Their Power

The Portuguese team attacked first, the Chinese team's coordination was not yet mature, and in less than ten minutes, V. Su Ruo scored a goal in the midst of the chaos. Just as the Chinese team was preparing to counterattack, Liu Zuruo on the central defense line was injured and left the field. Lacking a replacement, they had to fight with ten players, and morale plummeted. For a time, they could not recover, and internal affairs became troublesome. The enemy general showed his power, and the Chinese team could only take a defensive position. At the twenty-minute mark, the enemy center forward Fafanmei entangled with Lin Gen and sent the ball in, two to 〇. The Chinese team then quickly transferred Yu Liming to the central defense to strengthen the rear and focus on defending and then attacking. However, the enemy's momentum was strong, and at thirty-eight minutes, V. Su Ruo was again scored by our goalkeeper, losing three goals in a row. The athletes were filled with anger, Han Longhai and Jia Youliang bravely launched a joint attack. Unexpectedly, heaven did not help us, Youliang missed two sure-shot balls, both because he was too cautious, resulting in weak shots that were saved by the goalkeeper, which was a pity. The first half ended with three to 〇.

The Chinese Counterattack Was Magnificent for a Time

In the second half, the lineup of the Chinese and Portuguese teams underwent major changes, using a rotation strategy. Our team continued to fight with ten players from the first half. After the start, our side took advantage of the fact that the opponent's formation was not yet stable and launched a massive attack. The enemy's defense was greatly loosened, and the four knights of our front line were seen passing the ball like pearls, with a magnificent momentum that cannot be described. Who would have believed that the enemy goalkeeper, who was usually mediocre and unworthy, would at this time save every ball, save with divine inspiration, which was beyond human power. The audience could not help but stamp their feet and sigh, and believed that the goalkeeper's performance was an unexpected performance. However, unity is strength, and heaven does not disappoint people. Han Longhai, in the midst of his repeated failed attacks, single-handedly charged straight in, the ball hitting the wooden post and bouncing in. Once the record was broken, the athletes were revitalized. Li Yao dribbled the ball from the left and cut to the center, landing right in front of the goal. The opponent's defender Ma Shan'er and our team's Sun Jinshun jumped up at the same time, the ball landing on Ma Shan'er and bouncing in, resulting in an own goal. Our side scored two goals in a row, determined to turn defeat into victory, supporting each other from front to back, and were unstoppable. In a blink of an eye, Han Longhai, who was unparalleled for a time, broke through in the middle, his feet flying, and the ball went into the net, a beautiful sight. The stadium was filled with cheers. Unexpectedly, only about ten minutes before the end of the game, the cheers were still in the ears, Lin Gen backfired, and was scored by Braga, which was unfortunate. In the end, they suffered a crushing defeat with a score of three to four.

Commenting on the Skills of Each Player on Both Teams

Speaking of the battle between the two teams, our team, although fighting with ten players, did have points that were admirable, with the attack being better than the defense. However, in the first half of the first half, it seemed that they were a little lax. Han Longhai was the most distinctive character, not just because he scored two goals. Looking at his tireless running, he deserves praise. Jia Youliang's merits and demerits are equal, he has more courage than skill, and he should be held responsible for not scoring two sure-shot balls. Li Fuzhen was less impressive than in the previous two games, mainly due to poor coordination. Zhang Lin Gen worked the hardest, fighting hard with Fafanmei, and his contribution was great. Goalkeeper Zhang Banglun was mediocre, only saving one dangerous ball, and the rest were scored. Zhang should train more.

The Portuguese team did not show anything particularly impressive yesterday, especially their good luck with the ball, and V. Su Ruo can be considered the most promising forward. His running and tackling are all methodical. The rest, Ma Shan, Kao Sitanweike Tai, all have the skills of veterans. Goalkeeper A. Luochaiyuan had a surprising performance, mainly due to luck. If he can maintain this performance in the future, he will not be unworthy of being a great talent.

In short, the Chinese team lost yesterday, not because of their fault, but because of their bad luck with the ball. (Jie)

### Further Discussion on "The Difficulty of Being a Basketball Referee"

— Mei Bixian

After this journal published my humble work "The Difficulty of Being a Basketball Referee" in the last issue, basketball senior Xie Yiqin invited me to talk. (Mr. Xie works at the Salt Industry Bank and has a great deal of research on basketball, serving as the leader and instructor of the Green Team's women's basketball team.) He said that there are still several points that should be paid attention to in basketball refereeing. His words are very pertinent and indeed insightful. As the Western Youth Games is about to end and the Chinese Youth Games is about to open, I will once again not presume my shallowness and record the following. And add my humble opinion as a supplement to the previous article, and sincerely hope that basketball referees will adopt it.

(1) The Clothing Must Be Conspicuous

Basketball games involve extremely fast movements, and if the referee's clothing is similar to that of the players, it is easy to cause misunderstandings. We often see that in tense situations, because the clothing is similar, the players do not have time to distinguish carefully, and they often mistakenly recognize the referee as a teammate and pass the ball to the referee. Therefore, the referee's clothing is best regulated to a uniform style, and it is preferable to have conspicuous colors.

(2) The Spirit Must Be Full

If the referee can be energetic and full of vigor, it will definitely improve the interest in the game and add a lot of color. On the contrary, if they are listless and perfunctory (Xi Qing Kai Qimiluotian was always like this), it will turn a tight and exciting game into a loose situation. Therefore, if the referee knows that he has a duty tomorrow, he should go to bed early tonight to conserve his energy, so that he may be successful.

(3) The Words Should Be Simple and Clear

Except for games involving Western teams, if the Chinese teams are competing against each other (the Western Youth Games may be due to the environment, as the clerks are all Westerners), then they are all Chinese compatriots, and simple Mandarin should be used, and English is not necessary. (It is said that when our country participated in the Berlin World Games, the athletes often spoke English among themselves. The Germans were very surprised when they heard it. Although it is a small matter, it is worth noting, so I add this note). The pronunciation should be heavy and clear, not too fast. Most importantly, avoid using Western and Chinese languages ​​at the same time, as it is inevitable that there will be grammatical errors, such as saying "Number what number comma foul", etc., repeating the points, incoherent, making a fool of oneself, how can it be taken?

(4) Judgment Must Not Be Hesitant

Once the whistle blows, the judgment should be announced immediately. Orders must be carried out, and there must be no hesitation, so that the players can take advantage of this time to express something. Once the judgment has been made, even if there is an error, there is no reason to change it. This is the way to maintain the dignity of the referee.

(5) Must Have Considerable Skill

For the basic movements of catching and passing the ball, at least a glimpse of the basics must be known, otherwise, if the ball is dropped and there is no target for the pass, time will be wasted, and the time spent will not be noticed by the timer. This is of great importance in major competitions.

In addition, familiarizing oneself with the rules so that one can answer fluently, and having a strong physique so that one can run without tiring, are also necessary conditions for a basketball referee. If one can do this, then one will not fail to be a typical referee. In a blink of an eye, the Chinese Youth Basketball League will open. In addition to hoping that the matter of beating the referee like in the Western Youth Games will never happen again, I also hope that the gentlemen of the committee will adopt my words and point them out!

### Easy Fitness Exercises (10) (2)

— Tom, translated by Yide

27, Muscles of the Upper Arm

Exercise 1

To develop the muscles of the upper arm, there are two special exercises: the first is to develop the biceps and triceps, which are the muscles for "lifting" and "striking". This exercise makes the front and back of the arm develop completely, and has a beautiful shape when viewed from the side.

Extend both arms horizontally to the left and right, palms facing up. Close both hands as if holding a dumbbell tightly, and use the forearms to bend towards the shoulders, without lowering the elbows or bending the wrists. Then extend to the left and right, returning to the original position. Be careful at first, and then use force to stretch, as if striking an object.

Upper arms extending horizontally to the left and right, bending and extending (10 times each)

Note Special exercises or individual exercises, from 25 to 50 times.

Exercise 2

The second exercise for the upper arm is on the outside of the arm, that is, the depression between the shoulder and elbow. Otherwise, the arm cannot develop completely, and it is especially easy to see when viewed from the front or back.
