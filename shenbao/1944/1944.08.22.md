### Japan's Supreme War Guidance Council

Q: Since the establishment of the Koiso Cabinet, it has been actively strengthening the decisive battle posture. Recently, the Supreme War Guidance Council has been set up. What is the significance of this?

A: Regarding the recent establishment of the "Supreme War Guidance Council" in Japan, judging from the announced information, it is undoubtedly an important measure in the new stage of the decisive battle, and it has a great relationship to the future of the country and the Greater East Asia War. In his first speech after the inauguration ceremony, Prime Minister Koiso mentioned that Japan is currently in a fierce battle, and that there must be a closer connection between state affairs and command. The main purpose of establishing the Supreme War Guidance Council now is to adjust the political and military strategies and formulate the supreme policy for guiding the war.

Q: Japan has been fighting for seven years, and there has long been a supreme command organ for formulating strategies. Why is this new organization necessary?

A: In the past, the highest body in Japan for deciding strategy and command was the Imperial General Headquarters. Speaking of Japan's Imperial General Headquarters, it has a very long history. As early as the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, it was the highest organ for commanding the overall situation in the war, and the Prime Minister of the Cabinet and the President of the Privy Council attended the Imperial General Headquarters meeting to realize the integration of state affairs and command. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the Imperial General Headquarters established in December of the 26th year of the Republic of China is different in nature from the Imperial General Headquarters during the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars. The Chief of the General Staff (currently General Umezu) and the Chief of the Naval General Staff (currently General Oikawa) are co-chiefs of staff, participating in confidential military affairs, which is completely different from the Prime Minister and the President of the Privy Council attending the Imperial General Headquarters meetings during the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars. It is a purely supreme command organ. Under this increasingly fierce war situation, the commander-in-chief must also have the structure of governing state affairs in order to cope with the situation. Therefore, the Supreme War Guidance Council was established.

Q: Then, will the establishment of the Supreme War Guidance Council affect the responsibilities and functions of the original command and state affairs departments?

A: This will not happen. The original supreme command organ is the Imperial General Headquarters, and the supreme state affairs organ is the Cabinet. There was originally a liaison conference between the two. Since November of the 26th year of the Republic of China, the liaison conference was abolished, and a regular meeting was held between the Imperial General Headquarters and the government once a week to exchange information. In this new stage of the decisive battle, in order to adapt to the requirements of the times, the Supreme War Guidance Council was established after imperial sanction, in order to formulate the fundamental policy of war guidance and seek the integration and adjustment of political and military strategies. Therefore, in reality, it is still the function of the original liaison conference between the Imperial General Headquarters and the government, making it further strengthened and promoted. At the same time, it makes the responsibilities of the Imperial General Headquarters and the government more clear, and their functions more effectively utilized.

Q: Then, what is the essential difference between this Supreme War Guidance Council and the liaison conference between the Imperial General Headquarters and the government? What is the significance for the future war situation?

A: The previous liaison conference between the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters and the government was for exchanging information and liaison. Now, in addition to this, the Supreme War Guidance Council is essentially a supreme decision-making body. Once the resolutions of the conference are approved by imperial sanction, they can be absolutely implemented. In particular, in order to adapt to the current internal and external situation of the decisive battle, for the materials, labor, and production distribution in the production aspect of the decisive battle, for the thorough completion of the victory posture of the decisive battle in the country, and for the preparation of the national decisive battle life, etc., with this supreme guidance organ and supreme decision-making organ that integrates the command and the government, it can be more powerfully and effectively realized. Therefore, we believe that Japan's war guidance power will be concentrated and strengthened in the Supreme War Guidance Council in the future, realizing the strong guidance of the integration of political and military strategies, and with the unity of 100 million people to destroy the enemy, we will surely defeat the enemy and achieve victory as soon as possible.

### Contributing to World Peace by Implementing the Greater East Asia Policy: Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's Broadcast Speech Last Night

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Japanese Foreign Minister and Minister of Greater East Asia, Shigemitsu Kui, gave a broadcast speech to various countries in the Greater East Asia region at the Tokyo Central Broadcasting Station at 7:00 p.m. on the 21st, entitled "On Japan's Greater East Asia Policy." The original text is as follows:

Liberating National Shackles and Restoring Autonomous Independence

The policy of the Empire of Japan toward the Greater East Asia region has been clearly realized due to the promotion of Japan's new policy toward China. Therefore, the new policy toward China can be said to be the foundation of East Asia policy. Since January of last year, the new policy toward China has been vigorously promoted, and today, it has almost been fully implemented. Unequal treaties have also been abolished due to the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty of Equality and Mutual Benefit. The treaty also stipulates that when China achieves peace, Japanese troops will immediately withdraw. Therefore, Japan's war aims in China are not to deal with the Chongqing side, but to eliminate the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States. The principle is very clear. At the same time, the East Asia policy has been steadily promoted due to the implementation of the new military policy. So, what is the basic significance of the East Asia policy? This is nothing more than enabling all nations to break away from the shackles of Britain and the United States, liberate themselves, and thus enable each component of East Asia to restore its true autonomy and independence. The reason why the Greater East Asia policy is a policy to thoroughly realize the original posture of the East Asian nations lies in this. Today, the world of East Asia has broken away from the shackles of Britain and the United States and has been liberated, and is further steadily realizing its traditional spirit. Therefore, the Greater East Asia War is actually a war of consciousness in Greater East Asia. Today, the countries and nations of Greater East Asia have gained this consciousness, and China has also been liberated as a result, and has further completed its perfect nation in history. Thailand is also able to fulfill its desire for independence, and Myanmar and the Philippines have also achieved their independence. However, we still look forward to the rise of patriots from all countries today, which is also what the Empire of Japan requires. The East Asia policy is also able to lay its foundation here. In November of the 18th year of Showa (32nd year of the Republic of China), the Greater East Asia Conference was held in Tokyo. At that time, the participating countries, in addition to Japan, included China, Manchukuo, Thailand, Myanmar, and the Philippines. In addition, India also participated in the conference. At this conference, the heads of government of each country announced the implementation of the Greater East Asia Declaration.

Promoting Cooperation and Friendship and Opening up a Sphere of Co-Prosperity

The gist of the five principles of the Greater East Asia Declaration lies in respecting the autonomy and independence of the countries and nations of Greater East Asia, promoting the cooperation and friendship of these ethnic nations, and in restoring the traditional creativity of Asia, which has been liberated, and further forming the foundation for the revitalization of East Asia on the basis of autonomy and independence. This is to expect these nations and countries to help each other, ensure the stability of East Asia, and open up a sphere of co-prosperity and co-existence.

The Greater East Asia Declaration is a Charter for Peace Construction

The major lessons that this Greater East Asia War has given to the people of East Asia are two. One is the trust in one's own strength. Britain and the United States have long deceived other nations with treaties or sweet words, trampled on the independent spirit of other nations, and used material civilization as a weapon to make their spirit and culture numb. However, today they have become aware that any sweet words and promises from others are not enough to be trusted. At the same time, they are also aware that their own demands can only be realized by their own strength. There is no good plan other than divine providence and self-help. Therefore, East Asia should also rely on the strength of the people of East Asia to achieve revitalization. The second lesson is the development of the Yamato spirit. The Yamato spirit not only exists in the Greater East Asia region, but also extends to the entire world and becomes the keynote of international relations. However, all nations and countries in the world develop resources, communicate culture, and further contribute to the progress of the world under the principles of equality and mutual benefit. The foundation of world peace can be completed here. Regarding this point, there are also clear instructions in the Greater East Asia Declaration. Therefore, the Greater East Asia Declaration is indeed a charter for world peace construction.

The Enemy's Attempt to Monopolize Distribution is Obvious

The enemy's purpose is to permanently bind Asia, infinitely exploit East Asia, and attempt to eliminate the enlightened Japan in Asia in order to realize their past means, which is to destroy Japan without war. Conversely, the current means is to destroy Japan, and even the entire East Asia, by force. Therefore, Japan rose up resolutely for its own and East Asia's self-preservation and self-defense. Therefore, this war is actually a war launched out of necessity in East Asia. Recently, knowledgeable people in Britain and the United States have had to admit this, and it has become a world problem. This is a well-known fact. However, in order to dominate the world, they rely on force and use the Cairo Conference resolution to replace the Greater East Asia Declaration, and remobilize to arbitrarily handle the future world and monopolize and dominate it. Their attempt to dominate the world has become obvious. What is most questionable is that they are now waging a world war on the one hand, and actively preparing for the future world war on the other.

Japan Will Persistently Carry Out the War with the Power and Courage of the Whole Country

This great war is a war to determine right and wrong. There will inevitably be a process of advance and retreat. However, the more the enemy advances, the more quickly they fall into danger, and the more opportunities they give us. Because the war of justice will surely win the final victory. This is the iron rule of ancient and modern times. After this cabinet change, Japan is still determined to maintain its foreign policy, closely cooperate with its allies, and bravely carry out this just war with the powerful momentum of the entire country. It will strive to implement the Greater East Asia Policy, which can be called a just policy. At the same time, it will further promote the good-neighborliness policy with the Yamato spirit, so as to permanently ensure the stability of East Asia and contribute to world peace. This is our sacred purpose.

Kwantung's Military Strength, Resource Production Achievements are Excellent

Dalian, 21st (Central News Agency) - Mr. Morioka, the Economic Minister of the Kwantung Leased Territory, recently made a statement on the salt production situation and food situation of Kwantung's military resources, as follows:

The salt production situation is very good due to the suitable climate, and it is expected that it will definitely break through this year's goal. In addition, the production of raw salt, which is essential for aircraft, is also quite good, so a significant increase in aircraft production next year is highly anticipated. Although there was no rainfall during the planting of agricultural crops, it has gradually improved recently, so it will be possible to ensure this year's harvest. The distribution of daily necessities such as cotton cloth is carried out simultaneously with Manchukuo. Thirty new agricultural warehouses are being built and will be completed this autumn.

### Enemy Planes Re-attack Kyushu, Still Failed to Achieve Results

Twenty-three planes attacked the previous day; Sergeant Yamada and two others died heroically.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 6:00 a.m. on the 21st: About 20 U.S. Air Force planes stationed in Chongqing re-attacked northern Kyushu and western China around 0:00 a.m. on the 21st for about an hour. Japanese losses were minor.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:00 p.m. on the 21st: Regarding the enemy plane air raid on Kyushu and western China on the evening of the 20th, the main situation has become clear afterwards, as follows: The attacking enemy planes totaled about 80. Twenty-three enemy planes were shot down. Three of our intercepting planes were lost. Those who heroically died while attacking enemy planes are as follows: Army Trainee Chief Yamada Mamoru, Sergeant Nobe Shigeo, and Private First Class Takagi Denzo.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - The U.S. Air Force attacked northern Kyushu, Japan, at dusk on the 20th. They re-attacked late at night on the same day. A portion of them also invaded the northern part of China. Because they were intercepted by the Japanese army's air defense forces, they were unable to succeed and immediately fled. The enemy planes adopted a method of dispersed air raids, infiltrating one by one. Because it was impossible to find the target in the dark, they could not invade important areas. They only dropped bombs, incendiary bombs, and flares in the suburban mountains and fields. Although there were some fires on the ground, they were immediately extinguished, so the losses were very small. The enemy planes still used the fires caused by the daytime bombings, trying to expand the results of the night raids. However, the fires caused by the initial dusk air raid were also extinguished before the second air raid, so the enemy's attack failed to achieve any results. A total of about 80 American planes raided, of which about 30% were lost, and they did not achieve any results. All of their attempts failed. In addition to the enemy's loss of 23 planes, it is expected that there are also a considerable number that have not returned to base. On the contrary, in addition to the Japanese side's loss of three planes, some planes were also hit by bullets. The U.S. Army Department originally intended to use this bombing as the starting point for a regular air raid on Japan, so they had high expectations for it. However, because the Japanese plane's defenses were strict, the enemy air force's ambition was completely in vain.

### Central Memorial Week

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Central Department of the Chinese Kuomintang held the 215th Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week in the Party Department's auditorium at 10:00 a.m. on the 21st. More than 600 people attended, including central supervisory committee members and staff from various departments and committees, government agencies, and Kuomintang members. Minister of Discipline Wu Lanyi chaired the meeting. After performing the ceremony, Committee Member Guo Xiufeng reported on "The News and Communications Industry." The meeting adjourned at 11:00 a.m.

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - The National Government held a weekly meeting in the auditorium at 9:00 a.m. on the 21st of this month.

### Japan Promotes Agricultural Land

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - In order to expand the planting area of ​​wheat, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce promoted the improvement of farmland last year. As a result, the planting area this year has increased to 1.87 million hectares. The planting area of ​​wheat next year will be further expanded. As a result of various studies, the area of ​​barren wasteland and the improvement of existing farmland has newly increased by 100,000 hectares, totaling 2.1 million hectares. With more than 40 days before the autumn planting season, farmers are working enthusiastically. Due to the lack of snow last winter and poor weather during the growing season, there was much pessimism in early spring regarding this year's wheat production. However, since mid-spring, the weather has improved, resulting in good results. The actual yield this spring is estimated to be 27 million shih or 26 million shih. According to a survey by the Japanese commercial authorities, the area of ​​barren land and newly developed forests utilized this year has reached more than 100,000 hectares. By thoroughly utilizing the waterless highlands of rivers, another 30,000 hectares of new farmland can be obtained, expanding the 2 million 800,000 hectares planned last year by 100,000 hectares. With such vast farmland, it is not difficult to obtain a wheat yield of 10 million shih.

### The Future of Chongqing-Communist Cooperation is Full of Hidden Reefs

Central News Agency - Regarding the Chongqing-Communist disputes, although the Chongqing side has recently expressed hope for improved cooperation, the Communist Party is dissatisfied with the Chongqing side's statement, and its future is full of hidden reefs, making cooperation difficult. Recently, according to reliable sources, the recent Chongqing-Communist content is quite detailed, and is recorded as follows:

The result of the previous Xi'an talks, the visit of the Chinese Communist Party representative Lin Zuhan to Chongqing, the beginning and end of the talks between the two sides, have yet to be clearly expressed. However, according to Liang Saicao, the propaganda minister of the Chongqing side, in a regular meeting with foreign reporters on July 26, he made a statement on the adjustment of Chongqing-Communist cooperation. According to Liang, there are too many difficulties in adjusting the relationship between the Chongqing and Communist parties.

Obstacles to resolution are: although the Communist Party is cooperating with the Kuomintang on the surface, the beliefs and statements of the Communist Party are absolutely opposite in fact. In order to resolve the county case between the Chongqing and Jiang parties, the following proposals were put forward: The Chongqing side recognizes the Communist Party as a legal entity. The 18th Group Army will be reorganized into four armies and twelve divisions. The reorganization of this army will be under the jurisdiction of the Chongqing side. The Chongqing side recognizes the continued existence of the border area government, and the areas under the jurisdiction of the provincial government will also be directly controlled by the Chongqing side. When the National Assembly is held in the future, the Chongqing side will recognize that all parties and factions enjoy equal status. Yan'an has not yet formally responded to this proposal of the Kuomintang, but has only put forward seventeen requests and conditions, which were negotiated by the Chongqing-Communist representatives three months ago, but in principle:

There are fundamental differences, and the Chongqing side is continuing its efforts to adjust the relationship between the two sides, and is trying to find ways to improve the situation, but the situation is quite difficult. Originally, from the viewpoint of the Chongqing side and the viewpoint of the Yan'an regime, Liang actually said that there was not much disagreement in fact, and that it had been partially resolved and a mutual understanding had been reached. After Liang made the above statement, Zhou Enlai of the Communist Party made a statement to the Xinhua Daily reporter in Yan'an on August 12, refuting Liang's statement. Zhou said that the improvement and adjustment of the Chongqing-Communist relationship can be responsible and clear, and the Chongqing side has not solved any of the Communist Party's problems in terms of specifics or small issues. As for the disagreement in the Communist Party's viewpoint and the difficulty in fundamental resolution, it is a kind of:

Erroneous view of those at home and abroad who are concerned about the relationship between the two parties, so there is considerable attention to the principles on which the two sides resolve the problem. In addition, the responsibility for the obstacles to resolution does not lie with the Communist Party, but with the dictatorship of the Kuomintang in Chongqing. Therefore, Liang's statement is not in line with the facts, because the Communist Party's proposal came first, and the Chongqing side's request came later. However, for the sake of compromise, the Communist Party changed the proposal to eleven written items and eight oral items, which were handed over to Chongqing representatives Zhang Zhizhong and Gong Jie on June 5. However, the Chongqing side's proposal is too far from the Communist Party's opinion, and Zhou's Zhengshi statement said that the 20 conditions proposed by the Communist Party are not twelve. Regarding the military importance of the Communist Party's conditions, implement democratic politics, guarantee the people's freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and suggestion.

Recognize the Communist Party and all parties and factions as legal entities, and release national political prisoners. Implement a truly democratic local public security.

The Chongqing side should organize five armies and sixteen divisions of the Communist army, and provide assistance in the form of supplies, ammunition, medicines, and various aid. Recognize the elected governments of the Sui, Gan, and Ning border regions and the base areas in North China, Central China, and South China as legal local autonomous governments. The Chongqing side should lift the military and economic blockade of each border area. Stop the military offensive against the Communist army. Request the Chongqing side to distribute the materials, weapons, ammunition, money, and aid provided by Britain and the United States to China in a fair proportion to the 18th Group Army and the New Fourth Army. Request that the Chongqing side jointly revoke the contempt for the Chinese Communist Party and the names of the traitors and military districts who attacked the 18th Group Army and the New Fourth Army. Stop the sabotage work of the security personnel against the 18th Group Army and the New Fourth Army. Prohibit the disclosure of rumors against the Chinese Communist Party in the newspapers.

Release the arrested personnel in various places. Stop the unreasonable inspection of the Xinhua Daily. Restore the CCP offices in Chongqing and Xi'an. Permit the staff of the two offices to:

Freedom of movement between Chongqing, Xi'an, and Yan'an, and be able to:

Reside in the area and be free to purchase daily necessities. Zhou Enlai once said that the conditions proposed by the Communist Party are still under negotiation and have not ended, and the hidden crisis has not passed. However, since Zhou made the statement, the Chongqing side has been quite dissatisfied. On the 16th of the month, Qian Cao met with foreign reporters and again raised this point, saying that the CCP situation is based on Chongqing's intelligence and Zhou's published statement, and there are many differences, and the facts obtained by the Chongqing side are contradictory, so it is pointed out that Zhou should bear considerable responsibility. Therefore, the relationship between Chongqing and the Communist Party and future cooperation are difficult to cooperate with in fact from the Communist Party's point of view.

### French Government Instructs Decoux to Be Granted Full Authority to Manage Vietnam: Vietnam to Convene Supreme Council Tomorrow

Saigon, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Vietnamese government recently announced that the French government has instructed Governor-General Decoux to be granted full authority to manage Vietnam. The general idea of the order is: The legal authority of the Governor-General of Vietnam has always been recognized by the domestic government. The government is deeply concerned about the current severe situation and is deeply concerned that there may be a break in the connection between the Vietnamese side and the domestic government in the future. It is specially granted to Governor-General Decoux the authority to make decisions in the future. This kind of measure has long been generally expected. From the perspective of the law promulgated on February 18, 1943, Article 90 of the bill states that if the telecommunications between Vietnam and the country are cut off, special powers will be granted. The law is stipulated based on Article 12 of the Constitution and the addendum to the same article, and is approved by the Cabinet Council. The original text is as follows: (Article 1) During the period when telecommunications between France and Indochina are cut off, according to existing laws, all powers that must be approved and decided by the domestic government are temporarily granted to the Governor-General. (Omitted below) The granting of this full power, that is, the French government's telegram to Governor Decoux, will have the same effect even if it is not completely cut off. Governor Decoux has actually obtained the same status as the previous heads in the implementation of wartime measures in Vietnam. From the Japanese perspective, Vietnam will be able to adhere to its original intention and increase its friendship in the future in fulfilling the defense agreement and maintaining friendly relations between the allied countries and Japan.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Vietnamese government broadcast at 8:00 p.m. on the 20th that the government will grant all powers to Governor Decoux, so that he can obtain the dictatorial status of wartime measures. At the same time, it also issued a statement on the incident. From then on, Vietnam's wartime system will be strengthened. Under the leadership of Governor Decoux, it will move forward as part of Greater East Asia. To this end, Governor Decoux recently invited members of the Supreme Council and the heads of various states to hold talks. It is heard that the Supreme Council and the heads of state meetings will be officially convened starting on the 23rd. The chairman of the meeting, Governor Decoux, will formally express the fact that full power has been entrusted, and will ask for support. At the same time, agreements will be reached on promoting future cooperation with Japanese policies and important issues in Vietnam.

### American Reporter Praises Japan's Courageous Spirit, Admits US Operations Will Become More Difficult

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) – Associated Press military reporters Johnsen and John Lantan, recently returned from the Mariana Islands front, spoke on the 19th at the Royal Madrid US Garage about the fighting spirit of Japanese soldiers as follows: "On the Saipan, Guam, and Tinian battle lines, we witnessed the courageous spirit of the Japanese army. They are not only unafraid of death, but each of their faces is filled with an expression of willing sacrifice. For example, when the American army attacked mountainous areas in Saipan, the Japanese soldiers shouted 'Banzai' and charged forward. The Japanese troops in Tinian and Guam also dared to launch courageous offensives. The Japanese army forgets everything during combat, so future Pacific battles will become increasingly difficult, and the US military will have to accept significant sacrifices."

Enemy Aircraft Formation Attacks Rabaul

Rabaul, 21st (Central News Agency) – Yesterday, a large formation of enemy aircraft attacked Rabaul on New Britain Island. After a resolute anti-aircraft defense by the Japanese army, the enemy suffered considerable losses and was forced to flee. One aircraft was shot down by intense Japanese fire into the sea east of Rabaul. Several American soldiers on board struggled for their lives in the water, in a very sorry state. Suddenly, an aircraft appeared at low altitude, and they thought they would be saved, so they raised their hands and shouted. Their joy and gratitude were imaginable. Unexpectedly, after circling two or three times, the American aircraft suddenly unleashed intense gunfire from its machine guns, strafing the comrades floating on the sea. Thus, the stranded men could not escape death in the end. They were unwilling to die with the aircraft, which is an inherent national characteristic of the American people, but how should such an act of shooting survivors after a battle be explained?

Battle Situation of Japanese Troops in Tengyue and Other Areas

Yunnan Front, 21st (Central News Agency) – The Chongqing army on the Tengyue front launched an attack on the Japanese army's front-line positions at dawn on the 15th, under the cover of powerful artillery fire. The Japanese army immediately engaged in battle, and after fierce fighting, the entire Chongqing army, except for a part near the south gate of Tengyue, was repelled. From the 14th to the 16th, the Chongqing army abandoned over 440 corpses, while the Japanese army suffered 48 fatalities.

On the 14th and 15th, the Chongqing army abandoned 85 corpses, one heavy machine gun, and one mortar, while the Japanese army suffered three casualties. In the Longling area, the Japanese army ambushed and repelled the Chongqing army attacking the eastern flank positions. The artillery fire on the Chongqing army positions north of the city gradually increased. On that day, about 600 Chongqing soldiers attacked from Guochang Street, and the Japanese army engaged them in fierce fighting and repelled them. On the 15th and 16th, the Chongqing army abandoned 690 corpses in the area, while the Japanese army suffered 13 fatalities. The Chongqing army around Mangshi gradually became active since the 16th. On that day, about 500 Chongqing soldiers attacked the northern positions, and the Japanese army immediately counterattacked.

### Fierce Fighting Rages All Day on Normandy Plain

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: German troops in Normandy valiantly resisted the fierce attacks of British and American superior tank units on Saturday, but were all repelled. Fierce fighting raged all day in the Trun area and further south, with extremely heavy losses on both sides. As a result, the enemy's fierce attacks were all blocked in the Torunai area. American tank and mechanized detachments advanced westward towards Argentan from the southwest, but made little progress. West of Caen, Canadian troops continued to attempt to make progress eastward and southeastward along the Dives River estuary. Although they had a numerical advantage, especially in tanks, they could only break through a few gaps, forcing the German army to withdraw to the Goustranville area. There is no news of large-scale operations on the Loire River front. The town of Pacy, southwest of Vernon, was reoccupied by German tank units. Powerful German fighter-bombers, under the protection of fighter planes, participated day and night in the great battle in the Falaise-Argentan area.

Meanwhile, an American mobile unit is advancing north from Toulon towards Marseille. The anti-Axis forces commander's office announced: Seven British naval aircraft carriers and two American aircraft carriers have joined forces and are cooperating in operations over the Riviera bridgehead.

### German Ships in Gulf of Riga Bombard Soviet Positions, Soviet Advance in South Fails

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – Coastal News Agency reports: The German Navy, including several cruisers, entered the Gulf of Riga yesterday morning and bombarded Soviet positions and rear areas. The German army, navy, and air force are now all participating in the Eastern Front battles. In the past 24 hours, Soviet troops launched attacks from northern Estonia to the lower reaches of the Dniester River, but not in a coordinated manner. The Baltic Sea area is characterized by mobile warfare.

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports that the Soviet army increased the number of new forces to the Iasi front on Friday and completed preparations for the offensive in this area. Then, on Saturday, they launched a large-scale offensive to the south with fierce artillery cover as a prelude. The first Soviet offensive, mainly infantry, created a gap of about two kilometers deep, but collapsed under the concentrated defensive fire of the German artillery and machine guns. The Red Army offensive between the Siret and Vistula rivers failed. In the bridgehead downstream of the Vistula River, a major battle unfolded as the Soviet army attempted to expand its gap to the northwest. A group of German combat units, temporarily cut off from communication in the area, regained contact with the main German forces in the area after a powerful counterattack. In the Omatton area, the Soviet army launched no less than fourteen linked-arm offensives throughout the day, covered by powerful artillery and tanks, but were all frustrated. The mid-section of the Eastern Front saw a major battle begin northeast of Warsaw, where the summer weather was oppressive, with temperatures around 30 degrees Celsius on the Celsius scale. After more than an hour of covering artillery fire, the Soviet army began an offensive along a broad front. In the fierce fighting between the two sides, casualties were very heavy. In southern Lithuania, the German army straightened its lines in the area. On the Latvian front, the Soviet army continued to attempt to break through west of Madona on the fourth day, but only broke through one gap, causing the German army to slightly withdraw its lines. West of Pskov, at the southeastern end of the Estonian front, the Soviet army continued to launch large-scale offensives to the west and north. The German forces operating in the area have been rescued by powerful main force squadrons in recent days, defeating the Soviet vanguard.

### British Forces Launch New Offensive on Italian East Coast

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: British auxiliary units, after heavy bombardment, launched a large-scale offensive yesterday, covered by tanks, between the Adriatic coast and the Umbria-Marche Apennines. Between Consfan Chai and Mondolfo, the enemy's vanguard penetrated the German line. Nineteen enemy tanks were destroyed in this battle. As the British army joined the battle with strong reinforcements, the German army had to withdraw its lines from the strongholds. East of Monteveglio, the enemy's offensive was repelled by a powerful German counterattack. The battle in the area continued throughout the night, and the situation was tense again this morning. British positions near Florence were heavily bombarded by German artillery. On the Ligurian coast, as American forces bombarded German positions, German forces retaliated with heavy artillery fire in the Tetera and Pisa areas.

### Elements of Victory (I)

— Toshio Shiratori

——Annihilating the Ambition of the Enemy America——

Mr. Toshio Shiratori is currently 58 years old. He graduated from Tokyo University in the third year of the Taisho era and entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the fourth year of the Showa era, he served as the head of the Second Intelligence Division, and in the fifth year, he served as the head of the Intelligence Department. When Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, he fulfilled his major mission as a spokesperson. In the eighth year of the Showa era, he was stationed in Sweden as Minister Plenipotentiary, concurrently stationed in Norway and Denmark. In September of the thirteenth year of Showa, he was appointed as Ambassador to Italy, where he made great contributions to the conclusion of the Anti-Comintern Axis of Japan, Germany, and Italy. He retired in the fifteenth year of Showa and served as a diplomatic advisor during the second Konoe cabinet. He is currently a member of the House of Representatives and the President of the Allied Comrades Association.

Japan has three enemies—England, America, and Chongqing. Here, I only want to examine how to defeat America, and I will discuss Chongqing separately for the time being. The abundance of American material resources is known to everyone today. It might even be said that it is overemphasized a bit. But is America merely a vehicle of material resources, and does it not possess anything in the spiritual sense? That is not necessarily the case. America is originally composed of various races, and its history of founding a country is short, so it cannot yet be said to be a complete nation. Once a war occurs, it harbors various weaknesses. But at least 60 to 70 percent of its citizens come from relatively excellent ethnic groups in Europe. However, when viewed as individuals, there are indeed people who cannot be viewed too highly.

The Source of the American People's Will to Fight

Three years have passed since the start of the war. The domestic situation in the United States has not yet developed any major flaws. Although the sacrifices of the war are great, the general public's will to fight is very strong, which is slightly different from what we thought before the war, and seems unexpected.

What is the reason for their strong will to fight? First, the American people are comfortable, and they believe that the war situation in the first year or two unfolded favorably. Second, military production has reached its peak today. This is very different compared to our country. Therefore, they are confident in their superiority in material resources. Third, they look down on certain races based on their sense of Anglo-American superiority. They speak freely and close their mouths with equality, but in reality, they are a people with very strong racial prejudice. This is the origin of the American domestic sense of superiority over blacks. This sense of superiority extends and expands to all colored races. They have an extraordinary sense of superiority, and even towards our country, which suffered a major blow in various battles, the sense of superiority temporarily gradually diminished, but later, with the changes in the war situation, it was revived again.

In the early stages of the war, they suffered a major defeat. In the end, they all had the determination to avenge Pearl Harbor. The government also wrote the slogan "Remember Pearl Harbor" and worked hard to promote it. This had an unexpected impact on the simple American people, and their hostility towards Japan became very strong. In short, their will to fight is the intensity of their hostility toward Japan and the delusion of material resources. They are confident that final victory is almost certain, which comes from elements such as a sense of national superiority. When their will to fight is analyzed, it is like the above-mentioned, groundless and easily dispersed. Therefore, as long as the situation on the battlefield is reversed once, they immediately feel the sadness of disillusionment. I believe that even if the American people can endure any difficulties, even if the war becomes a long-term war, they will never have the enthusiasm and determination to persevere to the end.

The reason why Roosevelt hopes for a short-term war is that he actually wants to win in one fell swoop today when material resources have reached their peak and the national will to fight is at its highest. Otherwise, the morale of the people will inevitably slacken, and the atmosphere of war-weariness will spread. Moreover, the various domestic situations felt as a result of rectifying the wartime situation over the past three years will inevitably produce flaws. Before the reactionary period comes, failure to end the war will be unproductive. This is the reason why Roosevelt is eager to seek a short-term decisive battle. If the morale of the people in the rear does not waver, even if the war becomes a long-term war, the United States will not necessarily waver. What Roosevelt suffers from is that he has no confidence in the morale of the people and the national will to fight.

From this perspective of the spiritual elements of wartime America, it can be seen that its foundation is quite weak. Unlike Germany and Japan, they clearly recognize the purpose of the war and have a solid foundation to fight to the end regardless of any sacrifice.

The Ambition of the Jews

But here we must deeply consider that the will to fight of the American leaders after Roosevelt is quite solid and vigorous. Speaking of the American leaders, everyone knows that they are the financial cliques of money power, that is, the Jews and the accomplices of the mutual aid group. For the most part, from the perspective of the general American public, even if they fail in this war, neither Japan nor the country will seize America. It can be ended as long as it is agreed not to interfere in Asia and Europe. But even from the perspective of its leaders, that is, the Jews, this war is an attempt to complete the ambition of establishing a new world in one fell swoop after several centuries. If this war fails, not only will their dream of controlling the world be shattered in one fell swoop, but it will also cause large-scale anti-Semitism all over the world, leading the nation to destruction. Therefore, from their point of view, it is a war that they cannot lose no matter what. It is generally said that the British and American people have no purpose in war. The general public may be like this, but their leaders harbor the ambition to control the world. England, America, and pre-war France completely joined hands for this relationship. What is the Jewish world like? Generally, judging from their actions to date, its outline can be clearly seen. However, in the past, it was a world promoted by the two forces of capitalism and communism. This is better said to be a transitional strategy. I believe the ultimate goal is world communization. They also want to do this to England and America. They plan to use Jewish power to grasp the governments of these countries and directly control the world. Using all their strength and indirect methods of manipulating public opinion is not only a mild means, but also after the tragedy of this war, assuming they win, there is fear of pursuing responsibility for the war. Therefore, they cannot but use autocratic suppression no matter what. In the United States, Roosevelt even wanted to be re-elected for two terms as president, planning to become a dictator. On the one hand, he implemented a new distribution system, grasping the labor stage, and thus the foundation of dictatorship was already solid. They believed that America's leaning towards communism was imminent.

The ideal world of the Jews is to use this kind of power with dictatorial power to suppress non-Jewish nations. On the one hand, they use the hundreds of billions of gold yuan they have accumulated to issue Jewish currency, suppressing the world politically and economically. Thus, in the final stage, they worship the God of Iwahber as the absolute God of the universe, causing all mankind to bow down to this God, making the long-cherished wish of Jewish hope. From this perspective, it is easy to see how the Jewish non-hope violates the original meaning of the Japanese national polity, that is, the grand plan of the Eight-Cord Universe.

Don't some people say that in New Guinea, in the Marshall Islands, or in the Mariana Islands, the wariness of the enemy soldiers who come to invade at the cost of vast sacrifices is not extremely hot and cannot be underestimated? But this is their leaders' domestic propaganda strategy. As mentioned above, not only Americans, but the struggle of mankind is a common struggle, and it is the origin of their will to fight. Probably any nation, once on the battlefield, fights quite bravely. They believe that victory is near, so a certain degree of bravery is not incomprehensible.

### Oil and Grain Control Committee Handles Registration of Cooking Oil Inventory to Prevent Hoarding and Manipulation, Suppress Market Prices

Since its reorganization, the Oil and Grain Control Committee of the Commerce Control Association is actively studying concrete plans for the implementation of unified management of oil and grains. However, in view of the recent sharp rise in edible oil prices, although due to the increase in consumption, speculation by general speculators and high prices are also the biggest problem.

In order to understand the status of edible oil storage and sales in the Shanghai area, prevent hoarding and speculation, and suppress market prices, the Temporary Registration Rules for Cooking Oil Inventory Sales in the Shanghai Area have been formulated and agreed upon with the relevant authorities. All manufacturers, vendors, and retailers must register all inventory with the Shanghai District Cooking Oil Industry Association (i.e., the old Edward Road, No. 15), before the 26th of this month. The registration rules are noted as follows:

Registration Rules

Temporary Registration Rules for Cooking Oil Inventory Sales in the Shanghai Area: Article 1: These rules are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 of the Provisional Measures for Unified Management of Oil and Grains in order to clarify the status of edible oil storage and sales in the Shanghai area. The aforementioned Shanghai area refers to the area within the control line. Article 2: Manufacturers, vendors, and retailers shall register all inventory with the Shanghai District Cooking Oil Industry Association (Union) (hereinafter referred to as the Association) before August 26. However, those with inventory of less than five units may be exempted from registration. Article 3: From August 26, manufacturers shall register the quantity of products and sales daily, vendors shall register the quantity of sales daily, and retailers shall register the quantity of sales every half month with the Association. Article 4: The registration forms for the previous two articles shall be printed and distributed by the Association according to a separately determined style. Article 5: The Association shall forward the registration information stipulated in the second and third articles to the Federation and submit it to the Oil and Grain Control Committee of the National Commercial Control Association. Article 6: The Association shall issue a certificate of compliance with the registration requirements of the second and third articles to members who have complied with the registration requirements. Article 7: Members who violate the provisions of these rules, or who conceal or falsely report information, shall be reported to the competent authorities in accordance with the Regulations on Punishing Hoarding of Major Commodities for punishment in accordance with the law. Article 8: These rules shall be submitted to the National Commercial Control Association for record.

Definitely Not Buying

According to the person in charge of the Oil and Grain Control Committee, the purpose of the implementation of these rules is not to buy up inventory or to impose any restrictions on sales. It is only intended to clarify the circulation process, prevent speculation by non-industry personnel and unscrupulous colleagues in the spirit of merchant self-governance.

### Special Tax Office Corruption Case, Three More Detained, Assistant Section Chief and Two Directors

The municipal financial authorities, in order to deal with the corruption case in the Special Tax Section, have detained four people: the head of the section, Zou Shaoji, the assistant head of the section, Xu Shengui, and the directors Wu Songling and Zhu Junqing, pending interrogation. The position of head of the Special Tax Section is temporarily held concurrently by Shi Hua, the head of the Third Section, dispatched by the Bureau. It is found that Mr. Shi has served as a lawyer in the Finance Office of the former Public Works Bureau since 1932. After the Financial Bureau took over the Finance Office of the district, he served as the head of the Land Tax Section. It is expected that he will be able to be conscientious in the future.

### Food Rice Registration Points, Clause Corrections

The Economic Security Office previously published the "Key Points of Food Rice Registration Procedures". The first and third clauses are corrected as follows:

Key Points of Economic Security Office Procedures:

"Food rice that has been registered, even if it is within the registered amount," is a mistake for "even if it is above the registered amount."

"After registering with the Goods Distribution Office of this Office, if new rice is purchased, and the remaining registered rice exceeds the specified amount, it must be submitted to this Office in writing within three days," should be changed to "After registering the remaining rice after registering with this Office and the Municipal Goods Distribution Office, and the combined amount of purchasing new rice, if it exceeds the previously registered amount, it must be submitted to this Office in writing within three days."

### Information Department of the Japanese Embassy: Yesterday's Press Conference

The Shanghai office of the Allied Japanese Embassy,

with Information Department Chief Matsudaira quietly heading to Beijing from Shanghai on official business.

The regular press conference of the office was held as usual yesterday, with Vice-Consul Fukuma representing

the office in meeting with local Chinese news reporters.

The conference was held at 2:30 PM on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road.

Both sides engaged in a frank discussion for a long time, lasting one and a half hours.

### Economy Association Holds Standing Committee Meeting

The Shanghai Special Municipality Economy Association

held a standing committee meeting the day before yesterday.

The standing committee members, chief secretaries, and deputy chief secretaries attended.

Minister of Social Welfare, Mr. Ding Mocun, was respectfully invited to attend and provide guidance.

Many important matters were discussed, and it was decided to strictly implement the "National Banquet Restriction Measures."

Staff will be dispatched to be stationed at major restaurants to conduct on-site inspections and guidance.

It was also decided to jointly convene a meeting within the week with the Social Welfare Bureau

to talk with responsible persons from various restaurants and hotels. Furthermore, the association, in view of the annual

autumn occurrence of so-called Taiping Gongjiao or Yulan Shenghui events, deemed such

unnecessary activities inappropriate during this critical period of decisive battle. Therefore, it was decided to strictly

prohibit them. It is heard that a meeting will be convened with representatives from the baojia system soon to discuss

how to cooperate and implement this measure, and at the same time, a request will be submitted to the governing authority to issue an order of prohibition.

### Public Utilities Bureau Unifies Management of Advertising Business

Since the advertising business in this city

was transferred to the unified management of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau in February of this year,

the bureau, based on practical needs, first focused on the eight districts

and began implementing the regulations based on the city's Advertising Management Rules.

This has now come to a conclusion. On the first of this month, the First District

Office was ordered to be abolished. From now on, municipal administration

will be unified, and advertising matters within the district will be handled directly by the bureau.

Any advertisements that obstruct the city's appearance or violate regulations

will be strictly prohibited.

In the future, if merchants need to erect any advertisements,

they can directly apply to the advertising section of the bureau's Second Division in accordance with regulations. All

advertisements that have already been erected within the former First District

must be re-applied for replacement from this bureau

to avoid being penalized. It is also heard that the bureau has revised

the measures for managing advertising companies in this city

and submitted them to the municipal government for approval and implementation. All businesses engaged in advertising

in this city, in addition to holding a business license from the Economic Bureau, must

also register with the bureau and obtain a business certificate for advertising companies

before they can operate.

### Shanghai Anti-Smoking Hospital Established Yesterday

will all be performed. In addition, there will be guqin and sword dance

performances, creating a serene and elegant atmosphere, unprecedented. The president of the Chinese Music Research Association, Sun Yude,

is one of the few experts in dongxiao and pipa in the country. He previously traveled

to Europe and America and gave public performances.

He was very popular in the United States, and his box office success

broke all previous records. After returning to China, Mr. Sun

gathered his colleagues and continued his research.

He has performed in this city several times and received great praise.

In the latter half of June of this year, he gave his sixth performance

at the New Heart Grand Theater, which was highly praised by both Chinese and foreign audiences.

is one of the leading pianists in the country, and she has great insights

into the works of Chopin and Liszt. Miss Wang Wenyu was invited by Madam Sun Yat-sen, Song Qingling,

to sing solo in Hong Kong, and her name carries great weight. Huang Yongxi

### The City Government Forbids the Issuance of French Charity Lottery Tickets; They Have Never Applied to Our Government for Approval

Since the issuance of the "French Charity Lottery,"

they have never applied to our government for approval,

which is not in compliance with the law.

Furthermore, the issuance of lottery tickets is by no means ordinary commerce.

Not only are foreigners not allowed to issue them within our country,

but even our own people,

unless specially approved by the governing authority,

may not rashly issue them. Furthermore, it has been found that the purchasers

of the French lottery tickets are purely our people,

while the beneficiaries are not our compatriots,

which is especially contrary to legal principles and human sentiments.

After receiving accusations from all sectors, the Ministry of Social Welfare

sent people to investigate and confirmed the facts. In addition to notifying the

Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance for their attention,

it also requested the Shanghai Special Municipal Government to order the

company to stop issuing the lottery tickets by the end of August,

handle the closure, and order the public announcement of the past accounts.

The Municipal Government of this city

forwarded the order to the Social Welfare Bureau and the Police Bureau,

dispatching personnel to carry it out. The Social Welfare Bureau further notified all shops to

prohibit the sale of French charity lottery tickets.

At the same time, the French Consul in Shanghai

also forwarded an order to the company to stop issuing the lottery tickets and

close as scheduled.

Report from the Ministry of Social Welfare

The report from the Ministry of Social Welfare regarding

the investigation into the inside story of the lottery tickets is extracted as follows: The reason for the establishment:

During the Shanghai Incident in 1932, refugees from the suburbs

poured into the city. Those who survived the war and were suffering from hunger and cold were pitiful. The French

Father Jacquinot, witnessing this situation, appealed to all parties

to demarcate refugee areas in Nanshi,

and millions of refugees were spared from freezing and starvation.

However, the expenses were enormous, and all the funds at that time

were obtained through donations, which were far from sufficient.

The following autumn, the French Jesuits and others

initiated the charity lottery, with the surplus after prizes and expenses

being used to maintain the refugee area. This was the reason for the establishment of the French Lottery. General organization: The operating structure

of the French Charity Lottery

is a company.

When it was established, it was registered with the French Consulate General

in accordance with French law, with no

official dividends, and all authority was controlled by the board of directors. The board has one chairman

and five directors. In addition to one each from Norway and Switzerland, the rest are all French.

Below the board of directors is a committee for distributing charity funds, with eight members.

One each from Norway, Switzerland, and China,

and the remaining five seats are all French. The lottery drawing committee has four people,

one from France and three from China, but

the Chinese are only in name and have never actually

participated. The auditors are also two French. Distribution standards: The distribution

of the income from this lottery is as follows:

Prizes account for 50%, and expenses

and charitable donations each account for

25%. Recent developments: After the National

Government returned to the capital, the villages gradually became peaceful,

and the refugees continued to return. The relief work in the Nanshi

refugee area came to an end.

However, the charity lottery continued

to be issued without interruption. The proceeds

were mostly donated to foreign chambers of commerce,

while the benefits to our Chinese people were few,

which is far from the original purpose of the establishment. Note:

The issuance of lottery tickets should normally be approved by the

Ministry of Finance. In the case of charity lottery tickets,

the permission of the Ministry of Social Welfare should also be obtained.

When the Shanghai French Charity Lottery was first issued,

it coincided with the westward relocation of the former government,

and it was not filed with our National Government for approval in accordance with the law, which was forgivable. However,

from 1940, when the National Government returned to the capital, until

last year, when the concessions were returned, it was not

submitted to our competent authorities for approval, which is improper.

Furthermore, this type of public undertaking

is by no means ordinary commerce, and no one

can operate it. Even if they are Chinese, they

must be specially approved before they can organize it.

It is against international practice for foreign businesses to issue lottery tickets

within our country. Moreover, since the lottery began,

its income and expenditure situation

and distribution standards have never been publicly announced,

and its responsible persons are all French, who monopolize and control it,

which is unavoidable. Therefore, there are many suspicions and criticisms from all sectors.

### Most Primary and Secondary Schools in This City are Setting Up Free Enrollment Quotas

The examination for the scholarship fund for impoverished

students organized by the Municipal Education Association has been

completed, but the number of students admitted is limited

due to funding constraints. Therefore,

there are countless impoverished students in this city who are unable to attend school. Therefore,

the education associations in the central districts of the city previously requested

all schools to increase the number of free enrollment quotas in order to remedy the situation. It is now learned

that all member schools of the current Municipal Education Association

have responded one after another, and within the possible range

of the financial situation of each school,

they will add a number of free enrollment quotas so that

a portion of impoverished students can continue their studies.

### During Air Raid Alarms, Police and Baojia Cooperate Closely: Baojia Members Must Assist the Police

In recent days, enemy American aircraft have been acting, showing more and more activity, and repeatedly invading this city,

soaring high in the sky for reconnaissance, conducting nervous guerrilla warfare.

Fortunately, in order to ensure the safety of citizens, the Air Defense Command

quickly issues an alarm upon detecting a slight air raid risk.

Citizens implement light control and traffic control,

making it impossible for enemy aircraft to find targets.

However, during air raid alarms, all baojia air defense members and police defense members

must be fully mobilized to assist the police in directing traffic, maintaining order,

and taking various emergency measures. Citizens must also, upon hearing the alarm,

take necessary preparations with swift action. At the same time, attention should be paid to noise prevention

to cope with the occurrence of emergencies. Police and baojia citizens must cooperate closely to safeguard the safety of Great Shanghai.

### Navy

— Translated by Ishida Yutaka

Long before anyone else was up, Takao had arrived in Kure, thinking it the most appropriate time.

Because he could meet Shinji before his work started, he could discuss lingering in Kure. As for the task of discussing his younger sister's marriage, of course, it was always on his mind. There was no need for the author to elaborate on that. In addition, he still held dear the promise Shinji had made earlier to visit the naval port. Takao tried his best not to disturb Shinji's military duties, and his efforts were rewarded.

(Disturbing Shinji's sleep, perhaps he'll forgive me!)

Takao boarded the bus he remembered. The early summer sun, rising earlier now, had not yet peeked over the horizon. The sound of the wooden clogs dragged along by Kure's most famous workers had not yet echoed on the roads.

Takao got off at a bus stop at Yama Hirachi-sei, and walked forward along the misty river. His heart was pounding anxiously. This was the joy of bringing a gift to Shinji, but also shyness.

(Everything else is easy to say, only the marriage thing is hard to bring up. If I say, "Please take my sister," Shinji will definitely blush. If it were me, I would. It's just impossible to say "My sister likes you.")

Takao now found it difficult to execute the task he had so readily volunteered for. A letter from his mother had also mentioned this difficulty, and he scratched his head and ears, feeling the challenge.

Before long, he arrived at the front of Shinji's dormitory. The windows of Shinji's second-floor study were still closed.

(It seems he's still sleeping. It's a bit rude to wake him.)

But Shinji wasn't the kind of polite friend who needed to be circled around first.

He turned the handle of the front door, but it was locked from the inside and wouldn't open. He went around to the back door to check the kitchen, where the landlady, who had just gotten up, stared at Takao with a surprised expression.

"Has Tani-kun not gotten up yet?"

"Oh, the guest has arrived so early..."

The landlady hastily tidied her messy hair and clothes, and asked politely.

"I'm passing through here on the way back to Tokyo, and I'm here to trouble you again. Due to the train schedule, I arrived too early."

Takao wanted to go upstairs from the kitchen, and ran into the house.

"But, I'm really sorry, Mr. Tani is no longer here..."

The landlady said with regret.

"Oh?"

"Due to his duties, he suddenly moved out two days ago, —"

"Then he's sailed out?"

"But he didn't say anything. Not only Mr. Tani, but all naval personnel keep their mouths shut, —"

(7)

The idea of preventing spies is truly widespread in Kure. The landlady's words might be intentionally fabricated, but the fact that Shinji was not in the dormitory was indeed true.

When Takao met Shinji a week ago, he had left with the impression that he was very busy, so it wasn't strange that he couldn't meet this time. But he felt an endless sense of loss that he hadn't been able to discuss his sister's marriage.

However, he thought that the marriage task could be solved in another way.

(It doesn't matter, I can write a letter, or come again. A place like Kure isn't too far to visit as many times as necessary, —)

He returned to the station again, ate breakfast, and took the train to Onomichi. He strolled through the ancient port in the Seto Inland Sea, gazing at the scenery that became material for paintings of a calm sea, until it was time for the express train to Tokyo at 2:30, when he stopped looking at the scenery.

This train was also very crowded, and he didn't get a seat until Kobe. Because he was too tired from the train ride last night, he immediately fell asleep.

It was almost seven in the morning when he arrived at Tokyo Station. Apartment living was uncomfortable, and even if he went back, no one would prepare a meal for him, so he ate some breakfast at the Tokyo Station cafeteria.

While eating, he suddenly remembered that he had to deliver the gift from his father to the painter Ichiki. Because it was a Satsuma ware vase, he was very afraid of breaking it, so he only put this one item in his suitcase.

He returned to the platform and took the Yamanote Line. Then he changed to the Ikegami Line at Gotanda.

When he arrived at the painter's house in Senzoku, it was still early morning, but because it was early summer, he was sweating profusely. It was just the time when the painter had just gotten up and was washing his face.

"My father instructed me to extend his special greetings to you. My father wanted to give you a Kirukan-style confectionery, and inquired everywhere, but lately, due to a shortage of ingredients, Kagoshima has not been able to make it."

Saying this, Takao handed over the vase box.

"I don't like that kind of confectionery! But how is Kagoshima? Is it still the same as before? Are the samurai still overbearing?"

"But it's not that bad."

Takao replied, but when he heard the painter Ichiki's usual tone, he felt like he had returned to Tokyo.

Later, they talked about painting until after ten o'clock, when he took his leave. He was too tired, so he wanted to take a nap, and went straight back to the Onuma Apartments.

"Oh, you're back? That was fast! Letters came while you were away."

The landlady handed over four or five letters, one of which was in Shinji's handwriting and in a very thick envelope. (134)

### Shanghai Buddhist Congee Kitchen Distributes Corn Flour—Registered Charities Should Claim Their Allotment Quickly

The Shanghai Buddhist Congee Kitchen, due to the sharp rise in rice prices in the city,

and the resulting impact on the poor, has been gradually purchasing

corn flour, totaling 114 dan and 85 jin, to be distributed to the poor during the winter.

Following a resolution by the standing directors' meeting, it was decided to distribute it early, and the full amount was allocated to various charitable organizations in the city. After this

news was announced, more than ten charities

registered with the kitchen. On the 20th, the board of directors resolved to distribute the flour as follows:

Shanghai Old People's Home, Shanghai South Congee Kitchen, 25 dan each. Xin Puyu Hall, 11 dan. Cilianhui Relief Home, Xujiahui Infant Asylum, 10 dan each. Tushanwan Orphanage, 7 dan.

China Education Morality Society, 5 dan. Christian Orphanage, Andang Hospital, 4 dan each. Fuyu Workers' Orphanage,

China Leprosy Relief Association, Pingjiang Children's Home, Baoan Old People's Home, 3 dan each. Ailaoju, 1 dan and 85 jin.

The above institutions are requested to

prepare an official letter within three

days and claim their allotment from the Shanghai Buddhist Congee Kitchen at the Ximen Guandi Temple,

so that the distribution can be completed as soon as possible. This is earnestly hoped.

### Issue Payment for Cotton Yarn and Cloth Soon

— Li Maoyong

Since the government issued a clear order to purchase cotton yarn and cloth last August,

it has been over a year now. During this long year, the Shanghai office of the General Chamber of Commerce's purchasing and inspection work

has been intermittent and has not yet been fully completed. Good merchants who have followed the government's orders, reporting all their yarn and cloth stock to the authorities and carefully preserving it, hope daily that the General Chamber of Commerce will come to inspect it and issue term deposit slips as soon as possible, so that they can fulfill the government's mandate. Some have already been inspected, but many have not yet been inspected. As for the payment, those who have not been inspected have not been able to receive it, which is perfectly reasonable from the perspective of the General Chamber of Commerce (when they will be inspected is another matter). Those who have been inspected have not received payment for two or three months.

Among the merchants, some who were inspected in May or June have been

waiting at the door of the General Chamber of Commerce every day, and more than 60

days have passed without the accounting being completed.

Since the beginning of this month, there have been virtually

no cases of completed calculations. The announcement board is blank every day, and if someone asks, there is

no concrete answer.

In view of the above facts, we

hope that:

The General Chamber of Commerce should stipulate a specific time limit after the yarn

and cloth inspection is completed, within which

the price will be calculated and term deposit slips issued.

The General Chamber of Commerce must complete the inspection of all uninspected yarn

and cloth within a certain number of days.

The order of issuing payment

should be based on the date of inspection,

and should not be advanced out of order.

The General Chamber of Commerce is an

organization of merchants, and its motto is "Fairness

and Integrity." We believe that it will accept the above

suggestions and alleviate the undue suffering of merchants.

### Obligatory Drug Addiction Rehabilitation—Third Batch Completes Treatment

This office has contracted with the Nantu Road branch of the China Educational

Moral Society to establish a temporary, free, drug addiction rehabilitation center,

where the third group of ten addicts, all

women, has completed treatment. Yesterday

morning, a farewell ceremony was held in the society's auditorium,

attended by more than a hundred guests from all walks of life. Mr. Li Huifa presided

over the ceremony, delivering an opening address, exposing the scourge

of opium without reservation, and strongly urging those who had completed treatment

not to repeat their mistakes, and isolate themselves from the public. His words were sincere and moving. Next, the chief physician of the center, Yang Yusheng, Sun Weirui, the representative of the China Biochemical Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Dr. Sun Shanjun,

and guests delivered speeches, filled with

encouragement, moving those who heard them. Finally, a representative of the addicts delivered a thank-you speech, reporting on the drug addiction rehabilitation process, and one woman said that

she had to inject over two hundred moka needles every day, and another woman said she was smoking over eight hundred yuan of heroin a day, all of them were safely removed by the "St. Kang Doping"

injection. Most addicts often have a fear

that drug addiction rehabilitation is painful,

but the proven circumstances show

that it is not always the case. As long as there is determination,

there is no reason why it cannot be removed. We

have been lifted out of the sea of suffering by the China Educational Moral Society,

and we are grateful beyond measure, and we should

vigorously promote it, so that fellow sufferers can also

be rescued from the maze and reach the other shore.

After the speech, they took a photo and dispersed.

### Maternity Hospital Attached to Health Demonstration Zone

The Shanghai Health Demonstration Zone,

sponsored by the Chinese Health Association, is equipped with four departments:

Health Care, Prevention, Medical Treatment, and Training.

Within the Health Care Department, there are three sections: Women's and Infant Health, School Health, and

Factory Health. Recently, a

maternity hospital has been attached, which is divided into inpatient and outpatient

delivery services. In the past two months,

more than ten women have safely left the hospital.

The fees are especially low, and if the family is indeed

poor, they can apply for preferential treatment.

Anyone who has any

questions about prenatal and postnatal women's and infant health, and health care matters,

can go directly to the area for examination,

or notify them by letter or telephone, and a public health nurse will be sent

to visit the family, free of charge.

Residents living in the Hongqiao, Fahua Town, and

Xujiahui areas of West Shanghai should pay attention. The

area's address is 349 Hongqiao Road,

(behind the former Jiaotong University, near

Fan Yu Road) telephone number is 70045. (Su)

The late famous doctor Chen Xiaobao of Sanpailou in the Nanshi area

was a specialist in gynecology,

and was renowned in the medical field. His sons, Pan Gen and Danian, inherited their father's skills and practiced medicine,

and also gained great reputation. Furthermore, they are kind-hearted

and considerate to patients, treating the poor without hesitation.

They now have a clinic on Julaida Road,

west of Albert Road. Outpatient services are available until 4:00 PM.
