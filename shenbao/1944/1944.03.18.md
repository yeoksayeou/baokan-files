### Do Not Acquiesce

Recently, a psychology of acquiescence has become prevalent in society. Given the severity of the current situation, this psychology is truly undesirable.

The first result of acquiescence is retreat and a lack of striving for progress. The second result is selfishness, caring only for oneself and disregarding the public. The third result is hedonism, focusing only on the present and neglecting the future. The manifestation of acquiescence in behavior is "getting by," "each sweeping only the snow from his own doorstep," and "a drunken spree today." Such behavior degrades an individual and prevents a nation from revitalizing. During wartime, it is an even greater danger.

On the road of life's struggles, not advancing is retreating, and retreating is failing. In the arena of struggle against the enemy, my retreat can create opportunities for the enemy to advance. Sometimes, a small retreat can prevent you from advancing permanently, causing a failure from which you can never recover. Now is a time of global transformation. The Chinese people are a part of the Chinese sphere, and the Chinese nation is a part of the Greater East Asia sphere. Every citizen must be "cautious and conscientious, as if facing a deep abyss or walking on thin ice," taking each step with careful deliberation and moving forward. This is not a time for stillness, leisure, or even the slightest negligence. As the saying goes, "One wrong step causes eternal regret; turning back, a hundred years have passed." This is truly a time of crisis and survival. How can there be retreat? How can one "get by"?

Now, war is a holistic war. In a holistic war, there is no distinction between the front and the rear, no distinction between soldiers and civilians. Everywhere and everyone is affected by the war, and there is no way to avoid it even if one wants to. Only by rising up and striving together to achieve victory as soon as possible can we attain stability. At this time, the destiny of the nation is in the hands of the people, and the destiny of the people is linked to the destiny of the nation. If the nation has life, you also have life. If the nation is lost, do not even think of surviving. If everyone is selfish and does not contribute to the nation, the result will be, "If the skin is gone, where can the hair attach?" Now is a crucial period for the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War. It is a time for everyone to work together and strive forward. If you want to preserve yourself, you must first defend the motherland. If you want to defend the motherland, you must first defend Greater East Asia. How can there be selfishness? How can one "sweep only the snow from his own doorstep"?

Enjoyment is what everyone desires and needs. However, the most important thing is to avoid trading future suffering for present enjoyment. In the current environment, whether present enjoyment will lead to future suffering is a question that needs no explanation. Just imagine if the people of a certain country all seek enjoyment, focusing only on the present and neglecting the future, then the victory or defeat and survival of that country would not depend on the battlefield. If the Chinese people were like this, then we would not even need to talk about liberation or freedom. This is certainly not what we desire. We do not want the nation to perish, but if our pursuit of enjoyment leads the nation down the path of destruction, it is truly dangerous! Fan Zhongyan once said, "Be the first to worry about the troubles of the world, and the last to enjoy its pleasures." This is our Chinese national spirit, and it is the sole reason for the enduring existence of our Chinese nation. Now is not a time for enjoyment. How can one "a drunken spree today"?

Today, we raise the issue of acquiescence and explain its harms in the hope that everyone will "correct their faults if they have them, and strive harder if they do not." Although this is a personal issue, it affects the whole. Therefore, everyone must be constantly mindful and encourage themselves and others.

### Heavy Artillery Battles Erupt Around the Qinqiu Ridge Highlands; Indian National Army Collaborates to Annihilate Enemy Forces

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency Dispatch) From the Chadi front in Burma: Elite Japanese troops, in coordination with a unit under Bao Dunzhaen, are jointly attacking the Yingyin Army's 17th Division base at Genatepeak, the forward position of Tidiemu. The elite troops commenced a frontal artillery barrage to suppress the enemy and then launched flanking attacks on all routes. The enemy is already showing signs of defeat and retreat. The enemy's 17th Division, numbering about 10,000, realizing that their vanguard is in danger and their rear is cut off, planned to break through the Japanese-occupied territory and flee into India. They converged on Teidam, where they engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese occupation forces stationed there. Enemy corpses are piled high, and the annihilation of the enemy army is imminent.

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency Dispatch) A dispatch from a Japanese army base on the Burmese front reports that Japanese forces have broken through the dense forests on the Indian-Burmese border with unstoppable momentum. The main force of the enemy's 81st Division, numbering several thousand, has been routed and is fleeing in disarray. The enemy forces, whose retreat was cut off by various Japanese units at the Gaton River and the Bichi River, are also aimlessly wandering. In addition, a main Japanese force has been continuously eliminating the starving remnants of the enemy since the 14th. They are currently moving north from the Bichi River area toward a key enemy point.

Yangon, 17th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Elite Japanese troops and the Indian National Army are urgently collaborating to encircle and annihilate the main force of the enemy's 17th Division at Dunzhaen Tidiemu. The Indian National Army is engaging in close combat with the Japanese army everywhere, fiercely fighting against the enemy's stubborn resistance. They are cutting off the enemy's retreat routes from Tidiemu and Railong, causing confusion. Since the morning of the 15th, British troops have been abandoning Indian soldiers and attempting to escape by vehicle. Simultaneously, the garrisons of Fort Watt's forward Genatepeak and the Dimur fortress have been gradually retreating towards Tidiemu due to the heavy bombardment by Japanese artillery. The Japanese artillery is fiercely targeting the retreating enemy, and heavy artillery battles are currently raging around the Qinqiu Ridge highlands, the booming sound of cannons shaking the hills.

Yangon, 17th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Two enemy fighter planes attacked Tainjiao Fu (south of Rixi) on the Burmese coast on the afternoon of the 15th. One was shot down by Japanese forces, while the Japanese side suffered no losses.

### Burmese-Japanese Army Units Launch Another Offensive, Unleashing Power on All Fronts

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency Dispatch) On the 16th, Japanese army units in Burma annihilated the British 7th Division in the Xinzewa Basin on the southern Burmese-Indian border, thwarting Mountbatten's attempt to counterattack Burma. After the completion of this annihilation operation, the Japanese army immediately launched another offensive against the West African forces in the Kalaton River valley east of the Arakan Mountains and the British-Indian forces in the Qinqiu Ridge area of the central Burmese-Indian border, closely collaborating with the Indian National Army to advance step by step. At the same time, in the Fugong area on the northern Burmese border, the elite units of the Japanese army have penetrated deep into the enemy's territory. According to the basic policy determined at the Quebec Conference, the combined forces of the United States, Britain, and Chongqing aim to retake Burma and open the Sino-Burmese Highway. Although their war aims appear to be the same on the surface, their actual interests and counterattack intentions are completely different. Moreover, their command systems are inconsistent. Mountbatten is merely the Supreme Commander of the Southeast Asia Command in name only. He has different opinions from Auchinleck regarding the British-Indian forces under his command, making it difficult to lead them. He has no authority to issue orders to the Chongqing troops stationed in India or the Yunnan troops. The Chongqing troops stationed in India are under the command of American General Stilwell, while the Yunnan troops are under the command of Commander-in-Chief Wei Lihuang. It is hoped that the US-Chongqing counterattack operation in Burma will be plagued by a divided military command system. Therefore, when the Japanese army launches a fierce attack, they will collapse and retreat. This is the natural course of events. The enemy camp has such fundamental defects, and the emotional relationships between the commanders of the US, Britain, and Chongqing are extremely lacking in harmony. The Stilwell Command in Chongqing announced on the 15th that Mountbatten and Stilwell had recently met to discuss the issue of Stilwell officially assuming the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Axis Forces, and also discussed the future war strategy against Japan. This fact is particularly symbolic of the other side's emotions nearing rupture and urgently seeking reconciliation. Mountbatten, because the British 7th and 5th Divisions on the southern Burmese-Indian border have suffered fierce attacks by the Japanese army and their situation has become unstable, still ordered the 81st West African Division in the Kalaton River valley and the British brigades in the Qinqiu Ridge area of the central Burmese-Indian border to attack, hoping to reverse the decline on the southern Burmese-Indian border. However, the Japanese army had already seen through Mountbatten's new strategy and attacked the enemy forces in the Kalaton River valley and the Qinqiu Ridge area before they could gather their strength. As such, the joint US-British-Chongqing counterattack plan in Burma has failed one after another, and the enemy forces will have difficulty launching another clumsy move. When the Japanese army first launched its offensive in the central Burmese-Indian border, the Burmese Japanese Army authorities made a statement on March 10 expressing their extremely confident grasp of victory. This statement is completely consistent with the actual situation of the current Japanese operation.

### Original Judgment in the Embezzlement Case of Hou Dachun and Hu Zheng

(Continued) Furthermore, on April 14th of the same year, Hou Dachun, acting on the orders of the Grain Department, and Hu Zheng cooperated to purchase glutinous rice in Wuxi and Changzhou at a price of no more than 300 yuan per picul. The funds were paid by the public glutinous rice company. Later, Hou Dachun wanted to handle the matter alone, so he sent his staff to investigate various places and issued instructions to the magistrates of Changzhou and Wuxi counties and the heads of various special work stations to cooperate. He actually sealed up all the glutinous rice owned by rice merchants in the city, totaling 26,440 piculs of glutinous rice, 1,028 piculs of brown rice, and 2,845 piculs of white rice in Wuxi, and 21,446 piculs of rough rice, 1,377 piculs of brown rice, and 214 piculs of white rice in Changzhou. Later, Hou Dachun wanted to forcibly purchase eight-tenths of the sealed rice and return two-tenths to the rice merchants. Because he conspired with Zheng Ziwen, the chairman of the Wuxi Joint Operations Cooperative, he transported 2,740 piculs and eight dou of white glutinous rice and 238 piculs and six dou of brown glutinous rice from Wuxi to Suzhou and sold it to the Mainland Rice Factory. After opposition from Wuxi rice merchants such as Zhao Zhangji, Hou Dachun reached an agreement with Zhou Naiwen, the vice minister of the Grain Department, to return one-third to the rice merchants and forcibly purchase two-thirds. Zhou Naiwen went to Suzhou on October 5th, and Hou Dachun again discussed the matter with him face-to-face, deciding to sell it locally at a price of 1,200 yuan per picul (at that time, the market price was 440 yuan per picul, plus a Grain Bureau adjustment fee of 400 yuan and a Grain Department adjustment fee of 360 yuan, as mentioned above). Zheng Ziwen introduced Xu Ruitang, the owner of the Wuxi Tongyu Grain Firm, and delivered 12,003 piculs and 36 catties of rough rice to the Wuxi Jiaotongyu Firm, and 140 piculs and 89 catties in Changzhou, and 5,250 piculs of brown rice in Xuzhou. After October 20th, he transported 1,250 piculs from rice wholesalers in Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places. The funds for the aforementioned compulsory purchase of glutinous rice, totaling 348,411 yuan and two jiao from the Grain Department, have not yet been cleared. Most of the proceeds from the sale, about 14 million yuan, were deposited in the bank in the name of the Grain Bureau. In addition to Hou Dachun embezzling 600,000 yuan (of which 100,000 yuan was transferred to others), the interest earned from the 7.5 million yuan deposited in the bank was divided and used with others. Also, from April to November of the same year, the Wujin County government, at the request of the Rong troops, purchased 43,000 piculs of rice husks. At that time, there was not enough rice stored in Changzhou City, so the county customs chief borrowed 3,359 piculs of rice from Hou Dachun (the rice money was used by Hou Dachun to misappropriate 500,000 yuan from the national treasury and the people's food rice money in Changzhou). At the end of August of the same year, the county magistrate returned Hou Darong the same amount, which was sold at the prevailing market price, illegally profiting 500,000 yuan. Also, in May of the same year, Hou Dachun ordered the Changshu Liquor Industry Guild to reorganize into the Chu Kun District Brewing Industry Guild and the Seasoning Industry Guild. On December 23rd, Hou Dachun restricted brewing methods, stating that brewing was not allowed without the permission of the Grain Bureau, and sent agents to various places to allow the brewing of 19,0328 piculs on the condition that 45 yuan per picul of glutinous rice used for brewing be extracted (in reality, there was no restriction on brewing). At the same time, he demanded a bribe of 700,000 yuan from the merchants. After the payment, Hou Dachun acquiesced to the free movement of glutinous rice in the Changshu area. Hu Zheng was the former director of the Su-Song-Chang-Jia District Rice Grain Purchasing and Sales Office of the Grain Department. During his tenure from April to October of the 32nd year, he discussed matters with the relevant authorities, and the joint operations cooperatives in various counties purchased rice at low prices and reported them at high prices, or reported them at high prices and replenished them at low prices, and inflated the joint lockup expenses and commissions of the joint operations cooperatives in various counties, continuously receiving about 30 million yuan. In addition to distributing it to the relevant authorities, he obtained 5.6 million yuan for himself. After the matter was discovered, the National Government issued an order for review.

Reasons Based on the above facts, the defendants Hou Dachun and Hu Zheng have repeatedly confessed without reservation, and they are consistent with the evidence submitted to the case. The defendant Hou Dachun either intended to profit during wartime, speculating and manipulating military supplies or daily necessities, hoarding and speculating, hindering supply and demand, or infringing upon public property and harming the public, or embezzling public funds and seeking private gain, harming the major interests of the state, or receiving bribes or other improper benefits for his official conduct. Although the crimes are different, the nature of the crimes is the same, and they are based on a general intent, so they should be treated as one crime. The defendant Hu Zheng continuously inflated the procurement of rice to a large amount of 30 million yuan, manipulating and speculating, using all means, affecting military grain and people's food, to a deep and great extent. The facts of his crime have a relationship of method and result, so he should be punished more severely. The defendants, as food administrative officials, only sought private gain and disregarded the difficulties of the time, which is truly unforgivable. They should each be severely punished to serve as a warning. The Western-style clothes and other items involved in the case should be confiscated, and the bribes and improper benefits should be recovered and confiscated.

Based on the above conclusions, in accordance with Article 8 of the Provisional Organization Regulations of the Special Court of the National Government, the first paragraph of Article 291 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 17, Paragraph 1 of the Wartime Criminal Special Law, Articles 1, 2, 3, 7, Paragraph 2, 8, 9, and 21 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Embezzlement by Public Officials, Article 11, Article 28, Article 56, Article 55, and Article 38, Paragraph 1, Clause 3 of the Criminal Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text.

March 14th, 33rd year of the Republic of China, Chen En, Chief Judge of the Special Court of the National Government (seal), Qiao Wanxuan, Judge (seal), Qian Sen, Judge (seal). This document is certified to be identical to the original. Pan Chengyin, Clerk. Jiang Wumian, Clerk. Zhu Jinghang, Clerk. March, 33rd year of the Republic of China

### Minister Chen Jian Delivers a Speech

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Minister of Construction Chen Chunpu delivered a speech to Chinese and foreign reporters during a routine reception on the 17th. The speech covered the recent situation of production increase and construction. This year is the year of production increase, and the increase in agricultural production is particularly important. What is related to the Ministry of Construction for the increase in agricultural production is the manufacture of new-style agricultural implements and the dredging project of Yinshan Lake in East Taihu Lake. Secondly, it is indeed traffic safety and the exchange of materials. The details are as follows: The Central Agricultural Implements Manufacturing Experimental Factory was planned and established in Wuxi in December of the 31st year and established on August 20th last year. The greatest goal of the establishment of this factory is to increase production and improve farming techniques. The quantity of products produced by this factory is insufficient to meet the demand. In the future, we should strive to increase production and achieve universality. There are currently more than 160 workers, and it is planned to increase it to 300 in the second year. It was organized and established in Suzhou in January and prepared for construction. First, a large dam will be built on Taihu Lake, and part of the main canal for irrigation will be contracted to merchants. As a result, the bid price was too high, and a new bid was made. A contract is now being signed, and construction will begin within one day. The recent general situation of road protection work is to strengthen the love for the Shanghai-Nanjing Line. The results of consultations with the Jiangsu Provincial Government are very satisfactory.

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - Since being ordered to purchase wheat in various locations in northern Jiangsu and elsewhere, the Business Coordination Association's Flour and Wheat Professional Committee has achieved over 72% of its expected purchase volume.

### Fierce Battle for Cassino in Italy Continues, U.S. Fifth Army Suffers Another Setback in Offensive

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports that after intense aerial bombardment, enemy forces, including New Zealand and French troops, attacked Cassino with strong artillery and tanks.

### Fierce Fighting on the West Bank of the Bug River, Soviets Launch New Offensive on the Former Polish Border

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: Large-scale fierce fighting continues in the Kherson-Tarnopol area. Intense fighting has also broken out at various points east of the Bug River on the Ukrainian border. The Soviets have once again shifted their military focus to the southwest of Uman, where they have crossed the Bug River at several points, attempting to encircle a large number of German troops in the area, but their hopes have been shattered by the tenacious German defense. The Soviets' second new focus is in the area south of Lutsk, where the enemy masses have been inactive for several days. Now, with infantry divisions and a tank unit, they are launching an attack, intending to break into the German lines to the west at any cost, but they have encountered fierce German artillery fire. Although they have broken through some smaller gaps, most have soon been closed. In the north, the Red Army, under the cover of tanks and heavy machine guns, attempted to break through the German defenses north of the Nevel-Velikiye Luki highway, but without success.

### British Ban on Foreigners Leaving the Country

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) - According to British sources, the British government has recently issued an order prohibiting foreigners from leaving British territory, but it has not been specified whether this order includes diplomats.

### British and American Aircraft Attack Germany, Suffering Heavy Losses

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: Under the protection of a large number of fighter escorts, American aircraft invaded southern Germany at noon yesterday. Due to heavy cloud cover, the enemy aircraft dropped bombs in many places, focusing especially on Augsburg and Ulm. Due to the unfavorable weather, German anti-aircraft forces were still able to shoot down 36 enemy aircraft, including 22 four-engine bombers. Several British aircraft also attacked western Germany last night.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - British aircraft invaded southwestern Germany last night, attacking Stuttgart and its suburbs. Sixty-six aircraft were shot down.

It is widely spread that Mr. Yoshida Shōin is a model of a national hero. This is a great surprise to the author, who has been praising Mr. Shōin for over 60 years. What exactly did Mr. Yoshida Shōin do? Probably no one knew the difference between peacetime and wartime as well as Mr. Shōin. Mr. Shōin considered the time to be an extraordinary period. He believed that doing extraordinary things in extraordinary times was not only permissible but also necessary. The things that he did based on this belief, such as calling on those who were engrossed in meaningless formalities, were considered madness. Traveling without the permission of the lord was a violation of the lord's rules, but Mr. Shōin had promised Mr. Miyabe Teibei of the Kumamoto domain to study in the Northeast, and fearing that he would break his promise, he set out from the lord's residence without waiting for approval. At that time, traveling abroad was not permitted by national law, but if it was for official business, it was permissible, so he boarded the Perry flagship. Confucius said that a gentleman does not think beyond his position. However, Mr. Shōin, in his capacity as a samurai of the clan, either wrote to the lord or sent letters to ministers in Kyoto, hoping that the emperor would read them. To the so-called bureaucrats, everything that Mr. Shōin did was an overstep.

However, from today's perspective, right and wrong are clear. In extraordinary times, extraordinary things are needed. Doing extraordinary things in extraordinary times is the true meaning of the ordinary way. So today is not a time for leisure. Do not use the excuse that you are old, useless, or incapable to prevent others from serving, but rather cooperate and serve each other. It is wrong to excuse oneself by saying that one is old and incapable, or that one is unlearned and lacks energy, while indulging in pleasure and letting others serve. Those who cannot, there is nothing to be done, but all who can should cooperate. In society, there are also those who particularly want to serve but cannot find work. This is a great mistake. In such a society, to say that there is no work is punishable. 

### Idle Talk on the Current Situation

If you say there is none, then you can pick up horse manure on the roadside! You can pick up fallen ears of grain in the fields after the harvest!

At this time, those who hesitate because they are concerned about their position or reputation are already out of step with the times. What is shameful about ladies working as seamstresses or maids? What is wrong with gentlemen working as day laborers? Of course, there is a need for servants, but is it impossible to manage without them? If you want tea or water, serve yourself. If everyone remembers that this is an extraordinary time, then Japan will accomplish many times more than it does today. I believe that 100 million people can do the work of at least 200 million people. Of course, this does not mean making even the frail old people or infants in arms work. If all those who can work do so with all their might, they will surely become a strong and impregnable fortress.

In society, there is an eight-hour workday. In democratic countries, it is even considered excessive, and working hours are gradually being reduced to seven or six hours. Some even advocate a maximum of five hours. However, these words are already outdated, they are words of a peaceful era, and today they are irrelevant. Of course, humans are animals and need rest, which must be considered at all times, even in extraordinary times. However, the limits on working hours that were advocated by liberal economists in the past are nothing more than delusions from the era when free-market liberalism was prevalent, and are no different from advocating birth control. If all workers work diligently, with a sincere love for the country, and work together, then even greater results than today can be achieved immediately. I am not saying that today's workers are idle or not working hard. Rather, I am saying that there must be an awareness of these extraordinary times, and this is not limited to workers, but should apply to everyone. That is to say, it is necessary not only to advocate age-based dedication to public service, but also rest-based dedication to public service. If 100 million people extend their working hours by one hour, then 100 million hours will be added. Of course, there are those who have already reached the limit of their labor, and there are children, the elderly, and the sick who should be deducted from this, but in any case, if everyone is determined to extend their working hours by one hour, then they will surely achieve amazing results.

What I am saying here is that the government authorities should take full, organized, and planned measures to ensure that those who are age-based dedicated to public service can find their place, and to open up a path for the effective use of time for those who are rest-based dedicated to public service. Well-ordered labor is twice as effective as chaotic labor. So, the coordination of labor power is essential. Being able to achieve the best of their abilities according to individual functions is the best way to maximize efficiency. Those with experience in earthwork should be assigned to earthwork, and those with calculation skills should be assigned to accounting. This is the most important thing. Asking a theater actor to wrestle, or a wrestler to play a stage role, will not yield good results even if the workers are exhausted. I think this is self-evident. Especially for today's conscription, if the qualities and experiences of the conscripts are not specifically assessed and used most effectively, then the result will be like pouring kerosene into the sea, turning the useful into the useless. (To be continued) Translated by Lu from the Mainichi Shimbun of February 9th.

### Income Tax for the 32nd Year Must Be Paid on Time, Income Tax Bureau Notifies All Industries to Comply

The Shanghai Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance sent a letter to all trade associations yesterday, stating: "All companies and firms should report their income to this bureau within three months of the end of each year for assessment of taxes. The start date for the collection of the first and second categories of profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the 32nd year is approaching on March 1st. All companies and firms should comply with the regulations and report the income of the first category of profit-seeking enterprises, along with the second category of income tax withheld from employees' salaries and bonuses, and the third category of income tax withheld from deposits, bond interest, and dividends, to this bureau accurately. Any increase in capital due to asset appreciation, capital increase, or the use of accumulated surplus to supplement capital should be taxed according to regulations. In addition, the Finance Ministry's Income Tax Department has ruled that company distributions of surplus that do not pay dividends but only bonuses should be treated as dividends and taxed accordingly. We will dispatch personnel to conduct individual audits and urge tax payments, and we will also issue a notice. We hereby send a copy of the precautions and request your association to forward them to all members for compliance and to report the income and tax amounts of each category to this bureau accurately, and to provide relevant account books for inspection. Failure to report within the time limit or refusal to allow auditing will result in penalties in accordance with the regulations, and this bureau will directly determine the tax amount and request the court to enforce collection. The case concerns national taxes, and no delay is permitted."

### British and Americans Use Chongqing's Resources in an Attempt to Satisfy Their Ambitions, Minister Matsushima Gave a Speech Yesterday

Colonel Matsushima, the head of the Japanese Fleet's Press Department stationed in China, gave a speech to the Chinese press corps yesterday (17th), as usual, as follows: Colonel said that the US Navy is frustrated over the lack of progress in the Pacific and is trying to solve its difficulties through political means, and that they intended to exploit China's land, manpower, and resources, to cooperate with Chongqing, and make a final decision on Japan. Regarding the point of using Chinese land and manpower, U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz has already spoken, and there is no need to repeat the statement. Now we are just discussing his resources.

Reasons for Rising Prices in Kunming

Colonel Shen cited Reuters on March 16, saying that "Foreign Minister" Song Ziwen and "Finance Minister" Kong Xiangxi recently made a short trip to Kunming, where Kong told reporters that he would investigate the reasons for the rising prices in Kunming and study countermeasures. According to this news, it proves that the lives of the people of Kunming are currently extremely difficult. Minister Matsushima also presented a comparison table of prices between Kunming and Shanghai in September last year as evidence:

Kunming Shanghai
White Rice 1 Shi 2,464.00 Yuan 1,800.00 Yuan
Wheat Flour 1 Bag 968.00 Yuan 490.00 Yuan
Pork 1 Jin 60.00 Yuan 45.64 Yuan
Cooking Oil 1 Jin 82.00 Yuan 41.63 Yuan
Salt 1 Jin 30.00 Yuan 3.95 Yuan
Sugar 1 Jin 20.00 Yuan 33.00 Yuan

The Colonel explained that the reason for the high prices in Kunming was actually due to the large number of British and Americans stationed near Kunming. Although the British and Americans came to China, their luxurious lifestyle remained the same, without the slightest savings. Chongqing is like this, and Guilin is also like this. At the same time, Kunming is the terminal for British and American transport aircraft, and the transport aircraft taking away a large amount of Chinese materials is also one of the reasons for fueling the price hike.

Japan's Aim is to Seek Peace

Colonel Matsushima then pointed out that only a small number of British and Americans are currently stationed in Chongqing. If Nimitz's plan to use the Chinese mainland for operations is realized and a large number of British and American troops enter, two results will occur: The lives of the people will be even more difficult, and China's land will become a battlefield. The human resources will be sacrificed for the British and Americans, and the products will be reduced and lack, and eventually the people will not be able to survive and suffer unprecedented tragedies. Of course, Japanese soldiers and civilians are also stationed in China today and are supplied with some materials from China, but Japan's goal is to seek peace. The British and American gold plans are exactly the opposite. They intend to turn China into a battlefield, seize Chinese materials, and kill Chinese people to achieve their ambitions of conquering East Asia. The venom of Yin is unprecedented. The Colonel reiterated: The success or failure of the Japanese Navy in the Pacific War is related to the fate of China. The Japanese Navy is in favor, and China can maintain peace. On the contrary, China's mainland will be ravaged by the British and Americans. At present, China's participation in the Greater East Asia War is only a matter of material assistance. If the Chinese people can cooperate in the war with one yuan of resources, they can avoid the loss of tens of thousands of dollars in land, life, and property in the future.

### Emergency Measures Taken to Prevent the Spread of Meningitis, the First District Office Hopes that Citizens Will Comply

The First District Office, in view of the recent outbreaks of cerebrospinal meningitis in the territory, has decided to implement the following emergency deployments from now on to prevent the spread:

A. Matters to which the licensees of theaters, cinemas, amusement parks, cafes, restaurants and dance halls, as well as school authorities, stock markets and other public places should pay attention:

### "Spring River Regret" Filming Ceremony Held Yesterday

### Public Basketball Unexpected Result: Donghua Defeats Hualian

In the public basketball game, the Tongren and Yijia teams were exceptionally brave in the first game last night. They even tied in the second half, but Zhongbei defeated Tongren 48-30 due to too many points lost in the first half. In the final game of the first division, Hualian played against Donghua. The two sides fought fiercely. In the first half, Hualian took a 18-15 lead by three points. After switching sides, the situation became even more tense, and the scores fluctuated, resulting in several ties. When time ran out, the score was tied 29-29. In overtime, Hualian was defeated by Donghua 31-35, which can be said to be an unexpected upset. There were originally eight games scheduled for tomorrow, but since the Lianyunhua team of the first division has announced its withdrawal, there are only seven games left.

Results of the previous games: Tongyi defeated Hede (Division B2) 41-16, Chengyou defeated Chengfu (Division B1) 17-16, Zhongbei defeated Tongren (Division A1) 48-30, Donghua defeated Hualian (Division A1) 35-31.

### It Is Better to Rely on Yourself Than on Others

It is better to rely on yourself than on others, which encourages people to invigorate themselves and not to have a dependent mentality, because relying on others may involve a vague hope, while relying on oneself at least has a considerable degree of certainty. In today's environment where rice is not sufficient for allocation, not only rice merchants, but even the rice management authorities, probably still hold on to the most unhealthy idea in the previous food policy, which is to spend all day managing how to import foreign rice, thinking that foreign rice can be relied on without fear. Now, because of the difficulties during wartime, the import of foreign rice is naturally impossible to guarantee, and even if it is transported with great difficulty, it feels like "distant water cannot quench a nearby fire." Therefore, it is too superficial to rely on foreign rice to supply domestic food today.

It is better to rely on yourself than on others. Instead of relying on the supply of foreign rice, it is better to work hard to increase the production of domestic rice. In today's serious food problem, first, it is necessary to ensure the supply of domestic food needs; second, it is necessary to remove rice from the category of commodities. Therefore, we have always sympathized with a few words said by the Continental News on October 11 last year: "Determining the purchase price of rice, limiting merchants' profits, and eliminating farmers' reluctance to sell are the most appropriate policies for today's food problem."

### Flour Professional Committee to Acquire Flour Bran, Continuing to Borrow 50 Million Yuan, Adopting a Current Account Mortgage Overdraft Method

The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee, in order to raise funds for the acquisition of wheat, has previously jointly established a loan of 100 million yuan with Chinese and Japanese banking groups. Due to the need for funds to acquire flour bran, it has continued to borrow 50 million yuan from Chinese and Japanese banking groups. The lending method is a current account mortgage overdraft, with the warehouse storage receipt of flour bran as collateral, with a mortgage period of six months and an interest rate of 8% per annum. It is reported that the purpose of this fund is to purchase flour bran from various factories and allocate it uniformly, and at the same time enable various flour mills to re-open acceptance bills with funds and continue to purchase wheat.

### Grain Bureau Legally Inspects Merchants' Qualifications

The Shanghai District Flour Bran Unified Allocation Office yesterday sent a letter to the Tea Industry Association and other associations, stating: "Regarding the letter from the Shanghai Special City Grain Bureau stating that among the member merchants of various grain industry associations, there are many who have not yet applied for registration, and many who falsely claim to be legal merchants and fraudulently receive flour allocations. In order to eliminate abuses and prevent problems, it is proposed that your office conduct a qualification check on the various grain industry associations' merchant shops under the jurisdiction of this bureau before the allocation. Those who fail to present the registration certificate approved by this bureau are not legal merchants and should not be allocated, so as to prevent those who use skillful language from flowing into the black market, etc." In order to understand whether all members of your association who have obtained flour allocation have obtained the Grain Bureau registration certificate for verification, this office is hereby writing to request your association to quickly collect these registration certificates and submit them to this office for processing.

### Industrial and Commercial Registration, Deadline for Completion

The City Economic Bureau stipulates that the registration and modification registration of various companies, except for cases where the attachments of the cases submitted to the Ministry of Industry are incomplete or do not meet the regulations, must be completed within seven days. For industrial and commercial registration, all cases of industrial and commercial firms applying for registration that are found to be consistent with the investigation must be completed within two weeks, so as to expedite the issuance of certificates.

### Various Industries Will Request Adjustment of Evaluation System

In order to strive for the welfare of the same industry and to make the evaluation system effective, so that merchants and people can benefit, various industry associations will jointly request the competent authorities to consider the difficulties of merchants and make efforts to thoroughly adjust the evaluation system within a time limit, so as to achieve perfection. When evaluating and setting the price limit for a certain item, the wholesale price of the trade should be used as a starting point, and then the focus should be shifted to the firm, using its wholesale price as a guideline to give legitimate profits, evaluate and set the standard price limit, and when allocating goods, an invoice must be issued for verification, otherwise, it is difficult to avoid pretexts.

### Improvement of Railway Transportation

— (Ma Jiazhang)

The improvement of railway transportation can be discussed in terms of passengers and transportation.

In terms of passengers, the first problem to be improved should be the excessive crowding of passengers. As long as this problem can be solved, passengers can at least reduce a large part of the suffering of the journey. From the current situation, it is already clear that the crowding of passengers is not a sign of true prosperity, but is entirely caused by too many people traveling on their own. Of course, the best way to improve the excessive crowding of passengers is to eliminate those who travel on their own. This responsibility should be borne by three parties simultaneously. The first is that the control authorities can strengthen control, the second is that the railway authorities can make the transportation of materials completely smooth, and the third is that passengers can have a deep realization themselves.

Improving the ticket sales method can also reduce the degree of passenger crowding. Ticket sales offices can all be set up outside the station and work all day long. This can give passengers a long period of time to purchase tickets, eliminate the crowding of passengers when purchasing tickets, and eliminate black market tickets and all the malpractices of ticket sales. The ticket sales office can also, based on statistics of the general number of passengers to various places, and in conjunction with the maximum capacity of the train, easily calculate the average maximum number of passengers to various places each day. Based on this number, the ticket sales office can decide the number of tickets sold to various places each day and limit the number of passengers, so that passengers who cannot purchase tickets do not run to the station in vain to squeeze. Therefore, it can also reduce the crowding scene in the military station and carriage. The ticket sales office can also pre-sell tickets for the next day on the first day, and shorten the usefulness of the ticket to only one day. This may be able to avoid the manipulation of many unscrupulous people.

The current train fares are too high for first class, second class, and third class. Most passengers are daunted and unable to afford first class or second class. Therefore, too many seats in the first and second class carriages are wasted. This waste is usually only a loss to the railway authorities, but today, when vehicles are in short supply and passengers are very crowded, this unnecessary waste is too inappropriate and unreasonable. Therefore, we hope that the railway authorities can completely eliminate the various meanings of first-class cars, and even the seats in second-class cars should be reduced to a minimum.

We hope that the arrangement of the schedule can be more precise, so that the time for shunting is reduced as much as possible, and the train running time must be accurate. This can not only reduce the pain of passengers squeezing in the carriage, but also increase the efficiency of passenger cars. In addition, the ticket checking time can also be brought forward as much as possible. Railway employees should be trained to be disciplined and upright, and should be able to provide passengers with guidance and assistance everywhere.

Passengers' lack of order often increases their own suffering. Lack of order seems to be an inferiority of our people. But we cannot just not improve on this. Therefore, I hope that every passenger can take into account the interests of everyone. For example, when checking tickets, checking tickets, boarding, and getting off the bus, they can follow the order, and they do not necessarily have to squeeze desperately. Especially when getting on and off the bus on the way, there are two doors in the east and west sides of the bus. We can use them, one exclusively for getting off the bus and one exclusively for getting on the bus. This can not only avoid chaotic and crowded situations, but also save passengers time and effort.

In terms of transportation, making the transportation of materials smooth and unhindered, the most ideal method in theory is to increase the number of vehicles. However, in today's war state, under the condition of military first, this is often impossible to achieve. But if we can improve the organization, management, planning, and means of material transportation, even with the least number of vehicles, we can make them exert their greatest capabilities and show their greatest effects. Now briefly stated as follows:

Research on the efficiency of transportation trains: Generally, people often think that if the carrying capacity of vehicles can be used as much as possible, even if the speed is very low, the maximum efficiency of the vehicles can be obtained. This is actually a specious view. Because the performance of transportation train efficiency is neither the size of the load nor the speed, but a balance between the two, so that it can be just right. Therefore, the study of the combination of load and speed is still the most important thing in transportation. Because merely increasing the load of vehicles does not necessarily result in the greatest use of efficiency. Of course, on shorter main lines and roads with less material transportation, transportation trains often have to pick up and drop off military vehicles along the way and load and unload goods. Therefore, the load is different along the way, and the parking time is longer, so it is difficult to talk about the combination of load and speed. However, on roads with longer lines and more material transportation, there must be many trains composed of whole carloads of goods, traveling longer distances, and not having to stop along the way, or stopping very little. The railway authorities should study the economy of load and speed for these vehicles, in order to obtain the greatest efficiency of the average time of the vehicles.

In order to implement the above suggestions, the author believes that the railway authorities today should study the following points, determine considerable standards, and implement them effectively.

1. Determine the most economical speed and load tonnage of various vehicles on each section of the line.

2. Stipulate the performance standards that various vehicles should have on each section of the line, so as to compare them with actual performance at any time.

3. Study the vehicle grouping method to reduce the stopping time in each section.

4. For vehicles that do not need to stop or stop very little in each section, their travel times should be stipulated in detail and strictly observed, and efforts should be made to avoid the waste of time waiting for other vehicles.

Using empty vehicles to transport: It is common for railway companies to have empty vehicles in transportation. However, this loss is great, especially now that the number of military vehicles is insufficient, this phenomenon can no longer be tolerated. Therefore, railway managers should strive to reduce the mileage of empty vehicles. If there are too many empty vehicles, in addition to improving the vehicle dispatching method, a fundamental remedy should be sought, which is to increase transportation in the direction of empty vehicles.

Decision on the priority of cargo transportation: Although whatever methods of improvement are imagined in cargo transportation today, the shortage of vehicles is a fact. Therefore, the power of vehicles to transport cargo is limited. When using limited power to transport cargo, of course, the nature and needs of various cargoes should be carefully studied. There should be a decision on who should transport first and who should transport later. The standard for this decision is to look at the degree of relationship between each cargo and the lives of the people today.

The rapid loading and unloading of cargo: The result of the rapid loading and unloading of cargo can of course reduce many of the ills caused by delays. The turnover of vehicles is therefore flexible, so it indirectly increases the transportation efficiency of cargo vehicles.
