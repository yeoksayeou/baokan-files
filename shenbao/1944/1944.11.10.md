### New Japanese Elite Troops Fiercely Attack, Battle Unfolds on Leyte, Enemy Airfield on Morotai Sliced in Two

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – On Leyte Island, Japanese defending forces are currently engaged in fierce battles with approximately five enemy divisions in the western highlands of places like Buloen, Tagame, and Aaro (northwest of Tagame), inflicting significant damage and awaiting an opportunity for a counterattack. This month, the enemy's strong 24th Division infiltrated Manaribanaas (12 kilometers west of Carigara on the north coast of Leyte Island) and is determined to advance towards Carigara. Advancing westward along the south coast, they are currently facing fierce attacks from newly arrived Japanese elite troops near the southwest corner of this bay. Enemy forces in this area are primarily adopting a defensive posture. Some units have been routed due to skillful Japanese operations. However, the enemy has already reorganized and is using the airfields of Tacloban, Talac, Sambabro, and Buloen, attempting to deploy large aircraft. Japanese air units are currently bombing enemy airfields day and night. On the other hand, enemy forces on Morotai Island have occupied the southern coast and part of the northern coast, building an airfield at Kila Point as a relay base for Leyte Island. The Japanese forces on the island are bombing with unpredictable tactics, splitting the enemy airfield into east and west sections in mid-October. On October 22nd, they launched a surprise attack on the enemy position at Bilaao, annihilating 200 enemy soldiers. The enemy, fearing the Japanese army's relentless day and night suicide attacks, has shortened its battle lines. Japanese raiding parties appear and disappear at the enemy airfield, rendering it unusable. Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) – German naval commentator Admiral Salwebieter has commented on the fierce Japanese attacks and American weaknesses in the Philippine naval and air battles as follows: Among all the major battles, the Philippine Sea battle is the most noteworthy in the world. The Japanese military's war against the American fleet, transport convoys, and supply lines in Leyte Gulf, based on currently available reports, has achieved new successes. Various types of Japanese naval units have achieved outstanding successes. Japanese aerial bombing units are attacking American ships and transport convoys in Leyte Gulf day and night. The American fleet is currently staying in Leyte Gulf to protect the landing forces and supply them. Although this American fleet has suffered significant damage, it is still forced to remain in Leyte Gulf. Japanese torpedo boat units are attacking American supply convoys, sinking many transport ships. Japanese attacks on American supply lines are mainly carried out by light fleets. Fortunately, the American military currently lacks secure air bases, and its offensive power relies entirely on easily attacked aircraft carriers, making it impossible to achieve a stable position in the short term. In particular, the anchorage of the fleet cannot be fully protected against submarine and torpedo boat attacks with mines. The American military has considerable experience in quickly establishing air bases. The Japanese military urgently needs to consider countermeasures.

General Yamashita's Inaugural Address, Philippines, 9th (Central News Agency) – General Yamashita Tomoyuki met with the press corps for the first time on the 8th, delivering a confident address on the war situation: "Recently, we inflicted a crushing blow on the enemy's large mobile unit in the waters off Taiwan. Subsequently, in the waters east of the Philippines, Leyte Gulf, east of Saipan, and the Morotai area, the Japanese army and navy air forces and navy have all achieved victories. I am extremely pleased about this. These victories are all based on the Japanese tradition of sacrifice, with a small number of troops and machines. All Japanese people can embrace this spirit of sacrifice to face the national crisis, and I am confident that we can seize the opportunity to win. We are all currently undertaking our missions with this spirit. In the past, in the larger islands of the Pacific, Japanese troops were fired upon from all directions by enemy warships and bombed by enemy aircraft. Japanese soldiers were able to sacrifice themselves in this isolated and helpless situation, fighting with a few against many until they were all killed in battle. I can only express my heartfelt sympathy and respect for this. I will strive to fully develop our combat power in the future. Although the Philippines is called an island nation, we must never allow the enemy to freely enter and exit this vast area as they have in the past. The Philippines has been ravaged by foreigners in the past, and its several attempts at independence have failed. Their feelings of pain and anger are understandable. Statues of Rizal are visible everywhere in the Philippines. I deeply admire the patriotic youth and am pleased that there are now many like Rizal in the Philippines. Although the Philippines has only been independent for a year, we are willing to do our best to support its development to the extent possible. The unscrupulous United States intends to obliterate the independence of the Philippines, using a large number of battleships, aircraft carriers, and cruisers to infringe upon the security of the Philippines. However, we are determined to protect the independence of the Philippines with our lives and enable the Philippines to step onto the world stage and complete our mission."

Lieutenant General Tominaga's Reflections, Manila, 9th (Central News Agency) – Lieutenant General Tominaga, the new commander of the Japanese Army Air Force in the Philippines, expressed his reflections on his unwavering beliefs on the afternoon of the 8th: "I have received a great mission this time, commanding the frontline air force, and I swear to persevere to the end with a firm determination to face difficulties. I also believe that the national fortune of the divine nation of Japan will last forever, and we can win the final victory. I am immensely honored to share weal and woe and carry out great justice with the brave soldiers who wholeheartedly serve the country."

### Japanese Art and Handicrafts to be Exhibited in China

### Japanese Army Breaks into Guilin City, Remnants of Chongqing Forces Gradually Retreating

Guiyang, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to news from the Japanese army base outside Guilin City: The Japanese army attacking Guilin broke into Guilin City on the 9th. The Japanese army, which had been waiting on the opposite bank of the Guijiang River on the east side of Guilin, first crossed the Guijiang River under artillery cover on the evening of the 8th. At 0:10 AM on the 9th, they successfully crossed the river for the first time and broke into the city. The breakthrough point was in the area between Fubo Mountain and the East Gate on the east side of the city center. The river was 200 meters wide. The Zhongzheng Bridge connecting the East Gate and the opposite bank had been destroyed by the Chongqing forces. The Japanese troops successfully crossed the river using civilian boats. Another Japanese army unit in the eastern part of the Guijiang River has occupied the fortress of Qixing Rock, which houses the air defense headquarters and a large cave capable of accommodating 20,000 people. The northern Japanese army has occupied the North Railway Station and is approaching the highlands to its southwest. Another unit has occupied the Beiqiao Textile Factory near the new city area of Guilin and is advancing towards the North Gate. The city of Guilin is ablaze with fire, black smoke rises into the sky, and the roaring of artillery still shakes the mountains. According to news from the Japanese army base outside Guilin City: The Japanese army units attacking Guilin launched a general offensive at dawn on the 9th. A unit of Japanese troops advancing from the east crossed the river in the face of the enemy and broke into the city. The Japanese army advancing from the north has also occupied key points in the new city area of Guilin and is currently expanding its gains. According to captured Chongqing soldiers, the Chongqing defending forces inside and outside Guilin City numbered over 20,000, including three divisions of the 31st Army (Guangxi Army), one division of the 26th Army, and more than two regiments of the 79th Army, which are four divisions of the Chongqing direct army. They had prepared about a month's worth of food in the city. It is also learned that the Japanese elite troops, in order to inflict a devastating blow on the Chongqing forces in that area in one fell swoop, are directly approaching the Chongqing army's position with the force of a river breaking its banks.

Guangxi Front, 9th (Central News Agency) – After the vanguard of the Japanese rapid unit began its attack along the Xiang-Gui Railway, it continued to pursue the Chongqing army on the night of the 31st, breaking through the new city area of Guilin and rushing to the vicinity of the North Gate of Guilin. However, most of the Chongqing army still guarded the area inside and outside the city, using a dense network of defensive firepower from the surrounding rocky mountain positions outside the city to counterattack. Therefore, the Japanese army was facing off against the Chongqing army at a location four kilometers from the outskirts. In the past eight days, the Japanese army has launched attacks with extreme caution, launching strong attacks on the surrounding rocky mountain positions day and night to suppress the Chongqing army. By the evening of the 8th, the Japanese besieging army had fully prepared the siege of Guilin and launched a general offensive at dawn on the 9th with the cooperation of the air force and tank units.

They had prepared about a month's worth of food in the city.

### Authorities Actively Planning to Stop Illegal Extortion in Order to Stabilize People's Livelihood and Promote National Policy

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Recently, prices in various places have continued to rise, making people's lives increasingly difficult. Therefore, the government authorities have actively planned countermeasures. If the problem of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies cannot be fundamentally eliminated, then the actual stability of the national economy cannot be expected to develop normally. Not only that, the illegal extortion on the material circulation lines is unlimited and unreasonable. Their acts of forcibly collecting, threatening, and intimidating harm farmers and merchants and indirectly affect the people's efforts to increase production.

Therefore, while all exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies should be stopped as soon as possible, it is also necessary to find ways to make these extortionists disappear so that the source of materials is not affected and the people's lives can be stabilized. In this way, not only can the national economy be established, but also the operation of the national policy on increasing production and the gaining of popular support will be smoothly promoted. It is deeply hoped that the government will quickly plan countermeasures to meet the people's expectations.

### News Association Holds Standing Committee Meeting

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Since its establishment, the Chinese News Association has been actively carrying out various tasks. In order to discuss the progress of its work in the month since its establishment and the future promotion direction, the Association has specifically scheduled its first Standing Committee Meeting to be held in the capital at 3:00 PM today (the 10th). Xu Liqiu, the chief standing director, and Jin Weibai, the standing director, arrived in Beijing from Shanghai today to hold a meeting with the standing directors in Beijing.

Editorial

### 重慶的苦悶

Chongqing is currently facing numerous predicaments in military, political, and diplomatic aspects. It lacks the courage to accept overall peace, yet lacks the strength to continue fighting, truly a dilemma of advance or retreat.

First, regarding military affairs, after successive major defeats in Henan and Hunan, the Japanese army has even penetrated into Guangxi, approaching key points such as Guilin and Liuzhou. The southwestern half of the country is in greater peril. From this point on, the Allied forces will be able to coordinate with the Southern Army in the Vietnam area. This has significant implications for both the war against Chongqing and the operations against Britain and the United States. In particular, the great blow suffered by Chongqing is unimaginable. In the recent decisive battles in Henan, Hunan, and Guangxi, the weaknesses of the Chongqing army were fully exposed. The supposedly elite forces of Tang Enbo and Hu Zongnan were easily defeated in the Longhai Railway campaign. Xue Yue's army, which prided itself on being good at fighting, was also ultimately routed. Although the U.S. provided air support and dispatched generals to participate in the command, they were ultimately unable to reverse the fate of defeat due to the disparity in combat power. Chongqing also hoped that the British army in India and Burma and the U.S. naval and air forces in the Pacific could hold back the Japanese army's advance in mainland China. However, the British army was pinned down by the Japanese army, and the U.S. army suffered successive defeats in Taiwan and the Philippines. Thus, Chongqing's wishful thinking of relying on external forces to relieve its crisis became a bubble.

In the political sphere, the friction between Chongqing and the Communists is increasing unabated. Recently, under U.S. mediation, Chongqing and the Communists held several rounds of negotiations. However, judging from the mutually accusatory talks between Wang Shijie and Lin Zuhan, and the various demands made by the Communist Party to the Chongqing side for the reorganization of the government, it is clear that the relationship between the two sides has not only not improved, but is becoming increasingly serious. Furthermore, other small parties besides the Communist Party are also deeply dissatisfied with Chongqing's dictatorial politics, and are turning to collude with the Communist Party in an attempt to use the Communist Party's strength to restrain dictatorship. As a result, the Communist Party has become even more arrogant and domineering. At the same time, Chongqing's unprofitable war of attrition has led to economic bankruptcy and hardship for the people in various places, which has given the Communists the opportunity to deceive and incite people in various places, further intensifying the Communist Party's power. These factors have a significant impact on Chongqing's political position.

As for diplomacy, it is well known that Chongqing is currently being held hostage by Britain and the United States, especially the U.S. The ambitions of British and American imperialism to control China are endless. Recently, the United States has even gone a step further and demanded the supreme command of the Chongqing army, creating discord in the Chongqing-U.S. relationship. The rift between Chongqing and the U.S., centered on the Stilwell's departure from Chongqing incident, is particularly noteworthy. Chongqing's efforts to please the U.S. are not paying off. The United States, which trumpets democracy, is quite dissatisfied with Chongqing's dictatorial politics, and deeply disappointed with the Chongqing army's weak combat capabilities. Therefore, it has used this as a pretext for the Chongqing army to be commanded by the U.S. The United States wants to use more of China's power at its disposal, so it does not approve of the expansion of the friction between the Nationalists and Communists, and even acts as a mediator. Moreover, it supports Yan'an in certain aspects to suppress Chongqing, which truly puts Chongqing in a situation where it cannot cry out or shout.

Chongqing is trapped in extreme distress in military, political, economic, and diplomatic aspects. If it wants to break out of this difficult situation, it must consider fundamental policy changes. Then, does Chongqing have statesmen with great wisdom and courage!

Baojia personnel and people in each district participated in the exercises. The comprehensive dawn training was still the first time, and air defense personnel in each district were dispatched to implement various trainings. During the air raid alarm, when simulated enemy aircraft flew overhead and dropped fake bombs, each district implemented contact between surveillance sentries and underground personnel, as well as various trainings such as sheltering, bomb extinguishing, fire fighting, and rescue.

Large-Scale Exercise in Huangpu District

The Huangpu District implemented a large-scale comprehensive training at 3:00 PM on Jiujiang Road between the Huangpu Bund and Henan Road. Deputy Director Du Zhengjian of the Municipal Police Bureau, Police Chief Tsukazaki, and other senior officials inspected the scene. Branch Director Kobayashi Minesaburo of the Huangpu Branch and Deputy Branch Director Liu Yaying commanded all Baojia personnel to participate in the exercise. It is worth noting that during the training air raid alarm, when simulated enemy aircraft flew overhead, the surveillance sentry reported "Aircraft coming," and the liaison officer reported to the air defense personnel, and passersby lay prone on the ground for shelter training. Then, various trainings such as rescue, fire fighting, and bomb extinguishing were implemented, and the performance was very skilled. China Film Company specially filmed news footage on the spot, which was completed at about 4:00 PM.

### Air Defense Pool on Xizang Road Holds Water Filling Ceremony Yesterday

In order to prepare for emergencies and consolidate air defense and first aid, the City Air Defense Headquarters, in conjunction with the citizens of this city, built a huge reservoir in the center of Xizang Road, which has been under construction for three months and has recently been completed. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, a water filling ceremony was held.

### Household Rice in Nanshi Extends Deadline

### Symposium on Blind and Deaf Education (2) (4) The Popularity of Blind and Deaf Education

Huang Jingwan: We have just discussed the combined group of blind and deaf education, and now we will talk about the issue of popularity. The two seem to contradict each other, but they actually lead to the same goal by different paths. The former focuses on the cultivation of talent, and the latter focuses on the promotion of quantity. There are no accurate statistics on the number of blind and deaf people in our country, but due to traditional and environmental factors, blind and deaf education is not yet widespread. Therefore, there are two points to pay attention to in popularizing blind and deaf education: (1) It is necessary to publicize the significance of blind and deaf education, break traditional prejudices, and prevent people in society from treating blind and deaf children as waste. (2) We should provide relief to blind and deaf children who are out of school or unable to afford it, such as scholarship fund movements and the relief of blind and deaf children on the streets, etc. Please express your opinions.

Song Pengcheng: This point cannot be separated from the economy. We hope to have ample economic strength before we can talk about the popularity of blind and deaf education.

Wang Jingyuan: What can be done at present is to give society an inspiration, that is, there are many geniuses among blind and deaf people. Parents should give them educational opportunities and develop their special abilities. At present, many wealthy families have deaf and dumb children, and their parents, due to the shackles of traditional concepts, only make them warm and full all day long. This is indeed a major obstacle to blind and deaf education. We need to ask the opinion circle and the education circle to publicize and eliminate this prejudice.

He Zijian: There are many historical examples of blind and deaf geniuses, such as Beethoven, Homer, etc. Even in our country, there are many deaf and dumb students studying abroad!

Shi Dianqing: Each school should set up free places.

Li Dingqing: There are also many school boards that have specially set up scholarship amounts.

Wang Jingyuan: At the same time, I hope that the scholarship and loan fund of Shenxin Erbao will provide special measures for blind and deaf children who are out of school.

He Zijian: Regarding the relief of street children, our school has done a great deal of effort, and 98% of the children are raised and educated for free, including food, clothing, housing and management.

Wang Jingyuan: This point should be linked to the Children's Protection Section.

Zhang Qinggen: We hope that the Blind and Deaf Association will make some contribution to this point in the future.

Huang Jingwan: The purpose of education is to cultivate sound members who can stand in society. Blind and deaf education is no exception. Therefore, the vocational training of blind and deaf schools is more important than other points.

Wang Jingyuan: Because blind and deaf people have less listening and hearing, their knowledge and ability, generally speaking, progress more slowly. However, if they are engaged in a certain skill, they can settle down and concentrate, and have greater efficiency than ordinary people. Many jobs that do not require the use of eyes, ears, mouth and voice, such as carpentry, barbering, etc., are good outlets for blind and deaf people.

He Zijian: Blind people can take on any occupation that does not require the use of eyes. Our school also provides special training, such as rattan work, typing, weaving, etc. People with literary accomplishments also serve as secretaries.

Wang Jingyuan: Among the more than 300 graduates of our school over the years, about 60% of them serve the society, have decent jobs, and are able to cope with them happily, and about 30% of them go on to further education and specialize in art. Before the war, there were many people who worked in various bookstores and printing houses such as the Commercial Press, Zhonghua, and World, especially in the studio of the famous sculptor Jiang Xiaquan. At present, there are also many people who work in the set department and photography department of the China Film United Company and in various advertising agencies and banks. In addition, I hope that society will sympathize with the deaf and dumb and give them employment opportunities.

He Zijian: When our school was opened, we established sewing and knitting departments. Later, we successively added rattan, reed curtain, bamboo, net knitting, woodworking, and textile departments. At most, we accommodated more than 30 blind workers. Now, due to lack of raw materials, we have to stop. There are still more than 10 blind workers. We hope that the industrial and commercial circles will employ them.

Huang Jingwan: As the gentlemen said, we can see the achievements of the schools in working hard in difficult environments. I hope that you will continue to work hard to benefit the deaf and dumb. Thank you for your insights today, and thank Ms. Li for translating, so that Shanghai's rare silent symposium was conducted smoothly. The newspaper hereby thanks you all. (End)
