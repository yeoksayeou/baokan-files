### Editorial: The Awakening of the People of Shanghai: Public Before Private? Private Before Public? Only Private, No Public?

Yesterday, the Municipal Advisory Committee and various parks hosted Mayor Chen and other officials. During the meeting, Chairman Ji Sihao gave a speech, stating that the progress of Shanghai's municipal administration requires joint efforts in normal times, and even more so during wartime, in order to overcome all difficulties. We strongly agree with this view.

We have said before that all those who reside in Shanghai are citizens of Shanghai, and in a broad sense, this should include people from both the government and the public, both Chinese and foreign. If the resolution of all issues in Shanghai depends on the joint efforts of all Shanghai citizens, then people from both the government and the public, both Chinese and foreign, all have their due responsibilities and should strive to fulfill them. How should they fulfill their responsibilities? First and foremost, they should have a spirit of "public before private." For example, public officials should be loyal to their duties and never use their authority for personal gain or engage in corruption. Those in charge of tax collection should ensure that every drop of tax revenue goes to the public coffers. Police officers should serve the public order and not use their positions to extort from the people. The people should faithfully fulfill their tax obligations. If people from both the government and the public, both Chinese and foreign, share a spirit of "public first," then all municipal administration will be on the right track. Therefore, if one can put "public first," then putting "private after" will not be a problem.

However, in the current social environment, those among the entire citizenry who can truly embody the spirit of "public before private" are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Therefore, the problem of Shanghai's municipal administration remains without a proper path to follow, and is even fraught with crises and hidden worries. The main reason for this is the citizens' lack of a spirit of "public before private." Taking a step back, if one cannot put "public before private," then at least put "private before public," because to limit the "private after the public" then at least put "private before public" is absolutely impermissible. The circumstances of wartime are completely different from those of peacetime. In wartime, we are secretly competing with the enemy for the fate of the nation. If we win the war, the nation survives; if we lose, the nation perishes. Therefore, in wartime, the primary goal should be to strive for the survival of the nation. Under the demand for victory, everything personal can be sacrificed, but the public interest must not be harmed in the slightest. Currently, we are in the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, fighting with the enemy. If we want to guarantee the survival of the nation, we must abandon "private before public" and truly practice "public before private."

Looking at the general atmosphere of the people of Shanghai, frankly speaking, the spirit of "public before private," as mentioned above, is as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Even those who can put "private before public" are not many, and the most common are those who are "only private, no public." Most people only care about their own affairs and interests and are unwilling to consider public affairs and interests. For example, those who pursue profiteering at all costs, disregarding the public and harming others to benefit themselves, are solely focused on personal gain. This is a perfect example of someone who is "only private, no public." Another example is the black market rice prices of the past few days, in the import forms of rice near Shanghai. Because the atmosphere of "only private, no public" is spreading, if the nation and society cease to exist, where can the individual attach himself? Private property will inevitably meet the fate of the Jews.

In this time of war, "private before public" is already impermissible, and "only private, no public" is even more dangerous. In order to strive for the survival of the nation and build a new Shanghai, we must eliminate "only private, no public" and correct the prevailing atmosphere. On the positive side, we should promote social welfare undertakings, such as police consumer cooperatives, labor service camps for vagrants, and living subsidies for teachers and staff. These address municipal issues related to public order, livelihood, and education. On the negative side, we should advocate thrift and reduce personal desires for enjoyment.

Public before private? Private before public? Only private, no public? Which to discard, which to choose? May all the people of Shanghai awaken together and truly decide which to choose?

### West Borneo Authorities Adapt to Wartime System

Yangon, 5th (Central News Agency) – The authorities in West Borneo, in order to adapt to the wartime system, are making significant progress in all their work through the active efforts of military, government, and civilian personnel, with the assistance of the indigenous people. They are striving to overcome manpower shortages and transportation difficulties in shipbuilding, lumbering, mining, and forestry production and development, in order to enhance war capabilities, and have achieved great results. In terms of shipbuilding, despite difficulties in materials and labor, they were able to achieve the planned output of tens of thousands of tons last year. This year, they are also planning to build several tens of thousands of tons of naval-type sailing ships and tugboats, a fourfold increase over last year. With the cooperation of all parties, this goal should be easily achieved.

### The Spirit of Hardship and Endurance is Cultivated in the Japanese Army: Chiang Kai-shek's Admonition to Military Students

Guangdong, 5th (Central News Agency) – According to the Chongqing Dagongbao, Chiang Kai-shek, in his previous speech to the first regiment of the first training group, approximately 4,000 military students, mentioned the difficult life he experienced more than 30 years ago when he served as an apprentice officer in the Takada Regiment in Japan. The gist of his speech is as follows: The military life that I had in the Takada unit, its hardship it is not what our Chinese youths could imagine. Japanese new recruits usually enter the camp during the depths of winter, and the Takada unit was located in Niigata Prefecture, the coldest and snowiest part of northern Japan. However, no matter how cold the weather was, we had to get up at 5 a.m. every day and personally fetch water from the well. After washing up, we had to take care of the horses. The food in the Japanese army, whether it was rice or dishes, was fixed and could not be increased or decreased at will, unlike you who can now increase or decrease as you please. Vegetables were only bland foods such as salted fish and pickles, and meat was eaten only once a week. Although there were many nobles and wealthy children among us, everyone was treated the same. During the first half month after entering the camp, because I was not used to it, I could only endure hunger every time I ate. It was not until the evening that I could go to the store in the camp to buy snacks to fill my stomach. Snacks were not allowed to be bought in large quantities, only two or three pieces per person, and it was not easy to buy them if it was a little late. But in order to fill my stomach, I had to endure it. It was not until two weeks later that I gradually got used to the food. In addition, new recruits had to wash clothes and polish shoes for the old soldiers, and sometimes even sew clothes for the old soldiers. This period was actually the most memorable period of hard work in my life. The fighting spirit of not fearing difficulties and hardships was cultivated during this period.

### Central News Agency Convenes Cadre Meeting

Chairman Zhao Muru of the agency also attended. Mr. Anishi, Information Director of the Japanese Embassy in the Allied States, attended and participated.

Then, guest Mr. Anishi, Information Director, delivered a speech, which mainly elaborated on the purpose of the Greater East Asia War and the aims of Japan's new policy towards China. He also explained the situation in the European theater and the so-called opening of the second front, as well as the general situation in Germany. Finally, in addition to emphasizing the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War and the importance of the ideological struggle to eliminate the oppression of East Asian nations by Britain and the United States, he pointed out that the Central News Agency of China and the Allied News Agency of Japan should work together to engage in this sacred ideological struggle in order to complete the Greater East Asia War and establish a new order in Greater East Asia. After Minister Anishi finished his speech, Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department gave a speech. Minister Lin first described the current situation and then gave three instructions on the future development of the Central News Agency's work: the selection of dispatches, the working principles of editing and interviewing, and how to make the connection between the head office and branch offices closer. His instructions were very detailed and meticulous. Finally, he encouraged everyone to work hard with a fighting spirit to complete the great mission of the national news agency. After Minister Lin finished his speech, Director Guo stood up to express his gratitude, and then the meeting was photographed. The meeting continued at 3:00 p.m. to discuss the agenda.

### Prospects for the Italian Front: Prelude to the Decisive Battle in Europe

Since the enemy's 5th and 8th Armies under General Alexander began their general attack on the German defense lines at Cassino and Gaeta Bay on the morning of May 12, the southern Italian front has become active again. Having failed in their desperate attempt to capture Cassino, which they attacked with many times their strength from March 15, what winning strategy are the British and American forces planning for their renewed attack? The curtain has only just been raised on the battle, so it is too early to make a judgment. The current situation and future predictions are summarized as follows:

Fierce Fighting on All Fronts

This offensive began with intense artillery and air bombardment, deploying large numbers of armored vehicles and launching a three-dimensional offensive. The intensity of the attack and defense is unprecedented since the start of the Italian theater.

The main battlefields are currently in the mountainous areas of the southern mountains, namely the areas around Minturno, Castelforte, San Elia, and the southern and northern areas centered on Cassino. On the 12th, the American forces attacked the German defense line on the western coast of Minturno, in order to prevent the consolidation of Mittum, and captured northern Maria. Mount Inde in France was counterattacked a few hours later, with no changes. On the 13th, several cruisers attacked and threatened the German supply line behind Minturno from the sea, but were also counterattacked. The fighting was quite fierce in Castelforte. On Mount Fait to the north, there were several bayonet fights, and the outcome is not yet clear, but Mount Maiola, which controls the mountain, is in the hands of the German army. To the north of that, in the area near Cassino, they launched a fierce attack from the Liri Valley on the San Andulese side against the German army stationed to the west of the valley. They secured a bridgehead on the other side of the stream and attempted to advance towards Minataello.

On the other hand, the British army, which launched an offensive from San Angelo, nine kilometers south of Cassino, engaged in fierce fighting with the Hu parachute units defending the area. After the first day, the strength of the British army gradually weakened.

In addition, the British and American Fifth Army, which is assembled in the foothills south of Ulronge in the western region, has a total strength of about four to five divisions. On the other hand, in the eastern region, the British Eighth Army, which is stationed from the Liri Valley south of Cassino to the plain, has a strength of about three divisions with independent armored brigades. Advance to the front.

The British and American air forces are also blindly bombing the entire Italian border following the ground offensive. The number of enemy planes coming and going over Rome has increased significantly since the 14th.

British and Americans Change Operational Policies

The goal of the enemy's offensive is to open up the "road to Rome." Having failed at Cassino, the enemy abandoned the tactic of concentrating their offensive on one point and tried to break through from somewhere along the entire line and seek further development. But this method naturally requires a great deal of manpower and time, and is virtually impossible in front of the German defense lines.

Therefore, the German and Italian military leaders all agreed that the British and American forces might launch an offensive along the entire line in order to confuse and restrain the German army, and begin an offensive from Natuno, or seek new landing points in the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Adriatic Sea.

However, the recent response of the enemy forces to the bandits in the northern Adriatic Sea, where the enemy has not been seen in action, requires considerable vigilance. At a time when the second front in Europe is making a lot of noise, the reopening of this front has a very profound meaning.

The Correlation of the Second Front

For the past two or three months, the question of whether the second front will be implemented or not has become a common topic of conversation. Everyone says that the second front is impossible unless it starts within May. So, is the current activity on the southern front a diversionary tactic or a prelude to the future second front, with the British and Americans trying to get away with capturing the Italian peninsula, or are they seeking a foothold from which to attack southern France and the Balkans, and as part of their strategy? These are all thought-provoking and noteworthy questions. (Sho: Translated from the May 17th issue of the Japanese Yomiuri Hochi)

### Manchukuo Diplomatic and Consular Conference in China Scheduled to be Held in the Capital; Special Envoy for Political Affairs to Come to China

### Regarding the Yudu 12th Plenary Session: Inside Story of its Convocation

Central News Agency dispatch: The Yudu regime, dissatisfied with the United States and Britain, and to avoid attacks from other political parties, convened the 12th Plenary Session, resolving to reform the censorship system and implement a constitutional program. On the surface, it seems to be maintaining the status of a democratic country in an attempt to dispel doubts from all parties, but in reality, it still adheres to its past dictatorial policies. Recently, reliable sources have revealed the Yudu regime's attempts to conceal the truth and its internal panic and embarrassment. The details are as follows:

Easing the Atmosphere: Regarding the resolutions of the 12th Plenary Session held by the Yudu regime at the end of last month, the reform of the censorship system for newspapers and magazines, and the constitutional implementation program, the former resolution is particularly surprising. The Yudu regime uses democratic countries as a facade, and its usual attitude is even more suspicious. Secondly, regarding the issue of constitutional implementation, during the 11th Plenary Session last September, opinions differed greatly, especially with strong criticism from the Communist Party. Jiang of Yudu was forced to declare that a National Assembly would be convened within one year after the end of the war to ease the atmosphere. However, judging from the past facts of the Yudu regime, such as the decisions of the 6th Plenary Session in the 26th year of the Republic of China and the National Assembly on November 12th of the 29th year, they were never actually implemented. This was the first dissatisfaction of the Communist Party. Currently, the Communist Party has three conditions for the Yudu regime to fulfill when implementing constitutionalism: Guarantee the people's democratic freedom, lift the ban on political parties, and implement local autonomy. Not only are there those within the Yudu regime who express sympathy for these demands, but even the United States and Britain deeply agree. Therefore, the Yudu regime is greatly frightened. In order to prevent losing the faith of the people, they are now proposing to implement constitutionalism, hoping to convene the National Assembly at the end of next year and implement it after the decision, solely to ease the atmosphere from all parties.

Extreme Embarrassment: In the past, when the Yudu regime convened a meeting of the Central Executive Committee, it was necessary to first hold a National Political Council meeting to be considered legitimate. However, this time, the 12th Plenary Session was convened unilaterally without a prior National Political Council meeting, which proves that the Yudu regime has not abandoned its dictatorship. On the one hand, they pretend to cope with the current situation, and on the other hand, they conceal it with reforms to the censorship system and the proclamation of a constitutional program. After the 12th Plenary Session, they convened a so-called administrative meeting, and the "governors" of various provinces were summoned to participate in the Yudu, discussing the so-called improvement of efficiency in the construction of various provinces. When it was learned that the Japanese army was attacking the Dongting Lake Yudu "Sixth War Zone," all the "governors" were extremely anxious and rushed back to their respective defense areas. The reason for their embarrassment was none other than the Japanese army's attack on Henao the next day and their capture of Luoyang in one fell swoop. They were completely taken by surprise by the Japanese army's unexpected victory, and they could not clearly predict the future movements of the Japanese army. Furthermore, the discord between Hu Zongnan's army and Jiang Dingwen's army in Yudu, under the serious friction between the two, further shows that the suspension of this administrative meeting in Yudu was due to panic. This proves that the Yudu side itself is extremely panic-stricken.

Soaring Prices: In addition, in Yudu, inflation is rampant, prices are soaring, and people's lives are miserable, causing resentment everywhere. The reasons for the high cost of living are nothing more than inflation, shortage of materials, and speculation. Therefore, the inflation of Yudu's legal tender is a clear indication of the bankruptcy of credit. Moreover, the sharp increase in the amount of Yudu's legal tender is tantamount to financial losses, leading to active speculation. While increasing the currency supply, materials become even more scarce. As of now, the amount of Yudu's currency in circulation has not been announced since September of the 29th year of the Republic of China. It is estimated that by the end of June of that year, the amount in circulation was 39.6 billion yuan, and since then, it has been issued recklessly in large quantities. Yudu's economists have estimated that the amount issued in recent years has reached more than 10 trillion yuan, all manufactured in the United States and transported by air from northern India to Yudu. On September 27th of last year, Ta Kung Pao revealed that Yudu's legal tender accounted for 40% of the materials carried by American planes flying from India to Yudu. At the same time, it pointed out that what is needed most now are military supplies and ammunition. If legal tender continues to be transported in this way, Yudu's finances may collapse in the future, but the Yudu side turns a deaf ear. At the same time, Huangpu military personnel and local private capitalists are also launching attacks. Regarding the exorbitant prices in Yudu, it is quite difficult to estimate the index. A famous economist in Yudu estimated that if the index for the first half of the 26th year of the Republic of China was assumed to be 100 points, it would be 7,000 points at the end of the 31st year of the Republic of China, 30,000 points in January of this year, and now it is 45,000 points. From this, it can be seen that the price index in Yudu has exceeded the amount of currency in circulation by several times, which is a vicious inflation in Yudu.

### Germany Officially Announces Withdrawal from Rome; Determination to Resist Remains Unshaken

Central News Agency rapid dispatch from Berlin, 5th: Huitong News Agency dispatch: The German High Command has announced the withdrawal of German troops from Rome.

Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 5th: Huitong News Agency dispatch: To avoid the poison of war in Rome, German troops have withdrawn from Rome. The German Supreme Commander publicly stated: "Because the battlefield is increasingly approaching Rome, this oldest cultural center in the world is in danger of being indirectly involved in the war. To avoid this danger, the Führer has ordered German troops to retreat to the northwest of the city. The war in Italy will continue with unwavering determination to achieve the final defeat of the enemy, and to jointly achieve victory with the Allied nations. The prerequisite is close cooperation with Italy and other allied countries. The year of invasion of Europe will be the time when the enemy encounters a disastrous defeat."

Central News Agency dispatch from Milan, 5th: German News Agency dispatch: After the anti-Axis forces occupied Rome, the Italian Fascist Republic announced today that all entertainment venues in Italy will be closed, and all sports competitions will also be canceled during this period.

Successful German Rearguard Action: Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 5th: Huitong News Agency dispatch: Hitler, in order to prevent the ancient city of Rome from being ravaged by war, has ordered German troops to withdraw from Rome. The German High Command has never intended to defend Rome to the death. In the past few days, the German rearguard units have prevented the enemy from advancing rapidly in the south of the city, allowing the main forces to withdraw to more advantageous new positions, and the enemy's encirclement plan has completely failed. In the future, the food for the 1.4 million residents of Rome will be provided by the enemy, which is not an easy task. The anti-Axis forces advancing towards Rome from the east and southeast have suffered heavy losses in the Alban Hills and the Campagna. A small German unit held Mount Cavour until its ammunition was exhausted before withdrawing. The enemy's French tank columns suffered heavy losses in the Zagarolo-Palestrina-Cave area. On the Tyrrhenian coast, German troops withdrew to the lower reaches of the Tiber River, with almost no hindrance from the enemy.

Proposal to Demilitarize Rome: Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, 5th: Huitong News Agency dispatch, London dispatch: British newspapers said that the anti-Axis forces are expected to accept Marshal Kesselring's proposal to recognize Rome as a demilitarized city. British newspapers hinted that the anti-Axis forces will make full use of Rome as a transportation hub.

Italy Upholds Alliance Unwaveringly: Central News Agency dispatch from Milan, 5th: Huitong News Agency dispatch: Rome radio reports revealed that even if Rome falls, the Italian Fascist Republic is determined to continue the war.

Luo Qiu Jiang Reports on the War Situation: Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 5th: President Roosevelt will address the nation on the German withdrawal from Rome.

Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, 5th: Huitong News Agency dispatch. London news: Downing Street has learned that British Prime Minister Churchill will report on the war situation to the House of Commons this week.

British Public Unmoved by Old News: Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, 5th: Huitong News Agency dispatch: Reuters reporters said that although British newspapers published the news of Rome's imminent fall under large headlines, it was not enough to fully stimulate the people's enthusiasm for victory. People have long anticipated the progress of the war in Italy, and even if there are any developments in the future, it will be difficult to generate a major reaction. Currently, the only news that can interest the British people is the invasion of Western Europe. However, most of the British public are aware of the arduousness of this task and believe that it is extremely difficult. Moreover, after the Tehran Conference, the emotions of the British people were quite tense for a while, but since there has been no movement for a long time, their nerves have inevitably relaxed, and they feel that their previous speculations and expectations were somewhat wrong.

### After the Establishment of Bulgaria's New Cabinet, Cooperation with Germany Strengthens; Relations with the Soviet Union Become Tense

Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 5th: In addition to the fierce battle for Rome in the European theater, the most noteworthy event is the diplomatic war between Germany and the Soviet Union, centered on Bulgaria. Since the outbreak of the revolution in Ecuador in South America and the establishment of a new regime, the weakening of the United States' influence in South America has become increasingly obvious. At the same time, the Soviet Union's influence behind the scenes has gradually risen, which is extremely noteworthy. Following the movement of the Eastern Front, Bulgaria formed a tripartite alliance with Germany on the one hand, and maintained a delicate neutral stance towards the Soviet Union on the other hand. After the situation in the Balkans became tense, Germany strongly demanded that Bulgaria strengthen its cooperation with Germany. Bulgaria formed a people's front at home, and issued appeals to Britain and the United States to withdraw from the Bulgarian front abroad. On the other hand, the Soviet Union increased the number of consulates in Bulgaria and made other demands, which contradicted the alliance relationship with Germany. As a result, the Baivlov cabinet, which was in a dilemma, had no choice but to resign en masse due to political instability. The new cabinet of former Minister of Agriculture Bagjanov was established on May 31, and the political situation has become more stable. At the same time, judging from the nature of the new cabinet, it can be seen that Bulgaria's cooperation with Germany will be strengthened in the future, and the tension in relations with the Soviet Union will inevitably be unavoidable.

### Eastern Front Quiet; German Labor Corps Leader Killed in Action

Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 5th: Huitong News Agency dispatch: According to reliable sources, the Eastern Front was slightly quiet yesterday. The mountains north and northwest of Yassi are still in the hands of the German army, and the 11th Romanian Infantry Division has made great contributions. Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 5th: Professor Buden Kuman, the leader of the Shete Labor Corps on the Eastern Front, was killed in action on the 4th. The professor was a collaborator of War Production Minister Speer. In 1940, he served as the supervisor of the construction department of the Air Force expansion plan and the Minister of Construction in East Asia. Since 1942, he has served as the leader of the Dutet Labor Corps on the Eastern Front.

### Meticulous German Preparations to Defend Western Europe

Central News Agency dispatch from Zurich, 5th: The Madrid correspondent of the British Daily Mail reported that German Marshal Lundstedt had instructed the German troops in Western Europe to "prepare for battle." Soldiers at various airfields, fortresses, and tank bases were carrying out surveillance work all night long. A special correspondent of the Swedish newspaper in Berlin reported that the German Foreign Ministry expressed the following views: The postponement of the anti-Axis invasion operation is closely related to the US presidential election. Roosevelt, regardless of the success or failure of the Eisenhower plan, decided his political future, and this domestic political reason has forced Roosevelt to cancel his meeting with Stalin. In this regard, the Pravda reprinted as follows: The Italian front has continued to delay the anti-Axis invasion operation in Western Europe, but the regular authorities have yet to determine how long the invasion operation will be postponed. The German authorities acknowledge that the anti-Axis propaganda and incitement are quite clever, but regardless of the timing, there is no change in the German defense preparations.

### Swedish Armed Forces Maintain Neutrality

Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, 5th: Huitong News Agency dispatch: General Younger, Commander-in-Chief of the Swedish Army, said at the establishment of the Malmö Barracks that Sweden has the possibility of defending its neutrality at any time with a war-like posture. "We still have the determination to be forced to maintain neutrality by force. Therefore, we must use every opportunity to engage in preparations for war."

### The Daily Life of the Japanese Navy

Now that the colors of total war are becoming increasingly profound, the Japanese Navy, with its excellent equipment and glorious traditions, is undergoing training that is truly unparalleled. This Navy spirit, honed through countless trials, was the reason for attending the Navy Military Training Seminar held for three days under the guidance of Sasebo Naval Base. I witnessed the daily life of a naval recruit, the cradle of the Navy's elite, and came into contact with the unwavering determination to fight to the death against Britain and the United States. The true image of the Navy on the day of the decisive battle is reported as follows:

During the training period, we stayed on the training ship, a former state-of-the-art destroyer that had broken through countless waves and established meritorious service in the previous European War. The first order was: "Crew, five minutes before reveille!" This was the order for the entire crew to wake up for the day. Then, they boarded the deck and lined up in formation.

At 6:00 AM, led by the duty instructor, we observed the morning rituals. The lush green essence emanating from the trees permeated the damp hills of the dawn. The white-clad men stood tall and tense, forming an orderly and massive group for training. In accordance with the morning ceremonies, we reverently bowed towards the Imperial Palace, offered silent prayers, and chanted Emperor Meiji's imperial poem. After completing a part of the ceremony,

we immediately engaged in cleaning duties. The rest began naval exercises. After observing the morning rituals, we returned to the ship and brushed our teeth and washed our faces with water from small washbasins.

At 7:30 AM, we prepared breakfast. Following the squad leader's orders, we ate. The food was simple, but it provided sufficient nutrition.

Preparation of the Guard Detail

At 8:00 AM, we raised the naval ensign and held the morning assembly. The naval ensign is the life of the warship. "Preparation of the guard detail" was ordered ten minutes before raising the ensign. We meticulously inspected our uniforms and movements with the utmost reverence. The warrant officer led the guard detail to the stern deck flagstaff and prepared the formation. On time, under the order of the duty officer, and amidst the blaring sound of the national anthem, the solemn naval ensign was raised. Then, the morning assembly was carried out.

At 9:15 AM, under the guidance of the instructors, we conducted short boat training. The short boat is a part of the warship. Once it leaves the warship by one foot, under the beckoning of the glorious naval ensign, we must resolve to be isolated on the ocean. Short boat training expresses the indomitable spirit of the naval tradition. We boarded two nine-foot boats, each equipped with a commander, a coxswain, and twelve rowers. The short boats left the mother ship and went out onto the shimmering sea.

At 11:45 AM, we had lunch.

At 1:15 PM, we listened to a lecture by Chief Instructor Colonel Ichikawa in the officers' mess. Colonel Ichikawa had served as an instructor at the Naval Academy and taught the art of command. He defined the essence of command as "lofty insights, judgment, determination, and disposition." He stated, "Admiral Yamamoto was an excellent commander because his insights were truly accurate." He warned those who came later not to become complacent and finally emphasized the belief that the Imperial Land would never be defeated. Following this, Naval Academy Commandant Colonel Izawa and other officers and instructors held a panel discussion. The Navy's training had long ceased to distinguish between Sundays and Saturdays, with no days of rest. The instructors expressed a sublime passion for educating the new recruits, a feeling of love that was as strong and indescribable as that of parents for their sons.

At 4:45 PM, we had dinner.

At 5:29 PM, the naval ensign was lowered. At 6:30 PM, we took a bath. Bathing inside the ship was extremely refreshing, but very brief, because we were considerate of the people who came later. Towels could not be used in the bathtubs, so the bathwater remained clear even after everyone had finished bathing. This expressed the Navy's teachings. At 7:00 PM, we conducted rope training. This is one of the most important training exercises in naval life. The Navy uses both steel and hemp ropes. In order to prevent danger, there is a scientific analysis from every angle. That is,

Short Boat Training

At 7:20 PM, having gained confidence from the short boat training during the day, we bravely went out to sea in the darkness. The short boat rushed through the waves, with the flickering of noctiluca. The air was filled with starlight. The heart and mind felt so comfortable that even the pain in the palms of our hands was completely forgotten.

At 8:00 PM, we hung up our hammocks. Hammocks can be used to stop bullets in battle, as everyone knows. Not only that, but if the hammock is tied tightly and held in the sea, it can float on the surface of the sea for up to 24 hours. Even when the warship rocks, the hammock does not rock much, making it the most comfortable bed. The preparation and cleaning of the hammock must be done reliably, quickly, and quietly. Then, the order "Five minutes before inspection" was given, and the day's training came to an end.

At 9:00 PM, it was time for inspection. The duty officer was fully responsible for the security of the warship. The inspecting officer cast a loving eye on each soldier who had undergone rigorous training, grasping the breath of the healthy soldiers who embodied the naval spirit. Within the quiet warship at night, it could be faintly heard.

From the above experiences, I deeply felt that what is generally regarded as a "narrow path" and considered impossible, the Navy resolutely breaks through with a thorough decisive battle plan, achieving even greater results.

After the seminar ended, the reporter visited a certain naval air corps. The young fighters of the air corps boasted leisurely: "If the enemy planes break through our air defense array and invade our airspace, whether our planes are training planes or not, we will definitely use fifty planes to stop fifty enemy planes, and one hundred planes to deal with one hundred enemy planes. We will shoot down the enemy planes." The view of life and death achieved by the Japanese Navy through rigorous training is truly sublime and admirable.

### Municipal Administration Consultative Committee Hosts Mayor Chen Yesterday; Mayor Chen Expresses Views on the "Rice Problem"

Yesterday (the 5th), the Municipal Administration Consultative Committee of this city held a tea party at 4:00 PM in the meeting hall of the Industrial and Commercial Association to host Mayor Chen, Secretary-General Wu, the heads of various bureaus under the Municipal Government, including Xiong Jiandong, and over a hundred directors, supervisors, and members from five groups: the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens Welfare Association, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, the Industrial and Commercial Association, and the News Federation. The event was warmly hosted by the standing committee members of the Municipal Administration Consultative Committee, including Li Sihao, Chen Riping, Lin Kanghou, and Xiang Kangyuan, creating a very warm atmosphere. Details are recorded as follows:

Speech by Li Sihao

First, Li Sihao, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Administration Consultative Committee, delivered a speech stating: "In the current environment, both within China and in the Greater East Asia region, Shanghai's position is extremely important. Therefore, all of Shanghai's problems must be rationally resolved. On the other hand, Shanghai needs to solve many problems. In broader terms, these include issues of public security, people's livelihood, production, finance, and education. The solution of these problems must rely on the joint efforts of officials and the people to achieve smooth results. We believe that Mayor Chen and other officials have ideal ambitions and far-reaching aspirations for solving all of Shanghai's problems. The recent establishment of the Municipal Administration Consultative Committee demonstrates the authorities' eagerness to seek governance advice. Although the Consultative Committee is not a formal public opinion body, we, standing from the perspective of the citizens, express our deep appreciation. The Municipal Government and the general public should work together for municipal progress in normal times, and even more so during wartime, to overcome all difficulties. The purpose of the Municipal Administration Consultative Committee is to provide consultation to the Municipal Government and to collect public opinion from the citizens to make suggestions to the Municipal Government. Standing in the position of the Consultative Committee, we should strive to achieve the objectives we have set. Today's tea party, in addition to expressing respect to Mayor Chen and other officials, specially invites major figures from various public organizations and sectors in Shanghai to attend, representing the great unity of officials and the people, working together to solve all of Shanghai's problems and complete the goal of building a new Shanghai." After the speech, he also read out a written opinion on behalf of Committee Member Feng Bingnan, which briefly stated: "The implementation of the rationing system must ensure that rights and obligations are given equal emphasis and implemented simultaneously for it to succeed. The so-called right is that the procurement of rationed goods is solely the responsibility of the government's purchasing agency; only the purchasing agency has the right to procure. What is called the obligation? The so-called obligation is to guarantee that the people obtain the minimum required quantity of rationed goods and that the rationing is not delayed. Secondly, personnel issues are also very important, because the honesty, integrity, and efficiency of the staff are also necessary conditions for the success of the rationing system. The most important task of the central government or local government is how to fairly distribute the burden of administrative expenses so that taxpayers at all levels bear the responsibility of taxes equally. I participate in the work of the Consultative Committee, hoping that the committee will first solve at least three problems: food, education, and medicine. Integrity should not only be applied to politics, but also to all kinds of occupations, and should be faced by officials and the people. Only then can a clean government be realized. Officials and the people should be united, and the ultimate goal is to 'benefit the country and the people.' How can officials and the people be united? I think only by practicing the four words 'sincerity and frankness.'"

Speech by Mayor Chen

Finally, Mayor Chen Chaoli delivered a speech, briefly saying: "I am very grateful for this grand tea party held to welcome me today. What everyone is most concerned about now is the rice problem. Let's put this aside for a moment and talk about what the Municipal Government has done in recent years. My colleagues in the Municipal Government can be said to have 'more than enough heart but not enough strength' regarding Shanghai's municipal administration in the past, and I hope everyone present can understand this. Since the establishment of the Municipal Administration Consultative Committee, I feel that the responsibility is lighter. Now that we are gathered together, we can discuss things together. Everyone is not only in a consultative position, but also puts forward various suggestions at any time and personally runs around to make contacts. On the one hand, I feel relaxed, but on the other hand, I feel uneasy about handing over my responsibilities to everyone to share the burden.

In addition, when it comes to the rice problem, no problem in Shanghai is more serious than this. When I first came, I already felt it was serious. When I was in the Ministry of Industry in the 21st year of the Republic of China, I already felt it was serious. You can see it in the articles I published in the past. Although China is a country based on agriculture, it has a long history of insufficient food supply. According to research, the import of foreign rice began in the sixth year of the Tongzhi reign of the late Qing Dynasty, and it has been 70 or 80 years since then. According to the average statistics of the 25th and 26th years of the Republic of China, whether there was a bumper harvest or not, foreign rice was imported into our country, and even more was imported in years of bumper harvest. Experts were asked to study it, and the average annual import of foreign rice was about 16 million dan in five years, of which 80% was sold in South China and 20% was transported to the north. Shanghai accounted for 30% of the 16 million dan, which is 250,000 dan. The reason for this is perhaps the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Rebellion, which blocked inland transportation, so we had to seek supply from overseas, and then we ordered rice from Myanmar, Saigon, and other places. In general, merchants are greedy for convenience and order rice from overseas, which is more convenient than from the mainland, so the import of foreign rice has increased. The quality of rice in Hunan and other places is uneven, and there are no machines for milling like those used for foreign rice, which makes it easier to store. If the rice problem in China cannot be solved, it is simply impossible to establish the country. At that time, an agricultural experiment station was established in Beijing, and experts were hired to study and improve wheat varieties. Experiments in Kunshan showed that the yield per mu could be increased by 19%, but after the Incident, all efforts were wasted. After coming to Shanghai in the 29th year of the Republic of China, I knew it was even more serious. Currently, foreign rice cannot be imported. Not long ago, I said that if the rice problem in Shanghai cannot be solved, I cannot be the mayor for a day.

Now the rice problem has reached a critical juncture. Every time I go to Beijing, I contact all parties, hoping to improve the system for buying rice, and at the same time discuss plans to increase agricultural production. The matter of purchasing is under the control of the Rice Association, and the Municipal Government cannot make decisions. As for increasing production, it cannot be achieved by a single experiment station. Therefore, I often talk to various parties about how to strengthen agricultural experiment stations and contact the competent authorities in various provinces and cities and agricultural colleges, at least to restore the situation in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. This seems too slow and will definitely not produce results in one year, but "urgent treatment addresses the symptoms, slow treatment addresses the root cause." If we only talk about treating the symptoms without addressing the root cause, it will not work. If the root cause is not changed, the symptoms cannot be treated either. Therefore, we should actively find ways to improve, improve one county, then improve one county, and gradually promote it to achieve comprehensive production increase. I also know about the rice problem now, and I am very concerned about it. If the rice problem is solved, 80% of Shanghai's problems can be solved. I have just raised the rice problem from the perspective of the Municipal Government, hoping that everyone will pay attention to it and work hard to solve it, and the whole people of the Municipal Government and I will be very grateful."

### Rice Merchants Eagerly Apply for Passports to Purchase Rice; Price of Requisitioned Rice Being Approved

Since the authorities of this city announced the application and issuance procedures for passports for transporting rice into Shanghai, and before the various procedures related to these measures have been completed and announced, rice transported into the city from the surrounding areas of Shanghai, regardless of quantity, can be freely transported in without [taxation?]. Wuhu is the most popular procurement location, followed by Songjiang, Wujiang, Changzhou, Changshu, Wuxi, Fengjing, Kunshan, Jiaxing, Jiashan, and other places. The total number of characters has already exceeded 100,000 shi. It is reported that a large amount of rice is on its way and will arrive in Shanghai soon. It is expected that rice prices will continue to fall in the future. Regarding the discussion of the price of requisitioned rice, it is reported that the Rice Association has drafted it and is submitting it to the Executive Yuan for approval.

Grain Bureau Holds Public Rice Sale Meeting

After the restrictions on rice in this city were eased, the Municipal Grain Bureau, in order to increase the people's food supply, specially convened a meeting of the heads of the public rice sale liaison offices in various districts at the bureau's conference room yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to discuss the matter, ordering rice merchants in each district to quickly form rice procurement groups to carry out procurement matters separately. The meeting was chaired by Sun Dunmin, secretary director of the bureau, who instructed on the organization of the group.

Black Market Rice Prices Continue to Fall

The rice problem in this city has been addressed by the authorities taking necessary measures, specifically allowing temporary free transport of rice into the city without the need to apply for a license or tax collection, and without limiting the quantity. As a result, the source is unblocked, so people's hearts are calm. Black market rice prices have been falling steadily in recent days. Yesterday, the selling price on the market had already fallen below eight yuan. Rice vendors were selling in the streets and alleys, but few people were interested. The serious rice problem has gradually eased, and it can be expected to turn into a better situation in the future, and the citizens need not worry unnecessarily. However, the amount of rice stored by citizens is limited to three months; exceeding the limit will be considered hoarding.

Transportation Company Prioritizes Rice Transportation

Shanghai has a large population, and the people's food problem is more serious than in other places. Recently, rice prices have risen sharply again, which has greatly affected people's livelihoods. Chen, the Minister of Construction, in view of this, in order to urgently dredge the source of supply, has ordered the China Railway Company, the China Transportation Company, and the China Steamship Company, Shanghai Inland River Steamship Company, and other land and water transportation agencies that from now on, when the rice control committee notifies these companies to transport rice to Shanghai, the companies should suspend other cargo transport and prioritize rice transport to help the people's food supply. This measure will have a considerable effect in helping to suppress rice prices.

### Yangzi Company Donates a Motorboat

Kondo Yoshimi, representative of Yangzi Company at 10 North Suzhou Road, visited the Japanese Naval Attaché's Office at 3 PM on the 5th to donate a high-speed motorboat.

### Nanshi to Ration Coal Balls, Firewood, and Soap Starting Tomorrow

Regarding the third-term rationed household coal balls and matches and the second-term soap for the seventh district (Nanshi) of this city, it is reported that the Municipal Economic Bureau has set the period from the 7th to the 17th of this month as the sales period. Each person can purchase 10 catties of coal balls per ticket at a price of 1 yuan and 8 jiao per catty, a small box of matches at a price of 3 yuan, and a bar of soap. Each bar, including the separately sold donation, costs 34 yuan and 2 jiao for Cow Brand, 35 yuan and 6 jiao for Henry, and 36 yuan and 4 jiao for Guben, Central, and Nanyang, 34 yuan for Mingxing, and 35 yuan and 7 jiao for Arrow. (The soap rationed by the bureau this time is all newly produced by various factories. Due to the rising cost of raw materials, the retail prices are slightly different.) However, both soap and matches must be purchased at the same time; one cannot choose to buy only one. Residents of Nanshi must hold their certificates and purchase from designated retailers within the above-mentioned period; it will be invalid if they purchase after the deadline.

### Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Holds Sketching Event

In order to promote art, the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association of this city has specifically scheduled the first sketching event at 9:00 AM on June 11th at Hardoon Garden. All Chinese and Japanese painters or those interested in art can apply to participate from now on. If it rains on that day, the event will be postponed to the morning of the 18th of this month.

### Reportedly Nanshi Opium Dens to Close at End of Month

After the gambling dens in Nanshi were ordered to close, the atmosphere of opium has not yet been eradicated. Old opium dens line the streets, openly allowing people to smoke opium, and the harm is getting worse, seriously undermining the foundation of the country. It is now learned that these old opium dens will be closed separately at the end of this month. The Smoke Prohibition Bureau has now stopped issuing licenses for opium dens. At that time, the opium atmosphere in Nanshi will often be completely eradicated. At the same time, the police stations in Nanshi have been ordered to set up opium user registration offices to handle the issuance of opium user licenses in order to allow all opium users in the district to quit within a time limit.

### Fisheries Administration Implements Fish Protection

The Fisheries Administration of the Ministry of Industry is actively promoting the training of fishery police for fish protection work. It has established a preparatory office for the Fishery Police Training Institute on the Republic of China Road and decided to recruit 50 fishery police officers for short-term training, and purchased two 40-ton fish protection boats. Therefore, fish protection work will be implemented soon.

### Reader Aid to Education News

Since the start of the seventh session of our newspaper's reader aid to education fund on June 1st, we are deeply concerned that the existing funds are limited and the budget is severely inadequate. We are appealing to all parties to raise donations. Fortunately, people from all walks of life have enthusiastically supported us, generously donating money, and gradually accumulating enough to reach the expected goal. Regarding application procedures, schools at all levels have successively reported lists of poor and outstanding students. This office will review them one by one. Application forms are being printed urgently. From the 15th onwards, schools can send staff to the office to collect them and distribute them for filling out. However, in recent days, there have still been some students who do not understand the application procedures and come to the office to collect forms. We hope that students will report to their class teachers or principals and avoid making unnecessary trips.

Wu Jinchuan Diligently Saves to Aid Education

Mr. Wu is usually diligent, frugal, and prudent in saving to aid education. His letter is heartfelt and his enthusiasm is admirable, saying: "I am uneducated and have no way to deal with the world, but I only know how to be diligent, frugal, and prudent in order to make a living. Since the Incident, I have not dared to indulge in extravagance. By carefully managing my income and expenses, I am fortunately able to have enough to eat and wear with some surplus. Now I have gathered 20,000 yuan from my savings over the years and sent it to your newspaper office to be transferred to the education fund to help poor children go to school, fulfilling my long-cherished wish."

Meiya Silk Mill Appropriates Savings to Aid Education

Meiya Silk Mill will hold a shareholders' meeting. The board of directors has decided in advance not to provide refreshments, but to transfer the money to the aid to education funds of Shen Bao and Xin Shen Bao, saving expenses, which can be a model for the industrial and commercial sectors. The letter said: "Since your newspaper launched the aid to education fund, poor and outstanding students have continued their studies as usual, demonstrating the utmost intention of cultivating talents, which we deeply admire. Now, our board of directors has resolved to donate the refreshment expenses of the 10,000 yuan in national currency for the twelfth shareholders' meeting to be held on June 26th to your newspaper and Lihua News to express our support. A check for 5,000 yuan in national currency is attached. Please accept it and issue a receipt for the shareholders' meeting report."

Teachers Donate Salaries to Aid Education

Primary school teachers have heavy responsibilities and lead very difficult lives. Now, Mr. Ge Youren is willing to donate the subsidy he received to the aid to education fund, which is very commendable. The letter said: "Since your newspaper launched the aid to education fund, it has cultivated a large number of poor children, which is truly a great merit. I am now donating all of the 1,200 yuan in subsidies I received as a teacher to the aid to education fund to do my part."

### Various Banks and Firms Prepare to Conduct Half-Yearly Financial Statements; Business for the First Half of the Year Was Average

The business financial statements of various banks and firms in this city are usually done twice a year, at the end of June and the end of December. It is now learned that the preparation for the business financial statements for the first half of this year will begin within the next week, and the interest settlement for the commercial and savings departments will be handled on the 20th and 25th of this month, respectively. The half-yearly business financial statements will be settled at the end of June, and the company will take a holiday on the 1st and 2nd of July as usual, and continue to open to the public on the 3rd. It is now learned that the business for the first half of this year has been very average. The number of loans is mostly investment in agricultural, industrial, and commercial loans, and the number of other non-essential loans has been greatly reduced by the Central Bank of China.

### Allied Powers' Shanghai Embassy Held Regular Meeting Yesterday

The Shanghai office of the Allied Powers' Japanese Embassy held its routine press conference at the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, at 2 PM yesterday (the 5th). The head of the intelligence department, Matsudaira, was unable to attend due to official business and was represented by the Deputy Consul Fukuma. More than ten reporters from various newspapers attended the meeting, and Mr. Fukuma spoke in detail about current affairs. The meeting ended at 4:30 PM.

### Enthusiastic Participation in Health Campaign

Visitors to the Shanghai YMCA's health campaign in recent days have been very enthusiastic. The focus of this campaign is on 15 health standards and 24 health rules, making it easy for everyone to implement, starting with individual physical health and extending to mental and spiritual health. Publications are also issued, and all participants can receive a copy for reference. This association will have Dr. Hou Xiangchuan give a film lecture on sports and health at 5:00 PM today, followed by a screening of Volume 2 of the World Sports Games and the application of X-rays in active films. Anyone can visit without purchasing tickets. Physical examinations are also available from 5:30 PM every day, conducted by specialized doctors, and the examination fees are very low.

### Reissuance of Residence Permits to Be Completed This Month

The Baojia sections of the police sub-bureaus in District 1 (excluding the old District 8) have been reissuing residence permits since June 1st of last month. It has been more than a month now. During this period, the authorities of each section arranged dates and ordered citizens to apply for them in order. The work has been progressing quite smoothly. However, because the number of residents is too large, it has not been completely completed so far. It is learned that the reissuance can be completed in full within this month, no matter what. At that time, the authorities will announce the date on which the old citizen certificates will be invalidated.

### Film Inspection Committee Holds Record Inspection

The Film Inspection Committee of the Propaganda Department, under orders, has begun implementing record inspections. All Chinese and foreign records must be submitted to the committee for inspection and approval and issued a license before they can be released. Before the implementation of record inspection, all kinds of records that have been issued must also be applied to the association for supplementary inspection, with a three-month deadline for completion.

### French Concession Tramway Plans Improvement Measures

Since the French Concession Tramway Company of this city implemented its driving time measures last winter, in general, the ticket sellers and drivers, restricted by the company's regulations, often do not stop at stations or stop only briefly before starting again, and even refuse passengers from getting off, resulting in repeated tragedies. This measure has already aroused deep concern in all walks of life. On April 7th of this year, Ms. Wang Feng from Shangyu was severely injured and lost both legs after being pushed off the bus, resulting in disability. The Shangyu and Shaoxing native associations organized a support association. In addition to requesting the judicial authorities to severely punish the perpetrators of the accident for the injuries caused to Wang Feng, in order to prevent similar tragedies from happening again in the future, they have submitted a proposal to the municipal government for approval, ordering the Transportation Improvement Committee to review the improvement plan and ordering the company to abolish the driving time restriction measures and improve them in order to maintain traffic safety.

### "Sufficient Food" First

— Huang Xiao Zhou

"The people are the foundation of the nation, and food is the people's heaven." If the people's food problem is not resolved for even a day, the people's livelihood will not be stable for a day, and the impact on the foundation of the nation will be extremely significant. Recently, Shanghai citizens have repeatedly experienced delays in the distribution of household rice rations, forcing them to rely on the black market for daily food. The black market rice supply has also been unstable, leading to unprecedented price surges, causing great concern. The authorities recently promulgated the "Temporary Measures Outline for Grain Supply to the People of Beijing and Shanghai," easing restrictions and providing supplies in a flexible manner, in order to suppress the price of black market rice in Shanghai. However, whether the household rice ration distribution system can be improved in the future is what the citizens hope for day and night.

The promulgation of the "Temporary Measures Outline for Grain Supply to the People of Beijing and Shanghai" was originally intended to ease restrictions in order to balance rice prices in various regions and eliminate uneven regional distribution. If there are no special forces interfering with the results of such free buying and selling, it would be a good expedient measure. However, the current effect of this new measure is limited to enriching the supply and slightly lowering the price of black market rice, while citizens still have to rely on the black market as before. Moreover, now that the transportation and sale of rice are free, it is reasonable to expect that the selling price should not be too different from the purchase cost in the place of origin. However, excessive taxation and levies during transportation are unavoidable, and the burden will still fall on the citizens. As for whether profiteering by unscrupulous merchants and hoarding by wealthy households can be absolutely prevented, this is the most important issue. Otherwise, even if transportation and sales are free and the supply is smooth, if the price of rice remains firm or even increases, what benefit will it bring to the poor?

The current new measures for the people's food are still in their initial stages of implementation, and it is difficult to predict what the achievements will be. However, it is an undeniable fact that citizens still rely on the black market to supplement their household rice rations, and the black market price fluctuates from time to time due to various artificial reasons, making talk of stabilizing people's livelihood just empty words. What people hope for from the government authorities now is nothing more than to effectively improve procurement agencies, improve the distribution system, and ensure that the household rations are sufficient to "make a living" and eliminate the black market. Indeed, the means of assistance should be adapted to the time and place, but the ultimate goal is to achieve "sufficient food" (sufficient food from household rice rations).

However, judging from the authorities' intentions, the implementation of this new measure is nothing more than to 1) balance rice prices in various regions—so that there is no worry about "unevenness," and 2) increase rice prices in the producing areas, encouraging farmers to work hard in rice production—so that there is no worry about "scarcity." Therefore, we earnestly hope that after completing "evenness without scarcity," the authorities will be able to establish a sound distribution system and provide sufficient household rice rations, which would be a great blessing for the common people and a great blessing for the nation.

### Letter to My Sister (8)

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

(Ah, I want to draw!)

In Takao's heart, there was an unexpected desire to draw. The feel of the canvas's elasticity that one feels while sketching, the smell of painting materials like palettes, these things are infinitely alluring to him.

(If I don't draw that, what am I going to draw? Such beautiful things!)

He somewhat regretted not bringing his art supplies box.

Facing the sea where the ship's shadow had already faded, he could only wield his imaginary brush endlessly, doing as he pleased and engaging in painting. Paintings without outlines appeared one after another on the green waves.

When the excitement calmed down a bit, he was surprised himself.

(What exactly is going on? I intended to abandon the brush and come to this place, but now that I'm here, I want to draw again. What exactly is going on?)

He was reminded of the kind of letter he wanted to write to his sister last night. Having hated painting so much, he had suddenly experienced, within just thirty minutes, such a drastic, unprecedented, and intense desire to paint, which really surprised him.

(Don't rush. Perhaps it's not necessary for me to throw away the brush, and I'm willing to paint again. Isn't it because I've seen beauty that cannot be painted?)

He suddenly felt that a dead end had opened up, and everything had become clear.

A painter who doesn't feel the beauty of an apple, no matter how he looks at it, is perhaps not a true painter. However, what does this mean? A painter who only paints warships is perhaps a naive and low-level painter, an artist who caters to children. But, isn't that also good? Even if he can't bear the name of a painter, even if he can't enter the ranks of artists, as long as he paints what he feels is beautiful, he can be worthy of heaven.——

### The Importance of Hygiene and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases

— Gu Nan Qun

Today is the fifth day of the health campaign. Several gentlemen have already spoken about the necessity of hygiene and common hygiene knowledge. I, Nan Qun, have been running a hospital in Shanghai for twenty-seven years and am someone who actually serves the public health cause, so I would like to add a few practical words that apply to everyone.

Now that rice prices are so high and the prices of all goods are so great, and the prices of medicine are also rising along with commodity prices, middle-class families really cannot afford to get sick anymore. People on salaries find it difficult to maintain their normal lives, and when they get sick, it is truly impossible to solve. But illnesses arise whether one can afford them or not, so what should be done? The only thing to do is to prevent them from arising. Emphasize hygiene on a daily basis and study various preventive measures. Therefore, the higher the standard of living, the more we must focus on our bodies, because health is wealth.

The above words are intended to calculate the economic benefits for individuals or families. When it comes to careers, when it comes to the nation and the people, hygiene is even more worthy of attention. A person who emphasizes hygiene and has abundant energy can serve society until the age of seventy or eighty. A person who neglects hygiene will have weakened energy, and by the age of fifty or more, his spirit will be lacking and he will need to retire.

This is based on the general situation without special diseases. One must know that there are countless people who die young due to neglecting hygiene. According to statistics on the lifespan of people in countries with developed hygiene, they are indeed different from the masses. For example, the average lifespan of people in New Zealand can reach sixty-seven years, while the average lifespan of people in Europe and Russia is only forty-six or forty-seven years. This is not because a certain ethnic group has a particularly long or particularly short lifespan, but because of the emphasis on hygiene and the lack of emphasis on hygiene. Parents should have sound bodies, and children should live under hygienic conditions from infancy to childhood to adulthood to middle age to old age, and their lifespan will naturally be long.

Generally speaking, infectious diseases account for the majority of illnesses. Speaking of the sources of infectious diseases, of course, it is the work of microorganisms. According to research by bacteriologists, if a bacterium continues to grow for twenty-four hours in a suitable environment, it can reproduce to a line long enough to encircle the earth three times. It can be seen how formidable bacterial reproduction is. In this way, the horror of bacterial infection, if not prevented, will endanger human health, which is unbearable to contemplate.

The number of human deaths due to infectious diseases is actually more than deaths from other causes, especially in China's mortality rate, which accounts for almost two-thirds. According to the records of internal medicine patients in our Nanyang Hospital, among one hundred and forty consecutive patients, one hundred and eleven were infectious diseases, which proves that infectious diseases are too numerous and too terrible.

Although infectious diseases originate from microorganisms, some are acute and some are chronic. Speaking of Shanghai, it is a large metropolis in East Asia where people from all directions gather and travel frequently, and any bacteria can be brought in by attaching to people and objects. Now, let me briefly mention a few infectious diseases. In cold weather, there are measles, whooping cough, diphtheria, pneumonia, smallpox, meningitis, etc. In spring, there are typhus, relapsing fever, etc. In hot weather, there are gastrointestinal infections, typhoid fever, dysentery, cholera, etc. As for tuberculosis, syphilis, gonorrhea, the transmission power is also quite strong, but they do not distinguish seasons and exist all year round. Some infectious diseases are particularly easy to contract in children, so parents are more

As for prevention methods, countries with developed hygiene attach great importance to them. As a result, infectious diseases are relatively rare. Even medical schools find it difficult to find an infectious patient for teaching purposes. Looking at the people of the East and West who have developed hygiene, smallpox transmission is rare, so people with pockmarked faces are not commonly seen. On the contrary, in our country, they can be seen everywhere. From this point of view, we can prove the greatness of the preventive effect. The people of our country mostly ignore the prevention of infectious diseases. In recent years, the health authorities have actively planted smallpox vaccines and injected preventive vaccines, but the people regard it as a difficult road and are unwilling to accept it. They are unwilling to endure minor pain to obtain the safety of life, which is too careless about hygiene. From now on, from today on, I, Nan Qun, sincerely hope that all our fellow citizens in the city will work together to promote and pay attention to all daily hygiene activities, so that the people of our Republic of China can keep pace with the healthiest people in the world.
