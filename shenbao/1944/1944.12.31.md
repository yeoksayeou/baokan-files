### 日任命蜂谷氏　爲駐印公使

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of India previously took the opportunity of visiting Japan to decide with the Japanese government to mutually dispatch diplomatic representatives, in order to enhance the cooperative relationship between the two countries, to complete the Greater East Asia War and to achieve Indian independence. Subsequently, Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu carefully weighed the candidates, and as a result, decided to appoint Teruo Hachiya, the Foreign Affairs Department Chief of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office and Investigation Officer of the Foreign Ministry, as the first minister. Therefore, the Japanese and Indian governments have established formal diplomatic relations, which is of great significance for India's independence movement. Consequently, both countries should further strengthen the war, strive to defeat the common enemies of Britain and the United States, and seek the liberation of India. After the Japanese government assisted in the formation of the Provisional Government of Free India on October 21st of last year, it immediately recognized it and declared that it would return the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to the Provisional Government of Free India. Afterwards, it further strengthened the Indian National Army, assisting the Japanese army in fighting fiercely in various border areas of India and Burma, demonstrating considerable achievements. On the one hand, it also gradually mobilized and gathered three million Indians in various parts of East Asia. The foundation of the provisional government, whether politically or militarily, has also developed to a considerable stage. Therefore, the appointment of Minister Hachiya is a clear sign of the Japanese government's strengthening of support for achieving Indian independence. The relationship between the two countries is becoming increasingly close, so its significance is truly significant.

Editorial

### 歲暮反省

The end of the 33rd year of the Republic of China is today.

Another year is about to pass. What have we actually done this year?

The late Chairman Wang, in his New Year's Day address this year, instructed us that this year should be devoted to the three major tasks of "purifying thought," "ensuring security," and "increasing production" for further efforts. How have we actually strived? What achievements have we made? Or is it worse than before?

Acting Chairman Chen, in his New Year's Day address to the citizens of Shanghai, pointed out that Shanghai has one abnormal thing and one contradictory thing. The abnormal thing is that the normal income of the general public is not enough to make a living, leading to shaky discipline and social unrest. The contradictory thing is that production should increase, but it decreases due to a lack of fuel, and hoarding raw materials for profit makes people lazy to produce, so the front cannot receive sufficient supplies, and the rear cannot have a proper life. These situations are actually not unique to Shanghai; many places are similar. Have we overcome these abnormal and contradictory things this year? How much have we overcome? Or is the degree deeper?

The New Year's editorial of this newspaper also put forward three hopes for this year: first, "hope for political clarity," second, "hope for relieving the suffering of the people," and third, "hope for fulfilling the task of participating in the war." How many of our hopes have been realized in a year? Or is the disappointment even greater?

The "purifying thought" that the late Chairman Wang instructed and the "political clarity" that we hope for are inseparable. Only by "purifying thought" can we make "political clarity," and only clear politics can purify thought. The late Chairman Wang also instructed us on "purifying thought": "All things that can hinder the uplift of the will to fight the decisive battle and discourage the revitalization of the national spirit must be eradicated and cleared away," such as "corruption and selling of office, which are malignant bacteria that corrode politics; hoarding and speculation, which are pests that poison people's lives; extortion and blackmail, which are the root of disorder in society; and decadence and debauchery, which are toxins that weaken the race." Corruption and selling of office are malignant bacteria that corrode politics. Sadly, corruption and selling of office cases this year, from the Hou Hu Gu Zhou major corruption case, the Shanghai special tax major fraud case, and the rice administration committee staff fraud case, have emerged one after another. How can politics be clear? Hoarding and speculation and extortion and blackmail, in fact, large-scale hoarding and speculation this year, manipulating materials, and inciting price increases have become more rampant than last year, and many have special forces as their background; non-political power or gun barrels as backing for extortion and blackmail incidents are even more rampant everywhere this year. Not to mention the most common ones, you will inevitably suffer or witness these kinds of events if you go out, at the docks, at the stations, in vehicles, and even on the road. If you are carrying anything, then you have even more chances of being blackmailed. In such a smoky atmosphere, it is inevitable that the decadent and debauched life, which is enough to weaken the race, will become more and more out of shape.

Since thought cannot be purified in this way, and political discipline and social atmosphere have become so corrupt, and even getting worse, how can we still complete "ensuring security" and "increasing production"? And how can we still realize our hoped-for "relieving the suffering of the people" and "fulfilling the task of participating in the war"?

Now, not only have bandits not been eradicated in various places, but there are also reports everywhere of extortion and blackmail incidents with political backgrounds and gun barrels as backing, making it even more difficult to ensure security and making it impossible for people to live and work in peace. Also, we are a country participating in the war. Currently, even the rear security in many places still needs to be maintained by allied forces, which is really too shameful.

Regarding production, due to the fact that political discipline has not yet been sound and security has not been ensured, various economic policies and control measures have not been properly implemented; material procurement countermeasures and supporting measures have also not been able to be made reasonable, which has naturally greatly affected production increases. This year's decline in various production industries has undoubtedly reached a very serious point.

Regarding the people's livelihood issue, the vast majority of our people are constantly affected by poor security, the blow of extortion and blackmail, and the devastation of high prices. Their lives have indeed become so difficult that they cannot be sustained. The abnormal phenomenon that Acting Chairman Chen said of "the normal income of the general public is not enough to make a living" has now almost become the most common thing. The so-called "people have no means of living" is probably no more tragic than it is now. With the people on their last breath, how can we still talk about fulfilling the task of participating in the war?

We must make a thorough reflection on all of the above at the end of the year today. From tomorrow onwards, both the government and the people must work hard to change. If we continue to make empty promises and act perfunctorily, then the future will be unimaginable.

### 抑平物價與執行法規

— Meng Zhou

To suppress and stabilize prices, it is necessary to manage materials. This is a common cry of those with knowledge. However, in order to suppress and stabilize prices and manage materials, it is first necessary to stipulate complete, proper, practical, and easy-to-implement management methods, and then it can be implemented earnestly based on the methods. For example, land transportation must first open up roads, and then it can follow the roads and move forward without going astray. Now, regarding the management methods of prices and materials, although various laws and regulations have been formulated, they are still rough and have many omissions. For example, when registering inventory, it should also clearly define detailed methods such as how to store, how to distribute, and how to price, so that the competent authorities can have a basis for implementation. If detailed methods are not defined in advance, and measures are taken to deal with the problems when they arise, then arbitrary measures will inevitably be taken and many malpractices will occur. Therefore, incomplete methods are like having no road. In places where there is no road, driving vehicles will inevitably overturn. Also, regarding prices and materials, even if detailed methods have been set, if the methods are not proper and difficult to implement, then these methods are like rugged, uneven, and blocked roads. Vehicles will definitely not be able to drive on the road, and the result will inevitably be abandoned and unused. As a result of this situation, the established methods will become a mere formality. Therefore, in order to achieve the purpose of managing materials and suppressing prices, the first step should be to stipulate complete, proper, practical, and easy-to-implement management methods.

Having complete, proper, practical, and easy-to-implement management methods, but not having a competent agency with centralized power and unified functions to implement them, these methods will not be effective. The agency is like a vehicle. If the vehicle is decayed and unsuitable for practical use, then even if the road is flat and can be reached directly, it will not be possible to drive. Now, regarding the management of prices and materials, the various public groups, government offices, and military camps in the local area often compete with each other and shirk responsibilities to each other. This is all because the group authority of various agencies has not been stipulated in detail. If it is possible to clearly define that price management is the sole responsibility of agency A, that rationing is the sole responsibility of agency B, and that the suppression of hoarding is the full responsibility of agency C, then between each other, the authority is clearly defined, and the responsibilities are clear, so the malpractices of competing and shirking responsibilities can naturally be eliminated. Also, military and police agencies have no competent authority for prices and materials in name, but in practice, because the military and police have real power and indeed have the necessary military needs and security, they cannot avoid excessive assistance in matters related to prices and materials. Therefore, events where names and realities do not match often occur. If the government cannot make the competent agency have the strength to implement, and at the same time, it is difficult to limit the participation of the military and police, then it may as well take into account the facts and clearly stipulate that a certain area and a certain period are limited, and the military and police are responsible for the competent authority over a certain matter, so that the power and responsibility are clearly defined, the name and reality are unified, and the merits and demerits will not be unaccountable. Therefore, the second step in suppressing prices and managing materials should be to establish a competent agency with centralized power and unified names and realities.

Regarding the management methods of prices and materials, to make them complete, proper, practical, and easy to implement, regarding the organizational authority of the competent agency, to make it have centralized power and unified names and realities, these are all matters that should be stipulated by laws and regulations. Therefore, the formulation of good laws and regulations is most important for suppressing prices and managing materials. However, with good laws and regulations, there must also be personnel who are devoted to their duties and abide by the law to assume the implementation, so that the duties of the laws and regulations can achieve their purpose. It is the same as having someone drive after the road is completed and the vehicle is equipped. However, as long as the personnel who assume the duty of implementing the laws and regulations can be devoted to their duties and abide by the law, they can also be competent, and it is not necessary for them to be geniuses with extraordinary abilities. Those who claim to be geniuses with extraordinary abilities often do not want to adhere to the scope and instead destroy the laws and regulations. In fact, if a certain law or regulation is difficult to implement, you can ask to modify it, but before it is changed, you must strictly abide by it and not allow contempt. If a certain law or regulation is not yet complete, you can also interpret the law and then formulate methods and ask the superior to approve it as a precedent for reference. You are not allowed to arbitrarily assert your own opinions and hastily change the precedent. In short, destroying laws and regulations and arbitrarily changing precedents are all convenient for malpractice and become a source of corruption. Therefore, the third step in suppressing prices and managing materials should be to select personnel who are devoted to their duties and abide by the law and make them assume the duties of implementation.

The above three steps are equally important. Chinese people have always advocated rule by man and do not talk about the rule of law. They do not pay attention to the formulation of laws and regulations. After the laws and regulations are formulated, they are regarded as their writing and forgotten over time. In this situation, to put politics into a regular path is really going in the opposite direction. Therefore, strictly enforcing laws and regulations is the prerequisite problem for suppressing prices and must be paid attention to. As for the personnel who assume the duties of implementation, it is not an easy task to make them all devoted to their duties and abide by the law. If they are not thrifty and hardworking, they cannot be devoted to their duties. If they have not read the laws and regulations thoroughly, they will not know how to abide by the law. Therefore, government offices and public groups must select thrifty, hardworking, and well-read people to assume duties in order to eliminate malpractices and create a clean atmosphere. Like some people who are good at using people, the authorities prefer to regard flashy and active people as outstanding talents and do not favor thrifty, hardworking, and well-read people. As the trend goes, being devoted to their duties and abiding by the law is considered out of touch with the times and becomes extremely rare.

Written on December 29th, the 33rd year of the Republic of China, for the seventh day after the death of Chairman Wang, coinciding with the sixth anniversary of the Yan telegram

I wrote a Jinlvqu poem to mourn him, because Chairman Wang liked this tune, Wu Hufan

Urge me to support the sky, then boundless bleak travel, people worry, double illuminate tear marks still wet today, after experiencing wind and rain jealousy, hate only hate the treacherous spear secretly injected, a thought of heartache to save the raging waves, fighting to eliminate soldiers to relieve the calamity first, meritorious service in the country, fixed discussion. Open up ten thousand feelings and a thousand difficulties, a hero's courage, a bodhisattva's heart, when will the wounds all over the land be restored? Heaven does not leave Yuan Fu, regretting not seeing the full peace, one sleep buried in the ground, accompanying the heroic spirit under the setting sun Mei Hua Wu, prison reflection, filial mausoleum tree.

### 自由不獲保障　决不放下武器　戈林勗勉德軍民奮戰

Berlin, 30th (German News Agency telegram) - German News Agency: German Aviation Minister General Goering recently issued a New Year's message to the German people, urging them to fight hard and reiterating his belief in victory. He said, "We have overcome the difficulties of the past many years and have made the greatest sacrifices. Our honorable army has defeated the enemy on the borders of Greater Germany. We follow the Fuhrer's will, and everything is for the front line. New weapons have increased the burden on the enemy. If the Germans show weakness, then there are precedents for the countries that have stopped fighting. The enemy promises to give these countries freedom, but in reality, they give them civil war, turmoil, disaster, and famine. Therefore, the chaos in Europe today is unprecedented in history. If the enemy invades German soil, where will the Germans go? Therefore, our New Year's task is to avoid the enemy's invasion and at the same time invade enemy territory. The enemy has united to force us to fight. We will never lay down our weapons until we have obtained a guarantee of freedom. Although the coming year will certainly be difficult, we also know that the Germans will win under the leadership of Fuhrer Hitler. Our New Year's motto is that whether attacking or defending, we must fight with the spirit of the Germans."

### 比利時南部　展開空前大戰　德軍側翼受重大壓力

Berlin, 30th (Havas telegram) - Havas telegram: The battle in southern Belgium and Luxembourg has entered a new stage. The anti-Axis forces are increasing the pressure on the German flank, and the German army is also increasing reinforcements to prevent their advance. There is fierce fighting north and northwest of Laroche, and west of Stavelot. Eisenhower has apparently transferred most of the tank corps of the US Ninth Army to that location. It is currently difficult to predict whether the British troops under Montgomery will also be transferred to that location. Although the enemy's pressure is great, there is no significant change in the German flank. The American attack on the German vanguard west of Rochefort was repelled. The American troops that broke into Bastogne are now continuing to advance north. There is fierce fighting on the line east from south of Witz to the crossing point at Echternach, but the enemy has not made much progress.

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to reports, fierce fighting continues in southern Belgium and Luxembourg. The US military, out of its total of 44 divisions, has specially dispatched the 26th Division to the north, charging sideways on the flanks of the German vanguard troops, so that the German troops are isolated. Marshal Rundstedt has increased his forces near Menenwa to prepare for a second offensive.

The German-Hungarian allied forces are retreating westward, having crossed the Gran River without losses along the way. At present, the plain north of the Danube River is being fought over, and new developments are expected in the fighting there. In the coming days, western Hungary will be the focus of the war. Soviet forces in the Gran area are currently using heavy tanks, making slight breakthroughs on the Mi-Tao-Fonburg line, but they are quickly contained. The third major battle in the Mi-Tao area has likely passed its peak and is gradually weakening.

Several fires have broken out in the city, and the British Air Force has participated in the fighting.

### Soviets Forbid U.S. Air Force to Use Soviet Bases

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - New York News: U.S. journalist Pearson published an article in the "Daily Victory Report" on the 28th, explaining the Soviet Union's refusal to allow the U.S. military to use Soviet bases. The gist of it is as follows: The Soviet government has notified the U.S. government that it will henceforth prohibit U.S. military aircraft from landing on Soviet territory. Therefore, the U.S. Air Force's previous use of Soviet airfields to carry out bombings can no longer continue. Germany has moved some military supply factories to the occupied territories of Poland. If the U.S. military cannot use Soviet airfields to carry out bombings, the German military will be able to fully supply its counter-offensive operations in Belgium. The Soviet Union has long harbored a distrust of the capitalist world, and its renewed policy of prohibiting aircraft from anti-Axis countries from passing through Soviet territory is particularly puzzling. U.S. Army Air Forces Chief of Staff Eaker stated to a group of reporters on September 15th that the U.S. and Soviet governments had reached a consensus that bombing from Soviet bases would not continue due to extreme cold and other climatic reasons, and because the main bombing targets in the Balkan countries were occupied by the anti-Axis forces. This matter reveals a glimpse of discord among the anti-Axis nations.

### City Government Orders Finance Bureau to Cancel Miscellaneous Tree Firewood Tax, Has Replied to Municipal Advisory Committee

### Year-End Settlement for Banking and Money Industry, All Banks and Firms Pass the Year-End Smoothly, Three-Day Holiday Begins Tomorrow as Usual

### Household Rice Delivery Delayed, Allocation in Early January

This period's household ration rice has been announced for sale by the Goods Allocation Office, with each certificate allowing the purchase of 1.5 liters of rice at a price of 97.5 National currency. There are slight differences in quantity and price compared to the previous period, leading to many questions from the outside world. Director Feng You of the office expressed the following views:

The allocation of household rice in the old Food Bureau's jurisdiction ended on the 29th of this month. The office has announced the start of allocation from the 30th. The reason why the quantity of household rice for the old 18th and 2nd districts in this period has been reduced from two liters to 1.5 liters is because the purchasing agencies have recently acquired miscellaneous grains for supplementary allocation in order to encourage wartime living. Therefore, relevant parties have agreed to reduce the rice allocation by half a liter this period and additionally allocate one catty of miscellaneous grains (beans), which is equivalent to more than half a liter of rice. Therefore, in fact, the allocation quantity is still maintained at two liters. Although the announcement of the allocation of one catty of miscellaneous grains was not issued at the same time as the rice allocation announcement due to delivery issues, the allocation will be implemented in early January. In short, the reason for reducing the allocation by half a liter this period is to supplement it with miscellaneous grains, and it is not a permanent change to 1.5 liters. If there is no need to supplement miscellaneous grains next time, the allocation of two liters will be restored. As for the price of rice allocation this time, it has also been slightly increased, with each liter selling for 65 yuan. The reason for this is that the procurement and transportation costs of the procurement agencies in other places have increased due to the impact of other commodity prices. Therefore, the allocation price of this office has also had to be slightly increased. In short, this office is well aware that citizens are currently suffering greatly from the soaring black market price of rice. This office will do its best to maintain the current price of 65 yuan per liter, that is, 6,500 yuan per picul, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods. The city government is also trying to raise funds to continue borrowing or allocate funds from the reorganization of tax revenues for subsidies, so that the allocation price can be continued to maintain, so that the general public can obtain affordable food.

Reader's Aid to Education News

### Feelings on the Nurses' Enthusiastic Aid to Education, Hoping that the Whole Society Will Mobilize Fundraising

The letter from the Hong En Hospital nurses' team, which was published in yesterday's newspaper, must have resonated with readers. The nursing profession is still in its infancy in China, while it has long been recognized as the most sacred free profession for women in various countries around the world. Regardless of which woman has received considerable training at school and serves society or becomes a housewife after graduation, she must have rich nursing knowledge. As for those who specialize in nursing, they serve patients all day long, without fear of hard work or hardship. Patients on groaning beds then feel "having illness makes you know how healthy you were". In addition to doctors being their saviors, nurses are their good companions. Therefore, every move and every word of the nurse is most noticed by the patient, and "heroes are most afraid of the devil of disease". Anyone who gets sick is particularly compassionate and particularly enthusiastic. If the nurse takes this opportunity to persuade with the "Aid to Education Movement", the effect will be very great. In addition to thanking the nurses of "Hong En", this newspaper also hopes that the nurses of major hospitals in Shanghai will respond in unison and take the lead in using "Aid to Education" as the only thorough way to save the country and the people, and persuade patients to donate. The thousands of poor and out-of-school children in Shanghai will be grateful and moved to tears, without a doubt.

In recent days, all sectors of Shanghai society have enthusiastically supported the aid to education movement, and the achievements of "special fundraising" are improving day by day, which makes us extremely excited. Since all sectors of society have responded in unison and resonated, we feel that there is still hope for people's hearts, there is still hope for public welfare undertakings, and further: the future of the country is promising! We hope that like-minded readers will join hands and work together to advance towards the goal of the aid to education movement!

The China Advertising Company's aid to education team, the anonymous team, and the oil and grain team, the Lianrangtang Children's Team, and the Tongli Team all donated one after another, expressing their thanks.

### Forty Days Adrift at Sea

Amidst the fierce battles of the Mariana Islands, four brave warriors – Petty Officer First Class Sesaki of the Navy, Seaman Tatsuwo Kanakawa, Crewman Masao Tani, and Kokufu Sakoda – escaped from Omiya Island. After drifting at sea for forty days and navigating over a thousand miles, they finally returned safely. These four men belonged to the Meteorological Unit and were crew members of the Asahi Maru (240 tons). They had no direct affiliation with the Omiya Island garrison but happened to pass by the island when the enemy attacked, thus becoming embroiled in the conflict. Later, under orders from their superior officer, they escaped the island, broke through the encirclement of enemy warships and aircraft, and miraculously survived after enduring numerous hardships. The following is a summary of their ordeal as recounted by Sesaki and Kanakawa:

Discovery of Enemy Warships

Petty Officer First Class Hinzaki and his comrades were aboard the Second Asahi Maru, which was ordered to return to the mainland via Omiya Island for hull repairs. This occurred in early June. On the eleventh of the same month, while sailing near Omiya Island, they observed twenty friendly aircraft urgently flying towards Saipan, sensing that something was amiss. That night, they spotted flares from enemy warships, indicating a chaotic situation at sea, and they became certain of an enemy task force attack.

The next day (June 12), before dawn, they anchored two nautical miles off the coast of Showa Street on Omiya Island, as planned. At that moment, enemy carrier-based aircraft were conducting an aerial assault. The dim sky was filled with enemy planes, and ships in the harbor and ground troops fiercely resisted them. Soon, the Asahi Maru was strafed by three Grumman fighter planes. They immediately fought back but were forced to go ashore due to a fire. After landing, they promptly proceeded to the headquarters to report the battle situation and movements. To prepare for a potential enemy landing on Omiya Island, a landing force was immediately formed. Petty Officer First Class Sesaki was assigned to a unit commanded by a certain Lieutenant, with Sesaki serving as the unit leader.

From June 16, the enemy's bombing intensified, with each raid involving over two hundred aircraft and daily totals exceeding a thousand. Moreover, from that day on, enemy warships approached the island and began naval bombardment. At that time, among the modern American warships arrogantly sailing before their eyes, the third one (40,000 tons class) suddenly exploded, sending up a huge column of fire, and then sank. This was the result of a surprise attack by their submarine. Upon witnessing this, they couldn't help but shout "Banzai!" From this day until July 7, the enemy's naval and air attacks were incessant. The coastal defense positions were completely destroyed by concentrated naval gunfire, and the naval forces were forced to establish defenses along the Moga Mountain area. Petty Officer First Class Sesaki's unit retreated to the Hakoeya River.

Fighting Back Against the Enemy

By July 19, the enemy's attempts to land became more urgent, with aircraft carriers and battleships approaching the coast to launch a fierce assault. Through binoculars, they could see American artillerymen rolling up their sleeves, smoking cigarettes, and leisurely firing their guns, which infuriated them.

Soon, the enemy used fifty amphibious tanks as the vanguard and landed about 50,000 soldiers in the Showa Street area. The army and navy garrison forces immediately fought back, inflicting 15,000 casualties on the enemy. However, their losses were also significant, forcing them to retreat to a new defensive line in Orita Village. At this time, the enemy dispatched follow-up troops to invade Hokuto Cape.

From then until July 22, the battle situation can be summarized as follows: the enemy's firepower was superior, and despite the bravery of their garrison forces, they could not reverse the situation and had to gradually retreat. Finally, the time for a general offensive arrived. By August 7, their forces were isolated by enemy tank units, but the morale of the entire army was further heightened, vowing to fight to the end.

Sesaki First Class Petty Officer's company, in order to carry out its mission, broke through the enemy encirclement and moved towards Shirahama beach. The squads dispersed, carrying transmitters and receivers, and infiltrated the thick forest. From that time onwards, the islanders' espionage activities became rampant, and their movements were often reported to the enemy. Enemy aircraft frequently cut off their engines and glided over the forest, communicating with ships at sea and continuously carrying out concentrated artillery fire and bombing. Enemy tanks roamed freely, using flame throwers to set the forest on fire, and densely strung electric wires on the roads. Anyone who accidentally touched them would be subjected to a concentrated attack. Petty Officer First Class Sesaki and others overcame these obstacles and continued to advance. On the dawn of August 9, they discovered an enemy tank on the road. They crept up to it stealthily, and the American soldiers were still fast asleep inside. They immediately used several hand grenades to destroy it and then continued to advance towards Shirahama Village. Unexpectedly, the enemy had also reached the village, forcing them to slip into a cave on the coast to await their opportunity. They gathered and counted the number of personnel: a total of twenty-four, including the company commander. The unit leader was already dead.

On August 15, the company commander, realizing that the battle on the island was very serious, decided to recruit a suicide squad to send liaison officers to the mainland. Petty Officer First Class Sesaki and three others immediately volunteered, willing to face death to complete this task. After searching, they finally found two Type 95 folding river-crossing boats in the jungle. They immediately repaired one of them, built oars, erected a mast, and loaded it with three bushels of unpolished rice, one hundred coconuts, a drum of rainwater, and some dry bread. The boat was made of 1.5mm thick plywood, fifteen feet long and five feet wide.

On the night of August 20, Sesaki and his comrades received the following orders:

"By this order, Petty Officer First Class Zhaqi and other four persons are to take off from the Omiya Island by a ferry craft from Shirahama coast on August 20. May you have a long-lasting martial luck. Commander of the landing force of the 000th unit, Navy Second Lieutenant So and So."

Escape in the Dark of Night

Earlier, on the night of the 19th, the enemy task force near Lotai seemed to be moving, and enemy surveillance at sea was very strict. Therefore, Sesaki's departure had to be delayed by one day, and he finally had a chance to leave the island at 7:00 p.m. on the 21st. Under the strict surveillance of the enemy's sea and land forces, the four quietly left the island, but they were immediately discovered by an enemy patrol boat and subjected to gunfire. Fortunately, they skillfully used the darkness to escape the danger. However, the shoulders and abdomen of crewmen Tani and Sakoda were finally hit. Due to the enemy's strict surveillance, the small boat lingered between Lotai and Omiya Island for three days. On the fourth day, the wounded recovered some strength and finally managed to slip past the警戒Line. Relying on a watch-style compass, a nautical chart torn from the naval diary, and the stars in the sky, they sailed at sea for thirteen days. During this period, enemy aircraft frequently flew by, and the island of Omiya Hall remained visible in the distance. At night, they vaguely saw the lights flashing from what seemed to be the Akashi Street airfield, and the thought that the enemy was rushing to repair the airfield filled their hearts with indescribable anger.

On September 6, they finally lost sight of Omiya Island. Later, fresh water gradually became scarce. On September 21, they finally spotted the silhouette of birds, guessing that they had reached the vicinity of Taiwan or the Ryukyu Islands. Unexpectedly, a storm suddenly arose on the 23rd, and the small boat was swept away by a gale with a speed of thirty meters per second, drifting uncontrollably for three days and three nights. The weather finally cleared on the morning of the fourth day. At this time, a considerable amount of fresh water had accumulated in the bucket, their spirits had recovered, and they knew that the small boat had caught the expected Kuroshio Current. On the morning of the fifth day, they raised the sail again and took a northwesterly course. The small boat sped along with the wind, white foam forming in its wake, and schools of sardines chased after the boat. Just as they were worrying about running out of food, they saw these fish, and they looked at each other with great joy. They immediately made a net out of gauze and caught forty or fifty of them, swallowing them alive.

Friendly Aircraft Come to Help

After sailing at sea for another week, they spotted seven friendly aircraft, having only seen enemy aircraft in the past. Therefore, everyone was very excited. Chief Seaman Kanakawa was a signalman. He immediately sent out a distress signal. However, the friendly aircraft had other important missions and did not rescue them. One plane dropped a bag of food and then flew away hastily. However, having encountered friendly aircraft, they felt much more courageous. Moreover, they saw seaweed and wood chips floating by, and everyone was excited that they were approaching land.

On the morning of September 30, they discovered three islands. At noon, they reached the islands and were rescued by Chinese fishermen. It turned out to be an island near the Zhoushan Islands off the coast of Shanghai. Before reaching the islands, they had been without food for two weeks, drinking only seawater three times a day. After resting on the islands for three days, they made contact with the naval garrison. On October 9, they arrived in Shanghai, returned to their local unit, and reported everything.

### Candy

— Hou Qianli

The junior high classroom of Lianhua Girls' Primary School was in an uproar.

It was exam day, and they were testing geometry.

But it didn't look like the ten minutes before an exam at all.

As soon as Huang Mingfen entered the classroom in the morning, she told everyone in a loud voice: yesterday she saw Mr. He at Zhaofeng Park, with another person.

"Who?" everyone asked in unison, and anxiously.

"Guess!" the reporter deliberately kept them in suspense.

Of course, no one could guess. So Huang Mingfen shouted:

"It's Liu Shuzhen!"

Everyone knew Liu Shuzhen. She graduated this summer.

Many people didn't believe it, but Huang Mingfen swore that if she was wrong or spreading rumors, she wouldn't be human.

"Otherwise, ask He Guangsheng yourself later."

Class began, and Mr. He brought in the exam papers.

Everyone made some faces at each other, and finally Huang Mingfen said:

"Mr. He, we went to Zhaofeng Park yesterday, sat under the willow tree, and had a really happy chat!"

The classroom erupted in laughter.

Mr. He's face immediately turned red.

Mr. He often blushed. Mr. He was only twenty-three years old this year, and was still studying at the university, majoring in electrical engineering, and would graduate next year.

Before he could answer, everyone started shouting randomly.

"Was the chat really happy?"

"No wonder Liu Shuzhen hasn't been coming to the school to play much lately."

"..."

"..."

No one was thinking about the exam.

Suddenly someone shouted:

"Treat us to candy!"

"Candy! Candy! Treat us to candy!" Everyone was eating and laughing.

"Let's take the exam today first!" Mr. He finally said, "We'll talk about it tomorrow!"

Afraid that the teacher would renege, everyone repeated it again when they finished the exam:

"Don't forget to bring candy tomorrow!"

Mr. He didn't forget. He really brought it the next day, but it wasn't candy, it was candied dates, two for each person.

So the classroom was filled with a happy atmosphere.

Mr. He taught both geometry and chemistry.

Mr. He had a very calm mind. When proving geometric theorems and calculating chemical equations, he was really meticulous.

But this one thing, somehow, he got confused.

More than a month ago, he didn't even know how he suddenly sent that letter to Liu Shuzhen. He had even forgotten what he wrote in it. Thinking about it now, it seemed like a dream.

But others didn't take him for dreaming at all. A colleague met him at Liu Shuzhen's door, so he treated his colleagues to candy again. Several female teachers even congratulated him.

He was very satisfied with these things, and he was also very proud.

However, troubles finally came.

First, it was Liu Shuzhen who told him that her father knew about this matter, and seemed to have some complaints. Moreover, in between the lines, even her studies for the next semester were in question. The old-fashioned father defined it:

"There are no good male teachers in girls' schools."

Secondly, the principal of Lianhua asked him to have a talk. The principal told him that the matter between Mr. He and Liu Shuzhen had become a "public secret" among the students. Moreover, the principal himself had heard some public opinion from parents, which was very critical of the school. Especially in girls' schools, the school spirit was very important.

Finally, the principal, as an elder, advised him:

"So, I say, Mr. He, not that I'm trying to upset you, but it's best to be cautious about this kind of thing! It's not good for you. You're graduating from university next year, and you can't spend a lot of time on these things. Furthermore, it's not a good thing for the school either. Many parents know about it and are dissatisfied. If this continues, it will affect the increase in students!"

However, the students were very enthusiastic about this matter. Those girls kept asking the geometry teacher about the latest developments, stubbornly inquiring about some trivial little questions. For example, what Liu Shuzhen called him, what he wrote in the letter, what they talked about, whether they went to Zhaofeng Park every Sunday, and what would happen if they didn't go, etc.

The young teacher answered these questions in detail, even more detailed than he explained geometric theorems. For no reason, he just felt full of joy.

But finally, a parent wrote a letter to question the school authorities, asking very sternly whether the school could allow teachers to engage in such behavior? Had they thought about the impact on the students? Was a teacher allowed to do this?

The school authorities couldn't answer these questions.

So, the principal asked Mr. He to have a talk again.

Mr. He read the letter. He understood very clearly what he should do, and what the principal hoped he would do.

"I want to ask for a long leave," then he added, "I'm busy with my studies." As mentioned above, Mr. He would graduate from university next year.

"Okay, let's avoid the limelight first." The principal was very sympathetic.

Coming out of the principal's office, he was stopped by the junior high school students on the stairs. "We want candy too. Tong Xiujuan saw you at the entrance of the Great Light Gate yesterday... You must bring it tomorrow!"

Mr. He smiled at them. Was his face red?

### Describing Myself

— Yuan Xu

Once, I discovered myself, in front of the mirror—this is not to say that I have never looked in the mirror before, it was due to my negligence and self-claimed busyness. It was a foolish guy, looking at his nose with his eyes, and looking at his heart with his nose, wearing a cultured look.

Therefore, I was silent. For a person like this, it is too lazy to talk about sadness.

If life is really a road, then I have walked a little more than half of it; I don't know what will happen to the remaining half, because I don't have firm self-confidence, so I can't help but feel lost. In fact, people like this rarely have any extravagant hopes for the future, and have great repentance for the past.

My grandfather, even if he didn't have anything immortal or notorious during his lifetime, he did work hard and put his family on his shoulders. After that, my father had good handwriting, but he didn't go out to work hard for life. As for me, I can't even write well, let alone run a business. Logically speaking, this is bound to be a great sadness; fortunately, I am so foolish, numb, and cowardly, so I am too lazy to think about it and be sad. In this way, it is inevitable to sigh for the snail on the wall, enduring hardships, crawling silently, carrying the hard shell of memory, when can it unload the excessive burden on its back—you martyrs.

Indeed, snails are unfortunate. From this point of view, I seem very smart; however, this is the greatest sorrow. Therefore, even the most forgetful and sad people will be sad.

I pay attention to myself again: my eyes, ears, nose, and even my mouth don't look like people of this era at all; I used to run wild in the countryside, so it is inevitable that I have a little earthy air, or this is the reason for my stupidity. I am not like politicians, merchants, scholars, or celebrities, and naturally not a poet. "Then what are you?" you may ask. Well, why don't you ask the skin worm clinging to the Sanggan River what it is doing in its thin shell, and what it is waiting for?

What answer can you get?

None, because it is stupid.

Because of this, I am silent.

Some people say: stupidity is unforgivable, but can I forgive myself? —Please tell me.

### Review of the Second Issue of "Whirlwind"

— Chen Xin

In October, the inaugural issue of the comprehensive magazine "Whirlwind" appeared on the literary scene, bringing people a novel feeling. While this feeling was still in the minds of readers, the second issue of "Whirlwind" was published.

The second issue of "Whirlwind" is more focused on literary and artistic aspects in terms of content. The main body of the content consists of six novels, four essays, and four poems. In terms of serialization, in addition to Mao Yu's "Children's Affairs," Sun Lehong's "Night Hunting Record" has been added. The author still maintains that unique style, and every word and sentence holds the reader's heart. Although it is not finished yet, it makes people shudder and unable to breathe from the beginning.

What I want to particularly mention is Xu Yi's essay "Fishing." In terms of style, it is very close to Lu Fen's "Cousins of Meng Anqing." The author uses his lively brushstrokes to depict a familiar shadow for us. I have spoken elsewhere about other essays by the author, and I hope to read works like "Fishing" again.

The lively and vivid layout and the fresh and eye-catching solid blue cover are also very attractive. Compared to the price of two hundred yuan, it is not a loss. If there is anything else to ask for, it is to improve the content level and not let some insubstantial works waste paper. Also, let the admirers, in this year of expensive firewood and rice, be able to obtain something that can really enrich and satisfy their minds in addition to spending a sum of money.

### Kingdom of Poetry

— Gu Ge

No laurel wreath,

No cane,

No throne and palace,

Oppose restraint and privilege,

Despise all "poets" in golden robes,

Absolutely deny the kingdom of poetry!

We want to sing out cries,

We want to turn poems into

Human trumpets,

To issue strong love and hate

From humble blood and tears,

Turn sparks into prairie fire,

Tear down the kingdom of poetry!

### Tower

— Bai Wen

The tower is the sword of a traitor,

Its sharp point piercing straight at the heart of the sky.

Its entire body covered with exquisite holes,

Within the holes once flashed

The charming image of an ancient royal concubine.

One day, suddenly, because of a miraculous story,

The tower became feared and revered by people;

Now it is covered with vines and dreams;

No longer do adventurous teenagers dare to climb it.

It was a monarch of a distant dynasty,

To praise his own dignity and merits,

Who conscripted thousands upon thousands of laborers,

Using their blood and flesh to build the tower's foundation.

Or it was devout monks,

To commemorate the greatness of the Buddha.

Thus, in the name of heaven,

They solicited donations from pious men and women from all over the world:

The history of the past is gradually forgotten,

And the tower becomes a mystery.

Now it stands isolated on a mountain peak,

Merely for the mourning of later generations,

People only exclaim in admiration at its magnificence.

And dream of the legendary demon within the tower.

Time passes year after year,

Green vines wither and then turn verdant again,

Sometimes, exactly during the sunny and harmonious vernal equinox,

The area around the tower is filled with admiring visitors;

Sometimes, when a mountain fire starts below,

The tower sinks into incomparable loneliness,

Although it harbors an incomprehensible sorrow,

It remains silent,

With a wait.

One evening, an old man came,

(I have heard the elders of this tower say)

He is a villager who has been wandering abroad for many years,

Now, he has returned in decline,

Bringing with him a body full of fatigue,

He gropes his way close to the tower.

Wanting to use his dim old eyes,

To find the scars of his youth;

He murmurs his sorrows,

And the silent tower also begins to groan.

Thus, in a deep,

Deep midnight,

The tower emits a mutual roar,

Ending its life together with him.

### Shen Bao Cup Basketball League's Completion of Merit and Virtue for Gongde Nationals

The Shen Bao Cup Basketball League's Group B finals and women's group matches, which began last Wednesday (the 20th), have concluded after fierce competition. In Group B, the Shantou team overcame strong opponents one after another, and in the final, they narrowly defeated Ren Yu by one point to win the overall championship, a truly commendable achievement. The Green team, with its outstanding performance, easily won every match and secured the Shen Bao Cup women's group title. The Green team's dominance among women is a source of pride. The cup awards ceremony was held this Friday and presided over by Mr. Chen, the president of this newspaper. The Group A winners, Zhongbei and Hualian, each received a silver cup, accepted by team captain Wang Zhongtao for Zhongbei and team captain Kong Guangyi for Hualian. The Shantou team's champion trophy in Group B was accepted by its key player, Lin Zuoshi. Green team captain Li Zhi was absent, so vice-captain Huang Mingyuan accepted the silver cup. Thus, the Shen Bao Cup came to a successful and virtuous conclusion. This newspaper would like to express its deep gratitude for the assistance received from all parties in organizing this basketball league. It fulfilled its original intention of promoting basketball and generated considerable revenue from ticket sales, which will greatly benefit the scholarship fund. The league began on October 6th and has now concluded successfully after nearly three months.

Shantou Team Wins Group B Championship

The Group B finals adopted a knockout system. Each of the five matches featured excellent performances and intense competition, said to be on par with Group A, which is not an exaggeration. The final match between Shantou and Ren Yu was particularly fierce, with both teams giving their all. In the end, Shantou narrowly won by a score of 25 to 24.

The two teams were evenly matched, with many seasoned veterans on their rosters. Their tactics were comparable to those of Group A teams and were progressing on the right track. Today's strong Group B teams will become tomorrow's Group A teams, aiming to dominate Shanghai, and this will be their starting point. We encourage all young players to continue their efforts with this spirit and hope for the best.

Green Team Completes Dominance in Women's Group

Five teams joined the women's group. Except for the Green team, which was particularly outstanding, the other teams were closely matched. The women's matches were unique. Here's a brief introduction to the champion Green team's performance, starting with their results in the cup competition:

Green Team defeats Xuebai 48-15

Green Team defeats Sansheng 50-11

Green Team defeats Huadong 62-15

Green Team defeats Yikang 38-14

Given the Green team's high winning margins in each match, they deserve their title as the leading women's team in Shanghai. Under the planning of manager Xie Yiqin, the team has been constantly practicing. Coach Qian Xucang has put in a lot of effort in guiding them. Team leader Xue Chunsheng has provided much encouragement. In these circumstances, they improve rapidly, so it is no wonder that newer teams have difficulty competing with them. Overall, the Green team's successful evasive maneuvers and accurate shooting are impressive. Individually, Huang Mingyuan and Rong Shujian are both in top form, while Yan Weiwen has a special style. Her dribbling skills have reached perfection, and with her talent for long shots, Miss Yan has become a standard center. As for the guards, Wang Weizhen, Liu Zhenbao, and Wang Yinlan have reached the peak of their individual skills. In terms of tactics, the three adopt a man-to-man marking strategy, each fulfilling their duties, pressing tightly and relentlessly. Their clear understanding of the game makes it difficult for opponents to break through. The Green team's low scores against them are due to the efforts of these three. With such a strong lineup, it is no surprise that they were undefeated. Reserve players such as Yang Wenjuan and Zhu Chengran are also promising talents.

Excellent Performances by Emerging Female Players

Among the emerging teams, Yikang, Xuebai, and Huadong, comprised of young players, put on a good show. The players of the Yikang team followed the coach's instructions and rarely made mistakes. Their inability to win is due to their relative inexperience and slightly inferior individual skills. The Xuebai team showed significant progress in each match, which is attributed to the efforts of team leader Chen Hanquan and coach Zhang Juefei. In their final match against Sansheng, they even managed to draw, demonstrating their rapid progress. Forward Zhang Huiling's agility, Xiao Ying's versatility, and Sheng Jingshu's steadiness are all commendable. Their excellent coordination is particularly rare. The three guards, Zhang Xiuli and Huang Ruyu, are all lively and energetic, with unlimited potential for the future. The Huadong team mainly consists of students from Zhongli Women's High School. Talented players such as Xu Rui and Xiu are still in the initial stages of cooperation and inevitably lack cohesion. In short, all the new teams have shown great potential. It is hoped that they will continue to work hard, and their achievements can be expected. Keep up the good work! (Gong)

### Sino-Portuguese Cup to be Held on New Year's Day: Discussing the Chinese Lineup

— Bi Xian

The Sino-Portuguese Cup football match, held a decade ago, always attracted huge crowds, a sight that still lingers in our minds. However, it has been suspended since the war. Now, the Football Association is reviving this cup match. Both China and Portugal have football stars who are sure to display their skills to the fullest. The crowds are also expected to be large. It is reported that the competition will still be a best-of-three series, with the first match scheduled for New Year's Day in the 34th year of the Republic. The Portuguese lineup has already been announced, and the Chinese roster has also been revealed. A total of 18 talented Chinese players have been selected. Since the Portuguese team's lineup is available, I would like to offer a lineup that counters it.

Portuguese Lineup Announced

Panlimi

Vicktai Colaituo

Laositan Aoliela Gelinbao

V Su Ruo W Panson Baoxiu Tuo Lailiao Fuen

Upon closer inspection, the Portuguese team's attack is entirely focused on the left. The right side will rely solely on Fuen, who is expected to display his power. If this is the case, then our Chinese left-back should be Tian Sheng or Li Ning. Fuen is strong, but the two Lis are too old and may not be able to stop him. Therefore, I believe that Wu Qixiang is the best choice for the left-back position. Old Wu is currently in excellent form and is the only one who can stop Fuen's rapid charge. Moreover, Qixiang is skilled with both feet and will be able to handle the task with ease. The authorities may have their reasons for wanting to use Tian Sheng or Li Ning, but from a tactical standpoint, I believe that Wu Qixiang should be preferred over the two Lis. Some may argue that if Qixiang is moved to the left, the right-back position will become a problem. However, we can avoid this by moving Zhang Lingen, who is a standard right-back. The reason he plays as a midfielder for the Donghua team is because of the lack of midfielders. However, Zhang's style has never been well-suited to the midfielder position, and he still resembles a defender. Therefore, it is only logical to use Lingen as the right-back. I hope the authorities will consider my suggestion. For the center-back position, I suggest Song Lingsheng as the central figure. Considering the Portuguese team's lineup, they will likely focus on defense and then look for opportunities to attack. Therefore, the Chinese team should adopt an attacking strategy. With Song's ball-handling skills, he can coordinate the attack from the center. The right midfielder position should be filled by Zheng Ying, who is currently in good form and improving his kicking and dribbling skills. His speed is also quite fast. As for the left midfielder, I believe Ying Fuzhen should be used. Some may argue that Old Ying has never played midfielder before, so why should we let him try now? But I say, why can't he give it a try? Song Lingsheng has never been successful as a left midfielder. Old Ying is good at retreating to become the third defender, making up for the deficiencies of the defense. Moreover, he can be used to man-mark Fuen, relying on his height to stifle Fuen's activity. I urge you not to dismiss Old Ying simply because he has never played midfielder before. Who knows, he may succeed after trying it out. Moreover, tactically, it makes perfect sense.

For the front line, I propose Li Yi as the center forward, Han Longhai as the right forward, Jia Youliang as the right winger, Sun Jinshun as the left forward, and Li Yao as the left winger. Indeed, the opponent has deployed a strategy to block Sun and Li's attacks and stop Youliang's activity. However, I believe that Youliang and Longhai can switch positions at any time to keep the opponent guessing. Moreover, in the match between Junhua and Portuguese merchants, Kaositan was unable to contain Youliang, and Viktor's mere bravery is not worth mentioning. Sun Jinshun will definitely be man-marked by Lailiao, and Li Yao will also be man-marked by Gelinbao. But if the opponent is willing to sacrifice themselves, then we can take advantage of it. Otherwise, we can make more use of the right side. Moreover, with Li Yichen as the center forward, the opponent's Weifei will be very wary, and the effect is promising. To sum up, my proposed lineup for the Sino-Portuguese Cup is as follows:

Liu Xianhan

Wu Zhang

Qi Lin

Xiang Gen

Tan Song Zheng

Fu Ling Ying

Zhen Sheng Quan

Li Zhuang Sun Jinshun Li Yichen Han Longhai Jia Youliang

### Essentials of Basketball Theory (8)

— Liang Zhaoan

(7) Free Throw Shooting Technique

In recent years, schools across the United States, under the guidance of good coaches, have been using weekends for short-term free throw shooting training, and the remarkable results have rapidly improved the level of basketball. Therefore, the importance of scoring through free throws is worth noting. In many games, victory or defeat often depends on the accuracy of free throws. It is said that in one game, neither side scored, but one team won the game by making a free throw at the end. This may be a rumor, but it shows the importance attached to free throws.

Although shooting free throws is relatively easy, in the tense and emotional atmosphere of a game, it can affect the accuracy of players who lack practice. Even players who practice diligently rarely make seven out of ten free throws in a game. At Springfield College in the United States, students who fail to make seven out of ten free throws in a basketball practice class are not allowed to pass, which is a standard that Shanghai players should strive to achieve.

The simplest free throw method is the two-handed underhand throw. This method involves using both hands to grip the ball on both sides with the fingers spread as much as possible (without the palms touching the ball). The grip should be firm and light. The feet should be shoulder-width apart and flat on the ground. If using the chest-pushing throwing method, the feet should be staggered. The body should first squat down, bending the knees, with the elbows hanging down close to the body. The center of gravity should be straight, not too far forward or too far back. When the ball is released, the body should rise accordingly, but not jump up or rush forward diagonally. Focus on the rim of the basket. The path of the ball should be from high to low, preferably without touching the backboard. However, if touching the backboard is easier, then do so. Do not change any free throw technique that you are accustomed to and have confidence in, otherwise, the new method will be even less accurate. The only point that should be changed is the error of often throwing outside the basket.

(8) Basketball Common Sense and Secrets

There are various ways to train shooting skills, which may vary depending on the instructor's interests and experience. However, regardless of the method used, in addition to technical practice, every player should be familiar with basketball common sense and secrets. Technical skills require a considerable amount of training time, but common sense and secrets can be understood with a single explanation, which can correct many errors. It can be said that it saves time and yields great results. The main points are described below:

### Gleanings from the Sports Scene

Green team's Wang Yinlan is serving in the Shen Bao Cup in her capacity as a bride during her honeymoon period, which is admirable! The groom cheers her on at every game, so Wang's performance is particularly brilliant.

Miss Lin Meiling, a famous swimmer, serves as a staff member in the Baojia section of the Jiangning Police Sub-bureau. Her loyal service has been appreciated by her superiors.
