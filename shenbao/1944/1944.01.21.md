### Editorial: The National Government's Urgent Tasks

Japan's Yomiuri Hochi newspaper, in its January 10th editorial, proposed that the most pressing task for the National Government is "increasing production." It argued that the continuous rise in prices destabilizes people's livelihoods, hindering production. The conclusion was that production determines the war, and therefore, in the current stage of the war, increasing production is an absolute order. The problems of prices and people's livelihoods, which hinder production, should be given special consideration, and Japan is willing to provide assistance for this purpose. (See the first page of today's newspaper.)

We share the same view on this issue and have repeatedly discussed and advised the authorities. In our editorial on September 17th of last year, when discussing the issue of national economic recovery, we proposed that a prerequisite is the stabilization of people's lives. People prioritize their livelihoods. If their lives are not stable, they will devote all their energy to securing their livelihoods and will not consider matters beyond that. Therefore, unless people's lives are first stabilized, it will be ineffective to expect them to cooperate with economic endeavors. Thus, the independent power of the economic system cannot fully salvage the economic crisis, and it must be supplemented by political reform to allow the economic system to exert its full effect.

What is the current state of people's livelihoods? Naturally, there is no "stability" to speak of. Prices are rising continuously, causing everyone to devote their energy to securing their livelihoods. As a result, national economic endeavors and plans to increase production have not received cooperation. Production in agriculture and industry has not only failed to increase but has also decreased. The Shanghai Industrial Association's survey of the operating rates of various industries last year is as follows:

Here, two points must be clarified: Firstly, the above statistics are based on the operating rates of Japanese factories, while the operating rates of Chinese factories are even lower due to insufficient raw materials. Secondly, the table is based on the situation in January of last year, and the current shortage of raw materials is even more severe than at that time, so the operating rates should be even lower. On the other hand, the government implements a wartime economic control system, focusing only on procurement and distribution. Originally, the control work should include production, procurement, and distribution. However, procurement and distribution are only temporary and passive measures. Only by intensifying production can we achieve a fundamental and active solution. However, the current control mechanism only extends to procurement and distribution, and even the procurement work has not been fully rationalized, which is enough to affect and reduce production. For example, the official procurement price of rice may not actually reach the farmers, which is likely to affect the rice yield in the next year. On the one hand, a slogan of increasing production is put forward, while on the other hand, methods of reducing production are implemented. This is an absolutely contradictory phenomenon.

In summary, we believe that the focus of the problem still lies in politics. Reform must be carried out as soon as possible to be able to solve the economic problems. Increasing production is certainly an economic problem, but the price problem, which hinders production, and the problem of stabilizing people's livelihoods must be addressed simultaneously with political power. Therefore, political reform and clarification are naturally necessary. What China needs now are practical politicians who implement production increase plans practically. At the same time, we hope that allied countries will provide us with technical assistance, especially grasping this key point. Relying solely on economic systems and economic policies cannot fully salvage the economic crisis or solve economic problems. We must simultaneously use the power of reforming politics and clarifying politics to enable economic systems and economic policies to achieve their full effect. This is our repeatedly and urgently put-forward request.

### Lending by Financial Institutions Must Be Used for Productive Enterprises: Finance Minister Zhou's Statement Yesterday

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) – China's participation in the war has entered its second year, and the responsibilities it bears have become increasingly significant. In order to rigorously carry out its tasks, the National Government has designated this year as the year of increased production. The National Economic Commission has also decided on specific guidelines for increased production. Moreover, as the old lunar year draws to a close, the general financial situation is exceptionally stable. Our reporter, due to the fact that Deputy Premier Zhou once presided over the Third Economic Conference on behalf of Chairman Wang, and is also the highest authority in the national financial community, sought an interview to understand the future direction of finance and economics. He was granted an audience and released the following statement:

The Greater East Asia War has entered its third year, and China's participation in the war has also stepped into its second year. The countries of East Asia should work even harder than before to complete the tasks of war and construction in East Asia. China, as an important stronghold in the rear of the Greater East Asia War and the hub of East Asian economy, bears extremely heavy responsibilities and tasks.

Chairman has instructed that this year is the year of increased production. The Third Conference of the National Economic Commission has decided on various production increase plans, which will be implemented in order. If the entire nation can follow this plan and work hard, not only can China's economic construction be completed, but also the victory of the Greater East Asia War will be more firmly secured. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will follow the government's policies and implement them diligently to reduce obstacles to construction and increase the effectiveness of construction. Furthermore, as the old lunar year is approaching, the financial situation in various places is exceptionally stable, indicating that the government's financial and economic policies have had good results, which has been rare in the past. However, according to past experience, after each old lunar year, various prices tend to rise. One reason for this is that the funds received by various banks and money houses before the festival lack proper distribution, and large amounts are released, causing floating capital to flood the market, leading to speculation and hoarding. Another reason is that unscrupulous merchants seek illegal profits by manipulating and speculating. Now that the end of the year is approaching, hoarding may occur after the old lunar year, stimulating prices. It is hoped that various financial institutions will be cautious in lending, ensuring that the released funds are used for productive enterprises, which can stabilize prices and promote production. At the same time, the general public should save as much as possible and practice thrift to accumulate construction funds and expand the scope of production. Businessmen should also consider the government's intentions and the people's livelihoods, and not be greedy for excessive profits and hoard goods. If there are still financial institutions that indiscriminately lend money and unscrupulous merchants who raise prices, the government will impose severe sanctions on them, because only in this way can people's livelihoods be stabilized and public order be guaranteed.

### Companies Tend to Speculate, Affecting the Financial Market: Statement by Responsible Person of the Ministry of Industry

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) – Because idle funds in various places and companies engaged in real estate trading and investment enterprises have recently tended towards speculative transactions, stimulating price increases and affecting the entire financial market, the responsible person of the Ministry of Industry made the following statement: It has been found that a large amount of idle capital in various places is used for speculative businesses, leading to stimulation of market prices and disruption of the financial market. Moreover, various companies engaged in real estate trading and investment enterprises also tend to engage in speculative transactions, causing market fluctuations to be abnormal. The establishment of new companies of this kind is even more rampant. In order to guide idle capital to the right track and to enrich the plan for increasing production, it is specifically decided that from January 22nd of this year, all companies engaged in real estate trading or general speculative enterprises with a wide range of businesses, such as enterprise investment companies, will be temporarily suspended from being established, unless they have been investigated by this Ministry and found to have special needs and are indeed non-speculative in nature, and are specially permitted to be established. Those who have already applied for registration, applied for capital verification, or held founding meetings before January 22nd will be given consideration to take into account the difficulties of businessmen while preventing speculative businesses. This measure has been telegraphed to the economic bureaus of various provinces and cities for compliance. It is hoped that merchants and people will understand this intention and invest their capital in the cause of increasing production, and must not engage in companies of a speculative nature, resulting in losses.

### Reorganization of the Ministry of Social Welfare: Approved by the Supreme National Defense Council Yesterday

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) – The 38th meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council was held on the 20th of this month, and the following proposals were approved, excerpted as follows: The proposal from the Secretariat was approved, and submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Secretariat of the Central Political Committee.

The Ministry of Social Welfare will set up a Population Department and incorporate the original Physical Strength Division. Referring to the regulations of the Population Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare, the functions are roughly as follows: (A) Matters related to population increase and improvement, (B) Matters related to ethnic eugenics and nutrition, (C) Matters related to national health, (D) Matters related to national physical strength, (E) Matters related to national marriage, (F) Other matters related to population.

### Hao Pengju Concurrently Appointed as Commander of the Huaihai Security

### Military and Political Conference Held in Northwestern Chongqing Area

Guangzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) – Chongqing news: The military and political conference in the northwestern Chongqing area was held at the headquarters of the Eighth War Zone on the 14th, lasting three days. More than 20 cases, including the improvement of military supplies, were passed. The conference closed on the 16th. It is heard that the central issue of the conference seemed to be dealing with the CCP issue. After the Chongqing side had previously issued a statement on the CCP issue at the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the CCP side did not express any formal opinions, but instead actively promoted anti-Chiang work and made efforts to expand its military equipment. In view of this, the Chongqing side wanted to suppress it and to give instructions to the generals in the Northwest, so there was this action by the Chongqing army, which is worthy of attention.

### Translated Commentary: The National Government's Urgent Tasks

Since the Konoe Statement, through the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, the implementation of the new policy toward China in January of last year, and the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty in the autumn of last year, Japan has expressed its full sincerity and efforts for China's independence; China has also strived for self-improvement and devoted itself to enhancing its national strength to live up to Japan's sincerity. Regarding Japan's policy toward China, there have been various arguments recently in Chongqing and the United States and Britain. But when we look at the changes in Japan's views toward China since the Meiji era, civil society figures since Meiji 10, such as Kentaro Oi, Baigai Yamamoto, and Tojū Kobayashi, and the Miyazaki and Yamada brothers and many other figures around the Xinhai Revolution, all hoped for China's strength and independence. Also, figures such as Kuniomi Hirano, Takayoshi Kido, Kaishu Katsu, and Tomomi Iwakura also advocated China's independence and Sino-Japanese cooperation; Shigenobu Okuma and Atsumaro Konoe also expressed the same views; Masayoshi Matsukata also discussed the importance of China's independence in a letter to Count Terauchi. Therefore, the policy toward China articulated by Japan since the Konoe Statement is based on the traditional policy since the Meiji Restoration. The various arguments commenting on Japan's recent policy toward China are merely making clever propaganda for Britain and the United States.

Now China's independence has gained a golden opportunity and is about to be realized. This is the historical hope of China and Japan. To achieve this hope, the victory of the Greater East Asia War is an absolute condition. Regardless of its short establishment period, the National Government resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States last January to strengthen its cooperation with Japan, which is also nothing more than to obtain this absolute condition. For the past year since the declaration of war, the National Government has been pouring all its strength and moving toward this goal.

Since participating in the war, the guiding principles of China's administration have been listed by President Wang as establishing security, increasing production, and raising the national wartime consciousness. However, in view of the current urgent situation of the war, the main point must first be to increase production to increase combat power. The most necessary things are airplanes, warships, and artillery. From this point of view, China's responsibility as a logistics base has become increasingly important. The iron, coal, and other heavy industrial resources of North China and Mengjiang, and the agricultural products of Central China, are the war resources that China can contribute, which are the most urgent requirements in the current decisive war situation. The most urgent requirement is the full mobilization of this aspect.

But we want to point out here that the high prices in North and Central China are a major obstacle in front of this urgent requirement. The prices in North China gradually declined after the price controls implemented last spring until June, but began to rise sharply again in October and continue to this day. In Central China, compared to January and August of last year, prices have risen three or four times. The price increases continued unabated thereafter, and the rate of increase has been even more alarming since December. Moreover, the characteristic is that the controlled prices have risen even higher than the free prices, and the rate of increase of necessities is high.

Increasing production is definitely not just a numerical calculation and the superficial establishment of institutions. It is a material that can be directly transformed into combat power through actual production. However, this actual production is only possible in complex relationships. Especially in a place like China, the conditions for implementing a controlled economy are not complete, so it is inevitable to anticipate the difficulties that are expected.

The high prices not only hinder the smoothness of production design, the acquisition of materials, and the transportation of products, but also lead to social unrest, which indirectly becomes an obstacle to production.

In the current stage of the war, increasing production is an absolute order. Production determines the war. Japan is now overcoming all difficulties and moving towards increasing production. For China, whose autonomy and independence are dependent on the Greater East Asia War, the most urgent task cannot but be increasing production first. If the past year was the growth period for the war-fighting posture, then the coming year should be to move directly towards increasing production in a well-prepared posture. Therefore, the price problem and the livelihood problem, which are obstacles to it, cannot but be given special consideration. Japan is willing to assist for this purpose; but at the same time, another political reason must be considered, that is, the high prices in China are caused by the progress of the war.

### Japanese Troops on the Burmese Border Attack Enemy Positions

### Adventurous Invasion of Europe Will Inevitably Backfire: Goebbels Warns the British

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the Haitong News Agency: A German weekly published an article by Goebbels, analyzing the adventure of the anti-Axis forces invading Europe and its impact. It is reported that the German military commanders have taken all necessary measures against the enemy's attempt to invade. The enemy also knows that a large-scale invasion of Western Europe is the most dangerous action. If Britain and the United States make a desperate bet and fail, they will be at a disadvantage and will inevitably be defeated. So far, Britain and the United States have only dispatched a part of their troops to fight. If they invade Western Europe on a large scale, they will have to use all their strength. Britain and the United States do not know the strength of the German army and what its strategy is. Isn't it adventurous to invade rashly? Moreover, the German troops in Western Europe have not encountered strong enemies since 1940, and their strength is sufficient. They also have the advantage of waiting for work. Since the beginning of the German-Soviet war, the Germans have been vigilant and have always been concerned about the enemy's actions to invade from the Atlantic coast. Goebbels revealed the possibility of the German army using new weapons. The enemy will inevitably suffer huge losses, which can be asserted. Moreover, the German Air Force and Army will fight fiercely with the enemy, and its intensity may be unprecedented. The British shouted "The invasion of Europe must not fail," which shows that the British understand the seriousness of this battle. What's more, there is one thing that the British and the world cannot tolerate. The British Isles have a population of only 40 million, and the birth rate is declining. If the action to invade Europe causes too many casualties, how can it be remedied? They will end up suffering the consequences of their own actions. The British will eventually have to pay for their sins.

### Original Text of Essential Guidelines for the Purchase and Rationing of Materials

These guidelines are intended to implement the current food and price policies. The rationing of cotton yarn, cloth, and other major materials in various regions focuses on promoting the purchase of agricultural products and aims for organic operation. These guidelines are implemented by the Commerce Control Council, with relevant Sino-Japanese agencies assisting as needed. The implementation period is from November of the Republic of China's 32nd year (1943) to March of the 33rd year (1944). However, these guidelines should be appropriately revised after the overall cotton yarn and cloth rationing plan is finalized. The materials include six types: cotton yarn, cloth, candles, matches, soap, sugar, and cigarettes. A separate plan will be created for the rationing of salt. The materials implemented under these guidelines should focus on promoting the purchase of agricultural products and ensure effective distribution. Except for appropriate restrictions on the rationing of general consumer goods, appropriate reserve quantities should be retained for use to promote the purchase of materials and implement price controls. The rationing of materials for exchange should focus on absorbing major agricultural products such as rice and cotton, as well as pastoral materials from non-peaceful areas. It should be distributed appropriately according to the type of materials to be purchased. The shipment of allocated materials from Shanghai and the overall wholesale in various regions should be handled by the Commerce Control Council's subordinate agencies. The shipment of materials allocated previously from Shanghai should adopt a mandatory system. Regarding the rationing of general consumer goods or exchange materials by local rationing agencies, the local agencies of the Commerce Control Council should operate cooperatives as a principle for rationing exchange materials. The rationing agencies for exchange materials should, in areas where lower-level agencies of the Commerce Control Council have been established, operate the various local lower-level agencies of the council as a principle. In areas where the Commerce Control Council has not established lower-level agencies, especially in areas close to non-peaceful areas, the various local purchasing agencies should be used as a principle. As for cooperatives, they should be appropriately used in any of the above areas. The Commerce Control Council should establish offices in eighteen major regions to manage exchange agencies and be responsible for handling the exchange of materials in various regions. The agencies affiliated with the Commerce Control Council, when handling the rationing of exchange materials, should follow the methods listed on the left. The specific implementation guidelines for purchasing various materials will be established separately. The agencies affiliated with the Commerce Control Council and the material purchasing agencies should negotiate to designate locations in various regions to handle the distribution of exchange materials and should, before the stipulated deadline, accurately distribute the types and quantities of each material to each distribution point. When agricultural product purchasers deliver the purchased materials to the warehouse designated by the material purchasing agency, they should issue a material exchange voucher with the name, quantity, deadline, and distribution point of the exchange items. The purchaser can exchange the voucher for exchange materials at the designated distribution point. (1) When cooperatives handle the rationing of exchange materials, if cooperative members can jointly collect and supply locally produced materials, the township or county/city cooperative can centrally collect materials from the agencies affiliated with the local Commerce Control Council. The implementation methods will be negotiated by the agencies affiliated with the local Commerce Control Council, the cooperative, and the purchasing agency. (2) When material purchasing agencies handle the rationing of exchange materials, the principle is that the purchasing agency directly receives the distributed materials from the receiving agency of the Commerce Control Council. The handling of rationing matters should still make great efforts to use the existing lower-level distribution agencies. The previous rationing method does not adopt a voucher system but instead allows the purchasing agency to directly deliver the materials it has purchased to the agricultural product purchasers. The prices of materials rationed under these guidelines are determined according to the following standards: (1) The prices of urban general rationing and exchange materials should refer to the general price levels in each region to determine fair prices and should gradually adapt to low-price policies. The prices of exchange materials in areas adjacent to non-peaceful areas should be determined with reference to local market prices. (2) The general rationing prices of cooperatives should not include adjustment fees in principle. Adjustment fees should be handled centrally by the Commerce Control Council in principle, but depending on the local situation, the Commerce Control Council may allocate a portion to local handling. The financial measures required to implement these guidelines should be planned by the local authorities themselves, but the Commerce Control Council should provide as much assistance as possible. The implementation of these guidelines should involve close liaison between the relevant agencies in each region, and widespread assistance from local agencies such as county/city/district/town. The implementation of these guidelines should be actively sought by local agencies, and the "Outline of Rewards for Material Purchases" should be given to farmers for publicity and to purchasing agencies or cooperatives, which should be submitted by the Material Control Review Committee to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation.

### Efforts Underway to Increase Coal Briquette Rationing; Daily Increase in Coal Shipments from North China to Shanghai

Central News Agency reports: Due to the scarcity of coal in the city recently, speculators have manipulated and hoarded it, causing prices to skyrocket and creating a fuel panic. Now, with the strict crackdown and control by relevant bureaus, as well as the smoothing of supply sources and the implementation of rationing, the market price has stopped rising, and public sentiment has stabilized somewhat. It is learned that the Coal United Association, in an effort to suppress the fuel panic and restore the coal supply to its previous state, has dispatched Bureau Chief Da Qiao to the coal-producing areas of North China to contact the Chang Bureau, smooth out supply routes, and purchase a large amount of coal to Shanghai. According to a Central News Agency reporter, it was recently learned from Da Zhong Lian Coal Company that the amount of coal shipped from North China to Shanghai has been increasing daily, with extremely rich reserves. There is a sufficient supply of raw materials for rationing to various briquette factories, and the production of coal briquettes has increased. The Economic Section of the First District Office is seeking ways to increase the rationing of coal briquettes.

Factory Coal Rationing Being Prepared

The Da Zhong Lian Coal Company is preparing the rationing procedures for 7,000 tons of coal for factories in January. In addition, the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company and the Coal United Association have obtained a significant amount of coal for water kiosks and are currently awaiting the issuance of permits from the First District Office before issuing it. As for coal for bathhouses, the authorities have allowed rationing, but because the Bathhouse Association is preparing a roster of members and the procedures are slow, there is no basis for immediate rationing. Once the association's roster of members is submitted, the required amount will be rationed. Therefore, the supply of coal in the city should be sufficient in the future.

Affordable Coal for Hot Water Shops

The First District Office decided yesterday that starting today, it will begin rationing affordable coal to 619 hot water shops in the First and Eighth Districts, as well as the Nanshi and Huxi areas. Each hot water shop owner can bring their original seal and association notice from 1:00 PM today to 23:00 PM on the 23rd to the association to obtain a registration certificate. Then, they can obtain a "Coal Purchase Certificate" from the Material Rationing Section of the Economic Section of the First District Office in Room 701, 3rd Floor, No. 209 Jiangxi Road, before paying for the goods at the designated coal company. The industry previously increased the selling price to one yuan per ladle of Central Reserve Certificates due to the soaring price of coal. Now that affordable fuel can be obtained, the cost has been slightly reduced, so it has been decided to reduce the price to five cents from February 1 of this year.

### Cracks Have Emerged Among the Anti-Axis Powers; Talk by Information Minister Hirota

Central News Agency reports: Information Minister Hirota of the Japanese Embassy met with reporters in the city at the Hua Mao Hotel on the eighth floor at 3:00 PM yesterday (20th) as usual. During the meeting, he delivered a speech on the current world situation, explaining in great detail the mutual contradictions in the political, military, and other policies of the anti-Axis powers, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The content of his speech is recorded as follows:

Britain and the United States Are Passive on the Second Front

Since the Tehran Conference last fall, it has been rumored that "the anti-Axis side, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing, have reached a complete understanding," and "the anti-Axis Britain and the United States will form a second front on the European continent and launch an attack on Germany. In the Pacific, they will strengthen their attack on Japan." However, judging from the actual situation, the anti-Axis powers have not been able to reach consensus in political, military, or economic aspects. In reality, there is a fierce opposition movement in Britain and the United States regarding the second front issue. Therefore, Britain and the United States are extremely passive about forming a second front. As a result, the Soviet Union is now extremely worried about the passive attitude of Britain and the United States. Britain and the United States landed in North Africa, Sicily, and southern Italy, where there are no defensive facilities, and suffered significant losses. Moreover, if Britain and the United States attempt to land in France and the Balkans this time, the German side has long been prepared and has strong defenses, so it can be predicted that they will suffer great losses. It is estimated that the loss of soldiers in Britain and the United States will be more than three million in 1944-1945, which is meaningless. The domestic public is also gradually understanding this, and opposition is gradually becoming fierce, causing great difficulties for the governments of both countries.

Political Opinions Are Difficult to Unify

Britain and the United States cannot agree on the issue of the gradual expansion of communist forces in Europe. Britain especially opposes the southward expansion of Soviet communism. Although the United States has stated that communism is not a threat to the world, its citizens cannot accept this. Therefore, the inability of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to unify their political opinions has been fully exposed. At the same time, the gradual expansion of communist forces into the European continent has made Britain and the United States feel the danger of its threat, prompting Britain and the United States to restore their relations with the Soviet Union to the era when they were enemies in the past. In response to this situation, the Axis powers have established perfect preparations to reduce the enemy's attack power and are confident of ultimate victory regardless of when the war ends.

### Supplementary Registration for Scholarships; Deadline on the 22nd; Junior 3 and Senior 1 Students Submit Application Forms Today

Due to the approaching school term and the excessive number of applications, the scholarship affairs for this session must be expedited. Students who need assistance must submit their application forms and receive their registration certificates according to the stipulated dates. Yesterday, it was announced that if there are indeed reasons why application forms could not be submitted in time, the school would compile and submit them. After much consideration, it was deemed inconvenient in terms of time. Now it has been decided that all application forms for Junior High School 3, Senior High School 1, Senior High School 2, Senior High School 3, and University/Business groups must be registered within the previously announced dates. Late submissions will not be accepted. As for Senior Elementary School 1st and 2nd graders and Junior High School 1st and 2nd graders' application forms, if they were not submitted last time, they must be registered by the 22nd of this month. Late registrations will not be accommodated. Today, application forms for Junior High School 3 and Senior High School 1 will be received. Students who need assistance are asked to personally bring their application forms, along with a "personal statement," to register.

All Sectors Enthusiastically Support Scholarships

Yesterday, Mr. Wu Shaowu sent 20,000 national currency to donate to the poor, which is commendable for his public spirit and righteousness. On Mr. Rong Zhenwang's thirtieth birthday, his relatives and friends gave him gifts. He allocated all the gift money, totaling 12,000 yuan, to scholarships. Cun Yang Tang Yao sent 9,600 yuan in cash to be used as the newspaper's scholarship fund.

### 60th Round of Rice Flour on Sale Today

The 60th round of rice flour for household ration is on sale starting today. Residents can take their rice flour purchase tickets to the designated rice shops to purchase two and a half sheng of white rice and one catty of first-class flour, for a total price of 28 Central Reserve Certificates. If citizens discover that rice shops have mixed or other irregularities, they should immediately report them to the nearest police authorities for investigation.

### 32nd Round of Rice in the City District Advanced for Public Sale

The Shanghai Food Bureau issued a notice yesterday (20th), stating that the 31st round of publicly sold brown rice, which is about to be sold, has been increased to two sheng, and the 32nd round will be further increased to two and a half sheng and will be changed to white rice. However, the bureau's public sales have been overdue for several months. Although efforts have been made to expedite the process, and the two rounds have been combined, there is still a delay of more than ten days. Therefore, the date of the 32nd round of public sales should be delayed until early February. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, citizens are in urgent need of rice. In order to suppress grain prices, the bureau has specially exchanged the 32nd and 31st rounds for sale, so that citizens can obtain more and better rice during the Spring Festival. It is now scheduled to sell the 32nd round of public sales from the 21st to the 30th of this month. Citizens in each district should purchase the allocated white rice of two and a half sheng with their certificates at the designated public sales locations within the period. Each sheng is 8 national currency, totaling 20 yuan. It will be invalidated after the deadline. The date for supplementary issuance of the 31st round will be announced separately.

### Medical Association and Two Other Groups Form Dispute Research Association to Handle Disputes Between Patients and Doctors

Central News Agency reports: The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Medical Association, the Shanghai Special City Medical Association, and the Shanghai Public and Private Hospital Federation held a banquet at the Conference Hall of the Industrial and Commercial Federation in the Xingya Building on the Bund yesterday (20th) at 12:00 PM to entertain members of the city's press. Presidents of the city's hospitals and famous doctors Gu Nanqun, Yan Fuqing, Yu Yunxiu, Zhu Qizhang, Tang Yuhan, Zhu Yanggao, etc., attended, as well as more than 30 journalists including Chen Binhe, Yang Jionglang, Chen Ying, Qiu Shimu, and Ren Yunpeng.

Chairman's Speech

Chairman Gu Nanqun first rose to speak on behalf of the group: "I am deeply grateful to all of you for attending today. You are authorities in public opinion and lead the masses in society. I and my colleagues in the medical community deeply respect you. Recently, there have been constant disputes between the medical community and patients in society. Although the medical community cannot be said to be without fault in this situation, there are also many patients who do not understand the situation, so misunderstandings occur. As medical professionals, we should do our best to serve the public and never refuse to save a patient who is in imminent danger. Now, due to the large number of disputes, the medical community has suffered, and the impact is not small. In order to correct this situation and prevent this trend from growing, the three associations have jointly organized the 'Medical Dispute Research Association' to study the causes and reasons for the disputes. Prominent doctors and experts in various fields in the city will be responsible for handling the organization of the association."

Impact of Disputes

Yu Yunxiu then gave a detailed explanation from the medical perspective. Later, Tian Yan Fuqing gave a speech: "The current situation of disputes not only affects my colleagues in the medical community but also affects society to a great extent. However, although it is the duty of the medical community to serve the public, there are inevitably speculative and false doctors mixed in. Therefore, it is necessary for the medical community to reorganize. In addition, experimental areas have been designated in the 182 Districts and Huxi and other civilian areas. Now, Daxilu and other places in Xujiahui Town have been selected to start civilian health work, with the aim of serving the public with doctors and instilling correct concepts of popularizing medical knowledge. Finally, he also explained many pathological conditions.

Representative's Thank You

Finally, Chen Binhe, a representative of the press, thanked them, saying, "I have just learned a lot about medical and pharmaceutical knowledge, which is not insignificant. The members of the press and the medical community have the same goal of serving society. Therefore, now that the medical community is experiencing difficulties, this unfortunate dispute not only affects society but also affects the welfare of the citizens. Although today's gathering is ordinary, its significance is not insignificant."

Yesterday's news dispatch at 7:20 PM

### Economic Commentary on the National Savings Movement

Wartime savings have at least two crucial significances: first, to expand production funds, and second, to promote frugality among the people. From the former perspective, savings can assist the country in digesting public bonds, thereby providing funds for production expansion. From the latter perspective, savings can put the people's floating purchasing power into a dormant state, thereby reducing unnecessary daily consumption. This is the task wartime savings undertake, and participating in the savings movement is the duty the people should bear.　　

The recent launch of the national savings movement in the capital, with various agencies, organizations, youth groups, and shops depositing funds in the Central Reserve Bank and encouraging the public to participate in frugality and savings in order to achieve the goal of saving to serve the country, is truly exciting. However, what we expect is the long-term and widespread implementation of wartime savings.　　

The basic policy for promoting savings should strive to avoid legal enforcement and instead allow the people to practice voluntary savings out of patriotism. However, whether the promotion of savings proceeds smoothly undoubtedly depends on whether those leading the wartime national savings movement can painstakingly and diligently research various countermeasures. These countermeasures must not only be novel and organized but also focus on absorbing the sources of national economic resources. Only then can satisfactory results be achieved, contributing to the country's economy and the people's livelihood during wartime. Further commentary will be provided to fully explain this.

### The Economic Sector is Organizing a Huaihai Survey Group to Investigate the Economic Situation in the Province

The Su-Huai region has a close relationship with the exchange of materials between Central and North China. Since the National Government decided to re-establish the area as Huaihai Province, its importance has increased even further. In order to accurately understand the actual situation of the province, economic figures in this city will organize an economic survey group to conduct an on-site investigation of all economic conditions in the area. Currently, relevant parties in this city are actively carrying out organizational matters for the survey group. In addition to authoritative figures from the economic sector serving as members, selections will also be made from various public organizations. It is expected that after the establishment of the province, it will contribute to the exchange of materials between the North and South.

### Situation on Various Fronts in Greater East Asia: Japanese Army's Efforts in Battle: Answers by Spokesperson of Japanese Army to Questions by Reporters

Central News Agency report: The spokesperson of the Shanghai Army Press Department of the Japanese Army met with Chinese journalists at the Hua Mao Hotel on the 20th, answering questions from reporters of various newspapers. He gave a detailed account of the defense and combat efforts of the Japanese army on various battlefields and clarified the determination to win. The details are as follows:

(Chinese Daily News Question) What is the progress of the situation in the Burma battlefield?

(Answer) The anti-Axis forces have high expectations for overcoming Burma. Our army has long anticipated the enemy's intentions, first with the operations north of Beixi, where the enemy was defeated last year. Recently, the expeditionary force of the Chongqing side in the area of A-mu has completed American-style training. The enemy side has also transferred the Gurkha forces, which have relatively strong anti-British sentiments, to the area of Ceylon Island, while mobilizing newly arrived African indigenous troops to the Zhuyi line, consistently making it their mission to sacrifice other ethnic groups. In December of last year, the Japanese army reduced the enemy forces by about one thousand north of Pukidon. On the night of the 8th of this year, they once again defeated the enemy forces that attacked the Chongte area. Recently, the enemy has shown some signs of activity on the Beixi front, but without any proactive actions. Also, recently, the Ling side has been frequently conducting reconnaissance on the area of Jitebo Island. Since the enemy has no land-based strategies to implement, they are repeatedly carrying out bombing raids on Burma and Vietnam, using the Tenth Air Force stationed in India, which has been incorporated into the Eastern Air Force. This is simply sacrificing innocent civilians. The Japanese army's air force has also launched attacks on various bases, including Tonsa, A-mu, the Arakan region, and Calcutta, suppressing the enemy's air force and making the enemy confirm that control of the airspace over the mainland is still in the hands of the Japanese army.

(Shen Bao Question) What is the recent battle situation on the Yunnan-Burma front?

(Answer) It is reported that Chen Cheng, the commander of the Chongqing expeditionary force in Burma, expressed extreme indignation at the non-rescue attitude of the British and Indian armies and resigned in mid-November, while simultaneously suggesting to Chiang Kai-shek that the Chongqing army should take independent military action. In short, the Chongqing army's dissatisfaction with the British and American military officers has been fully exposed. The Chongqing army, which was deceived and driven away west of the Nu River, is panicked about the Japanese army's attacks. How Wei Lihuang, Chen Cheng's successor, will clean up this expeditionary force is a real problem.

### Current Situation on the China Front

(New China News Question) What is the situation on the Central China front?

(Answer) The Changde operation has concluded with a major victory. The Japanese army in Central China completely annihilated the Chongqing army that was stirring up trouble in the Sixth and Fifty-second War Zones during the mopping-up operations, and on December 25th of last year, it restored the original state. Conflicts often arise between the Chongqing and Communist armies, especially in the Third War Zone.

(New China News Question) What is the current situation on the South China front?

(Answer) After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the railway that was damaged by the British army was repeatedly cleared by the Japanese army and, with the sincere cooperation of the Chinese people, has now resumed traffic.

(New China News Question) What is the current situation on the North China Front?

(Answer) Mopping-up operations are continuously being carried out in the North China area. Last year, the number of abandoned corpses of bandits and those captured and surrendered reached as many as 300,000. Currently, the clearing operations are still ongoing.

### Remnants of the Chongqing Air Force

(New Daily News Question) The British and American armies recently attempted to disrupt peaceful areas using their remaining air force in Chongqing, implementing blind harassment tactics. What is the reality of the air force in Chongqing, the movement of the harassment tactics, and the preparations of the Japanese Air Force?

(Answer) The army air force in China shot down and destroyed 153 American air force planes in Chongqing in mid-December last winter, eliminating the enemy's ambition to disrupt the mainland. Enemy aircraft appeared over Taiwan twice, on November 25th of last year and January 11th of this year. Their intention is not difficult to discern. Although the enemy suffered a major blow, they still attempt to take advantage of our unpreparedness to attack Wuhan, Guangzhou, and the Yangtze River basin. Recently, the enemy has deployed a large number of aircraft to the southeast of China, attempting to threaten our southern supply lines. However, their repeated sorties, preempted by the Japanese army, fully expose their weakness and incompetence. The Chongqing air force is confined to the interior. In short, the Japanese army's control of the airspace over the mainland remains unshaken.

### Western District Youth Basketball Showdown: Hualian vs. Dongfang in Championship Final

The Western District Youth Basketball Tournament features four games tonight, starting at 6:15 PM. Among them, the Group A match between Hualian Pharmacy and Dongfang is essentially the championship final. Hualian has repeatedly defeated the local Western District powerhouses, including the giants, Mononok, and the strong Chinese teams, including Hua Nan and Tongren, with six consecutive wins. Their only major concern is Dongfang. Dongfang has emerged as a force in Shanghai this year, harboring championship ambitions. Unfortunately, they suffered a crushing defeat in their match against Tongren. If Dongfang can win tonight, it will create a three-way tie with Hualian, the giants, and Dongfang each losing once. Therefore, a fierce and exciting battle is expected. However, according to Dongfang's official announcement: Zhang Jiakui, Gao Baozheng, and Li Zude, who are staying in Xiqing, and Wang Jinghu, who is staying in the Soviet Union, were unable to arrive in time. Bao Songyuan is unlikely to play. Zhang Shaoqing and Xu Wenkui are both suffering from bronchitis and are unable to serve. The internal decision is to field Fan Qingxian, Wu Huanian, Qian Jingyong, Gu Senkang, Gu Likang, Wu Guolin, Zhong En, etc. With such a lineup, Hualian is likely to win. The schedule for tonight is as follows: (Also, tickets for the Western District, starting today, will be sold for 13 yuan upstairs and 26 yuan downstairs.)

Opponent / Team (Group) / Time
E Team vs. Soviet (B3) 6:15 PM
Dongfang vs. Hualian (Group A) 7:10 PM
Hua Ying vs. Mononok (Group A) 8:00 PM

### National Forum: The Improvements That Western Pharmaceutical Factories Should Make by Hu Min

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the source of Western medicines has been cut off, and the domestic Western medicine industry has seen a temporary surge.

However, if a factory is opened and the products are poor or reduced because of improper use of personnel, or "personnel cannot give full play to their talents and equipment cannot be fully utilized," then isn't the life of the factory very worrying? The author would like to offer a word to the heads of pharmaceutical factories based on what I have seen and heard:

Ordinary factories recruit personnel with experience as a prerequisite, but the author believes that experienced people, if they do not have the enterprising determination to strive for excellence, then their work value is lower than those who have the determination to strive for excellence but have no experience. Because although the latter have no experience, they will definitely have more skills and experience than the former in the future, relying only on their enterprising determination.

Some factories think that the newly recruited personnel are all uneducated, so the work they are given is trivial and meaningless. Moreover, because they are new, they are not given any right to speak. The author has a cousin who used to be a trainee in a small pharmaceutical factory. According to him, every morning he would help the chemist wash bottles, fetch things, install instruments, disassemble instruments, etc. He would do this all day long without rest or change. Sometimes he felt that what the chemist was doing was unreasonable. However, he was a new trainee, and the chemist thought of him as "just a high school graduate, how much knowledge could he have?" Of course, he dared not speak up, and could not speak up. When the factory director thought that the products were too slow or poor and extended the working hours, wouldn't it be the trainees who suffered?

Some pharmaceutical factories often misuse instruments. For example, a tube that has just passed chlorine gas is placed on the shelf, and the person does not wipe or inspect it before taking it to use for filtration. How can the things filtered out in this way be good? Some people use huge air pumps to supply porcelain cups with a diameter of less than four centimeters for filtration. In fact, the pumping force required for such a porcelain cup is the same as the suction generated when a long rubber tube is used as a siphon. Why use a huge air pump to "waste talent on a small task"?

The author has also visited a pharmaceutical factory. The factory was equipped with a sophisticated air pump, the scale of which can be said to exert the utmost force on the mercury column of 0.25 inches. However, this sophisticated machine is not used for sophisticated work, but for filtration that does not require precise air extraction. The author believes that in today's world where motive power is expensive, it may be possible to replace this electric-powered machine with a hand-cranked machine. Its structure can be roughly modified by imitating a steam engine. As for the parts that are prone to air leakage, cheap soft padding can be used to prevent them. In this way, assuming that the effective volume of the cylinder is 5,000 CC and the efficiency is 60%, then one round trip of the piston would have a pressure of 45.6 millimeters of mercury column height, and a vacuum with a volume of 10,000 CC would be provided for application. If 100 CC is required per second, then it can also be used for one and two-thirds minutes. These pressures and these times are enough for the filtration required.

Some factories, when distilling liquids with lower boiling points - such as alcohol, ether, or acetone - are afraid of explosions, so they specifically prepare a water bath and have one person manage the temperature and another person change the hot water. Such distillation not only consumes manpower, but also the temperature is not necessarily stable, because the temperature difference during the exchange of hot water is often between six and seven degrees - Celsius - and can be as high as a dozen degrees. In the author's opinion, it may be possible to steam it over a fire with a water bath. If you are afraid of fire, you can use a safety net with good heat transfer to cover the fire, just like the safety lamps used by coal miners. If the entire condenser is insulated, then the medicines in the receiver, which is a long distance away, can be safely stored without worrying about how easily they explode. In this way, not only can manpower be saved, but also the temperature can be kept stable - because the temperature of the gas lamp can be adjusted.

All of these things, I hope the pharmaceutical factory authorities will improve.

### Navy: Ambition by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang (10)

(Decision is the most important thing...)

Yinmo and the naval seniors in Edo resolutely adopted the British style. Such a decision, after hundreds of years, has had such brilliant achievements, and I am truly grateful, but when I think back to my own current situation, I am really ashamed.

(I have not yet decided to enter the Army Officer School or the Naval Academy.)

Although I have already decided to become a soldier in the future, I have not yet made a concrete decision. In Japan, there is no such thing as just a soldier. It is either a soldier of the anchor or a soldier of the star.

(Okay, I will make a decision today.)

It is no longer an age to waste time. Isn't it written in that book that Saigo also went on an expedition at the age of seventeen?

He returned the book to the librarian, shrugged his shoulders, and left the reading room. He came wearing a uniform and wooden clogs, so he had to change into straw sandals in the shoe cabinet.

"Tani, did you come to the library too?" A friend of the same grade, Ozaki, who was not very close, shouted at the exit.

"Huh! What are you doing there?"

"It's raining, and I didn't bring an umbrella."

Indeed, it was raining heavily outside.

"Then, come under my umbrella!"

Zhenren, who had always been prepared for a rainy day, happened to have brought an umbrella.

The two of them held up the umbrella together, walking through the heavy wind and rain from the front of Terukuni Shrine to the Tenmonkan Road.

"The rain is heavy!" Ozaki was soaked all over, rolling his trousers up to his knees. The water was flowing down his ankles like a squeezed towel.

Zhenren didn't even look at him, walking proudly. In fact, he had forgotten all about the wind and rain.

Nakahara Yusuke was born in Satsuma... Akatsuka, Ito, Nirei, Kawamura, Tsunoyama, Yamamoto, and Togo were all born in Satsuma. He was only thinking about those things.

"Tani...where are you going?" Ozaki walked to the streetcar road on Tenmonkan Road and spoke to Zhenren, who was still walking forward. There was a streetcar there that went directly to where they lived, without having to change streetcars halfway.

Zhenren was unexpectedly reminded, looking around, he saw a sky full of wind and rain. The unique heavy rain of the Satsuma region was sprinkling on the road from the gray-black sky like blooming flowers. The electric wires were being blown by the strong wind, whistling. Everything seemed like the first day of the Satsuma-English War.

"Ozaki, let's go...don't take the streetcar!" Zhenren walked straight across the streetcar road. At that time, it was as if something was starting to ignite in his heart. Ozaki was confused and a little unhappy, following under Zhenren's umbrella.

### Social Service: Establishing Others by Establishing Oneself: Poor Student Donates Money to Help Students

Lianshui Pan, from a poor family, graduated from junior high school and came to Shanghai as an apprentice in a store. He served diligently, and read books in his spare time, without failing for several years. He was greatly valued by the store owner. Pan felt that his knowledge was insufficient, and determined to enroll in night school to study Chinese and bookkeeping in order to further his studies. He listened attentively, and asked questions whenever he had doubts. He was punctual for class, rain or shine. His homework was neatly written, without any errors. His sincerity in studying was very different from his peers. Recently, Pan was worried that the schools would greatly increase tuition fees in the next semester, and he would not be able to afford it. Therefore, he took out 300 yuan of his savings and presented it to the head of the school, requesting that two more free places be added. The head of the school praised his ambition and immediately announced it to wait for applications from poor students. Confucius said: "Wishing to establish oneself, one should also establish others." Pan is indeed a role model. (From Shu)
