### On County Administration

Central politics is a point, provincial politics is a line, and county politics is a surface. If the point and the line are strengthened while the surface is neglected, then the power of the point and the line will not be sufficient to control the surface and make it follow suit. Therefore, we advocate strengthening county politics to the same degree as strengthening central and provincial politics, without neglecting either.

What is the current state of county politics in the peaceful areas? Although it cannot be generally described as "a scene of devastation," and some county administrations may be "passable," the majority are more harmful than beneficial to the people. This established phenomenon is undeniably lamentable at a time when reform is eagerly anticipated. We know that when the National Government returned to its capital, various areas transformed from "war zones" to peaceful areas. After the local war, those who emerged to control local politics during the transitional period were mostly either local tyrants and evil gentry or local ruffians, and their purpose was to take advantage of the chaos and muddy the waters. Those who stood up to maintain order as local political figures were truly rare. At that time, the higher-level governments and even the central government were overwhelmed with countless issues regarding their own organizations and post-war arrangements, and were too busy to attend to county politics. Those who controlled county politics naturally expanded their power and did as they pleased. In the meantime, there were also struggles and infighting between tyrants and ruffians, vying for territory. As a result, the common people suffered the consequences. Those who have lived in the city for a long time may not have personally experienced these events, but those whose ancestral home is in a county within the peaceful areas will surely know the general picture.

Secondly, in various counties north of the Yangtze River, there was the spread of the "New Fourth Army," which used tactics of "small favors" as a tool to win over the people. The people were in dire straits and their minds had barely settled. Seeing these "small favors," they could not help but waver. Moreover, rural farmers are fundamentally uninterested in doctrines and beliefs, only seeking to live and work in peace. Which to dislike and which to follow? The question of choice is quite simple, so the "New Fourth Army" was able to take advantage of the opportunity to spread, and the local situation became increasingly corrupt, and the people's suffering also increased day by day.

However, more than four years have passed since the National Government returned to its capital. Although the central and provincial politics have gradually established a wartime system and are gradually moving towards reform, county politics has not been able to advance in a balanced manner. We believe that if we want to thoroughly reform politics, to truly reform, then we must thoroughly review the past environment of county politics. There is no need to mince words about the ills, nor is there any need to conceal shortcomings. We must honestly study the focus of the troubles, overcome all difficulties, and eliminate obstacles.

The reform of county politics is as important as that of the central and provincial areas, and the reasons for the shortcomings of county politics are as described above. Therefore, we advocate that personnel should be the first priority in reforming county administration, followed by the system. Without adjusting personnel, even if there is an excellent system, it will become a soulless husk. If county administration personnel and systems are sound, then the implementation of central government orders will naturally achieve the effect of fingers and arms. For example, the issue of purchasing military rice will not only not be a problem, but it will also not harm the people.

As the Greater East Asia War gradually approaches the decisive stage, China's position and the tasks it should undertake at this critical moment are undoubtedly extremely important. In other words, the leadership responsibility of the National Government is becoming increasingly important. Recently, the authorities have been planning to reform the central and provincial politics, and there have been concrete manifestations, but we still feel that it is not enough, and that comprehensive reform is necessary, especially county administration reform as the foundation. Today, we will first briefly discuss the importance of county administration and its key problems. As for adjusting personnel and reforming the system, we will discuss them later.

### Comparing the Fierce Attack on Bishenpur, Japanese and Indian Troops Advance Steadily, Fighting Intensifies on the Left Bank of the Mayu River

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain base of the Japanese army on the Indo-Burmese front: The offensive launched by the Japanese and Indian allied forces against Bishenpur has become increasingly strengthened with the reinforcement of new troops. The enemy forces in that area, numbering more than 20,000, are making use of the surrounding terrain to construct fortifications and are making a desperate defense day after day with all their tanks, heavy artillery, and aircraft. The Japanese and Indian allied forces are advancing steadily day and night. Among them, the Japanese army that advanced from Meilang to the highway leading to Bishenpur encountered enemy forces coming from the vicinity of Kegeiman (five kilometers south of Bishenpur) north of Bausam on the afternoon of the 10th at about 8:00 pm. They engaged each other at close range. That night, they used tank guns to destroy two enemy P22 tanks, setting them on fire. They also launched a close-quarters combat attack on enemy tanks that invaded from the northeast, immobilizing them and achieving remarkable results.

Rangoon, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army on the Indo-Burmese border front has intensified its annihilation campaign against the British-West African Army's 81st Division's 6th Brigade, which is moving in the area on the left bank of the Mayu River, since the 10th. A strong Japanese force that began operations near Tawondan Kethia (five miles north of Thabulgon) defeated the enemy forces in that area and occupied the enemy stronghold of Qinla south of Tawondan Kethia on the night of the 10th, and is still continuing its operations. In addition, the Japanese army, which pursued the defeated enemy in the Jintan area, occupied Jin Kian Kethia (three kilometers north of Jintan) on the 12th, and is coordinating with the Japanese army that advanced to the vicinity of Bin Kian and Bin La to attack a certain place. The enemy forces, having lost air supply since the 10th, are fleeing in disarray. The elite Japanese troops, who had completed the encirclement circle half a month ago, are cutting off the enemy's retreat and annihilating them in one fell swoop, and are advancing into the dense forest area.

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from Conti, the Southeast Asia Military Headquarters announced on the 14th that the Japanese army had again begun attacking the vital hills southeast of Ba Lieer.

### Announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters: Results of the Bombing of Suichuan, Seven Enemy Fighters Shot Down

The results achieved are as follows: Seven fighter planes shot down (three unconfirmed), more than twelve large planes destroyed and damaged, and twenty-six small planes, totaling more than forty-five planes. The Japanese side lost five planes that exploded and did not return.

Xiamen, 15th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese Air Force bomber squadron attacked the enemy airfields of Yushan and Jian'ou on the morning of the 14th, carrying out repeated bombings despite the enemy's fierce artillery fire, destroying their runways and other military facilities.

The Japanese fighter squadron engaged them and shot down two B45 planes and destroyed two P40 planes, causing them to flee in disarray. The Japanese planes returned safely to base.

### Burmese Investigation Team Visits Meiji Shrine

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - Dr. Ba Heng, head of the Burmese Special Investigation Team, and his entourage visited the Meiji Shrine and Yasukuni Shrine on the morning of the 15th.

### Manchukuo Implements Emergency Coal Production Increase

Xinjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - Although coal production in Manchukuo last year showed a declining trend in the first half of the year, after the summer production increase campaign was launched in July and August, all the summer production reduction was made up for. The increase in coal output, calculated by month, has achieved good results compared to the past three years. By September, due to unfavorable natural conditions, mining was not possible, or due to insufficient workers, etc., the output temporarily decreased. Even with the summer production increase performance, the set target could not be reached. As a result, the first half ended up being generally sluggish, and the increase in production in the second half was still difficult due to the delay of labor. Therefore, the Manchukuo government convened a full Manchukuo coal mine director meeting in mid-December and issued an emergency production increase order, stipulating that from December onwards, one month would be used for the winter coal emergency production increase. A large-scale production increase movement was launched during the increased delivery period, and winter coal mine encouragement teams were dispatched to provide encouragement. At the same time, countermeasures such as providing essential living materials were discussed. As a result, the period yielded amazing results, and future development is even more anticipated.

### Philippines Service Corps Reorganized, Aquino Appointed Vice President

Manila, 15th (Central News Agency) - President Laurel, in order to make the Philippine Service Corps shoulder the important mission of one country and one party, transforming it from a purely spiritual organization into a political party to promote Philippine politics, had previously begun reorganizing the organization of the corps. On the 15th, the President specially appointed former special envoy to the United States and Speaker of the Philippine Congress, Aquino, as Vice President and Secretary-General of the Service Corps. The former Vice President of the Corps, Osias, will now serve exclusively as the Minister of Education. According to reports, Vice President Aquino, since the birth of the Philippine Service Corps, has transferred from Minister of the Interior to Vice President of the Corps, guiding the spiritual movement of the Philippines during the most difficult period and building the foundation of the corps today. Therefore, Aquino is truly the "nanny" of the corps. Now that Aquino has returned to his old post and re-assumed the post of Vice President of the Corps, with his East Asian political thought and operational skills, his future achievements can be definitively evaluated. The Philippine Service Corps is the core of Philippine politics. This time, Aquino's assumption of his new position is the most appropriate. In addition, the new Minister of Education, Mr. Osias, who previously visited Japan and Manchukuo as a delegation, and Mr. Aquino, who assumed important positions, are further strengthening the Philippine government.

Vargas Returns Home to Report on His Duties

Manila, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Philippine Ambassador to Japan, Vargas, returned to the country to report on his duties, arriving in Manila at 2:30 pm on the 15th with his daughter. Philippine Finance Minister Aralas accompanied him. Mr. Aralas had previously accompanied Special Envoy Aquino to Japan. After Ambassador Aquino returned to the country, he continued to negotiate important matters with the relevant Japanese authorities.

### Defeat of the Chongqing Army in Henan, Britain and the United States Unable to Provide Assistance, British Critic Discusses the Kuomintang-Communist Problem

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - The disastrous defeat of the Chongqing army in Henan has given the greatest stimulus to the "rethinking of Chongqing" recently advocated by British and American commentators. On the 12th, the New York Times published an article entitled "Distressed Chongqing," specifically discussing the matter, saying that given the current situation, full-scale aid to Chiang Kai-shek is impossible. The gist is as follows: The Chongqing government is using the situation in Henan as a reason to request aid from Britain and the United States, and we are, of course, essential to aid Chongqing, but given the current situation, aid must be extremely limited. The Chongqing government currently has no other option but to resist on its own. To conduct self-reliant resistance, the first thing is to resolve the struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. This is an effective way, so I would like to faithfully advise Chongqing to stop the resistance before the end of the war. The British military commentator Roel Unca also discussed the Kuomintang-Communist problem as follows: The Chongqing army's blockade of the Communist army has weakened its own resistance. The Chongqing army's failure to increase its resistance force is evident from the situation on the Yunnan border. The 500,000 troops in Yunnan Province are standing by and watching the Stilwell army's operations in Burma, without providing assistance. At a time when the Burma Road cannot be reopened, and it is impossible to supply Chongqing, even though the Chongqing army is crying out for aid from the United States and Britain, it is not cooperating with the American and British forces to reopen the Burma Road.

Local People Cooperate with the Japanese Army

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The large scale and skillful operation of the Japanese army's offensive in the Henan Plain has added another landmark page to the history of war. The mainland theater has always seemed to be limited to the scope of the Sino-Japanese Incident, but now the Japanese army on the mainland is clearly recognizing who are East Asian compatriots and rising up to strike down Britain and the United States. At present, the Tang Enbo army is only a group loyal to Chongqing, but the real enemy is Britain and the United States. Under this determination, the Japanese army is planning to launch an offensive in the Henan Plain. At this time, thinking about the fate of China, Chongqing should also wake up to its past mistakes and deeply examine the new situation after seven years of resistance. Although Chongqing advised the people of the townships and villages along the Beijing-Hankou Railway to evacuate, they have not yet agreed. The Japanese army has extremely strict discipline, and the local people are willing to cooperate with the Japanese army. After the Japanese army occupied the area, the local people's autonomous self-defense organizations smoothly promoted all matters with local influential people as the center. No friction occurred with the Japanese army. The Japanese army not only did not despise the people, but also gave them all kinds of preferential treatment. Therefore, the general people scrambled to cooperate closely with the Japanese army. This can be said to be the biggest gain of this operation. The Japanese army's ability to sweep through the minds of the Chinese people in this operation is exactly the same as the situation of liberating the original residents in the southern theater. This operation is not destruction, but construction; it is not rejection, but support. If these facts are compared with the current chaotic situation in Chongqing, it is not difficult to know that the military authorities in Chongqing did not understand the intentions of the Japanese army in this operation, and only acted based on speculation. Due to the chaotic command system, Tang Enbo's eight divisions and twenty-three divisions were completely wiped out. In the Republic of China Year _, the Yellow River was breached by Chongqing, causing repeated pain and suffering to the people. Although Chongqing seems to have forgotten all these facts, the general people always remember them in their hearts. The Yellow River construction plan will soon be implemented with the cooperation of the Japanese army, and the general people are very happy. In the future, they will surely work together with the Japanese army to complete this great undertaking.

### Enemy Planes Attacking Rabaul Shot Down Twenty, Japanese Planes Bomb Enemy Positions in Hollandia

### Japan Strengthens Domestic System, Each Region Implements Key Policies to Maximize Comprehensive Strength

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - In order to support long-term operations and strengthen the domestic system, the nine regions of Japan, including "Hokkaido," "Tohoku," "Kanto," "Tokai," "Hokuriku," "Kinki," "Chugoku," "Shikoku," and "Kyushu," each have an organization called the Regional Administrative Council, which has held repeated meetings and convened a central conference. Specific policy guidelines have been officially decided and are being gradually promoted and implemented in each region, based on its specific characteristics and with the powers delegated by the central government. The strategy to strengthen the domestic system is to maximize comprehensive strength, smoothly promote secondary warfare policies, perfect air defense and other measures that directly affect the execution of the war, increase production, and enhance the military strength of the land, sea, and air forces. In short, it is to unite the 100 million people of the country in sincerity to complete the war. Looking at each region separately, the Hokkaido and Tohoku regions are focused on increasing agricultural production. The Kanto region (including Tokyo) is focused on strengthening production in all sectors of agriculture, industry, and commerce. The Hokuriku region, because it is an important port, places emphasis on maritime transport and increasing agricultural production. The Kinki region, with Osaka and Kobe as its centers, places emphasis on expanding the munitions industry. The Chugoku and Shikoku regions place emphasis on strengthening maritime transport. Kyushu places emphasis on mining and iron production. They all bear great responsibilities.

### All Measures Impeding Shipping are Cancelled by Order of the Executive Yuan, and Subordinates are Instructed to Prevent Various Illegal Smuggling Activities

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - Since the implementation of the General Regulations for the Control of Navigation of Ships in the Central China region, they have had a significant effect on the overall navigation and operation of ships. Now, in order to further establish a wartime system, improve navigation, and streamline transportation, our government has discussed and revised them with the relevant allied authorities. They will be implemented from the 15th of this month. Deputy President Zhou of the Executive Yuan issued a statement yesterday, elucidating the main points of the revision. The Executive Yuan has now issued a general order to the provincial and municipal governments under its jurisdiction, the Ministry of Construction, and requested the Military Affairs Committee to take note, and instructed its subordinates to abide by it. It is clearly stipulated that all measures that impede navigation, such as various taxes that have not been approved, should be cancelled immediately, and strict measures should be taken at any time to crack down on them. At the same time, all illegal smuggling activities and various navigation activities that hinder public order, which are not in accordance with legal regulations, should still be vigorously prevented and strictly punished in accordance with the law.

### Students at the Chongqing Air Force Training School Dissatisfied with American Instructors, Relationship Between Instructors and Students is Like Ice and Charcoal

Central News Agency Report - In order to replenish its military strength, the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing has specially established air force training schools in Kunming and Guilin, specializing in recruiting people from Chongqing, ostensibly for training, but in reality only to make sacrifices. According to a person who recently arrived from the mainland, the contents of the training schools established by the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing are described in detail. Moreover, the students inside are dissatisfied with the American instructors, and the relationship between the two sides is like ice and charcoal. It has been found that the person in charge of the training school is Chinode, who is responsible for the 14th Air Force Unit of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing. It was first established in Kunming in September last year, and in Guilin in December of the same year. The person pointed out the reasons for the students' dissatisfaction with the instructors, including five points: 1. The American instructors' attitude towards the students from Chongqing is very arrogant and exceptionally dismissive. 2. The training standards are relatively high and not suitable for the level of the students from Chongqing. 3. The training is too strict, and injuries often occur during training, even fatal falls. 4. The first phase of training is scheduled for six weeks, and after the end, the second phase continues to receive training, including various driving training techniques. However, due to the lack of gasoline, no new training has been given so far. At the same time, most of the trainees are from Guangdong and Guangxi, and they have a deep sense of their hometown and are particularly narrow-minded. Once they feel dissatisfied, the instructors' daily life is too extravagant, and their daily life and actions are particularly mysterious, with no communication with the outside world, and they secretly set up clubs in Guilin, prohibiting Chinese from participating and even strictly prohibiting students from entering. The club in Kunming is smaller, like a coffee room. The students at the school are also dissatisfied with the establishment of such clubs. It is said that the American instructors, seeing the poor relationship with the students, asked Chongqing to strictly prohibit students from this type of behavior. As a result, Chongqing granted the Americans the right to shoot and kill anyone who violated orders and broke the rules, regardless of whether they were guilty or not. After the school obtained this permission, it was announced to the students. This shows the Americans' oppression of the Chinese people and the collusion between Chongqing and the enemy Americans, which is hateful.

### Chongqing's US Currency Exchange Rate Rises Daily

Central News Agency Report - According to recent information arriving from the area, the exchange rate of US currency in the Chongqing area is rising daily. Chongqing is currently seeking countermeasures, but the effectiveness is still questionable. As early as March of this year, after Kong Xiangxi inspected various places in Kunming, he stated at a meeting with reporters that he would eradicate the black market trading of foreign paper currency. However, the black market for US currency is still skyrocketing. According to the official exchange rate, one US dollar is exchanged for 20 yuan, but the current black market rate has soared to 230 yuan. The excessive issuance of legal currency is also very alarming. The amount of legal currency issued was 3.062 billion yuan in December 1940, approximately 21 billion to 28 billion yuan in 1942, 54 billion yuan in April 1943, approximately 70 billion yuan last year, and is now estimated to reach 100 billion yuan. This excessive issuance of legal currency has caused the prices of coal, rice, and other commodities to be approximately 600 times that of last year, matches to be 600 times that of before the war, cotton cloth to be 340 times, and edible oil to soar to 170 times. Foreigners in Chongqing are also greatly affected by the rising prices. Recently, foreign reporters have often cried out that their lives are threatened. Items that can be purchased for one US dollar in the United States require 250 yuan in legal currency in the Chongqing area. The Guangxi Daily in Guilin recently published an article entitled "The Problem of the Foreign Goods Circulation Market," discussing the adverse effects of the inflow of US currency as follows: The current foreigners are as fierce as tigers, and the prices of goods everywhere are completely monopolized. At the end of last year, the black market rate for US currency was 1 to 80, two months later it was 1 to 160 yuan, and now it is 1 to 220 or 230 yuan, and it continues to rise. The black market for US currency only makes the legal currency continue to fall. The inflow of US currency makes China permanently stand in the position of a colony. Regarding this issue, the Hunan Daily also discussed as follows: The new livers under Chongqing's rule are most hopeful of being employed in American-related organizations, that is, working as compradors. For example, a person who writes steel plates in an American-related organization can also earn 100 US dollars per month. If exchanged at the black market rate, this can be 23,000 yuan, which is more than that of a specially appointed official in Chongqing. The management of the currency system is not directly under the central government, and should not be handled by unscrupulous merchants. The government has a responsibility, and the Americans must also be responsible. The constant inflow of US currency is making the Chongqing economy more chaotic, and there is no possibility of revenue.

### North China Organization: Food Corporation

Peiping, 15th (Central News Agency) – In order to smoothly promote the food policy, the North China Political Affairs Commission previously decided to establish a comprehensive control organization for food.

The capital of the Central Food Corporation is 100 million yuan. At the same time, in order to raise and manage funds, it may issue food bonds. In addition, local food corporations will be established in various provinces of North China and in Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places, each with a capital of 10 million yuan.

### Axis Allies in Southeastern Europe Monitor the Transition of the War Situation; Determined to Fight to the End Hand in Hand with Germany

Budapest, 15th (Central News Agency) – Regarding the war in Italy, after the anti-Axis forces launched a counteroffensive on the night of the 11th, the German army immediately prepared for attack. The countries of the Balkans also believe that this may be the prelude to the Anglo-American landing operation and are paying close attention to its development. Regarding the Anglo-American attempt to wage war in Southeastern Europe, many rumors are circulating in Turkey following the meeting between Stalin and Eden. The rumors are based on the following points: 1. The movement of Anglo-American naval forces in the eastern Mediterranean; 2. The repeated Anglo-American bombing of various parts of Southeastern Europe; 3. The increased Anglo-American aid to Tito's (Yugoslav guerrilla leader) forces; and the visits to London by Tito's military envoys and Mark, the head of the American delegation to Tito. In particular, the United States has recently sent a military mission to Tito's headquarters. Since the German army withdrew from Sevastopol, various rumors have also arisen regarding the Soviet army's Black Sea operations. The Soviet army's large-scale war preparations have not yet been completed, and the German army has also reinforced with fresh troops to prepare for the Soviet offensive. Furthermore, the German army launched a large-scale offensive against Tito's forces, which are cooperating with the Anglo-American landing operation, in early May, surrounding the bandits in the Bosnia region. The mop-up operation is continuing, and Tito's army's advance to the Adriatic coast has been blocked, and its strength is gradually weakening. Currently, the Albanian government is also closely cooperating with the German army, organizing a security force to assist the German army in guarding the straits. Therefore, a landing in Eastern Europe is by no means a simple matter. Moreover, although the governments of Southeastern European countries are subject to all kinds of schemes and strange bombings by the anti-Axis forces, they are still willing to closely cooperate with the German army in life and death. If the Anglo-Americans attempt to land, they will certainly be able to launch an offensive and defensive war together with the German army.

German Leader Hitler Calls for National Attention

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – Judging from the exhortation issued by Alexander to all officers and soldiers, it is known that the great counteroffensive on the southern Italian front seems about to begin. Since this offensive is the first step in attacking Europe, it has attracted worldwide attention. The German leader's headquarters explained that the anti-Axis bombing of German-occupied territories is considered a "preparation for a landing operation," in order to call for national attention. Since the beginning of Easter in early May, the German authorities have confirmed that the bombing in the western part of the country is a strategic bombing, which further proves the urgency of the war situation. However, the Atlantic Wall, which the German army spent four years completing, cannot be destroyed and eliminated by bombing alone.

### Hungarian Army Holds Firm in Dangerous Terrain

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – On the Carpathian front, a regiment of the Red Army attacked Kuty several times but was repelled. South and north of the Deladyn-Kolomear railway line, the Hungarian and Soviet armies attacked each other in rotation until the Hungarian army finally extended its position to a strategically important mountain range, then held firm in this improved position and repelled the fierce Soviet counteroffensive.

### Crimean Forces Complete Retreat

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) – The retreat of the last German troops from Crimea to the mainland can be regarded as a great success for the German shipping and air transport units. Moreover, the German tonnage of ships in the Black Sea is extremely small, while the power of the Soviet Navy remains formidable. The withdrawal of German war materials and civilians began in April, and the Soviet Black Sea Fleet and Air Force have so far failed to seriously obstruct it.

### Switzerland Determined to Maintain Neutrality by Force

Zurich, 15th (Central News Agency) – The Swiss Federal Minister of Justice and Police, Stager, said yesterday that the question for us today is not which side to help fight, but our only goal is to maintain neutrality by force. Every citizen should be prepared to defend the country and strictly maintain neutrality, which is the duty of free citizens.

### Prelude to the Great European War: Intensified Fighting in Southern Italy; German Resistance in the Cassino Area is Strong

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – Three days have passed since the anti-Axis forces launched a new offensive in the Italian theater. Except for the Tyrrhenian coast, where the enemy deployed a force of ten divisions, the situation in other places such as Naturno, although also fierce, is not of a local nature. Moreover, the German army is resisting strongly, and there is no progress. At the moment, the air forces of both sides are extremely active, and naval exchanges are also frequent, serving as an ominous sign that a major war is about to break out.

Berlin, 15th (German News Agency) – According to German news agencies, the fighting between the Tyrrhenian coast and Cassino has reached an extreme level. General Alexander is now launching a large-scale offensive with the US Fifth Army and the British Eighth Army, totaling about ten divisions, in an attempt to advance towards the main German positions. The German army is now forcing the main forces of the Anglo-American coalition into a war of attrition according to a pre-determined plan. German resistance is even more intense in the Tyrrhenian coastal area, which extends from the Minturno highway to Castelforte.

Berlin, 15th (German News Agency) – According to German authorities, the anti-Axis forces in southern Italy resumed their offensive yesterday with maximum strength. After fierce fighting, the enemy lost 50 tanks in just one location south of Cassino. Most of the German troops moved west a few kilometers and retreated to pre-arranged positions.

### The India-Burma Supply Route Under Japanese Threat

The Japanese army's suppression of the Imphal Plain has completely closed off the Anglo-American counteroffensive on the East Asian mainland front. The Anglo-American attempts to first, re-invade Burma and gradually shift the main battlefield to China, and second, to establish a supply line in a corner of northern Burma and launch an offensive in China in the shortest possible time, have all been shattered.

First, the re-invasion of Burma has been weakly thwarted. Looking at the second point, the enemy is recently eager to open the new India-Burma Road, which runs from Ledo in northeastern Assam, India, through Burma, and to strengthen the air route from Tinsukia over the Himalayas. This undoubtedly indicates that the Assam region plays an extremely important role in supplementing the Chinese front. Moreover, the largest enemy supply zone on the East Asian mainland is Bengal, south of Assam, and its central base is Calcutta. This supply zone and northeastern Assam are connected by the following four communication lines along the Assam Valley:

Railway

One branch line of the Eastern Indian Railway, which starts in Calcutta, runs eastward from Bihar and connects Assam on the south bank of the Brahmaputra. A branch line of the Bengal Railway connects this branch line in Lumding, running north from Chittagong to Tinsukia, and connects the Saikhoa-Dibrugarh railway in Tinsukia. Dibrugarh is the largest river port on the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra, and Ledo is at the end of this railway branch line. Since March 1, the US Army Railway Technical Corps has been repairing 750 miles of railway and two branch lines between Katihar in Bihar and Dibrugarh. Major General Wilson, the corps commander, has also taken over the port operations in Calcutta. From these facts, the focus of railway transportation in northeastern Assam is on the line starting from Calcutta and heading north, running parallel to the Brahmaputra.

Waterways

Assam's waterways rely on the Brahmaputra and Surma rivers. Currently, the Brahmaputra is noteworthy for its supply transport. Inland steamers frequently travel between Dibrugarh in the upper reaches and Goalundo, where it intersects the Ganges River in the lower reaches, and large steamers can navigate to Goalundo. Therefore, this river naturally forms an important route for supply transport, just like the Irrawaddy River in Burma before the war. The reason why Calcutta Port and Dibrugarh Port in the upper reaches are both managed by the US military lies in this.

Roads

In addition to the strategic roads that have been rapidly opened near the India-Burma border, the highway centered on Shillong, the state capital of the central hilly area, extends westward. Of note are the two highways along the north and south banks of the Brahmaputra.

Air Routes

From the Calcutta airport, passing through the Surma Valley and the central hilly area, and flying over the northeastern part of the Assam Valley, reaching the Dibrugarh airport.

Among the four routes above, the railway, waterway, and highway all run parallel to the southern edge of the Himalayas, very close to Manipur. Kohima, which was occupied by the Japanese army on April 6, is only 50 kilometers from the railway and 120 kilometers from the Brahmaputra River. The Japanese army's advance towards the Brahmaputra Valley after occupying Kohima posed a direct threat to the enemy. As for the air route, as long as the many airports in Manipur, east of Assam, are occupied by the Japanese army, it will naturally be under the threat of the Japanese air force given their geographical relationship. The Anglo-Americans have no other international routes to connect with China besides this, and there is no possibility of discovering other routes in the best of times. The materials needed for China's counteroffensive must all pass through this area. The Assam Valley area can be said to be the strategic bottleneck on the anti-Axis forces' East Asian mainland front. In response, the Japanese army in northern Burma has launched fierce attacks from both the air and land. The trend is that the aforementioned supply centers and midway bases will soon be destroyed, causing the enemy to be anxious. (Translation by Xiang from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, April 26th)

### Emphasis and Neglect

— Li Yunzhan

After Reading "A Message to University Graduates"

After reading the May 11th editorial "A Message to University Graduates," I couldn't help but feel lost. Although the mentioned three stages of dealing with the world – "respect," "resentment," and "persuasion" – are nothing more than clichés, the words are clear and the meaning is earnest. At the beginning of life's journey, which is full of darkness and thorns, receiving such good advice can be considered a blessing for this year's graduates. It further proves that society has not forgotten young students who are about to complete higher education. I am currently studying electrical engineering at a national university. Before graduating, I feel immensely ashamed and surprised to receive such respect. Therefore, I dare to share my experiences from the past two years.

Without mincing words, each year, a batch of university graduates enters society, but the results achieved are not directly proportional to the efforts put in. Is this the main reason why university students are looked down upon? What does society value now? That is the question. I remember in my second year of high school, a classmate, Mr. Shi, failed too many subjects to be promoted. As a result, he transferred to a university with equivalent qualifications to study economics. Now, almost two years after graduation, besides being a manager at a bank and an insurance company, he has also become the head of a certain enterprise. Strangely, he seems to have a lot of free time for dancing, mahjong, opera, and speaking in a Beijing accent, which are almost daily activities. Two weeks ago, at his engagement banquet, everyone praised him for being young, handsome, and talented! He has won the praise and favor of society, and the university he attended has gained some glory from this rising star. But I wonder, which part of him does society respect? His character? His talent? His knowledge? Continuing my train of thought, I subconsciously concluded that "money is omnipotent." These four words encompass the entire philosophy of life. Money is what people eat, and it is what society values. But I dare say that these past three years of burning the midnight oil have only taught me how to work, not how to create a money-making machine. Moreover, the deeper the education received, the weaker the desire for money, the less willing one is to seek opportunities to get rich, and the more isolated one becomes from social realities. If society's perspective does not change, I will not seek society's respect through petty gains. Furthermore, I would rather be suffocated to death by society's neglect than follow the crowd and become a money-grubbing lackey in order to gain respect.

In this era, the bankruptcy of the education system is shocking. Before the war, professors taught more than ten hours a week and earned four to five hundred yuan a month, which allowed them to live comfortably. Therefore, they could sit in the laboratory or library and discuss diligently with students. Now, the situation has changed. Professors with connections invest in business and treat teaching as a side job. Those without connections teach up to fifty hours a week, running around and panting for breath under the whip of life. How much time do they have to prepare for tomorrow's teaching materials, let alone further study and discussion? Decades ago, they were also university graduates, or even spent tens of thousands of yuan and two or three years of effort to obtain a doctorate degree. But what does this empty skill get them? As the saying goes, "A scarecrow dies of fear, and his wife starves to death." The year-end cries of hunger and the winter roars of cold are a true depiction. Although enlightened people in society have repeatedly called for improving the treatment of teachers, this kind of pitying sympathy has not restored the lost dignity of professors, nor has it inspired the public's interest. Improving treatment is still a pending issue. I remember one day, while chatting with a certain gentleman about recent events, he deeply regretted not using the money spent on his education to buy gold and store it until now. He would have no problem with food and clothing, and if he played his cards right, it would not be impossible to have a constant stream of guests and a never-empty wine cup. Alas! If the way of teachers is like this, then the status of students need not be asked, it is unbearable to ask.

Speaking of the state of education at universities and the level of graduates, I dare not make a definitive judgment. Because when comparing schools, there are different levels of strictness; when comparing students, there is even more uneven quality. But although it is difficult to draw a conclusion on the specific situation, the lack of interest in learning and the neglect of moral cultivation are facts. Originally, we had large school buildings, beautiful libraries, perfect laboratories, and vast sports fields, all of which were intoxicating and memorable. As a result, someone pulled strings and rented a house to barely start classes. Besides the fixed gatherings and dispersals, discussions, research, reference, consultation, meetings, and gatherings have all become terms of the past. Every day, they slave away over books, gaining some poorly understood dead knowledge. How can this kind of life not be boring? In Shanghai, there is definitely more than one school like this. The classmates I know are willing to listen to the professor's guidance and make a living from dead books; if there are classmates who do not even bother with books, then what will they gain from their four years of university education? Furthermore, concerning the issue of career prospects, among last year's graduates, only two were assigned to suitable positions. The rest were either teachers or clerks, working in positions unrelated to their studies. The country spent a lot of money to cultivate specialized talents, but in the end, they cannot be utilized, which is a pity. Thinking back to the time before the war, when graduation was approaching, there were sixty or seventy positions waiting to be chosen by thirty graduates, which is disheartening. Society despises university students, and the country abandons university students. Is this the fault of the university students?

Unable to bear the injustice, I cannot help but speak out. I forgot the three essential aspects of dealing with the world: "respect, resentment, and persuasion." In short, society despises us, and we despise society. That is an established fact. The work ahead is not to blindly seek society's respect, but to muster all our energy to analyze whether things are good or evil, so that the society we participate in will no longer be despised by the next generation of graduates. Only then can university graduates be truly respected, and meaningfully respected.

### Minister Matsudaira Expresses His Thoughts

Regarding traffic on this route in the Taichung area, the authorities in Chongqing consulted with the Allied land and naval authorities. With their utmost sincerity and assistance, the general regulations for ship navigation in Central China have been revised and officially implemented yesterday (the 15th). As a result, ships on the Yangtze River and inland rivers can now navigate freely. This will make the transportation and exchange of materials in various parts of Central China smoother. Minister Matsudaira of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy in China's Shanghai Office expressed two points of gratitude to the Chinese press corps at a regular press conference at 3 PM yesterday regarding the free navigation of waterways in Central China: 1. Strengthening the exchange of materials will further stabilize people's livelihoods. In the future, the transportation of food, flour, agricultural products, and other essential goods will be free and unobstructed. 2. The exchange of materials in various parts of Central China will become more balanced, which will greatly benefit people's livelihoods.

### Vice Minister Guo Receives Reporters and Discusses His Impressions of His Visit to Japan: What He Saw and Heard Left a Deep Impression

Guo Feng, Vice Minister of the Department of Propaganda of the National Government and President of the Central Telegraph Agency, returned after completing his visit to Japan. Yesterday (the 15th) at 2 PM, he held a tea party on the ninth floor of the hotel to receive more than fifty reporters from various newspapers in the city, as well as from the Allied News Agency, Haitong News Agency, and the Chinese News Agency. Vice Minister Guo, accompanied by Deputy President Hu of the Central Telegraph Agency, Director of the Telegraph Department Zhang Zhaoming, and Director of the Shanghai Branch He Baoheng, warmly greeted the guests. First, Director He Baoheng of the Shanghai Branch delivered an introductory speech, followed by Vice Minister Guo's speech about his impressions of his visit to Japan. He also introduced Deputy President Hu of the Central Telegraph Agency to the newspaper reporters and answered various questions raised by the reporters. Afterwards, tea and snacks were served, and the event ended at 4 PM. The content of Mr. Guo's speech is recorded as follows:

I was invited by Mr. Furuno, President of the Allied News Agency, and set off for Japan on the 4th of this month. I arrived in Tokyo on the 7th and stayed for four days. During my stay in Japan, I was warmly received by the Allied News Agency and relevant authorities, which I am deeply grateful for. What I saw and heard left a particularly deep impression on me, which can be summarized as follows:

The Allied People's Belief is Firm

The Allied people's unwavering faith in maintaining the strength of the divine and their determination to win is something that the enemy cannot imagine. When I was traveling east from Fukuoka by train, I looked out the window and saw the Allied people, regardless of gender or age, faithfully performing their duties. All aspects of social order were well-organized. Seeing this, it was just like normal times, but the enthusiasm of their emotions, the seriousness of their attitude, and the development of their work were far beyond what they were like in peacetime. It is evident that the Allied people have full determination to complete the war.

Production Capacity is Increasing

The Allied military and civilian production capacity has been increasing with the development of the war. At this crucial stage of the decisive battle, based on general imagination and enemy propaganda, it is often thought that the Allied people's lives may be experiencing considerable difficulties. However, the reality is the opposite. The Allied countries have implemented a rationing system with thorough controls. The daily necessities of the people are fully supplied according to their needs, and their lives are very comfortable.

The Future of East Asia is Full of Light

Since the Allied countries implemented the new policy towards China and revised the treaties, they have been actively assisting our country in completing its independence and liberation. This policy was decided by the cabinet and has become the highest principle of Sino-Japanese relations, which will not change. What the Allied countries hope from China is that, based on the position of East Asians, we will cooperate in the war and achieve independence and liberation as soon as possible. Beyond that, there is nothing else they seek. Their earnest expectations are evident in their words. As for the Chongqing government abandoning the East Asian position and willingly acting as a henchman for Britain and the United States, we cannot help but feel hatred and deep regret. My visit to Japan was very short, and what I saw was limited, but the impressions I gained were very deep. I deeply admired the Allied countries' various wartime measures. I believe that with the Allied people's spirit of decisive battle and our daily cooperation, we will surely win the war, and the future of East Asia is full of unlimited light.

### City Public Bonds: Redemption Lottery Held Yesterday

The Shanghai Special City Public Bond redemption lottery was held for the second time at 10 AM yesterday on the fifth floor of the Banking Association.

The five winning numbers drawn were 10, 22, 25, 53, and 78. The total amount of principal and interest to be paid in this period is 785,000 yuan. It is scheduled to be paid by the Central Reserve Bank or the Fuxing Bank starting at the end of this month.

### Police Consumer Cooperative: Promoting Cooperative Affairs

Since the establishment of the First Police Bureau Police Consumer Cooperative in this city, it has received assistance from various sectors in terms of funding, reaching more than 20 million yuan. The cooperative affairs are being actively promoted by specialists assigned by the bureau. They have now begun to conduct surveys of cooperative members' families, printing forms that have been distributed to all police officers, who are required to fill them out truthfully within a specified period for review. This is to accurately calculate the number of dependents, so that the evaluation, purchase, and distribution of daily necessities can be carried out as soon as possible, improving the lives of police officers and promoting the efficiency of police work.

### Report on Donations to Subsidize Teachers and Staff

Mr. Bao Guochang donated 20,000 yuan. President of the Shenzhong Foreign Hospital, Tang Xinghai, Chi Xijia, Huang Zhendong, Yang Runlin, Yang Huazhai (jointly), Huang Yuyi, Ding Fangyuan, all teachers and staff of the private Yanghua Elementary School, Shao Baosheng, Rong Hongyuan, and Rong Hongsan (jointly) each donated 12,000 yuan.

### Assisting Impoverished Mothers: Launching an Obstetric Aid Movement; Hoping for Generous Donations from Enthusiastic Individuals

Given the current high cost of living, most poor women cannot afford proper and reasonable midwifery when they are about to give birth. This often leads to dangers for both the mother and the child, which has a significant impact on national fertility. Therefore, we are launching a movement to assist impoverished mothers. Poor pregnant women can apply for registration with our office one month before their due date. If the investigation confirms their eligibility, approval will be granted. If it is a normal delivery, a midwife doctor will be sent to the mother's home to assist with the delivery, with the expenses borne by our office. If there are complications during delivery, hospitalization will be approved, and the hospitalization and medical expenses will be borne by our office. At the same time, the midwife doctor will provide guidance on the mother's pre- and post-natal hygiene, as well as infant care. We have also contacted various hospitals, who have agreed to cooperate.

This initiative is not only charitable in nature but also related to the nation and the people. We earnestly hope that enthusiastic individuals in society will generously donate to support this cause.

### Navy

— By Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang

A major doubt, like a painting, unfolded on Ryufo's mind.

Paintings depicting the North China and Shanghai battlefields filled the exhibition, all of which were works in keeping with the times, but Ryufo was unmoved.

(That way of painting is no good.)

Although he thought so, he would get angry when he saw someone nearby painting works like a large plate filled with fruit.

(This way of painting is also no good.)

When the invincible Imperial Japanese Army began its offensive in Guangdong, and the term "new system" began to enter the ears of the people, Ryufo, who was young and easily impulsive, could not remain unmoved.

So he didn't know what was good to paint. He was simply very dissatisfied with himself and the surrounding situation.

(What exactly is painting? What is art?)

When he thought of this, he didn't want to submit anything to the Art Exhibition.

Thus, on top of his accumulated frustration, he added fundamental doubt. So-called new sorrows and old hatreds intertwined.

(Perhaps my motivation for wanting to be a painter is wrong.)

All painters became painters because they liked painting. Ryufo certainly didn't dislike painting, but the thought of becoming a painter never occurred to him until after he failed the military academy entrance exams twice.

(I wanted to rebel against the "Navy," that's why I wanted to become a painter.)

Associating this motive, he came to think that he was too close to self-abandonment. At least it could be said that it was clearly not out of a love for beauty that he became a painter.

(The motive is impure. That's why I'm being punished now.) He explained it to himself this way.

Thus, everything sank deeply into the abyss of despair. He realized that his future as a painter and the desperate efforts he had made since coming to Beijing had all been in vain. All the face and hope had been discarded like worn-out shoes.

(Makoto is truly enviable!)

He had never envied Makoto as much as he had lately. He knew as accurately as if it were his own affair that Makoto was about to graduate in a year. Because it was Makoto's affair, he encouraged Makoto's life at Etajima in his heart. He was waiting for Makoto to obtain the glorious rank of naval officer soon. In contrast, he had become a failure. A twenty-year-old failure, how regrettable!
