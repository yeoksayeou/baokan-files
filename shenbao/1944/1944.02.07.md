### Suppressing Stock Speculation

"The current widespread phenomenon of stock speculation is all caused by ordinary 'industrial companies'. Clever people, with keen insight, put up the signboard of an 'industrial company.' In the board of directors, they arrange the big names of 'industrialists,' flaunt astonishing amounts of capital to the public, boast and exaggerate, fabricate news of hidden profits, and take advantage of the public's unwillingness to sit idly by as the value of their money gradually diminishes. They rush to buy and sell stocks, running around the speculative market, and as a result, extract the hard-earned money of the people."

"Currently, most 'industrial companies' have a huge discrepancy between their stock price and their actual value, and in essence, they all operate solely on speculation and manipulation. And a group of companies, seeing the golden age of stock speculation, are each utilizing their own stocks to embark on the path of 'industrial companies.' For example, film studios, food companies, real estate companies, etc."

The above excerpt is from what Mr. Yoshida Toyu said in yesterday's weekly commentary in this newspaper. It can also be said to be what we want to say. At the same time, it is also a serious wartime economic pathology, a deplorable wartime suicide phenomenon.

Since the securities exchange resumed operations last October and started trading stocks, it has gradually evolved into the current chaotic situation of stock speculation frenzy in a few months, which was definitely not anticipated. The purpose of the stock exchange resuming operations and trading stocks was, of course, to invigorate finance, promote industrial and commercial prosperity, and increase production. However, the current result is the opposite, merely creating a frenzy of speculative psychology. Why is it that a correct method and a good system, after being adopted by the Chinese people, turn into tools for speculation? The orange turns into a trifoliate orange when it crosses the Huai River. It is truly heartbreaking to say. And Mr. Yoshida, as a Japanese, points out our shortcomings from his mouth, revealing them thoroughly, which should especially make those with a conscience feel uneasy.

In recent months, companies in various industries have been established one after another, with a wide variety of names. Very few of them are operating properly. Although most of them claim to be engaged in some kind of industrial and commercial business, the actual content is just opening a few offices and placing a few desks. They publish advertisements to solicit shares, and before the share capital is even fully collected, the black market price of the stock exceeds the face value. After the company holds its founding meeting, it does not focus on business but hurriedly finds ways to list the stock. After listing, it tries its best to push up the stock price, so that the market price of the stock exceeds its face value by a considerable amount, and then uses the excuse of asset appreciation to carry out capital increases, earning several times the profit in a short period of time. Moreover, the mentality of semi-official speculative elements and merchant speculative elements is that the larger the company's capital, the greater the profit; the smaller the face value of the stock, the more widespread the attraction; and the more companies established, the more ways to make money. As a result, the national economy is increasingly exploited and declines. Furthermore, after establishing a new company, the share capital received by that company is used to establish another company, layer upon layer, just like the hoarders of the past, who use the hoarded goods as collateral for loans, then hoard more goods, then borrow more money. The more loans, the more hoarded goods, and the more ill-gotten gains. When the hoarded goods are once bought up and they cannot make up the difference in the black market price, they commit suicide or go bankrupt. In the end, it is not a pity that such people commit suicide or go bankrupt, but it is unforgivable that they disrupt the wartime national economy, causing the value of currency to fall and prices to rise, making the lives of the masses more and more difficult. We dare to say that the manipulators and hoarders of the past are the stock manipulators of today. These people are innate speculators, who use speculative tricks anytime and anywhere, seeking only profit and disregarding the overall wartime situation. If the government does not severely punish them and society does not have the power to restrain them, then the more rampant speculation is, the more chaotic the society will be, and the more painful the lives of the people will be.

Stock speculation is currently a very serious wartime economic pathology. The government authorities naturally cannot turn a blind eye. We offer a few suggestions:

According to item 2 of the examination principles of the Exchange Management Committee for listed stocks: "The company has been established and operating for more than one year." Item 2 of the Organizational Rules of the Supervision Committee: "Various securities must be approved by the Supervision Committee before they can be traded on the market." Therefore, it is illegal that 27 stocks have been listed recently without being reviewed by the committee. And the exchange authorities listed and traded stocks that have not been reviewed and approved. What is the basis for this? How can they claim to be unaware of the review rules? This is indeed likely to promote speculation. The exchange authorities should be subject to appropriate punishment. Now that the Supervision Committee has ordered these 27 stocks to suspend trading, it is very proper. However, during the review, the provisions of the "Review Principles" should be strictly followed, and stocks of companies that have not been operating for more than one year should absolutely not be allowed to be listed.

On January 20 of this year, the Central News Agency reported that the Ministry of Industry, in view of the fact that idle funds in various places are competing for speculation, stimulating prices, and disrupting finance, and that various companies engaged in real estate trading and investment enterprises are also tending towards speculative transactions, in order to prevent the spread, decided to stop the establishment of new companies from January 21, and hoped that merchants and people would invest in production-increasing industries, and not engage in speculative companies, so as not to suffer losses. This restriction by the Ministry of Industry is indeed very wise, but while restricting establishment on the one hand, new companies are still being established one after another on the other hand. Therefore, it must be strictly enforced, with no exceptions. If establishment is carried out without permission, it should be ordered to stop operations and punished. The capital increase of companies should also be strictly reviewed to prevent abuse.

Separation of government and business is what we have always advocated. And it is also clearly stipulated by the government that civil servants are not allowed to engage in commerce concurrently. However, ignorant officials, although they do not come forward themselves, use relatives and old friends to come forward to operate, and use special conveniences to do whatever they want. As a result, speculative merchants fuel the flames and take advantage of their power. We hope that the government authorities will conduct a thorough investigation with the spirit of impartiality and selflessness, so that the intermediate elements who do not separate government and business have no way to use their tricks, and give speculative merchants a head-on blow. For example, semi-official companies, using the publicity of propaganda organs, squeeze into the speculative group and try their best to push up the stock price, making it soar and reaping huge profits, which makes ordinary speculative merchants envious, and the speculative atmosphere is even more intense. We hope that the government authorities will start rectifying from this type of semi-official company first.

Now that the stocks listed on the exchange have been approved, in order to prevent speculation and promote production enterprises, a new standard should be strictly set and re-examined. All stocks of industrial and commercial enterprises that are not directly productive should not be allowed to be listed. Stocks that are labeled as production enterprises but do not have actual production equipment, or that have equipment but do not engage in production, should also not be allowed to be listed. Private trading and dark market transactions of stocks that are not allowed to be listed should be strictly prohibited.

In short, we have now reached the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War. The participating countries should contribute their lives to jointly strive for victory, and China cannot be an exception. And Shanghai is an important economic center in the rear. Not only has it failed to make its wartime economic contribution, but today, individuals are keen on stock speculation and obsessed with getting rich. The government authorities should quickly suppress this, as it is an urgent and unavoidable task.

### Displaying Power on the India-Burma Border: Japanese Aircraft Fiercely Attack Enemy Positions; Air Combat Occurs in Buthidaung, Inflicting Heavy Damage on the Enemy

Rangoon, 5th (Central News Agency) - Since the British-Indian army's disastrous defeat at Arakan in the spring counter-offensive against Burma, they have repeatedly announced a counter-offensive against Burma in October, but have been blocked by the Japanese army and unable to launch it. Recently, the British-Indian army on the Burma-India border has completed preparations for a counter-offensive. They have repeatedly attacked with small forces on the Maungdaw-Buthidaung front to test the strength of the Japanese army, while continuously gathering troops behind the front lines. The Japanese army air force took advantage of the clear weather on the 4th to fly in large numbers to the Buthidaung area, fiercely bombing enemy troops attempting to move, and engaging enemy aircraft, inflicting heavy damage. When the Japanese army air force bombed the Buthidaung front on the morning of the 4th, they encountered a formation of eight enemy aircraft, including Spitfire fighters and B38s.

### Severe Food Shortage in Australia

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - The situation in Australia is difficult in all aspects. According to a dispatch from Canberra on the 5th, Australia is currently encountering extremely serious problems, namely labor and food. Australia is currently supplying a large amount of food to the anti-Axis countries, but due to a shortage of labor, it is unable to transport it out. Recently, about 2,000 workers per month have returned to the countryside from Australia's military and ordnance factories to increase food production. However, the lack of necessary phosphate fertilizer in the agricultural sector is also a difficult problem, as Australia's phosphate fertilizer has been imported from Nauru Island. In addition, volcanic eruptions have occurred repeatedly in various parts of Victoria and New South Wales, which is also a factor contributing to the reduction in agricultural production. Therefore, Australia is no longer able to continuously supply butter and cheese to Britain, and meat production is also reduced due to the death of a large number of livestock in volcanic eruptions.

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the German News Agency: February 4 was a dark day for the British army on the Nettuno front. Since the anti-Axis forces landed there, the German army launched its first large-scale offensive on this day, annihilating the British army that broke into the Rome-Cisterna railway. The encirclement was completed within seven hours. Therefore, the first part of the offensive mission was completed at 6:00 AM that morning. At that time, the German army launched a joint offensive in two directions, encircling several brigades of the British army, and is now concentrating on annihilating them. About 600 enemy troops were captured at noon that day. The dense German artillery fire and hand grenades caused confusion in the British army units, resulting in heavy casualties. Before launching the offensive, the German artillery bombarded the enemy for half an hour, first causing confusion in their ranks, and then the infantry launched a positional offensive. German armored forces attacked from both flanks to encircle the British army. The rainy weather affected the activities of the enemy air force, so the German offensive was quite convenient.

### Coal Ingots Arriving Continuously, Preparation to Expand Rationing - Eleven Coal Merchants Join New Organization

Thai Language Newspaper Report: According to reliable sources yesterday, the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company will be reorganized and renamed the Da Zhong Lian Coal Ingot Control Association to strengthen unified coal ingot distribution.

It is also reported that the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company has submitted a proposal to the board of directors of the Shanghai Coal Association to reorganize the Control Association. The proposal has been adopted by the authorities.

Fuel Already Significantly Improved

The Da Zhong Lian Coal Company was established in February of last year, entrusted by the authorities to be responsible for distributing coal ingots to users. Chinese industrial and commercial organizations and private users have been indirectly supplied through retailers. It is also heard that the stock of coal ingots in this port has been continuously arriving from other ports recently, and the quantity is quite considerable. The authorities are paying close attention to it and are preparing to implement expanded rationing measures. In fact, with ample sources, the fuel market has shown significant improvement, and it is widely believed that it will eventually stabilize.

Establishment of a Electricity Distribution Deliberation Organization

At the same time, according to a Japanese newspaper report, in order to prevent excessive coal ingot consumption, a "Electricity Distribution Deliberation Organization" will be jointly established by the Chinese and Japanese authorities and the citizens to set up an Electricity Distribution Deliberation Committee to adjust coal ingot distribution and use electricity for legitimate purposes.

However, "coal purchase permits" were issued by the First District Office before the Lunar New Year, and the coal payments have also been paid in full by the owners of the cooked water shops. It was learned yesterday that these coal ingots have not yet been delivered, making the situation of the cooked water shops even more difficult. It is now urgently hoped that the delivery can be made as soon as possible to meet the emergency needs, otherwise, the cooked water shops will be completely closed.

Sports

### Charity Football Grand Event, Unprecedented, China Beats Western Union, Three to Zero, Western Union's Ball Luck Extremely Poor

The charity football match hosted by the Shanghai Football Association was held at Yi Gang yesterday morning, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. The game started at 10:50 am. First, Zhou Jiaqi, the general secretary of the Shanghai Football Association, reported the purpose of the charity match on the radio. Then, the District Office band played music, and Minister Ding personally kicked off the game. Referee Wu Shouheng blew the silver whistle, and Western Union immediately launched an attack. Bao Xiutuo, like a tiger released from its cage, pounced fiercely on China's goal, but fortunately, he missed. China took advantage of the situation to attack. Fei Qinghua went straight in from the wing, dribbled to the penalty area, and kicked at the goal. Mai Youliang caught up and touched the ball to the left corner. At that time, McNeilly was focusing all his attention on the right. As a result, Han Long slapped the ball into the net. A second meritorious service. At the end of the first half, China was ahead by three to zero. During the break, charity footballs were auctioned off, hosted by Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, and Sun Mingqi, etc. As a result, Liuhe Society won the bid for 210,000 yuan, breaking the record for the highest price of a charity football. Changing sides to fight again, Western Union's lineup was adjusted, and the offensive became stronger. In front of China's goal, danger was everywhere. Bao Xiutuo shot twice with force, but they were both saved by Liu Xianhan and were not counted. McEachern kicked from near the goal, and the momentum was extremely fierce, but Xianhan lay down and held it down, and the entire audience applauded warmly. At this time, the ball constantly hovered in front of China's goal, but Western Union repeatedly attacked without success. At 23 minutes, Zhang Lingen fouled in the penalty area and was awarded a penalty kick, which was taken by Robert Stoff. Because he was eager to win, he kicked it right into Liu Xianhan's arms and failed to break the duck egg, which was unfortunate. Western Union gradually showed signs of fatigue, while China, with the victory in hand, did not push too hard, and the game became relaxed. When the whistle blew to end the game, China won 3-0.

Economic Circle, Review Translation

### Quickly Raise Countermeasures for Commodity Prices

The soaring prices of goods continue to rise without end. Most people in the Peace District are threatened and struggling in the wild waves of life. The intellectual class, the salaried class, wage laborers, and farmers are all without exception. Those who obtain huge profits from the rise in prices and become rich overnight are less than one percent of the population of speculators. Because of the profiteering of these speculators, the people's livelihood problem is becoming increasingly precarious. It is obviously difficult to build China's wartime economy on this foundation. The basic premise of the wartime economy should be to curb the rise in commodity prices and rationalize the income of the people.

The intellectual class and hardworking people are the backbone of China in the war. If this backbone is exhausted every day by firewood, rice, oil, and salt, how can they have the leisure to engage in other work, and how can China become strong? Looking at the reality of China, those who uphold justice and integrity and are content with their duties are suffering from life, while those who are unrighteous and break the law are generally wealthy. If this situation continues for a long time, can China's morality not fall to the ground? This is not a simple issue of commodity prices. Therefore, thoroughly rectifying speculators and cracking down on speculative behavior is the most effective countermeasure to commodity prices, and it is also absolutely necessary to maintain the morality of China in the war.

However, cracking down on speculative behavior cannot be said to be the solution to the commodity price problem. There are more fundamental countermeasures, such as promoting the exchange of goods between Shanghai and the inland, severing the exploitation of the intermediate layers, and rationalizing and streamlining procurement and distribution. Planned release of bank funds and contraction of speculative funds, etc., can be implemented immediately. If implemented one by one, they can all help solve the commodity price problem.

Everyone knows that the commodity price problem is becoming more and more serious. Whether viewed from the perspective of wartime economic construction or from the perspective of national psychological construction, it is absolutely impossible to stand by and do nothing. We dare to ask the National Government again to make the greatest determination and immediately start with effective commodity price controls. (Translated by Xiang from the Mainland News on February 2nd)

### Goods Arrive in Shanghai in a Steady Stream, Supply of Goods Increases Sharply; All Industries Strictly Supervise Trading Among Peers

In order to increase the stock of materials and stabilize commodity prices, the authorities of this city have actively tried to dredge goods and native raw materials from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Guangdong and other places, which has achieved remarkable results. The reporter learned from business circles yesterday that the goods shipped to Shanghai from the above-mentioned places are constantly on the way, mostly belonging to miscellaneous rights, and raw materials needed in industry, which is of great benefit to the expansion of industry and commerce in this city, and it is not small. It is expected that the supply of various items in this city will increase sharply.

Supervise Trading Among Peers

It was learned yesterday that the major commodity trade associations, in order to assist the authorities in recovering industry and commerce and suppressing commodity prices, have successively taken the following steps. Namely: Follow the central government's intention to initiate the establishment of trade associations in various industries. Formulate industry rules for trading among peers, and order all member peers to abide by them. Establish an evaluation committee to periodically evaluate and set standard pool limits. Be responsible for distribution matters, so as to curb the black market. In order to crack down on illegal transactions, it is stipulated that all transactions are limited to spot trading.

Prohibit Floating Transactions

It is found that since the authorities ordered the cessation of trading in various markets, general speculative merchants and brokers have suffered serious threats. Under the strict supervision of the authorities, their daily actions are deeply constrained, but their intentions are unpredictable. They dare to carry out floating transactions and illegally operate on various clean roads. It is learned that the relevant authorities will severely punish these treacherous merchants. Once such transactions are found, they will be arrested and prosecuted in court, and investigated according to law, so as to deter others and maintain the market. At the same time, it is hoped that citizens will assist in reporting.

### Silver and Money Industry, Increase Loan Rate

In order to prevent the use of industry funds for speculation and hoarding, the silver and money industry has decided to reject all new loans that are deemed to promote speculation and hoarding after implementing tight lending. If the industry does have legitimate needs, it can be loaned separately as appropriate, and the production situation will be used as the standard. It was recently heard that in addition to raising deposit interest rates to absorb social roaming expenses, the various industries will also raise the interest rate by more than three points for any forgiveness, including credit mortgage, and it is heard that the monthly announcement of deposit and debt interest market by the money industry will raise the debt interest item to 40 yuan. That is, the monthly interest is 4%, and this matter is under close consideration.

### A Tour of the South Pacific Front Line

A naval aircraft 〇〇, flying out of a certain place in mainland Japan, soared southward over the Pacific Ocean, heading for a certain base on the front line. I and many young naval airmen were on the plane together. They all looked no more than twenty years old. When I inquired about them, some of them were only seventeen years old. Their spirit is really admirable. They all thought that this was the first time they had achieved their long-cherished wish for many years. From now on, they could stand up to the front and meet the American soldiers who were irreconcilable. But what they talked about with each other, without listening for long, you could know that it was innocent, enough to prove that they were all children. Can a group of children like this complete the important work that is the most important factor in the outcome of the war? I couldn't help but feel a little uneasy. But soon I realized I had made a big mistake.

Young Airmen

In addition to carrying a white canvas bag containing the bedding issued by the government, each young airman had a tote bag for daily necessities. Compared with the luggage I brought for the planned tour of the front line for dozens of days, it was really pitifully small, so I couldn't help but ask them if this was enough, and a young airman replied, "It's enough to bring things for about two months, because after that, we will die in battle!" Hearing this answer, I couldn't help but be in awe and deeply moved!

In addition to the tote bag, each young airman routinely carried a photo album. I asked several soldiers to take a look at it. Inside were portraits of their parents, photos of themselves as children, as well as pictures taken during sports meets and school trips during their national school days, and also commemorative photos of winning the championship flag at rural youth schools. Finally, there were photos taken in front of their ancestors on the day of their departure. Some of these photos were indeed faded or stained with hand dirt, but they were all neatly pasted. Before reaching their destination, they sat on the plane and flipped through them again and again, exchanging them and reading them with great interest. They probably felt that before the day of glorious death in battle came, they would get encouragement from their parents, support from their childhood friends, and the blessing of their ancestors from this photo album.

Before long, the plane we were on arrived at a base close to the front line. So I said goodbye to this group of young airmen. On one side of the airfield, several new aircraft were neatly arranged, waiting for the young airmen who had arrived here with me. When I was waiting for the plane to take me at one corner of the airfield, the young airmen soon changed into flight suits and boarded the designated aircraft. At this time, they were no longer the children who had just spoken to me. In their eyes, on their faces, there was a determination to kill the enemy and achieve results, and they looked really reliable. What a noble spirit! The current war is a confrontation between the enemy's quantity and our quality. The basis for our ability to constantly overwhelm the enemy and defeat the enemy lies in this noble spirit.

### Farming While Fighting

The natives living on various islands in the Southern War Zone do not know how to cultivate the land to obtain crops. The enemy, who has long occupied this place, also relied on its own country and other colonies for food. They did not cultivate themselves, nor did they teach the natives. Another reason is that in this sparsely populated area with abundant natural food, there is really no need to cultivate. However, today, tens of thousands of Japanese troops have entered this place, and with the intensification of the war, the transportation of materials sent to the front across the vast ocean is gradually becoming difficult. Food cannot be obtained from the nearby area, nor can it be taken from friendly forces. This is the current situation in the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and the Bismarck Archipelago. After all, fighting on an empty stomach is not a matter of course. How can this difficult problem be solved? Therefore, the generals and soldiers of the Japanese army on the front line resolutely took up the plow.

The land is not unsuitable for cultivation, and the sunlight and rainfall are not insufficient. After cultivation, the seeds brought from the motherland are planted, and things like soybeans, peas, sweet potatoes, gourds, and cabbage sprout, and because of the temperature, they grow very quickly, and some can be harvested within three weeks after sowing. However, the hardship of developing this kind of farmland is not comparable to ordinary.

From reclamation to cultivation, seeing the hardworking situation of the generals and soldiers, just like seeing them handing over with enemy soldiers, makes us feel indescribable admiration. Both of these situations can be said to be due to the indomitable spirit that permeates the entire body of the Japanese soldiers. This strong spirit, on the one hand, overcomes all difficulties and defeats strong enemies, and on the other hand, cleverly overcomes the violent forces of nature. I have also eaten the vegetables grown in this way several times. Every time I put my chopsticks into this vegetable bowl, I can't help but be filled with tears and gratitude.

### SPIRIT OVER MATERIAL

In the ranks, many new slogans have emerged. Among them, many are born from practical experience, and although no one has ever shouted them out, they are precious precepts widely followed among the soldiers. For example, "Hidden illness is not illness" is one of them. Soldiers who are slightly accustomed to life on the southern front no longer feel the pain of hidden illnesses. According to reports from our side, the rate of hidden illnesses among frontline soldiers is 3% for the army and 2% for the navy. However, like reporting war news, this is an inaccurate report like those from the United States, and the actual rate is three to five times higher than this percentage. In our ranks, there is no practice of quickly withdrawing soldiers suffering from these illnesses from the front lines to the rear for deliberate recuperation. One reason is that we have an abundance of quinine cream, which is not allowed. One soldier once told me: "This is the fifth time I've had malaria." Examples of malaria patients not retreating from the front lines, fighting with a fever of 40 degrees Celsius, are not rare news. In the Suda area, a certain petty officer second class of the Marine Corps suddenly suffered a severe attack of malaria while on watch. At the same time, the telephone lines between the observation post and the unit headquarters were cut off by enemy fire. Therefore, this petty officer second class, suffering from a hidden illness, had to walk four kilometers every day to report to the unit headquarters.

On an anti-aircraft position, a non-commissioned officer in charge of shooting said: "The machine guns and anti-aircraft guns that are attacking enemy planes will never be hit by enemy fire. Because our side's spirit overwhelms the enemy plane's gunners. If the spirit fails, then you will be killed." These words are probably born from long practical experience. The spirit of the frontline soldiers, determined not to be hit by enemy fire, is truly admirable. This spirit can be said to be invincible. However, the nature of modern warfare is such that, even with this spirit, one cannot necessarily make the enemy surrender by relying solely on it. To put it more clearly, in addition to spirit, sufficient munitions are also needed. The amount of iron has a great significance in determining the outcome of a battle. Looking back at the tragic battle situations of Renteba, Monta, and others, the Japanese army did not fail in each battle. However, despite this, they still had to temporarily abandon their occupied positions. The reason for this is, in short, the lack of iron.

On the battlefield of Monta, which was in fierce fighting, a certain commander said: "War is sound!" This sentence accurately expresses the characteristics of modern warfare. The roar of airplanes, the screeching of battles, the roar of guns and bombs, the explosion of torpedoes, the sound of loudspeakers blaring towards the enemy positions—the place where many sounds intermingle is the battlefield of modern warfare. And the sound sources of these sounds can be divided into enemy and ally. By comparing the intensity of the sounds emitted from both sides' positions, one can gauge which side's battle is advantageous.

Today, good news is still frequently coming from the battle lines, but it is impossible to say "Even with few weapons, we can still win." The reason why we repeatedly have such victory records today is that the spirit of the Japanese soldiers compensates for the shortage of munitions. In the future, in addition to this valuable spirit, sending large quantities of weapons such as aircraft to the front lines is the only way to make the Japanese army's inevitable victory complete. There is no second way to achieve complete victory. (Naval Reporting Team Member Mori Masataka) (Translated from the December 16th weekly Mainichi)

Sketches from the Forefront

### N's Pilot's Eyes

During a break in the fierce fighting, a young naval warrior pilot showed me a directory. Pointing to a commemorative photo of his classmates: "This person is dead; this person is also gone. This person is still alive. As for this..." I looked down at the ground where the finger pointed, and unconsciously lowered my head.

The eyes of Petty Officer First Class N gleamed: "Artist, we will live until we completely conquer Australia!"

Here I see the infinite fighting spirit of the naval air corps. Relying on their vast productive capacity, the enemies have fought and lost, and fought again. Sometimes, there is not even anyone around.

In the dark officer's room of the Ampong 〇〇 base, the night's squad leader, with his hands clenched, seemed to spit blood: "It's tough now, there aren't enough planes." There was no need to hear the rest of the words. While glancing at the dark sky, I cursed: Beast! It's over now! Fireflies sparkled among countless trees, and the grave too glowed in the darkness!

### WEDDING GOWN

— Ren Shufang

The month of March is full of spring, and the scenery in the garden is so charming that even the water in the pond is stirred by the weeping willows. Meifen leaned against the garden gate, realizing that this was the thirtieth spring since her birth. Thinking of this, she was obviously a little sad. She felt she had received a hint that youth had bid her farewell, and the shadow of aging was gnawing at her heart day by day. She dared not think about what the future would be like!

This day was Meifen's birthday, and her two younger sisters, Lanfen and Jufen, had been clamoring to celebrate her birthday, but their good intentions aroused her worries. She vaguely remembered that on her twentieth birthday, her mother had stroked her shoulder and said, "Mei'er, this is the last whole birthday you'll have at home. By the time you're thirty, your husband should be celebrating your birthday for you."

At that time, Meifen lowered her head shyly. She certainly believed that in another ten years, she would definitely have children. But ten years passed in the blink of an eye, and she was still at home. These things pricked her heart like needles. She wanted to cry heartily, but she had to personally light the incense and candles, and personally go to the kitchen to cook. When she knelt down and kowtowed to her parents, she felt that if she didn't try her best to hold back, the tears would flow out. A layer of melancholy was also added to her mother's face.

In the Fang mansion, Miss Meifen was the most capable one. Apart from not understanding English and science, her Chinese foundation was quite good, and she could write a beautiful "Lingfei Sutra" script and classical Chinese. She was skilled in housework, whether it was cooking or sewing. In particular, embroidery was Miss Fang's forte. Mrs. Fang was getting old, and her daughter was so capable, so the affairs of the Fang mansion were all managed by Miss Meifen.

Like her elder sister, Second Miss Lanfen had not received a school education, and she was not as clever as Meifen. However, her good nature was well-known in the Fang mansion. As for Third Miss Jufen, partly because she was younger and partly because she had a very stubborn personality, she was the only one among the three girls who had managed to receive a new education. She was now in high school, and her grades were not bad. She was also extremely clever, but she was not very willing to give in to others.

In recent years, what had made Mrs. Fang and Mr. Fang worry day and night was the marriage of their three daughters. She had no sons, and her only hope was to get two good sons-in-law. Although Jufen was only twenty years old, Meifen was already thirty, and Lanfen was also twenty-seven. Over the years, there had been many people who came to propose marriage to these two ladies, but Mrs. Fang and Mr. Fang either disliked the proposer for being poor or for having too many family members, and they insisted that their daughters must marry a first wife. So, the days passed by, and the marriage of their daughters was inadvertently delayed. Now that she saw her daughters' ages were not young, she was really anxious.

In the autumn, Mr. Jiang, a friend of Mr. Fang, came personally to propose marriage for his nephew. His nephew had died a year ago, and he was now preparing to marry a second wife. The deceased wife had left behind two children. The Jiang family was also a prominent family, and everything was very familiar. In the past, Mr. Fang would have flatly refused. The Fang family's daughters would only marry a first wife. But now he readily agreed and even took photos of the two ladies for the Jiang family to choose from.

This matter was of no interest to Jufen, but it had a great impact on Meifen and Lanfen. Especially Meifen, she suffered insomnia all night, hoping that she would be chosen, and she felt that as the elder sister, she should get married before her younger sister. During the day, she often sat in a daze, and at night she could not sleep peacefully. She was obviously much more haggard.

A week later, Mr. Jiang sent a reply, saying that Lanfen, the second miss, had been chosen because young master Jiang was only thirty-two years old, so Miss Meifen's age seemed to be a bit too old. Although Mrs. Fang also hoped that Meifen would be chosen, but the matter was already settled. At least one daughter had found a home, so the two families decided to get engaged in the winter of that year and prepare to get married in the spring of the following year.

Lanfen had no objection to this matter. Everything was decided by her mother. But Meifen not only felt disappointed but also felt greatly humiliated. She cried all night and was afraid that her younger sister and the servants would laugh at her. During the day, she forced herself to be happy, but tears always welled up when she was reading. After the engagement ceremony was held, the Fang mansion gradually became busy. Because of her age, Mrs. Fang could not exert herself too much, so she entrusted all the matters of purchasing the dowry to Meifen. However, Meifen was heartbroken by every item, but on the surface, she had to pretend to be happy. After the New Year, it was soon spring, and Lanfen's wedding date had been set. Everyone was beaming with joy.

One afternoon, Meifen was sitting in her room when Lanfen suddenly pushed open the door and came in, sitting next to Meifen, lowering her head as if she had something to say. Originally, the sisters had a very good relationship, but because of this marriage, Meifen felt an unspeakable resentment towards Lanfen, but on the surface, she had never revealed it.

"Second Sister! Is there anything you need?" Meifen waited for a while, but Lanfen still didn't open her mouth, and Meifen became a little impatient.

"Elder Sister: I... I want to ask you for something."

"Can you stop beating around the bush! What is it? Tell me quickly."

"I want to ask you to embroider a dress for me, to wear after I take off the wedding dress."

"Why do you want me to make your clothes when you're getting married?" Meifen felt that her wound had been reopened.

"Good sister! You won't even agree to this little request I have? You're better at embroidery than me!"

"..."

"Good sister, please agree to it! I'll definitely thank you properly!"

"Alright!" Meifen swallowed her tears and finally agreed.

After a month of hard work, the dress was completed. The light crimson soft satin was matched with crimson peony flowers. The colors were so well-matched, and the embroidery was so exquisite that everyone who saw it praised it endlessly.

Lanfen got married. On the wedding day, she wore the embroidered dress, and the guests' praises were constantly sent to Miss Meifen, but she didn't feel any joy.

Time flowed by mercilessly like water. After Lanfen got married, Meifen became even more lonely. Jufen had schoolwork and was often not at home. Apart from lingering in the garden for a while, she spent the whole day moping in her room.

Jufen graduated this year. Along with the happy news of her graduation, Jufen proposed to her parents the idea of marrying a young English teacher she had met.

Mrs. Fang naturally agreed to this marriage that did not worry her at all, but under the strict questioning of the Fang Old Master, she learned that this future son-in-law was an orphan and had nothing except his own brain and hands. Moreover, he was from the distant north. These things immediately aroused the opposition of the Fang Old Master, who felt that a young lady from a prominent family like theirs could never marry a poor teacher with a humble background. Mrs. Fang was also reluctant to send her daughter to such a faraway place.

Undoubtedly, the father-daughter conflict began. The matter reached Meifen's ears, and she immediately rushed over. The Fang Old Master was already blue in the face.

"Father! Marriage is related to a person's lifelong happiness. The most important thing is that both parties have feelings. We are still young, and money can be earned with our hands and brains. As for social status, there's even less to talk about. I'm marrying a person, not a family." Jufen said a great deal with confidence.

The Fang Old Master felt that his daughter's words were simply too rude, and he immediately stood up.

"Fine! Unless you marry on your own, I will never agree!" Saying this, he flicked his sleeves and went out.

After this father-daughter conflict, Meifen persuaded Jufen to go to her room. Jufen said excitedly, with tears flowing down her face.

"Elder sister? Father is so stubborn, I really can't stand it. Mother's thinking is also outdated. How could your marriage have been delayed until now, and how could Second Sister have become someone's second wife? All of this was caused by them. They didn't think that a person only has one youth, and once it's lost, it will never come back."

Jufen felt that her third sister's words spoke to her heart, and she and Jufen began to cry in each other's arms. However, she thought that unless she made the most extreme compromises regarding marriage, there was little hope for her in this life.

"Elder sister! I'm going to talk to Mom and Dad again. If they still don't agree, I'll leave."
"Leave! Third sister, don't think like that! I'll definitely help you speak to Father."

The next day, the two sisters mustered up their courage to go before the Fang Old Couple, but they still got the same result.

Jufen felt that things were pressing in on her. In this way, not only was her marriage hopeless, but also her and her lover's common dream of going to the countryside to start a school would be shattered. These things all needed to be resolved in the short summer vacation. She knew that hesitation and timidity would not be beneficial to her future. Finally, as the summer vacation was about to end, she decided on the path she should take, which was... to leave.

Meifen sympathized with her third sister's plight and felt sorry for her own life. Now that her youth was being buried, she felt that she shouldn't let her younger sister go down the same path. So, she actually agreed to Jufen's departure and helped her leave.

On an early autumn night, Meifen was helping her pack her things when she suddenly thought of something and quickly walked out. When she came back, she was holding something in her hand.

"Third sister! Who knows when we'll see each other again after you leave. This is a piece of clothing that I embroidered myself, and it's my most satisfying work. I was going to wear it when I got married, but now I don't want to get married anymore. I'll give this dress to you as a memento: and I hope you'll wear it on your wedding day." "Everything about my departure depends on your help. I will definitely do as you say, but Mom and Dad..."

"Don't worry, I'll take care of them. I'll take care of everything in this family." Jufen looked at the magnificent dress, black satin embroidered with red phoenixes inlaid with gold thread, with tears in her eyes and was too grateful to speak.

In the morning, before it was fully light, Jufen left. Meifen felt a layer of joy added to her heart. Although she still had to live a half-life of monastic life, she thought about her own frequent dizziness, heart palpitations, and stomach pains, and knew that she wouldn't be a fossil for long.

### WINTER SONG

— Shizhou

The biting cold wind,

Freezes the accumulated water on the roadside.

The pedestrians on the street,

All show shrinking expressions.

At this time:

In a store displaying new winter clothing,

Two modern women walked out.

One is:

A charming face accompanied by a fox fur scarf.

One is:

A body full of snow-white fluff lined with bright red lips.

They are talking vigorously.

Just turning the corner, not a few steps, suddenly "ah!" A sound, and quickly walked down the sidewalk.

"Oh, Mom! Scared to death," it turned out at the foot of the wall under a broken reed mat,

There were two frozen human feet sticking out. A rag picking child was shivering from the cold in the street,

Although his mother put him in an old long coat.

The lower body only has a pair of pants,

Bare feet dragged a pair of broken and big shoes.

The cold wind blowing up was terrible. Go home,

And will be scolded by his mother. I had to endure the cold step by step.

An overnight west wind, had already blown leaves all over the street.

A pair of red lotus root like hands, climb them one by one.

"The red rice porridge picked up yesterday couldn't be heated,

So many picked up today my mother must be very happy."

He was thinking:

A trace of pleasant smile unwittingly revealing on his frozen red face.

### DO NOT LET THE PAST BECOME THE PAST

— Cai Yanyan

Friend, don't linger on the past, it seems like a mysterious maze, even the ordinary becomes joy. If you are intoxicated in memories all day,

Even if it makes you disillusioned and depressed, there will never be a bright goodbye. Let's throw away these old things, it makes us hide in the corners of reality.

Blindly facing the current horrifying waves and winds.

The sorrow of longing is a waste. We can't keep every bubble,

Vainly floating like a pile of dregs.

Friend, please put away your sentimental intestines,

Time will still disappoint you even if it is a heavy turn. Why force yourself with the past, a beautiful vision is right in front of you.

Let's step on difficulties step by step.

Bravely strive for future freedom.

### WHAT CAN MAKE MUSCLES DEVELOP? INTRODUCING LIU KEZHONG'S SIMPLE EXERCISE METHOD

The author of this article, Mr. Zhao Zhuguang, is the president of the Shanghai Fitness Academy and the organizer of Jianlimei Magazine. In recent years, Mr. Zhao has spared no effort in promoting physical exercise and has cultivated many talents. His translations and writings include "Muscle Development Method," "Complete Book of Physical Exercise Methods," "Latest Dumbbell Exercise Method," and more than 20 other kinds. Therefore, we specially invite Mr. Zhao to introduce the methods of muscle development to the readers. ——Editor

Generally speaking, it is an undeniable fact that the physical fitness of Chinese people is below standard. Therefore, for the sake of our own happiness and the future of our nation, we must catch up quickly and speed up the process of building our bodies to be strong.

Strictly speaking, physical exercise should include exercise, rest, and nutrition. Regarding the first point, it would naturally be better if you could train under the guidance of an expert. Otherwise, you can get considerable results if you follow an appropriate method of exercise. But exercise must be persistent. If you only do it for a day or two a week and then hope to have amazing results, and then measure yourself with a tape measure and do not get the expected results, and then blame a certain exercise method for being bad, that is an unreasonable thing. Because the exercise to develop muscles is not a magic trick, it cannot make the muscles of the body grow larger at that time or the next day, but it takes time for the body's elements to slowly increase.

Rest is also an important part of physical exercise. The most important of these is sleep. Because during sleep, the cells that are destroyed by activity during the day have a chance to regenerate. Rest is divided into physical and mental aspects. If we think that we don't need to have a rational life just because we are exercising our bodies, then we will not get much benefit.

At present, nutrition is fundamentally a difficult problem. However, if our environment is superior, it is naturally best to eat eggs, milk, and lean meats and vegetables. But if our environment is normal, we can get our fat and protein from beans, especially soybeans. Get the minerals and vitamins our body needs from vegetables, especially green leafy vegetables.

In order to adapt to the physical weakness and economic conditions of most members of society, the movements we introduce this time do not require equipment. These exercises are also known as self-resistance or self-resistance exercises.

Exercise one

Stand with your feet comfortably apart, relax your whole body, and slowly raise your arms upward, while deeply inhaling. At this time, the abdomen should expand outward. When you have inhaled as much as you can, pause for a moment (but do not pause for too long, keep it comfortable), bend your body down: while exhaling, and cross your arms in front of your chest to compress your chest, so as to drive out as much air as possible from the lungs. At this time, the abdomen should contract inward. You can start with six times and gradually increase to twelve times.

Exercise two

Stand upright as before, with your hands on your hips, first turn your body to the left side, and when you turn as far as you can to the left, restore to the original position; then turn to the right side. Inhale each time you turn to one side, and exhale when you return to the original position. Throughout the entire movement, the legs should maintain a straight posture.

At first, you can do six times on each side, for a total of twenty times. This is an exercise to train the muscles on both sides of the abdomen.

Exercise three

Lie on your back on the ground, with your arms straight beside you, pressed on the ground. Keep your upper body still, stretch your legs and raise them upward while inhaling. When your legs are at a 90-degree angle to your body, pause for a moment, lower them and repeat. When your legs are raised upwards and are paused, you can raise your head and neck at the same time, so that the neck can also get a full range of motion. Exhale when you lower your legs.

When doing this exercise, one thing to pay attention to is that when raising your legs, your legs must be stretched (for older people or people with too much abdominal fat, the knees can be slightly bent, but try to straighten them afterwards). When returning to the original position, the whole body must be relaxed and not stiff. Do as much as you can, up to 25 times.

Exercise four

First stand with your feet comfortably apart, put your left hand on your right hand, and then slowly and forcefully bend your right arm upward from a straight position, while your left hand also applies considerable resistance. When it bends to the same height as your shoulder, restore and repeat. Inhale when bending upwards, and exhale when restoring. You can do ten to fifteen times. Both arms must do the same number of times. This is a very good exercise for the biceps (i.e., the front part of the upper arm).

Exercise five

First place both hands on the ground and stretch both arms, the distance between the hands is approximately equal to the width between the shoulders, stretch the whole body straight, and use both hands and toes to support the weight of the whole body. Lower your legs and arms, while exhaling, and when your chest almost touches the bottom, slowly and forcefully push your arms upward, while inhaling, until your arms are fully straightened. This is a very good exercise for developing chest muscles, and it is also of great help for the development of the shoulders and triceps.

At first, do as much as you can. If you can do more than twenty times, you can change to doing it with your fists, or raise your feet to do it.

Exercise six

Stand with your feet comfortably apart, put your hands on your hips, and keep your body straight, then bend your knees and squat down, while exhaling. When you have squatted as low as you can, stand up, and lift your feet up at the same time, and try to contract the muscles of your thighs and calves as much as possible. Inhale deeply when standing up, and do about ten to eleven times. After you can exceed ten times, you can use one leg to support the weight of your whole body to do it, so that the muscles of the legs have a further movement.

The above-mentioned major exercises are expanded from the muscle development correspondence course attached to this hospital. If we can really do them seriously, we can see our whole body's muscles developing day by day. I wish you all readers can develop a strong body in the near future!

### West Qing Champion Hualian Pharmacy Team's Excellent Tactics – Commentary on Individual Skills

The West Qing Basketball Invitational Tournament has been held for fourteen sessions. Except for the first session which was won by Shanghai University, the twelfth by Qiangju, and the thirteenth by Huaxing, the rest were won by foreign teams. At the beginning of this session's preparation, the Western team's giants were ambitious, while our Chinese teams placed their hopes on Zhongbei and Dongfang. However, Zhongbei withdrew, and Dongfang failed to be consistently energetic, while Hualian Pharmacy emerged as a dark horse, initially having the ambition to win. Relying on the concerted efforts of all, with everyone united as one, they maintained their winning streak, creating a glorious history. Their results were as follows:

Won against Sanlun 76-21

Won against Tongren 40-20

Won against Gengren 35-32

Won against Datong 49-25

Won against Dongfang 62-47

Won against Huanan 53-21

Won against Renyu 42-30

Won against Huaying (opponent) forfeited

Won against Shantou team 46-31

Won against Amateur (opponent) forfeited

Basketball tactics have progressed from five-man zone defense to man-to-man marking. Since the Washington team's visit, the progress has even advanced to using screens to break the man-to-man defense. Under the leadership of Zhang Zixiang, although Hualian Pharmacy did not demonstrate new tactics, they strived for success in the above aspects and seemed to have reached perfection. This is truly admirable. Now, let's introduce the team's brave generals:

Team Leader Zhang Zixiang – Graduated from Sino-French Medical University, a registered pharmacist known by this name. Mr. Zhang is a basketball star, previously representing the Yaoguang team. This time, the organization of Hualian Pharmacy was mainly driven by spirit. Winning the brilliant championship was unexpected. His inner joy is understandable.

Captain Kong Guangyi – A veteran of the basketball scene, he made a name for himself ten years ago representing Qingguang. Even now, his skills are still sharp. He doesn't protect the younger players. Serving as captain and directing the team on the field, his contribution is significant.

Guard Qu Xilin – Also a veteran of basketball, he has a clever and quick mind. He is unusually calm during matches, with excellent skills and accurate shooting. He is like one man guarding the pass, impossible for ten thousand to surpass. Mr. Qu previously worked at the Central Savings Society, winning the championship. Especially in the West Qing tournament, he defeated the giant Monarque twice. It's impossible to add more, so let's note this down first.

Center Wu Chengzhang – Nicknamed Adi, indicating his young age. Before the season, he was still in the second-tier team. However, he suddenly joined the first tier this time and performed very well, truly a rising star. His rebounding and speed under the basket resemble the famous Chen Xue, with some saying he has surpassed him, which is credible!

Right Forward Zhang Lanlun – Physically strong, he is a typical basketball forward. He relies on his stamina and excels at reading opponents. He can run unpredictably, making it difficult for the enemy to defend against him. This is his special characteristic.

Left Forward Zhang Xiaoxuan – He is a disciple of the Qian style, with a slightly upscale style. His specialty is intercepting the ball halfway and shooting from the left corner, with a near-certain success rate of nine out of ten, which is commendable.

All-Around Zhang Liangxiong – Mr. Zhang is proficient in both guard and forward positions. He previously played for the Liangxi team and was already loved by many. He has been retired for a long time. Now, he's back and has contributed significantly to Hualian Pharmacy. His unique advantage is that in extremely chaotic situations, he can prevent unexpected shots and often create miracles, with the ability to turn the tide.

The introduction is complete. We hope that Hualian Pharmacy will not be satisfied with this and will further improve their standards and evolve their skills, making basketball even better and creating greater achievements. We sincerely offer our blessings. (Reporter Shou)

### The Difficulty of Basketball Refereeing (Mei Bixian) – Reflections on an Assault on a Referee in West Qing

In the past, incidents of assaulting referees occurred frequently, even in serious National Games events, which was regrettable! However, recently, such incidents seem rare in Shanghai competitions. This is a welcome sign of progress in sportsmanship and ethics. Unfortunately, an incident was witnessed again at the West Qing stadium last week, which raises some concerns.

The Difficulty of Basketball Refereeing

Among all ball games, I believe basketball refereeing is the most difficult. Soccer has a slower pace, and the most important things to watch are offsides and free kicks. Moreover, there are often linesmen on both sides. Volleyball has very few difficult rules to call, except for touching the net and double touches. Only basketball, because of its fast pace and many strict rules, makes basketball refereeing the most difficult in my opinion. Now, I dare to offer my humble opinions to various sectors. In addition to the usual conditions, I dare to say that the basketball referee should have the following points worth discussing:

Solemn Attitude

Some say that basketball referees should be approachable, but I disagree. Basketball referees must be solemn, representing sacred inviolability. Especially during breaks, they should not talk much with the players to reduce the effect of emotions, which can grow invisibly. Furthermore, whether in extremely tense or extremely relaxed games, they should always maintain that solemnity. Otherwise, smiling and laughing in unimportant games will reduce the players' respect. Therefore, a basketball referee should not be approachable, but solemn.

Whistle Techniques

Generally, it is thought that the more whistles, the better, but that's not true. A whistle is a reflection of the occurrence of a fact, not the result of a fact. Therefore, I think it is redundant to blow the whistle madly when a ball is scored. Too many whistles increase the players' and spectators' annoyance. Therefore, unnecessary whistles should be minimized. Secondly, the whistle sounds should be different. For example, a foul should be slightly longer and louder, while an out-of-bounds call can be light and short to indicate the seriousness of the situation. When a player mistakenly continues to dribble the ball, a broken, intermittent whistle should be used. A whistle like the one used for a false start in track and field may mislead the players and waste valuable seconds of the game.

Psychological Effect

Many referees experience a psychological change when they encounter famous players, following the player's various suggestive attitudes and making it their target. This is absolutely wrong. Because the referee is the highest authority, they must adhere to their original intentions. If they are afraid of something, they will inevitably make one mistake after another. Psychologically, they must not have any concerns.

Other things to consider include minimizing unnecessary socializing with players. Referees should regularly practice and study together so that every referee can become the most standard and impartial person, giving players and spectators the best impression.

There is a referees' association in this city, and there is a lot of communication, but it mainly focuses on friendship. I think the emphasis should be on discussion because nothing is ever finished. In particular, they should do more practical exercises, which will lead to considerable success. Furthermore, I hope that referees can be fair and that research articles can be published in newspapers regularly so that players and spectators can understand the points of misunderstanding, which will naturally reduce assaults.

### Shanghai Special City Food Bureau Announcement

Hu Liang Pei Yi Zi No. 468. This Bureau's 32nd allocation of public rice is two and a half liters of complete white japonica rice per person. It was originally scheduled to be sold sequentially, but in consideration of the Lunar New Year and to celebrate the festival with the people, the 32nd allocation was swapped with the 31st allocation to be issued in advance. This was submitted to the Shanghai Food Adjustment Committee for discussion and approval and implemented accordingly. As a result, citizens received a ration of rice of excellent quality during the Spring Festival, which was gratifying. Now, to replenish the rice allocated for the 31st allocation, it is specially scheduled to be issued from February 6th to 10th. Citizens in each district can purchase two liters of rice per person with this Bureau's 31st rice purchase certificate at the designated public granary within the deadline, at a cost of eight yuan per liter, totaling sixteen yuan. Expired rice purchase certificates will be void and will not be reissued. In addition to ordering all public granaries to comply, this announcement is hereby issued for general knowledge. February 5th, Year 33 of the Republic of China. Director Ji Hua.
