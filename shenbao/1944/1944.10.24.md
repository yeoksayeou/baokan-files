### Relying on England and America or Independent Liberation - A Critical Review

— Chen Binhe

On the evening of the 23rd, Binhe was invited by Shanghai Radio to broadcast to Chongqing. Herewith is an excerpt of the speech, hoping for the readers' kind attention.

The Chongqing government is currently in a situation of relying on England and America to continue the protracted war. However, from the standpoint of the entire China, and the future interests of the nation, we must weigh the pros and cons and not blindly make meaningless sacrifices. The reasons why Chongqing relies on England and America are no more than two points: Firstly, it believes that the power of England and America is sufficient to defeat Japan, and then restore China's territory and sovereignty. Secondly, it suspects that Japan's policy toward China is insincere, and that the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere led by Japan is hypocritical. Therefore, it is better to rely on England and America to contain Japan.

Now, let us assume that the reasons Chongqing relies on are correct. Is there any possibility of realization?

First, believing that the power of England and America is sufficient to defeat Japan. Regarding this point, we do not need to analyze from remote theories. Simply observing the recent facts is enough to fully prove it. Since there has been a mainland battlefield, Luoyang, Changsha, Hengyang and other places have fallen one after another. Now Guilin is also in imminent danger. The above places all occupy extremely important positions in terms of military, politics, and economy. Especially after the occupation of Hengyang, the greatest threat of peace areas and Japanese air raids can be lifted. It can also further open up the Beijing-Hankou and Guangdong-Hankou railways, promote the full connection of the Greater East Asia continental railway, and integrate the mainland with Nanyang. Therefore, from the perspective of Chongqing's insistence on relying on England and America to protract the war, the loss of these important places is undoubtedly an irreparable fatal blow, and it also fundamentally shatters the dream of believing that the power of England and America can defeat Japan.

Conversely, the US military strength stationed in Chongqing has of course used its greatest strength in the recent mainland battles to cooperate with the Chongqing army. However, the result is still repeated defeats, which proves the weakness of the British and American aid to Chongqing.

Secondly, perhaps some people will say that in the China mainland war, England and America cannot help Chongqing with more military strength due to the limitations of transportation, so they were defeated by Japan. However, this cannot be regarded as the lack of American power to defeat Japan. These views may have been believed by some people in the past. Now there is also evidence to prove that in this Taiwan naval battle, the enemy America used the most elite main fleet in the Pacific and the most complete mobile unit, preparing for a decisive battle against the Japanese army. However, after the Japanese army bravely responded, the enemy American fleet was defeated. This battle is enough to prove that not only does the enemy America not have the power to defeat Japan, but on the contrary, Japan has the power to defeat the enemy America. This is a powerful counter-evidence that the Chongqing government's belief that the power of England and America can defeat Japan cannot exist at all.

At the same time, we should also realize that England and America are conniving at Chongqing's protracted war, and of course they have their aggressive ambitions. This time, the enemy America wants to regain its declining momentum in Chongqing's position, and is trying its best to mediate the Chongqing-Communist disputes. In fact, Chongqing is falling into the trap of the enemy America, drinking poison to quench thirst, which is of no practical help. Recently, Zhou Enlai's speech in Yan'an on the National Day said: [The current Chinese frontal battlefield is in a state of heavy defeats. In the Henan campaign, many cities were lost in forty-four days. In the Xiang-Gui campaign, Changsha, Lingling, Shiqing, Zhaoqing, Wuzhou and other cities were lost in succession. Now the Japanese army is approaching Guilin, threatening Liuzhou, and even Kunming. Guiyang has also become the target of the Japanese army's covetousness. Wenzhou and Fuzhou were lost one after another in the coastal battles, and from then on, the major ports on the coast were no longer in our hands. Why have these series of failures occurred continuously in recent years? It is by no means accidental, but is caused by the Kuomintang government's consistent policy of unilateral resistance against Japan, relying on foreign aid, and creating civil war.] After reading this passage, we certainly know that Zhou Enlai is speaking from the standpoint of the Communist Party against Chongqing. However, from this, we can expose the weakness of Chongqing's military and the absolutely unreliable signs of British and American foreign aid. It is even more proof that relying on England and America to defeat Japan is a completely impossible dream.

Second, Chongqing believes that Japan's new policy toward China and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere are hypocritical. After the Greater East Asia Conference, in the peaceful areas, the progress of Sino-Japanese relations and the independence and autonomy of various countries have been proven by facts. On the 20th of this month, Japanese Prime Minister Koiso said at the Tokyo National Assembly: [At present, the Japanese army is still fighting in China, but this battle is not against the Chinese people, nor is it aimed at the Chinese people, nor is it aimed at the Chinese army, and even those who do not rely on British and American forces, even the Chongqing army, are not regarded as enemies. Chongqing not only fails to recognize the real enemy of China itself, but is manipulated by the real enemy, and recklessly launches a useless war of resistance against Japan, which makes the real enemy even more rampant.] These few words fully express Japan's completely different attitude toward China and toward England and America. We must clearly distinguish and decide our path.

Chongqing's reliance on England and America is self-defeating from Greater East Asia, and is self-destruction. Otherwise, looking around at the current situation and considering the future of the country, we must reject England and America, realize the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and achieve independent liberation. What to abandon and what to follow, all Chinese people have reached the critical moment of making a decision as soon as possible.

[PThe Japanese army is gradually increasing its counterattack force on Leyte Island, and the Japanese air force has repeatedly severely damaged the enemy's mobile unit]

○Tokyo, 23rd, Central News Agency - The enemy invaded Leyte Bay with a large unit of transport ships, and then attempted to land near Tacloban. The Japanese army is currently intercepting it. At the same time, the Japanese air force has repeatedly attacked low transport ships and escort convoys, and achieved great results. The Japanese headquarters announced on the 22nd that on the 21st, an enemy destroyer was destroyed and searched, a transport ship was searched and caught fire, and an aircraft carrier was burned. On the 19th, the enemy mobile unit (including two aircraft carriers, two battleships, two cruisers, and three destroyers) attacked Kaniko Mountain Island. After the Japanese air force intercepted it, it also achieved great results. The Japanese headquarters announced on the 20th that one enemy aircraft carrier and one destroyer were sunk (caused by three Japanese aircraft colliding with the enemy ships and sinking), and one battleship and one destroyer were destroyed.

○Tokyo, 23rd, Central News Agency - The battle since the US military invaded Leyte Bay in the Philippines on the 19th of this month has been as follows: On the morning of the 17th, there was a storm with wind speeds of up to 35 meters. Therefore, the enemy ships that invaded Leyte Bay since dawn did not move. Into the dark night, on the 18th, the enemy army waited for the weather to recover, and then sent carrier-based aircraft to bomb the Bisaya area and Luzon Island, etc. In the afternoon, battleships and other ships approached the coast and began naval gun bombardment, and then seemed to prepare for landing. After 9 o'clock on the 19th, a part of the enemy army landed from the south of Leyte Island to Kabak. From noon onwards, the enemy army, under the cover of artillery fire, planned to attack Tacloban by surprise landing. However, the Japanese army intercepted it and inflicted heavy damage on it, sinking one ship and one large ship. At present, the US military's attack on the Philippines has softened, and only small-scale operations have been dispatched. On the contrary, the Japanese army is gradually strengthening its counterattack force. Therefore, it is extremely difficult for the enemy army to use reinforcements to carry out a full-scale invasion.

### The Japanese Army's Elite Has Surrounded Shaoguan City, and the Situation Is Extremely Tense

○Guangzhou, 23rd, Central News Agency - The Japanese army's elite has responded from the north and south, completely surrounding Shaoguan, the base of Yu Hanmou, the seventh theater of the Chongqing army. Recently, the Jianguo Daily and Daguang Daily, which were published in the area, cried out that the flames of war were approaching Shaoguan. The article said that Shaoguan had previously established a municipal government, and its affairs were transferred to the county government. In the past, the county government specially set up the Shaoguan Eight County People's Self-Defense Committee to take charge of the armed forces of the people, and newly established a volunteer police team to greatly expand the air defense organization. The authorities are also studying various defense measures, but the general people are holding a bystander attitude, hoping that the flames of war will not affect the area. Therefore, the people's armed organization has not made progress, and judging from this situation, it seems that it cannot prevent the Japanese army's fierce attack. However, according to another source, the authorities' control is becoming increasingly tense, postal and telecommunications have been completely suspended, and transportation has also been restricted.

○Continental Front, 23rd, Central News Agency - Today, the number of aircraft determines the outcome of the air battle, so the air battle has changed its appearance, from individual combat to group combat. Before the fall of Hengyang, the Chongqing army only attacked with about 20 aircraft scattered. Recently, in mid-September, they attacked Xinqiang twice, and actually dispatched a formation of more than 40 aircraft. When they raided Guangdong during the day on October 15, they dispatched a formation of 50 fighter-bombers. The air battle at Xinqiang in Central China on September 15 was as fierce as a ball game in a large open space. Every time the Japanese aircraft received news of the Chongqing aircraft's attack, they immediately took off to form a formation, and after a few minutes, they broke into the center of the Chongqing aircraft. The Chongqing aircraft also attacked in the same way. After several convergences, they launched a windmill-like aerial battle. This kind of fierce battle does not allow single-aircraft combat, and must be carried out in formation. This is the new character of the recent continental air battle.

### War Results Obtained by the Japanese Army in South China

○South China Front Base, 23rd - Since the Japanese army in South China began on the 9th of last month, the Chongqing army has abandoned only 1,314 bodies according to reliable sources, 229 people have been captured, and the weapons seized include 6 mountain guns, 2 machine guns, 91 heavy machine guns, 107 machine guns, 2 automatic rifles, 83 rifles, 70 grenade launchers, 100,000 rounds of ammunition, 83 landmines, 2,000 naval mines, 46,550 helmets, 5,900 winter clothes, 3,875 summer clothes, 4,000 winter coats, and countless other military supplies.

○Guangzhou, 23rd, Central News Agency - The Chongqing authorities are very anxious because the southwest of China is being oppressed by the Japanese army and suffering heavy blows. On the 14th, Bai Chongxi, deputy chief of staff of the Chongqing Military Commission, specially published a letter to the people of Guangxi Province, calling on the strong men of the entire province to arm themselves. According to Chongqing electricity, Kunming, which is relatively peaceful, is now threatened due to the weakness of the Chongqing army and the rapid advance of the Japanese army. For the sake of defense, it has been decided to organize a national army. First, on the 20th, a summons order was issued to men aged 18 to 45, and after two months of military training, they were deployed in various parts of the city to serve as defense.

### Preparing for Future Battles, India Is Willing to Sacrifice. Bose's Speech Urges the People to Rise Up

○Burma Base, 23rd, Central News Agency - The Provisional Government of Free India established the first day of the anniversary week as Military Day, and the next day was to make the people understand the situation of the Indian National Army's participation in the Imphal campaign, and Bose and other administrative officials in the occupied areas inspected the front line. In the assembly of Burmese people held in various places, chairman Bose attended and spoke, saying that the people in the rear gave manpower and material resources to the large-scale armed resistance in the history of Indian liberation, and he was deeply grateful. In the past year, there have been brilliant results, and he is willing to bless the people together. In the future, in order to prepare for the war, he will not hesitate to make all sacrifices. He also hopes that the people will rise up to achieve the final victory.

○Yangon, 23rd, Central News Agency - Bamo, the representative of the Burmese nation, made a congratulatory statement on the occasion of the first anniversary of the establishment of the Free India Municipal Government, the main points of which are as follows: The liberation of India and its people is indeed a bold and great cause in world history, and the greatness of its spiritual and physical strength is unparalleled in the world. The great task of liberating India rests on the shoulders of the free government and its vanguard, the National Army. The Provisional Government of Free India, with the efforts of the people of East Asia and the Indian National Army in the past year, has shown the spirit of being able to complete this great cause. That is, in this battle, it has fully exerted its combat effectiveness. After these battles, they all made the determination that [they will never give up unless they liberate the Indian people]. The struggle of the Indian National Army and its commanders under the leadership of Bose, and the business of the Indian Provisional Government in the past year, I believe that the completion of the great cause of liberating India has become a reality. Here, I would like to express my congratulations again, and at the same time, I am confident that the final victory will come.

○Nanjing, 23rd, Central News Agency - The Legislative Yuan held its 107th meeting in the Yuan's conference hall on the 23rd, chaired by Yuan Chang Chen.

○Central News Agency - Regarding the Chongqing-Communist cooperation, the future is not optimistic, and there are many difficulties. The Communist Party has repeatedly demanded that the Chongqing government be reorganized and a joint government be established. Therefore, the Chongqing side is extremely depressed and is being forced from both inside and outside. According to reliable sources, the details are quite detailed. It is said that the US military inspection team participated in the celebration held by the Yan'an Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government on the Double Tenth Festival, and Zhu De, Mao Zedong and other Communist Party cadres also participated. At that time, what the congress paid special attention to was Zhou Enlai's speech, which expressed the Communist Party's own position. The main points of his speech were that Chiang Kai-shek expressed the Chongqing-Communist issue in the Chongqing Congress, and decided to resolve it through political means. At that time, it was decided to send five councilors to Yan'an, and I would like to express my welcome. However, in order to save Chongqing's crisis and meet the requirements of the current situation, the only proper way is to select personnel from all parties and factions to participate in the joint government and the establishment of the joint command. Therefore, it is necessary to ask the Chongqing side to admit that it can participate in the entire [anti-Japanese] army and the democratic government elected and built by the people. Yan'an has always demanded that the Chongqing side reorganize the government and reorganize the Military Commission, and adopt personnel from all parties to participate in the joint government and military agencies. In particular, it has instigated all parties to demand that the Chongqing government, except for the Chongqing Kuomintang, all rise up. Therefore, the atmosphere of reorganizing the government has spread throughout the mainland. This new demand for democracy has won the sympathy and approval of England and America. The purpose of England and America is to sacrifice China to deal with Japan, which is the consistent goal of England and America. The Communist Party said that in order to achieve its goals, it must be united as a whole. Otherwise, the Chongqing-Communist cooperation will provide powerful conditions for England and America. Therefore, the Chongqing side is also in a difficult situation. Liang Hancao, the Minister of Propaganda of Chongqing, said in a speech on the 16th of this month that the Chongqing-Communist negotiations have now encountered real difficulties, which is undeniable. However, the Chongqing side is determined to exercise great patience and continue the negotiations. On the one hand, the Chongqing side uses the Chongqing-Communist incident for international propaganda, and in order to prevent the unfavorable international propaganda, it has recently strengthened the review of news. The London Times correspondent stationed in Chongqing telegraphed to the newspaper authorities in China, saying that the Chongqing military authorities have recently become more serious in their review. The news about Yan'an and important news are all checked and cannot be published. At the same time, there are also ten good friends whose manuscripts have also been deleted and cannot be telegraphed. Now, the Chongqing side is dealing with the Communist Party. On the one hand, it is dealing with the Communist Party. On the other hand, it is expressing its depression to England and America, regardless of relying on others' breath.

### Central Party Department Held a Memorial Service for Mr. Toyama Mitsuru, with Chairman Chen Acting as the Presider

○Nanjing, 23rd, Central News Agency - Mr. Toyama Mitsuru, a famous Japanese figure in the Allied Powers, passed away at Gotemba on the 14th of this month. When the bad news came, all of China's official and public circles deeply mourned. In addition to dedicating himself to Japanese nationalism, Mr. Toyama Mitsuru also helped a lot in China's revolution, and was indeed a friend of China's revolution. In order to commemorate Mr. Toyama Mitsuru's achievements during his lifetime, the Central Party Department held a memorial service for Mr. Toyama Mitsuru at the auditorium of the department at 10:00 a.m. on the 23rd. State Councilor Chen, acting as chairman, and Zhou, acting as prime minister of the Executive Yuan, attended the memorial service in person. More than 300 other officials from various ministries and councils, representatives from party and government agencies, and representatives from embassies and agencies of various countries in China attended. In the center of the hall, there was a portrait of Mr. Toyama Mitsuru, with wreaths presented by various officials such as Chen below, and memorial candles and couplets hanging all around. A dirge was played first, and Chairman Chen acted as the presiding officer, leading the whole body to pay the most respect to the portrait of Mr. Toyama Mitsuru, and silently mourned. Chairman Chen offered incense and flowers to the memorial service, and then read the memorial text of Chairman Wang and the memorial text of Foreign Minister Chu. Then, after State Councilor Zhang Yongfu reported on the deeds of his life, guests from the Japanese side, Minister Kunei, Lieutenant General Matsui, Lieutenant General Maeda, Rear Admiral Asahai, Economic Advisor Kawano, Consul General Tanaka, Chairman Maeda of the Civilian Corps, Minister De Guo, and Charge d'Affaires Subinaire of Italy, offered incense one after another. The memorial service began at 11:00 a.m. and ended in the sound of a dirge.

○Nanjing, 23rd, Central News Agency - The chairman believed that Mr. Toyama Mitsuru had strongly supported China's revolution in the past, and ordered to send a condolence gift of 100,000 yuan to express his condolences. Xu Suzhou, chief of the Civil Affairs Department of the National Government, recently sent a letter to Mr. Toyama Hideyuki, his family member, to convey the chairman's intentions. The original letter is recorded as follows: Dear Mr. Toyama Hideyuki, upon the chairman's discussion, Mr. Toyama Mitsuru strongly supported China's revolution in the past, and ordered to send a condolence gift of 100,000 yuan to express his condolences, etc. It is appropriate to send the national currency of 100,000 yuan with the letter. Please accept it for the memorial service. Sincerely, to Mr. Toyama Hideyuki, with 100,000 yuan of national currency attached.

### The Situation on the East Prussian Front Is Becoming Serious; Fierce Battles Are Unfolding in Southern Hungary

○Berlin, 23rd, Central News Agency - German News Agency: Yesterday and last night, street battles between the German and Soviet armies took place in the city of Goldap in eastern East Prussia. The development of the situation on the East Prussian border has become serious. Southeast of Gumbinnen, the German army is currently counterattacking, and the air force detachment has been sent to the area to participate in defensive operations.

○Berlin, 23rd, Central News Agency - Huitong News Agency: On the sixth day of the Soviet army's attack on East Prussia, it has changed its strategy. Instead of attacking between Schirwindt and Suwalki, it is now using a large number of tanks to attack south of Gumbinnen. The Soviet army's goal is to break through the fortresses built by civilians in several weeks. So far, the German army has been able to repel the Soviet army's attack on a 110-kilometer line. South of Heath, several Soviet infantry divisions are concentrating their attack. The Soviet army first attacked with tanks, but the terrain was not suitable for tanks, and they retreated due to the German army's resistance. North of Warsaw, the Soviet army did not launch a large-scale attack, and the breakthrough points near Serock and Rosen have been blocked. A major war has broken out in the Baja area in southern Hungary (Baja is located on the right bank of the Danube, 150 kilometers from Hongjing), and the Soviet army in Szolnok has been encircled and annihilated. North of Debrecen, the Soviet army has invaded the city of Nyíregyháza, and the city of Hajdúhadház, halfway between the two cities, has been recaptured by the German army.

### Anti-Axis Forces Occupy Lemnos Island

○Lisbon, 23rd, Central News Agency - According to a report from Rome, the Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters in the Mediterranean announced on the 22nd that the Anti-Axis Forces landed on Lemnos Island in the Aegean Sea on the 16th and will occupy it on the 17th.

### German Troops Retreat from Dubrovnik

○Berlin, 23rd, Central News Agency - Huitong News Agency: The German troops in the western Balkans have withdrawn from the city of Dubrovnik on the Dalmatian coast. The German troops have now reached a new position without any losses.

### German Troops on the Western Front Use New Weapons; Pocket Tanks Are Controlled by Radio Waves

○Berlin, 23rd, Central News Agency - German new weapons (pocket tanks) controlled by radio waves have recently been active on the Western Front, causing great distress to the Anti-Axis Forces. Recently, powerful new tank weapons have suddenly appeared on the battlefield, causing extreme fear to the Anti-Axis Forces. This new weapon is named the V4. According to reports, this type of tank is driven by a single driver to the designated target. Then, the driver disengages from the tank in front of the target, causing the tank to automatically launch radio waves, advancing towards the target. After releasing box-shaped naval mines upon reaching the target, it then releases smoke screens and returns to the German army's position.

○Berlin, 23rd, Central News Agency - Huitong News Agency: On the 21st, the focus of the battle on the Belgian-Dutch border was on the main road from Antwerp to Breda. The Canadian army advanced several kilometers in areas such as Heijt and Blijede. The intensity of the battle has increased without end. The Canadian army broke into Breskens on the 21st. The German army seems to have the intention of retreating to the northern passes of the Western Scheldt. However, occupying Breskens does not mean that Antwerp will be lost early. The Canadian First Army cannot easily subdue the artillery batteries of Hulst and South Beveland. Patrols from the British Second Army have appeared in the Nijmegen area and have been repelled. The battle west of Mount Frey has eased slightly. A soldier from Hawaii was captured for the first time. Information from him shows that the 442nd Regiment of the US Infantry is made up entirely of Hawaiians.

○Berlin, 23rd, Central News Agency - Huitong News Agency: The German Army Headquarters on the Western Front received a final message from the Aachen defenders yesterday afternoon, stating that ammunition, food, and water had all been exhausted. The message stated, "After hand-to-hand combat, the Aachen defenders have fired their last bullet. Water and food are also exhausted. The German soldiers defending Aachen send their last blessing to our beloved homeland. Heil Hitler!" On the 21st, the city commander ordered the soldiers, "I hope that the Aachen defenders will do their duty to the utmost while they still have a breath. May the Führer and our beloved homeland live forever!"

### The Problem of Black People in America - 3

— He Ling

The Struggle of Black People

Booker T. Washington, a famous Black educator and leader, and Marcus Garvey, a religious figure, both struggled for the improvement of the social status of Black people. Booker T. Washington once said: "White people may seem to defeat us, but we Black people can also defeat white people." This is a euphemistic way of expressing their fighting spirit. Since the last European war, the status of Black people, whether economically, politically, or personally, has gradually improved. Many have become wealthy, and the number of those receiving university education has also increased, especially in the American sports world, where they have emerged prominently. More and more Black faces are appearing as university football players. In addition, Black people have also excelled in car races and swimming. Even white people acknowledge the excellence of Black people as soldiers. During the Washington Naval Conference, some Americans were already shouting that if Japan and the United States entered a state of war, Japan would definitely arouse Black people in America to launch a rebellion. Today, Japan and the United States are at war, and Japan's brilliant war results, as well as the successive liberation of the Chinese, Filipino, Burmese, and Thai nations under the oppression of Britain and the United States, allowing each to find its place, and even planning to liberate India and make it independent, etc. The American people are most afraid of Japan's just attitude in all of these things, because Japan's national liberation movement is bound to arouse the awakening and rebellion of Black people at home. In the past, the American Communist Party attached great importance to the increasingly intense resentment of Black people towards American society and attempted to use it to disintegrate the United States. Even today, there are still a considerable number of Communist Party members among Black people, and their numbers are gradually increasing. They are certainly operating in close contact with the Soviet Union. Former Black journalist Dorothy Orr is very active in the propaganda department in Moscow, reaching out to the Black community in America. Undoubtedly, when the time comes, Black people will definitely participate in anti-American revolution. The resentment they have accumulated over the years from the coldness, insults, persecution, and discrimination they have suffered from white people is bound to erupt at some point! Recently, the social and political activities of Black people in America have been particularly significant. During Roosevelt's second presidential election in 1936, the Black People's Election Movement Committee, under the leadership of Chairman R.R. Wright, with the cooperation of Washington's Black church pastor and broadcaster Ada Wright and others, appealed to Black people living in the northern regions. As a result, 70 to 80% of Black people in the northern regions voted for Roosevelt. When this movement reached its climax, famous Rooseveltian intellectuals who sympathized with Black people attended Black community meetings and praised Black people, much to the delight of the Black people. In October of the same year, before the election, when a large speech was held in New York City's Madison Square Garden to support Roosevelt, the Black crowd reached 16,000 people, the largest gathering of Black people in history. The number of Black votes scattered across the 17 northern states was not as chaotic as in the South. The Black people's votes were entirely on one front, even holding the key to the victory or defeat of the election. There are many Black national organizations, the most famous of which is the National Negro Congress. The current president, A. Philip Randolph, is the president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. The secretary, John P. Davis, a Black scholar who graduated from Bates College and majored in law at Harvard University, is one of the founders of the Congress, and he controls the real power of the organization.

National Negro Congress

The National Negro Congress is engaged in the united solidarity of Black people and the strengthening of their common responsibility, governing many Black groups under its jurisdiction. The first Black Congress was held in Chicago in 1936, with representatives from various Black groups participating, totaling more than 1,000 people. Since then, its influence has expanded year by year, and now the Black youth groups in the South have also joined. Also, in St. Louis, there is a man named Aban Tiggs, who commands 48 Black groups. They launched a movement to close down gambling dens and brothels run by Black people in the city, and began to defend the rights of Black people. For example, if a store that catered to Black customers refused to hire Black clerks due to racial prejudice, Aban Tiggs immediately ordered his affiliated groups to launch a boycott of the store. As a result, Black customers stopped coming, and the store's business plummeted. The store owner finally accepted Aban Tiggs' request and hired Black clerks, and the matter was resolved. Also, once, Aban Tiggs sent a letter to the president of a large milk delivery company in the city, requesting the employment of Black delivery men to serve Black customers. The company ignored it. So Tiggs' representative visited the president and reiterated his request. However, the company still did not welcome Black delivery men. Therefore, they made the same request to another company. That company immediately agreed to hire six Black delivery men. The number of delivery applications to this company increased by 40% the next day. In contrast, the company that refused to hire Black delivery men saw its sales decline proportionally. The slogan of the Black groups is:

"Don't shop at stores that don't hire Black people."

From the recent economic resistance of Black people against white people, stores can be divided into three types:

1. Stores run entirely by Black people are called Black Faces.
2. Stores run jointly by Black and white people are called Black Tan.
3. Stores run entirely by white people are called Lily White.

Black people shop according to this hierarchy. This movement is now prevalent among Black people. Recently, Black people have begun to engage in significant activities, showing a powerful spirit of destined struggle for the future. (End)

### The Great Victory on the Seas off Taiwan Determines the Fate of the Enemy America: Minister Izubuchi's Valedictory Address

The More Victorious, the More Steadfast in Heart

This time, we have received long-awaited news of a great victory from the seas off Taiwan. I, like everyone else, wholeheartedly congratulate you. However, there is a common saying in Japan: "The more victorious, the more steadfast in heart." This means that in times of victory, one should not harbor arrogance but rather strengthen one's beliefs and fully prepare for the next battle, in order to achieve even greater success. This victory is indeed a very great achievement, but I dare say here that America is by no means an enemy who will give up after being attacked in this way. It will inevitably regroup, recover from its great defeat, and make more violent struggles. The Southern Mobile Unit of the MacArthur's force has already attacked the Philippines, landing on Leyte Island. I am afraid that the enemy's intentions are more than just this. In addition to directly attacking our Japanese homeland or the Chinese mainland, it is also conceivable that the American air force in Chongqing will act even more violently. However, if the enemy regroups to make a blind attack, it is truly an excellent opportunity for us. If the enemy makes another reckless invasion in the future, no matter where it comes, it will inevitably repeat the mistakes made on the seas off Taiwan. This trend is already very obvious. The enemy now admits that the American troops attacking Leyte Island in the Philippines are engaged in a hopeless struggle, and our Japanese headquarters announced the resounding victory on Leyte Island yesterday. From this, we can even more determine the enemy's fate in this area. The inner defense line is as solid as a rock.

However, in order to secure the domestic public sentiment for Roosevelt's campaign for a fourth term as president, the enemy America will probably make another adventurous move. The great war is still ahead, and the real victory is also in the future. Now is the time to be "the more victorious, the more steadfast in heart." The enemy's failure on the seas off Taiwan is a natural failure. Why do I say it is a natural failure? Because our Japanese inner defense line is as solid as a rock, and for him to act rashly is truly asking for his own destruction. So, what exactly is this inner defense line that is as solid as a rock? Let's first look at its formation: First, it is the battle line from north to south in the Pacific Ocean; second, it is the battle line on the Chinese mainland. I will not discuss the first line in the Pacific for the time being, and I will focus on the battle line on the Chinese mainland. The largest strategic line on the Chinese mainland has recently swept through Henan and Hunan provinces, and has penetrated deep into Guangxi province, with its stronghold Guilin within sight. In this way, it echoes the battle line in North China, forming a battle line that runs north and south across the mainland. At the same time, it controls the coastal strongholds of Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang provinces on the Chinese sea, deploying a watertight defense line along the entire coastline. Let us now discuss the tasks of the mainland strategic line: First, to suppress the enemy's air force in Chongqing, this effect has already given the enemy a severe lesson, causing a major obstacle to his attempt to launch a general counteroffensive in the Pacific. Second, to cope with the enemy's direct invasion of the mainland with a strong defense. As a result, the enemy's boast of a mainland landing operation is ultimately impossible.

But the enemy has not abandoned his ambition, hoping to attack Taiwan or the Philippines. On the one hand, he wants to cut off Japan's military supplies and resources, and on the other hand, he wants to invade the Chinese mainland and try to use force to invade East Asia. However, the Japanese army is always ready to destroy the enemy's actions and then turn to the offensive. Our side's strategy for certain victory has been as firm as a rock. So, how was this strategy for certain victory established? It is that our Japanese soldiers on the front lines and the production camps in the rear are united, concentrating all their efforts to destroy Britain and the United States. Moreover, the countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere are cooperating with each other as much as possible, advancing towards the path of eliminating Britain and the United States, and have taken on a very large task. In particular, our ally China has resolutely declared war on the enemy countries, strengthened relations between the two countries, and is advancing towards a common goal with a spirit of selflessness. This is truly admirable. The decisive battle is still ahead, and the situation of the war will also become more intense. We will never stop until we have completely eliminated the ugly enemies Britain and the United States and achieved final victory. I would like to share this with everyone here.

### Arrogant Soldiers Will Surely Be Defeated: Exterminate the Aggression of the Enemy America - Mr. Huang Jingzhai's Speech

The powerful might displayed by the Allied Japanese army, navy, and air force in the naval battle off Taiwan, the resounding victories they have achieved, and the progress of the ongoing battle in the Philippines are all very clear to everyone, I believe. What I want to say to everyone now is just a few of my personal thoughts on this great victory.

Correcting Concepts

First, while there are many people in our country who can truly understand the relationship between this battle off Taiwan and China's future, there are still many people who regard this naval battle as merely a war between Japan and the United States, and it seems to have nothing to do with China itself. This kind of concept should be corrected. This understanding is completely wrong. Why? Didn't we know long ago that the enemy American commander-in-chief Admiral Nimitz's plan and propaganda was to land on the Chinese mainland? So, the decisive battle in the waters off Taiwan this time is the prelude to the Chinese mainland landing operation in Nimitz's plan. They want to use Taiwan and the Philippines as their forward bases for attacking the Chinese mainland. If we understand this point, we will understand the great significance of this great victory for the future destiny of our China. In this world war, there is a country whose destiny is very worthy of our China's vigilance, and that is France. At the beginning of the European war, France was exploited by Britain and the United States, and as a result, it made its own country a sacrifice for Britain and the United States, and used its own territory as a battlefield. When the Second Front in Europe was established, who was the first to suffer from the attacks, destruction, and trampling of Britain and the United States? It was still France. France was sacrificed by Britain and the United States in this kind of unenviable situation. We have seen that the enemy America wants to use the Chinese mainland as a decisive battlefield to completely destroy New East Asia, and use the land, people, and resources of China as a sacrifice to achieve their aggressive ambitions. Can we not think of rising up and concentrating the total strength of the whole country to cooperate with the allies to extinguish the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States?

Arrogant Soldiers Will Surely Be Defeated

Second, a mourning army will surely win, while an arrogant army will surely be defeated. Although this is an ancient Chinese saying, it is a truth that cannot be broken. The British and Americans' attack on the Greater East Asia region this time is an act of aggression. Our participation in the Greater East Asia War is to defend the survival and liberation of East Asia, and thereby seek our own independence, autonomy, and freedom for China. The British and Americans are aggressors, and we are the invaded, so we are a mourning army. Moreover, since the battles of Saipan and Guam, the enemy Americans have gained a little victory and become unbearably arrogant. To fight with this kind of conceited and arrogant aggressive army and our righteous army that is fighting to defend its own survival, liberation, and freedom, the failure of the enemy Americans is inevitable. Although the enemy boasts of their material superiority, we believe that we can definitely defeat the aggressive efforts of Britain and the United States with the power generated by our spirit and belief, and the joint efforts of the 1 billion people of East Asia.

Joint Efforts

Third, the goal of the Chinese revolution is to seek the unity and unification of the Chinese nation internally, and to break free from aggressive forces and strive for China's autonomy, independence, survival, and liberation externally. More than 100 years of Chinese history is filled with the facts of British and American aggression, exploitation, trampling, and suppression of China. China has always been in a semi-colonial position and cannot turn over. This is entirely due to Britain and the United States. Now that the East Asian liberation war has reached its decisive stage, we must concentrate all our material and human resources and strengthen the system of cooperative warfare. Therefore, the completion of the goal of the Chinese revolution, and the acquisition of China's freedom and independence, must take the completion of East Asian liberation as a prerequisite. If East Asia is still controlled by Britain and the United States, then not only will Greater East Asia never have a day of liberation, but China's survival and rejuvenation will also be completely hopeless. Therefore, we are now truly at a time of life and death. In order to seek China's autonomy, independence, survival, and rejuvenation, and in order to seek East Asia's freedom and liberation, we must work together with the nations of East Asia, with the determination and belief to win, rise up and eliminate Britain and the United States, complete the war, restore China, and defend East Asia.

### In Order to Completely Maintain the Safety of Traffic and Communication and Expand Publicity, the Police Bureau of the City Will Launch a Traffic Safety Week

In order to maintain traffic safety as the top priority, the police in this city will launch a "Traffic Safety Week" starting on the 26th of this month, expanding publicity to ensure that the public deeply understands and strictly follows traffic rules. Yesterday (23rd) at 4:00 PM, a tea party was held in the club on the 7th floor of the bureau, inviting Chinese, Japanese, and foreign news media and radio stations in the city. The event was hosted by Director Lu of the Administrative Department, with Traffic Section Chief Chen Shantong and the directors of the administrative sections of each branch bureau serving as hosts. Present were Liang Xiuyu from the Municipal Propaganda Office (Secretary Pan Bibi on behalf) and dozens of reporters from Chinese, Japanese, and foreign newspapers. Director Lu Qi explained the essentials of traffic safety at the meeting. His original words are as follows: In today's Shanghai, traffic safety is indeed a current and important issue in police work, and a problem that urgently needs to be improved. According to the statistics of traffic accident records of this bureau, compared with last year and this year, in the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), the number of adults seriously injured due to traffic accidents was 1,504, and the number of children was 48. The number of deaths was 483 for adults and 17 for children. However, this year, as of September, the number of adults seriously injured due to traffic accidents has reached 1,111, and the number of children is 16. Based on these figures, it can be seen that the occurrence of traffic accidents has increased significantly. In today's Shanghai, its importance is even more obvious and urgent. Reorganizing urban traffic to ensure traffic safety and promote traffic welfare is the natural task of the traffic police. The effect depends on the activity of the traffic police and the general traffic reorganization facilities. However, the level of citizens varies, and they do not abide by traffic regulations and do not understand the meaning of the activities of the traffic police. No matter how hard the traffic police officers work and how dutiful they are, it is difficult to achieve satisfactory results. Any city that wants to achieve the goal of good traffic order must have a well-organized and properly managed traffic police organization, but the public's traffic knowledge and the cultivation of traffic ethics are even more critical issues. This spring, when I was ordered to go to the East to study police administration and stayed in Tokyo, I saw many traffic police officers on the roads, and the order of vehicles and pedestrians was orderly, and the public's traffic knowledge was popularized to the effect, which was very obvious. Looking back at this city, not to mention the villagers who have just arrived, but even the citizens who have lived here for a long time lack understanding of traffic regulations. In the end, in the city streets, vehicles and pedestrians are intertwined and chaotic, the order is chaotic, and the increase in traffic accidents is inevitable. In view of the current increase in traffic accidents and the seriousness of the traffic order problem, this bureau will hold another Traffic Safety Week from the 26th of this month, using various publicity methods. The purpose is to: 1. Popularize citizens' traffic safety ideas. 2. Make the public understand the meaning and function of the traffic police. 3. Cultivate the public's habit of respecting traffic discipline. 4. Promote traffic ethics. 5. Make citizens pay attention to the methods of avoiding traffic dangers. In short, we seek to make traffic knowledge universal and deeply rooted in every citizen, so that citizens can be guaranteed traffic safety. This bureau sincerely hopes that the holding of Traffic Safety Week can arouse the greatest attention and cooperation of all citizens, recognizing that traffic safety is their own life safety. Based on this goal, we firmly believe that the traffic order in this city can be significantly improved in the future, and the general damage will tend to decrease day by day.

A Glimpse of the Main Tasks of This Session

The main tasks of this "Traffic Safety Movement" are: 1. Paint yellow lines at major intersections, marked as "[No Pedestrians Crossing the Street]," to facilitate traffic. 2. Mobilize more than 1,000 people from the Baojia offices and self-defense corps at major intersections to cooperate in maintaining traffic.

A Glimpse of the Publicity Materials for This "Traffic Safety Movement"

1. Giant banners with the slogan "[Safety First]" are hung at major intersections throughout the city.
2. Giant slogans and logos of "[Safety First]" are posted on trams, buses, theaters, and public places throughout the city.
3. "[Safety First]" logos are posted in the shop windows of major street stores to remind pedestrians to pay attention.
4. "[Safety First]" slides and films are distributed to cinemas throughout the city for rotation.
5. "[Safety First]" logos are distributed to all motor vehicles in the city for conspicuous display.
Additional "[Automobile Driver's Guide]" leaflets are issued to motor vehicle drivers.
6. "[Safety First]" logos and polite remarks are pasted on the backs of tricycles and rickshaws to remind citizens to pay attention.
Additional "[Tricycle Driver's Guide]" and "[Rickshaw Puller's Guide]" leaflets are issued to tricycle drivers and rickshaw pullers.
7. Picture advertisements of "[Safety First]" are pasted on electric welding wood.
8. The Baojia offices are entrusted with distributing traffic regulations that "[Bicycle Drivers]" and "[Pedestrians]" should observe.

### Minister Matsudaira Discusses the Increasingly Meddlesome Relationship Between Chongqing and the United States; Will Further Interfere in Chongqing's Internal Affairs

The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held its regular press conference yesterday (23rd) at 2:30 PM at the Hua Chou Hotel on the Bund in Nanjing Road, as usual. Minister of Information Matsudaira of the Embassy and Vice Consul Fukuma, on the spot, Minister Matsudaira gave the following impressions on the recent deterioration of relations between Chongqing and the United States:

Recently, American public opinion toward Chongqing has gradually deteriorated, especially after a group of American journalists went to Yan'an for investigation in June of this year, and their report clearly stated the situation of the "war zone," pointing out that there were many shortcomings in the "war" power, which increased the most after the Hunan front incident, specifically criticizing Chongqing for poor politics and attacking it completely. At the same time, the criticism in the American newspapers is clear and explicit, and the situation is nothing more than that the American Fairy wants to make further interference in the internal affairs of the Chongqing regime, and it will definitely happen. It has been found that in the past, when the United States interfered in the internal affairs of other countries, it first used newspapers to criticize and denounce the politics of that country, which is a consistent means adopted by the United States, and the same means are also adopted for South America, especially for our East Asia, which is even more blatant, and they despise the countries of East Asia and believe that their culture is low. Now the American interference in Chongqing's opinions is to military, political, and culturalize the Chongqing regime. The main goal is to force Chongqing to remove the cadres of the Three People's Principles Youth League from the Chongqing political institutions. Recently, American Ambassador to Chongqing Gauss specifically made several demands to Chiang Kai-shek. According to the information obtained, it is deeply believed that after the enemy America's naval defeat in the eastern sea off Taiwan and the Pacific Ocean, it will inevitably make greater demands on Chongqing and interfere with Chongqing's ineffective operations in the Guilin area. From this point of view, it is clear that the United States wants to add the fate of Iran and Iraq to Chongqing, and add a new worry to the fate of the East Asian nations. Moreover, the United States is oppressing Chongqing to accept the conditions of the Communist Party, implement the cooperation between Chongqing and the Communist Party, and does not consider Chongqing's own intentions, which is really forcing others to do what is difficult.

### Coal Briquettes Will Be Distributed in the Nanshi, Zhabei, and West Shanghai Districts

The Municipal Goods Distribution Office has already fully prepared the coal briquettes for household distribution in the Nanshi, Zhabei, and West Shanghai districts of this city, and will issue them for sale separately in the coming days. The supplementary distribution of soybeans and soap will also be expedited to order designated retailers to replenish their sales quickly.

### The Pre-Victory Speech Meeting Ended Successfully Yesterday; Minister Izubuchi and Huang Jingzhai

The "[Wipe Out the British and American Fleets Pre-Victory Meeting]" jointly convened by the Shanghai News Federation and the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Municipal Welfare Association, etc., was the last day yesterday. It was still held at the Grand Theater at noon after the ceremony was held as usual. First, Xu Liqiu, representing the presidium of the conference, delivered the opening remarks, followed by speeches by the Minister of the Allied Army News Department, Izubuchi, and the monthly chairman of the News Federation, Huang Jingzhai (the speeches are on the second page). The words were alarming, and the listeners were moved. Finally, music and singing began, performed by the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, and famous Chinese and Japanese singers were invited to sing, and the atmosphere was extremely warm. The Shanghai Symphony Orchestra performed, conducted by Ryoichi Hattori. Ayako Watanabe, Tomiko Hattori, Meifang Hu, Leiming Li and other famous Chinese and Japanese singers were responsible for singing. The program was wonderful, the applause was incessant, and it dispersed at about 7:00 PM.

### All Circles in This City Commemorate Elder Toyama

The Allied elder Toyama Mitsuru, before his death, made many contributions to the cooperation in our country's revolution. Recently, he returned to the mountains. The government and the public of our country mourned. The Shanghai Special Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Propaganda Office, and the East Asia League Shanghai Branch jointly held a citywide memorial service for all walks of life at the Jade Buddha Temple on Jiangning Road yesterday (23rd) at 10:00 AM to express their condolences. Chairman Liu Yangshan presided over the ceremony, and heads of various agencies and celebrities from all walks of life attended, including Huan Lvdeng, Zheng Hongnian, Xiong Dong, Liang Xiuyu, Li Quanshi, Chen Binhe, Zhou Minying, Xi Peiwen, Chen Riping, Zhang Enlin, Yuan Chang, and Wu Chengzi, as well as Allied officials Kumagai, head of the liaison department, Yano, consul general, Matsudaira, minister of information, Matsushima, leader of the unit's news department, and Izubuchi, head of the army news department, numbering no less than hundreds of people. Mayor Chen, Secretary-General Wu, and the heads of various bureaus and Allied Minister Usami, and Chinese and Japanese social groups all gave flower wreaths. The memorial ceremony was held on time, with extreme mourning.

### The Quality of Household Rice is Poor, and We Urgently Hope to Find Ways to Improve it, Containing Ash, Sand, Bran, and Grains

The Municipal Goods Distribution Office of this city has distributed two municipal bushels of rice with the No. 23 comprehensive distribution certificate at the rice retailers or public sale places in the former First District since the 22nd of this month. The citizens in this area have suffered from the high prices of rice on the black market, and they have been very active in going to buy rice after hearing the news. However, it is reported that the household rice in this period is divided into three types: Indica rice, brown rice, or glutinous rice, but at present, the rice quality of most of the retailers is mostly very poor. Some of the rice sold in some stores contains ash, sand, bran, and grains. The citizens are extremely angry about this, and urgently hope that the relevant parties will earnestly find ways to improve and rescue them.

### Police Department Personnel Adjustments

The police department recently made personnel adjustments. Lu Lu, the chief of the administrative section of the Old Zha Division, was transferred to serve in the Security Administration Section of the Administrative Office. The vacancy was filled by Zhou Liansheng, the chief of the administrative section of the Lujiawan Division, who was transferred to the position. The position of chief of the administrative section of the Lujiawan Division was then filled by Lou Bin, the leader of the 14th Squad of the 4th Brigade of the Security Police, and the 10th Squad. The aforementioned personnel all reported for duty yesterday. Over a hundred clerks in the bureau have been transferred to the positions of second and third-class police assistants, and some have been sent to the training center for training.

### Enforcement of Light Control for Ordinary Vehicles

The Police Defense Department of the Municipal Police Bureau, having reviewed the amended Table No. 3 of the Shanghai Municipal Light Control Regulations, added tricycles and pedicabs to the category of ordinary vehicles. The Shanghai Land and Sea Air Defense Headquarters officially announced this in Notice No. 27 on October 14th of this year. Considering past circumstances, these ordinary vehicles have not been effectively controlled. Field police officers standing on roads or sidewalks often do not pay attention to or correct ordinary vehicles that do not have lights or lack control equipment. Therefore, each division chief has been ordered to instruct their officers to thoroughly implement the regulations and to inform vehicle owners to comply promptly to ensure full control.

### Exemption of Consumption Special Tax for Funeral Supplies and Clothing

The Funeral Supplies and Clothing Industry Association, in order to reduce the burden on bereaved families, requested the Ministry of Finance to exempt them from the consumption special tax. It is reported that the association has received a clear order No. 76 from the Ministry of Finance, Tax Division A, approving a combined exemption.

The 24th press conference was held as usual at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 23rd) at the Municipal Government Conference Room on Jiangxi Road. Secretary Pan Bide of the Municipal Propaganda Office attended and presided on behalf of Director Liang, reporting on the written responses of the Merchants' Association to various questions raised by reporters from various news agencies in this city. The following is an excerpt of the questions and answers: Rice and Grain Issues: Question the Rice and Grain Control Committee

1.  Central News Agency asks: During wartime, all measures are primarily based on military needs, but nurturing the people is essential for warfare, as the people nurture the war effort. This is an immutable principle that the Chairman has proclaimed. What is the overall strategy for coordinating military rice and civilian rice? How can the supply of rice for military needs be ensured, and what guarantees are there for the allocation of rice to the people? 2. Central News Agency asks: What is the current state of rice collection in various regions? Are farmers truly benefiting from it, and are there any unscrupulous elements taking advantage of the situation to exploit and manipulate? 3. Central News Agency asks: What is the current price of rice in this city, how is the price standard determined, and has there been consultation with the Price Review Council? 4. Chinese Daily asks: The price of rice is the main factor in commodity prices. To suppress commodity prices, the price of rice must be suppressed first. Currently, the price of rice is skyrocketing, stimulating a uniform rise in other commodity prices. How does the Commodity Control Committee plan to deal with the rice price issue? 5. Chinese Daily asks: The amount of rice allocated per household in this city is too small, forcing citizens to seek it on the black market. However, due to restrictions on free imports, the supply of rice on the black market is limited, leading to unmet demand. In the past, suggestions have been made to either increase the allocation of rice per household or relax restrictions on rice imports. Could the Rice Control Committee consider adopting one of these suggestions or have other good ideas to alleviate the food shortage and address the livelihood issues? Answer: The above five questions all pertain to rice and grain issues and are quite important. We should send a letter to the Rice and Grain Control Committee to answer them, which will be more straightforward.

Reasons for Price Increase in Allocated Flour

6.  Ping Bao asks: The allocated price of flour has increased by one and a half times. Please explain the reason. Answer: The allocated price of flour has increased by one and a half times because the cost of flour production is higher due to the newly set purchase price of wheat. All transportation and other costs have also increased, as have the prices of various commodities. Therefore, the previously set prices for flour and bran in various regions must be reassessed to balance income and expenditure. After repeated discussions with all relevant parties and careful consideration, it was deemed necessary to make adjustments. The Flour and Wheat Control Committee has already reported this directly to the Executive Yuan and has also informed the Commodity Control Committee.

Next Period's Allocation of Cotton Cloth per Household

7.  Central News Agency asks: Peddlers buying and selling cotton cloth allocation certificates are ubiquitous on the streets, disrupting the allocation policy. Has your committee noticed this, and what is your attitude towards it? Answer: Buying and selling are not allowed according to regulations and should be cracked down upon by administrative agencies. 11. Central News Agency asks: Cloth stalls in the Nanyang Bridge and Ningxia Road area were previously discussed for crackdown, and your committee also banned them once, but now the situation has worsened, and the business area has expanded. Although there are many reasons for this, what is your committee's determination to crack down on this? Answer: It should be cracked down upon by the city's administrative agencies according to regulations.

Commodity Control is Still in its Initial Stages

12. Chinese Daily asks: The city's commodity control work has been dealing with trivial matters and has failed to get on the right track. Is it because the organizational structure is not yet perfect, or is it due to personnel issues? Please explain. Answer: Commodity control is still a pioneering endeavor in the Republic of China. It can be said that there are no precedents and a lack of experienced people. In the process of implementation, trivial matters are bound to arise. Although the achievements of commodity control in friendly countries can be used as a reference, the national conditions are different, and there are some things that are not very suitable. Commodity control has been implemented for more than a year, and we are gradually making adjustments. In the future, it will gradually get on the right track. 13. Chinese Daily asks: Reporters from various news agencies often find that there is no one responsible for liaison when interviewing for news about the Commodity Control Committee, resulting in a lot of isolation from the outside world. At the same time, when inquiries are made, the answers are often irrelevant or unhelpful, making it a futile effort. We hope that methods can be found to improve this in the future. Answer: Our committee has always assigned a secretary in charge of compiling and issuing news and announcements. However, due to internal organizational changes in July of this year, the focus of all commodity control matters has been shifted to the various control committees under its jurisdiction. Sometimes, when reporters come to our committee to inquire about the current state of implementation of various commodity controls, it may not be possible to provide immediate answers. Furthermore, there are times when reporters are received by personnel who are not specifically responsible, which leads to inaccurate answers. This is inevitable. In the future, we will instruct our staff to pay attention to this at all times. 14. Chinese Daily asks: Since the beginning of the city's commodity control work, it has often failed to conduct thorough investigations of local conditions, leading to frequent changes in orders, which have instead stimulated price increases and affected people's livelihoods. What is the reason for this? Answer: Changes in control orders may be due to factual changes in circumstances. Not all control orders are subject to change. The term "frequent changes in orders" does not specify which orders are being referred to. Please provide specific examples for us to answer.

### My Views on Applications for Cotton Product Removals

— Translated by Cui Wen

The Commodity Control Committee, in order to specialize tasks and improve administrative efficiency, transferred the work of applying for the removal of cotton products to the Cotton Control Committee for direct handling. If we look at it from the perspective of following established rules, with responsibility in the hands of specialists, its work efficiency should be no less than that of the previous Commodity Control Committee. However, the reality is the opposite, leading to much public criticism that the Cotton Control Committee is intentionally delaying the process. Although some criticisms may be exaggerated, the difficulty of applying for removals is not something that outsiders can fully understand. For example, if an application takes too long, even if the removal is approved, the validity of the permit becomes questionable. It is a difficult situation to navigate, requiring much thought. Therefore, the applicant's desire for "speed" is driven by the circumstances. I, despite my limited knowledge, will list several points based on my observations for the benefit of those with greater insights.

1.  Publicly Announce Restrictions: The Cotton Control Committee should publicly announce any cotton products that are not permitted for removal or are prohibited from export due to conflicting with the Cotton Control Committee's regulations. This will avoid repeated applications, wasted time, and hinder normal work progress. 2. Reduce Entries: The Committee should temporarily reject incomplete applications or applications with excessively low unit prices. It should point out the errors and accept them again after correction, to avoid discovering errors after acceptance, which will affect the variable time wasted. 3. Set Official Prices: To reduce entries, correct official prices should be set. Current commodity prices fluctuate constantly. For example, when goods shipped from North China arrive in Shanghai after obtaining a permit, much time has passed, rendering the approved unit price obsolete. The Committee may disapprove of excessively low unit prices, in the belief that high prices are correct. Applicants, to please the Cotton Control Committee, will then strive to inflate the permitted unit prices, leading to inflated applications and potentially stimulating price increases at any time. The best approach is for the Cotton Control Committee (or a public association familiar with cotton prices) to publish an accurate price for each period monthly, adjusting it according to market fluctuations, allowing applicants (regardless of the unit price or quantity of the permit) to increase or decrease the quantity of goods to be removed. 4. Submit Samples: For goods outside the published prices, or goods of unclear type even if priced beforehand, applicants should submit original samples for a proper price assessment, before being approved for removal. 5. Old Approvals Remain Valid: The Cotton Control Committee should uphold the validity of the removal approvals previously granted by the Commodity Control Committee, to avoid applicants unfamiliarity with the new procedures, leading to errors that affect the Cotton Control Committee's work progress.

### Navy

After standing for over an hour, Takao's legs felt a little sore, and his stomach was empty. He remembered that he hadn't had breakfast. And there was little hope of getting lunch. If he left his position, someone would immediately take his place. "Hey! Have you had breakfast?"

Takao finally felt sympathy for his sister and asked a question. His sister didn't look at his face; she just shook her head. Her face looked pale. By one twenty in the afternoon, Takao had completely forgotten his fatigue and hunger. Because he knew that at this time, the coffins would depart from the Naval Ministry. Before long, security guards ran around to the various checkpoints to inspect and maintain order. When Takao felt the procession approaching, he stood on tiptoe to look. The officers leading the way appeared. The priests in white robes also appeared. As they quietly walked towards the front, it seemed like he could hear a mournful chirping sound. (Ah! That's the coffin!)

In an instant, Takao saw the white coffin carried on the black gun carriage. He didn't notice that the coffin, wrapped in white silk, was protected by eighteen officers. He immediately closed his eyes and lowered his head, only listening to the sound of the coffin passing by. (The ghost is walking... the ghost is...) The ghost sneered and looked at him from the gun carriage. As a result, Takao couldn't bear this illusion and began to cry loudly. This was like an acute infection; the rest of the crowd also began to sob. However, only his sister didn't cry. She sat demurely on the dirt platform, clasping her hands in prayer without moving. Although her biting lips trembled, there was no crying or tears. In the park, the navy band began to play "For the Country."

When Takao opened his eyes, the representatives of the bereaved families had already passed by, and the family's mourning procession was now walking in front of him. (Ah, that's the ghost's mother.) He saw the small, hunched-over great-grandmother in the black mourning procession. Next to her, very much like the ghost, was his fourth younger brother, dressed in national uniform, running along. (Oh my! Mr. Ogata is also there...) Perhaps he was participating as a representative of the teacher. He was wearing a full dress with a black armband, his slightly chubby upper body swaying. Takao deeply felt the atmosphere of his hometown, trying to suppress his emotion towards the ghost, and also trying to suppress his desire to greet them. After the mourning procession had completely passed, the crowd began to move. Takao continued to wait until the memorial service was over, still not wanting to leave suddenly. After a little while, his sister slowly stood up. Takao suddenly saw that his sister's kneecaps were bleeding from kneeling for too long. (154) [P The YWCA cordially welcomes visitors>

The Shanghai Christian Young Women's Christian Association, in order to maintain various expenses for the next year, began a fundraising campaign on the 6th of this month with a goal of eight million yuan. In order to inform the outside world of the work situation, it is specifically scheduled to invite people from all walks of life to visit the nursery and children's home sponsored by the association from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM on the 24th of this month. The nursery is still a pioneering undertaking in Shanghai, and the association's excellent management has won social support. People who are enthusiastic about social undertakings and interested in children's work are welcome to visit. Heavily in debt, and with the cold weather approaching, hundreds of children are in danger of freezing and starvation. It is earnestly hoped that charitable people from all over the world will generously donate, so that the institution can maintain its future without worry. Donations of any amount are welcome, and this office can also collect and transfer them.

### Returning Lost Property

Submitted to the French Tram Company

Respected Sirs, At nine o'clock this morning, I found a blue cloth parcel at the tram station at the 16th Pier, containing banknotes. I waited for a long time, but no one came to claim it, so I had to take it on Tram No. 70 and hand it over to Ticket Seller No. 429 to be forwarded to the French Tram Company for safekeeping, pending collection. Luo Chen respectfully, residing in the Dong residence at the Yingkang Lumber Company in Dongchang Road, Pudong.

### Pork Industry Sellers' Dispute: Donation to Help the Home for the Aged

○ Goal: Five million yuan ○ Period: Until November 10th ○ Collection Point: Shanghai District Livestock Industry Pork Retailers' Association. Recently, due to a dispute in the trade among colleagues, a buyer delivered 20 fresh pigs to the association to be operated, and the resulting profits were donated to the Home for the Aged, which is commendable. The original letter is transcribed as follows: [Regarding a certain party selling at black market prices, a dispute arose between the two parties. Subsequently, Kui, He Azhang, Gu Tangsheng, Lu Xikui, and Qin Shunfu mediated, and the seller delivered 20 fresh pigs at market prices to our association for sale without commission, covering the cost, and donated all the profits to charity. Now, after all the sales, a profit of 27,300 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates has been calculated. The mediators have gathered 30,000 yuan and sent it to your office with a special letter, requesting that it be forwarded to the Home for the Aged for expenses. Although the amount is small, it does not compensate for the actual needs, but their sincerity is commendable. We hope that the facts will be published in the newspapers to encourage others to follow suit. We will be most grateful.]
