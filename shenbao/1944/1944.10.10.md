### Wishes for National Day

Time flies, and another year easily passes; it's National Day again. As usual for National Day, we commemorate and celebrate, and as usual, we write articles to mark the occasion. However, observing the current situation and environment, we can hardly celebrate leisurely. Today, we have no special advice, but rather, we revisit old lessons. As the saying goes, "Reviewing the old helps one understand the new," and we should be even more vigilant and practice in the future. We list several wishes to share with fellow countrymen: First, wishes regarding the individual. First of all, understand the times and the environment. Currently, we face the era of the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War. To strive for final victory, everyone has the responsibility to contribute their strength. How can we contribute our strength? On the one hand, actively work hard in our respective positions. Everyone has their own duties, and duties are positions. Therefore, it is not necessarily only going to the front lines and charging into battle that counts as contributing strength. Modern warfare is total war, which is the sum of the strength of all aspects and departments. Everyone's position, within the scope of total war, has a part of the strength. As long as we work hard in our own positions and increase efficiency, then we have contributed strength and fulfilled our share of responsibility in the decisive battle. On the other hand, it is to practice wartime living. Wartime living at least contains an atmosphere of hardship and seriousness. Therefore, wasteful and undisciplined living is definitely not a phenomenon that wartime living should have. Practicing wartime living aims not only to conserve materials, but also to cultivate habits of hardship and seriousness, and to strengthen one's will. In allied Japan, 100 million people are united and engaged in the war. Some people have not tasted meat for several months. Their habits of hardship and frugality are truly worthy of our emulation. Second, wishes regarding the local area. People in any area must bear the responsibility of protecting everything in the place where they live. For example, if we live in Shanghai, then we have a responsibility to protect Shanghai. [The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every individual.] We can even say: [The rise and fall of Shanghai is the responsibility of the people of Shanghai.] If the responsibility of protecting the local area is fulfilled, the rear can be stabilized, and we can contribute even greater strength to the front lines. Therefore, local affairs should be the joint responsibility of local people. They must be enthusiastic about public welfare and must not stand idly by, let alone watch from across the river. We must recognize that [if the skin is gone, what will the hair attach to?]. If the local security is poor, then local people will never have peace. Third, regarding the nation. We look around at the current national situation, which is fragmented and broken, which is truly heartbreaking. The more difficult the country is, the more we must love our country. Past failures have been due to the general lack of a national concept. People without a national concept will never understand the importance of Greater East Asia, nor will they understand the importance of the liberation war. However, the Greater East Asia War is already a war that determines the fate of the countries and nations of Greater East Asia. The rise and fall of Greater East Asia depends on this battle, and the success or failure of China naturally also depends on this battle. Finally, regarding allied Japan, [Without Japan, there is no China; without China, there is no Japan] has already been recognized by enlightened people in both China and Japan. The new Japanese policy towards China and the meaning of the new order of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere must be widely understood by the Chinese people. How can the Chinese people widely understand this? We believe that [winning the hearts of the people] is the first priority. We should look at the big picture and start with the immediate. The decision of all policies and measures must first gain the support of the Chinese people, especially to gain the understanding of community leaders first, so that it can be conveyed to the general public. We also believe that military, political, and economic aspects should be equally emphasized, all with [winning the hearts of the people] as the first priority. China itself should also adopt an extremely sincere attitude to jointly cope with the decisive battle situation.

### Japanese Army Completes Horizontal and Vertical Operations on the Mainland

Crushing the Chongqing-US Counter-Offensive Attempt Japanese Army Base, Central News Agency, 9th - According to Navy reporter Mitani, a telegram from a certain Japanese warship stated: Since the enemy United States began its counter-offensive on Guadalcanal Island, it has successfully seized some islands in the Pacific at the cost of heavy sacrifices. The enemy US, relying on its large amount of iron, adopted a mainland landing offensive operation plan on paper, and began a comprehensive counter-offensive in the Pacific, while also planning to strengthen the US Air Force in Chongqing, which served as a base on the mainland. On the other hand, the enemy fears that Japan will use Southern resources to increase its combat power, so in order to prevent this, in addition to dispatching the Air Force, it also densely deployed submarines in the waters near Japan and the East China Sea to attempt to cut off the Japanese army's supply lines and weaken the Japanese combat power. Especially Wenzhou and Fuzhou were highly valued by the enemy US, and they were actively defended. Because these two places are the best supply bases for enemy submarines, and they can also be reused as footholds when the US military launches a landing offensive on the mainland. In addition, the enemy also strengthened its air force in flight bases near the East China Sea, such as Lishui, Ganzhou, Yushan, Jian'ou, and Longyan, in order to defeat Japanese fleets. They also infiltrated the blockade line of the Japanese fleet stationed in China, and set up surveillance posts and observation platforms on uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, attempting to establish contact with the US Air Force base in Chongqing and enemy submarines. The XX unit of the Japanese fleet stationed in China, in order to crush the enemy's ambitions, continued to land in many places such as XXXXXXXXXX after capturing Wenzhou, tightened the coastal blockade, and secured footholds, leaving enemy submarines and aircraft with no room for activity. On September 27, when the army landed northeast of Fuzhou, the navy was responsible for escorting, and the landing operation was completed without bloodshed. The significance of capturing Wenzhou and Fuzhou this time lies in obtaining strategically important results. Since the success of the horizontal and vertical operations on the mainland, the supply lines of the US Air Force base in Chongqing, which is adjacent to the southeastern coast of China, have been cut off and they are in an isolated state. There is no way out other than self-destruction. At this point, Nimitz and MacArthur also realized the difficulty of landing operations on the mainland. Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - Fuzhou, the largest key point on the coast of Fujian Province, has fallen, and the defense of the Japanese army's operations on the coast of China has been further consolidated. The Japanese army recently occupied Wenzhou, and now it has also occupied Fuzhou. The coastal area of ​​China, from Hainan Island, Guangzhou Bay, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, and other mobile bases in the south, to the Yellow Sea coast north of Shanghai, is occupied by the Japanese army. Now, Wenzhou and Fuzhou, the two major strongholds within 500 kilometers of the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, have also been occupied by the Japanese army, which is very beneficial to the Japanese army's operations. It has dealt a major blow to the counter-offensive of the Chongqing army and the US Air Force in Chongqing. The Chongqing authorities are reorganizing the defeated army, waiting for the Japanese army's front line to be extended, and are ready to attack at any time. However, the Japanese army has now advanced from the military stage to the political stage, which should not be ignored.

### Surprise Attack on Airfield Near Chengdu

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Headquarters announced at 3 p.m. on the 9th: ○ The Japanese air force in China, braving bad weather on the night of the 7th, launched a preemptive surprise attack on airfields near Chengdu, where the US Air Force was gathering, inflicting heavy damage on them. ○ As for the battle results, at the Pengshan airfield, 23 B-29s, 19 small aircraft, and 2 aircraft of unknown type, totaling 44 aircraft, were destroyed and set on fire. In addition, one ground facility was set on fire after being hit. The results at other airfields could not be confirmed in detail due to bad weather, except that several places were seen to be on fire. ○ The Japanese side lost one aircraft by self-destruction. A certain Japanese base on the Chinese front, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese air force bombed Chengdu in the rain on the night of the 7th. The Chongqing aircraft were about to take off, but were delayed due to the weather. The Japanese aircraft took the opportunity to launch a preemptive strong attack, and it was confirmed that 23 aircraft were destroyed and 4 were burned. The Japanese aircraft returned safely. At the same time, the Japanese aircraft detachment also raided the Xinjin Daping Temple and Baoza airfields, destroying ground and aviation facilities.

### Preemptive Strike Yields Great Results

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Air Force launched a surprise attack on the Chengdu airfield on the 7th in order to suppress the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, destroying a total of 44 Chongqing and US aircraft. The significance of this operation is very important and different from past operations to destroy B-29 aircraft, because this time the Japanese aircraft went to bomb just as the enemy aircraft were taking off, so under the Japanese army's preemptive strike strategy, they suffered heavy losses. Looking back, the enemy aircraft bombed South Manchuria twice on September 8 and 26, but suffered losses of 40 aircraft on the 8th and 35 aircraft on the 26th due to the Japanese air force's interception. However, although they suffered heavy blows, they still attempted to bomb the Japanese mainland, so this time the Japanese army aircraft took preemptive action, causing the Chengdu airfield to suffer heavy damage. According to reports, the Japanese Air Force braved bad weather and set off in heavy rain that day. After searching for a long time, they finally discovered the Chongqing and US aircraft groups concentrated at the Pengshan airfield south of Xinjin, and launched a fierce attack, causing them to lose 44 aircraft. It is estimated that 23 of the destroyed and burning B-29 aircraft were B-29 type aircraft, and the remaining 19 were small aircraft. In addition, another team also bombed Xinjin Wanxian and the Pacific airfields on the same day, and achieved great results. In just one month, they caused them to lose 119 aircraft, while the Japanese side only lost one aircraft.

### Fierce Fighting on the First Line of Guangxi

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to the Chongqing correspondent of the American Times newspaper on the 8th, the Japanese and Chongqing armies are currently engaged in fierce fighting on the first line of Guangxi, and the rear of the two armies is very active in fighting. In addition to repairing the Pinghan Railway, the Japanese army is also repairing the Yuehan Railway, directly to the south of Hengyang, to transport weapons and military supplies for the large-scale offensive against Guilin. The Chongqing army is trying to block the Japanese offensive. Bai Chongxi visited Chiang Kai-shek three weeks ago, and flew to Guilin the next day to personally command the operation. Currently, the Chongqing army is continuously dispatching reinforcements to the Guilin area, and the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is also doing its best to supply the Chongqing defenders. In addition, five divisions of student soldiers have also begun to be recruited.

### Japanese Army in Guangxi and Hunan Takes Encirclement Position

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to the Associated Press correspondent in Chongqing, the situation in Guangxi and Hunan is as follows: The war situation in southeastern China has reached its climax, and the Battle of Guilin is imminent. At this moment, the Japanese army has gradually adopted an encircling offensive in the central region, using two huge currents of encirclement to advance towards Guilin, which is located in 300 highlands. Others are heading south along the Xiang-Gui Railway from the northeast, breaking through the Chongqing army's security line in Xing'an and advancing 20 kilometers west, reaching the second ferry port in Lishui (40 kilometers from Guilin). In front of this place, there is a narrow gap in the Lishui River valley, which is the entrance to the Guilin Plain. One of them advances from Pingle (the transportation hub that controls the southeast) and adopts a wide-ranging encirclement. According to reports, the Japanese army advanced 56 kilometers last week and then suspended its advance to reorganize its troops. ○ In the southern region, the Japanese army is advancing rapidly along the West River from Guangdong. Last week, it arrived in Pingnan and headed north to Pingle. From this, the Japanese army has established contact with the troops attacking Guilin from the south. However, from the point of view of the Japanese army advancing west to Jiangkou, it can be seen that the Japanese army will further advance to Liuzhou to block Guilin from the south, forcing the Chongqing army in the city to retreat westward over the mountains, or even sail directly to Nanning, thereby establishing a transportation line from Korea to Zhao Nan. At the same time, they will crush the last resistance of the Baoqing Chongqing army in Hunan and the northwestern region. At present, the Japanese army in this area is advancing towards Guiyang step by step, but the highway leading to Guiyang is extremely unfavorable for vehicles to travel on, and there are continuous mountains that are easy to defend. Because the occupation of Guiyang is only the first step in blocking Kunming, from the above points, the strong attack of the Baoqing Japanese army is expected to be just a cover for the flank attack on Guilin.

### Japanese Army on Biak Island Completes Mission to Defend the Territory

Japanese Army Ministry Praises the Spirit of Colonel Katsume Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - On May 27, enemy troops landed on Biak Island in northwestern New Guinea. The Japanese army's Colonel Katsume's troops stationed there bravely engaged the enemy, which consisted of one division, under heavy bombing, launching day and night attacks, engaging in bloody battles. The enemy troops were exhausted and anxious. Meanwhile, the air force team also echoed the operations of this Katsume team, repeatedly attacking the enemy's ocean warships, destroyers, landing boats, etc., inflicting heavy damage on them. Up to June 11, the battle results were: more than 1,500 enemy corpses were abandoned and eight artillery pieces were destroyed. However, the enemy gradually strengthened its forces, and by the end of June, it had strengthened to one and a half divisions, so the airfield on the island gradually fell into the hands of the enemy. Colonel Katsume, the commander of the Japanese army, also died heroically on July 2. The soldiers under his command inherited the commander's will, either sneaking into the enemy's camp at night, or breaking into the enemy's camp with bayonets. Later, they dug cave positions in trenches hundreds of feet underground, communicating with each other. For about five months, the Japanese army on the island, in an isolated and resupply island, completed the important task of defending the territory. Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - Since the enemy US landed on Biak Island in May of this year, the Japanese defenders on the island have inflicted heavy damage on the enemy with a small number of troops, while also ensuring the key areas of the island. General Terauchi, the Supreme Commander of the Southern Army, gave a commendation to the Japanese defenders on the island and the commander of the unit, Colonel Katsume Naoyuki, for their great achievements. The Japanese Ministry of the Army also issued the following commendation on the 8th.

### Commendation

The defenders of Biak Island, since the enemy troops landed on May 27, Showa 19 (33rd year of the Republic of China), have repeatedly launched large-scale counterattacks against the superior enemy with a small number of troops, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy and ensuring the key areas of the island. The contribution to the operation is truly great. The unit, under the command of Colonel Katsume, was able to unite as one, and insisted on fighting with an indomitable spirit, demonstrating the spirit of the Japanese army. Its achievements are truly a model for the entire army. This commendation is hereby awarded on August 1, Showa 19, Terauchi Hisaichi, Supreme Commander of the Southern Army.

### Letter of Appreciation

Army Colonel Katsume Naoyuki, since December Showa 18, has led the defenders of Biak Island to assist the navy in defending Biak Island. On May 8, Showa 19, enemy troops attempted to land on Biak Island, braving shelling and bombing, and then defeated the enemy at the beach. However, the enemy relied on its superior strength, naval gun fire, repeated bombing, and forced a landing. Although the defenders were few in number, they were good at fighting. Even after the enemy troops landed, they were still able to use night raids to inflict great damage on the enemy. Colonel Katsume fought bravely at the front and died in battle on July 2 after being hit by a bullet. This was beneficial to the overall situation. This letter of appreciation is hereby awarded and announced to the entire army on August 16, Showa 19, Terauchi Hisaichi, Supreme Commander of the Southern Army in the Southern Area.

### Enemy Aircraft Attack Thailand and Burma, Three Shot Down

Rangoon, 9th (Central News Agency) - On the 6th of this month, the enemy air force used B-24 and B-25 bombers and fighter planes, either alone or in formation, to attack the rear air bases of the Japanese army in Thailand and Burma. The Japanese air defense team immediately intercepted them, shooting down one B-24 and two B-25s. The Japanese army also lost two aircraft.

### President of South Manchuria Railway Flew to Japan Yesterday Morning

Xinjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - President of South Manchuria Railway, Mr. Konichi, flew east on the morning of the 9th to discuss important matters with the Japanese government authorities. He is scheduled to stay in Japan for one month.

### Japanese Army on Peleliu Island Launches Night Attack on Enemy Airfield

Inflicting Significant Damage on the Enemy for Three Weeks Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - After fighting fiercely for three weeks, the Japanese army on Peleliu Island has inflicted more than 18,000 casualties on the enemy. On the night of the 5th, the Japanese army generals and soldiers, together with a unit of suicide squads, broke through the enemy's strict security and infiltrated the airfield, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy and its defenses. From 12:30 a.m. to 2:10 a.m. that night, the great fire at the enemy airfield could be seen for more than two hours. On the 6th, the enemy attacked the south end of the Japanese defense line on the east coast and Mount Suifu in the north. The Japanese army inflicted heavy damage on them and repelled most of them. However, a part of the enemy on Dongshan invaded the Japanese army's position and began to build positions. The Japanese defenders are currently preparing to destroy the enemy. The actions of enemy warships on the sea surface of Peleliu Island and Palau's Kosol, etc., are still very frequent. On the evening of the 7th, an enemy hospital ship went to Peleliu Island again to recover the dead and wounded. The enemy aircraft attacks on Palau Island and Koror Island are becoming more and more intense. There were a total of 370 on the 6th and 470 on the 7th. A considerable number of enemy aircraft attacked the Peleliu airfield. The enemy aircraft avoid the Japanese army and the anti-aircraft positions during bombing and shelling, which is different from the past. They strive to conserve resources and are afraid of damage, etc.

### Minister Matsushima Discusses the Significance of the Fall of Fuzhou

Crushing Future British and American Invasion Attempts Rear Admiral Matsushima, the press officer of the Japanese Navy's China Fleet, gave a talk on the 7th about the significance of the fall of Fuzhou, the gist of which was: The significance of the fall of Fuzhou is that it thoroughly crushes future British and American invasion operations on the South China coast. The enemy's attempts to establish intelligence, submarine, and air bases in these areas have been repeatedly seen in enemy propaganda. In particular, the enemy military attempted to cooperate with the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing to set up a bridgehead in the coastal area of ​​China as soon as possible. Therefore, Fuzhou has obviously become one of its important candidate locations. Therefore, this key location is of great importance to the progress of future operations. The most noteworthy aspect of this operation is that the Japanese army and navy dispatched naval operations, and the Japanese Navy's China Fleet has a sea-air integrated formation, leaving the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing helpless. This further demonstrates the extent of the Japanese Navy's strength. At the same time, the enemy has repeatedly claimed that the US military has set up a submarine base in Sandu Ao near Fuzhou, which can also prove that all the counter-propaganda is false. No matter how Chongqing and the US military plan and attempt to turn China into a battlefield, the Japanese army will spare no sacrifice to stop it. In fact, this Japanese military operation is the beginning of the Greater East Asia War turning to the offensive. I believe that the local Chinese people will welcome the Japanese army and gladly cooperate in destroying the British and American operations.

### Friction Between the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing; Inner Story of the Xinjiang Dispute Can Only Be Solved with Guns and Cannons

Central News Agency dispatch - Regarding the Xinjiang dispute, the Soviet Union will send aircraft to bomb Dihua, and the friction between the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing is becoming increasingly acute. To ease the tension, Chongqing has transferred Sheng Shicai, the Governor of Xinjiang Province. According to reliable sources here, the details of the Xinjiang dispute and the friction between the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing are as follows: Xinjiang is

### China's Back Door

After his visit to Chongqing, US Vice President Wallace also stated that he had entered Chongqing from America through China's back door, and that Xinjiang was an important location. He returned to America from Xinjiang, China's back door. Why did Wallace repeatedly mention the Xinjiang issue? There is an important reason for this. The fact is as follows: The Soviet Union has been expanding its influence in Xinjiang for many years. Xinjiang has become almost a part of the Soviet Union in terms of politics, economy, and military affairs. Xinjiang Province Chairman Sheng Shicai has not forgotten his motherland, China. In recent years, he has been dealing with the Soviet Union in a compromising manner while actively expanding the internal strength of Xinjiang Province. However, the Soviet Union could no longer tolerate Chairman Sheng's perfunctory policies. The situation became serious in early winter last year. Sheng Shicai's younger brother, Sheng Guoxiong, was a brave warrior loyal to his motherland. He knew that the Soviet Union's oppression had

### Territorial Ambitions

At the same time, the Soviet Union's instigation of independence movements was a force that fragmented the motherland's independence. The Soviet Union repeatedly proposed to sign a treaty with the Xinjiang Provincial Government, essentially making Xinjiang an independent province of China. He indignantly reported this conspiracy to the Chongqing government. On the sixth day after he contacted them and returned to Xinjiang Province, he was assassinated by the Soviet Union's Fifth Column. He sacrificed himself for the motherland and for Xinjiang Province. With boiling blood, Sheng Shicai, seeing the Chinese Communists instigated by the Soviet Union disrupt public order, had no choice but to take military action. He mobilized troops to protect the provincial capital of Dihua and urgently reported to the Chongqing government, requesting a large army to come to his aid. This tense situation brewed for several months, and finally, shortly after the Chongqing army (Zhu Shaoliang's troops) arrived in Dihua, the war broke out. The officially established Xinjiang Communist Army attacked Dihua, while the Xinjiang Army and the Chongqing Army resisted with the mission of defending their territory. The untrained Communist Army, of course, could not withstand artillery fire and

### Collapsed

However, during the Communist Army's defeat (in early July of this year), large bombers were discovered in the high sky above Dihua, strafing downwards and dropping countless incendiary bombs. This was something that Sheng Shicai and the Chongqing Army generals had never expected. The Soviet Union was openly providing military support. Therefore, after receiving the urgent information, Yu Jiang immediately ordered a ceasefire. At the same time, a serious protest was filed with the Soviet Union, which was an unavoidable procedure. On the other hand, news control was tightened. All news about the war in Xinjiang was strictly prohibited from being published to avoid stimulating people's emotions. At the same time, when it was unavoidable, an appeal was made to the White House owner in Washington for mediation. After such back-and-forth negotiations involving the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing, the Soviet Union finally expressed its willingness to compromise, but demanded that Chairman Sheng Shicai, who caused the incident, be transferred out of Xinjiang. All issues would be resolved through diplomatic channels. The Communist Army and the Chongqing Army would each return to their defense areas. Sheng Shicai then returned to Chongqing. The Chongqing-controlled Political Participation Council made an exception to hold a grand welcoming ceremony for this purpose, praising Sheng Shicai as a model soldier. Furthermore, Chiang himself accompanied him to every meeting, which was considered one of the most glorious pages by the Chongqing military and political circles. How the Xinjiang issue will end, American guns, Soviet guns, and Chongqing guns, most people believe that it can only be resolved with guns.

### The Xinjiang Issue

However, the Chongqing government continues to adopt appeasement diplomacy towards the Soviet Union on the surface, which is why they emphasize the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. On the 5th of this month, the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao also advocated strengthening friendly Sino-Soviet relations, especially advocating the selection of outstanding talents to form a national goodwill delegation and send them to Moscow as soon as possible to strengthen Sino-Soviet relations. On the other hand, the new Xinjiang Provincial Chairman Wu Zhongxin, when convening provincial government and department officials on the 5th of this month for a pro-government speech, also mentioned the issue of Sino-Soviet relations. He said, "Xinjiang is located at a crucial point in Sino-Soviet transportation and bears an unavoidable mission under the principle of being friendly and good neighbors. I will act in accordance with the wishes of the Chongqing government to actively strengthen the spirit of friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union." From this, it can be seen that Chongqing is actively expressing friendliness to the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union still despises Chongqing. Therefore, how Chongqing and third countries will deal with the Soviet Union's ambitions in Xinjiang will inevitably leave a major problem on Chongqing's borders, and will also create British and American power. Therefore, the relationship between them is increasingly complex. In East Asia, the relationship between Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing, their friction, there is a high probability of an outbreak.

Fierce Fighting in the Aachen Area Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Huitong News Agency dispatch: Although the German Grenadier Division was established not long ago, it has made decisive contributions in the war on the Western Front to contain the anti-Axis forces. A reporter recently visited the operational line of the new division in the Moselle area and saw that the division possessed the latest weapons.

The German bridgehead on the Scheldt River east of Antwerp is preventing the anti-Axis forces from using the port of Antwerp. The enemy has repeatedly attacked the bridgehead, but has met with strong resistance and made little progress to the northeast and north. The situation in Nijmegen is also becoming more intense. British reinforcements have not yet been able to withstand the German pressure. The German army has made considerable progress between the Waal and Lek rivers. General Hodges, south of Geilenkirchen, with the help of artillery and aircraft, is assisting tank forces in attacking the German positions east of Ubach-Palenberg.

### Chinese Communists Are Making Every Effort to Launch a Pincer Attack on the Chongqing Military and Government

Central News Agency dispatch - The relationship between the Yan'an regime and the Soviet Union has always been quite close. Recently, it sent representatives Qin Bangxian and Wang Ming to Moscow to visit and directly negotiate with the Soviet government to ensure Soviet assistance. Therefore, the Chinese Communists have expressed [the future of China is in our hands]. As a result, Yan'an's attitude towards Chongqing has become increasingly tough, and it frequently launches a pincer attack on the Chongqing government. According to reliable sources, on the 4th of this month, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government organized a Preparatory Committee to celebrate the Double Ten National Day and used the name of the committee to make a statement, not hesitating to criticize Chongqing. The content stated that we deeply understand that before victory is achieved, there are considerable obstacles in the future that will have a significant impact. This is the consistent dictatorial policy of the Chongqing Kuomintang, that is, the military and political institutions without any vitality. How does the work of this minority of dictatorial power look like? Based on the following points, the general public can know: 1. After repeated defeats, they do not allow others to fight, but rather make a planned dissolution of the Communist Party, eliminating four-fifths of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, and plan to advocate the incorporation of the remaining one-fifth of the forces under the unified military power of defeatism. 2. Their attempts have implemented fascism, abandoned the Three Principles of the People, and opposed the Three Principles of the People. This can be seen in the fact that democratic politics is not allowed to be implemented. However, on the surface, they allow local autonomy and the people to participate in politics, but this is completely contrary to the facts. 3. The results of Chongqing's repeated defeats have completely failed the anti-Axis countries' attempts to counterattack within Chinese territory. Therefore, in order to oppose the Chongqing Kuomintang's autocracy, immediately convene a temporary National Assembly, convene all parties and factions, as well as local troops, governments, and talents from various public organizations, and further demand the implementation of the reorganization of the Chongqing government and the Military Affairs Commission to organize a joint government and a joint military commission to implement the revolutionary Three Principles of the People. Now that the Communist Party's criticism is quite strong, the process of the friction between Chongqing and the Communist Party has shifted to negotiations between the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing. However, after the Chongqing army's military defeats in Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong, its response to the Communist Party is passive, and the reason is actually the result of pressure from Washington. However, the decline in the Chongqing army's combat strength will give the Communist Party a good opportunity in international activities. Knowledgeable people in Chongqing are deeply concerned about the discussion of the Chongqing-Communist Party issue.

### Yesterday's Air Raid Drill Showed More Progress Than Before, According to Comments Released by Air Defense Headquarters

The Citizens Air Defense Headquarters issued the following comments on yesterday's air defense drill: Based on the results of various air defense drills held on the tenth air defense day, it is believed that the general awareness of air defense among the citizens of this country is progressing greatly. In particular, the cooperation given by citizens and the waiting training in the Nanjing Road area, although carried out by districts, is considered to have made unusual progress compared to before. However, we must not be complacent because of this. In the event of an actual air raid, current air defense technology may not be able to protect the safety of each person's life. The enemy's air raids are not only strategic, but also seem to have intentions towards the compatriots of this city, as can be seen from the bombing situation in China, South China, and the example of the air raid on Manila. The Air Defense Headquarters believes that even one person's injury must be avoided as much as possible. It is regrettable that some citizens have an indifferent attitude towards the Headquarters' measures in this regard. This training will make use of the monitoring posts recently established throughout the city and use waiting as the main items. It is different from the past, which was limited to a very small area and attempted high-level training. All residents were mobilized in each district to conduct exercises in their respective districts. There are as many as seventeen designated exercise areas in the city. As a result of the exercise, several points that still need to be studied are noted below for the reference of the Baojia Self-Defense Corps and the Air Defense Class in the future.

### Points to Be Improved Yesterday

This training has not yet broken away from past habits and is still far from achieving the ideal of total citizen mobilization, and general basic training has not been sufficient. Therefore, we hope that instructors will recognize the importance of strengthening air defense awareness so that subordinates can unite and work together to enlighten the general public's air defense awareness. The points that need to be improved are recorded below: 1. When designating buildings as public shelters, more consideration must be given, because if the buildings are used for business purposes and already need to accommodate a large number of people on weekdays, it seems difficult to accommodate external refugees. In addition, small buildings that can only accommodate a few or dozens of people do not seem suitable as public shelters. 2. After the air raid alarm is issued, it is inappropriate for police officers, Baojia personnel, and members of the Self-Defense Corps to allow cars, tricycles, and bicycles to continue driving. They should be quickly ordered to stop on the side of the road, disperse to wait, and pay attention to maintaining an appropriate distance from road corners, bridgeheads, etc. 3. Although the clothing of those directly involved in air defense has gradually been improved to facilitate activities, it is regrettable that instructors are still wearing long gowns or clothing that is not conducive to air defense activities on patrols. Therefore, instructors should first be concerned about their own clothing and quickly prepare headscarves and gloves. 4. Waiting is the main item of this training. Although the issuance of the guiding outline and the training period were very short, some areas were still satisfactory. This should be attributed to the hard work of the instructors in the area. Areas that have not been able to be comprehensive should pay attention to the following points. Waiting means that when enemy aircraft are discovered or machine sounds are heard, or when the air defense agency instructs to wait, you must avoid danger on your own and temporarily wait in a safe place. After the danger has passed, you can engage in air defense activities. This point does not seem to be completely thorough, especially the transmission method should be improved again, that is, the situation prompted by the monitoring post should first be reported to the commander, and then the commander should be assigned to important places. Configure transmission posts to take on transmission work and be responsible for guiding the waiting of nearby residents. Air defense personnel must not lie in the middle of the road to avoid danger. Although the lighting control is usually very good, it was not considered good at night. In particular, the lighting control of rickshaws and tricycles is still lacking. In short, although the appearance of each training session has improved, the situation is becoming increasingly urgent. All of us citizens should realize that the current exercises are equivalent to actual combat, so as to achieve perfection.

### Fire-Fighting Exercise Results in Various Districts

Yesterday (the 9th) was the tenth Air Defense Day. The Citizens Air Defense Headquarters summarized the results of the fire-fighting exercise in various districts of the city and made the following comments: ○Regarding the fire-fighting exercise 1. The replenishment of fire-fighting water has improved significantly, but should be prepared in advance. In particular, in the non-exercise areas south of the Suzhou River, some water tanks have not been filled with water, and only a small amount of water remains at the bottom of the tank. 2. There seem to be too many people carrying fire-fighting water in lead buckets, which is the opposite of being quick. The method of adding water should be designed according to the situation and timing, so that fire-fighting battles can have good results. 3. Observation of wind direction should be stepped up, emphasizing the direction of the wind to prevent the fire from spreading. 4. It is still considered lacking to use moistened grass mats to extinguish the fire caused by incendiary bombs. This seems to be of no benefit in peacetime, but after several actual tests, it is recognized that it is absolutely necessary to use it. 5. There are many high buildings in this city, so the methods of extinguishing fires at high altitudes should be studied. 6. There are still the majority of Chinese-style houses in this city, so in addition to pouring water with lead buckets, hand-operated pumps should also be used. 7. In addition to the exercise personnel, there are still citizens who take a bystander attitude, which should be corrected.

### Household Flour on Sale Today

Additional Allotment of Two Catties of Soybeans The city's Goods Allocation Office has decided to start allocating soybeans in the old District 1 today, with two catties per person, selling at 15 yuan of Central Reserve Certificates per catty, until the 22nd of this month. Citizens in that district can purchase it at the food retail store with the same number listed on the ticket with the 21st comprehensive joint ticket. The allocation of soybeans in other districts will be announced later. At the same time, household flour is also scheduled to go on sale today, ending on the 22nd, with one catty of No. 2 flour per person, selling at 42 yuan of Central Reserve Certificates. Citizens in the old District 1 can purchase it with the 22nd comprehensive joint ticket, and other districts can purchase it with the 45th period flour certificate issued by the former Grain Bureau. The household rice will be generally sold starting on the 15th of this month, still selling for city liters per person.

### The New Association Holds a Movie Speech Tonight to Celebrate National Day; Yesterday, a Peking Opera Benefit Performance

The Shanghai News Association is celebrating the Double Tenth Festival with a grand three-day celebration. Yesterday, the association specially invited famous Shanghai opera performers such as Zhou Xinfang, Chen Hefeng, and Chen Yongling to hold a Peking Opera benefit performance to celebrate National Day in advance.

In addition, the ticket prices for the drama benefit performance at 7:30 pm on the 11th will be sold at half price to show universal celebration. Ticket sales will start at 10 am that day. Those who wish to see "[Sea Burial]" should not miss the opportunity.

### Misconduct by Officials of the Rice Control Association; Seven Years' Imprisonment

Rong Huiren, an official of the Rice and Grain Control Committee, colluded with Wuxi merchants Bao Ming and Chen Yuan to illegally break up whole rice shipments into smaller quantities to avoid government requisition and transport them to Shanghai for sale. The Economic Security Office learned of this, and the three were arrested. After two interrogations by the court, the sentence was announced yesterday. Judge Bi delivered the verdict as follows: Rong Huiren and Chen Yuan, with the common intention of obtaining illegal profits and harming public interests, are each sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and a fine of 30,000 yuan. Bao Mingxiang is sentenced to one year and two months of imprisonment for repeatedly using false documents. The eighteen temporary certificates for rice transportation are confiscated. After the sentence was pronounced, they were immediately sent to prison.

### Increase in Radio Listening Fees Adds to the Burden of Ordinary People

— Jin Hu

Since October, the China Broadcasting Association has increased the monthly radio listening fee to 100 yuan, more than three times the original 30 yuan per month half a year ago. This listening fee was originally one of the state's wartime taxes, and those who own radios should pay taxes without a doubt. However, this sudden sharp increase, compared with the first collection of radio listening fees last October, which was 10 yuan per month, is a ratio of ten to one. Originally, radio in Shanghai was a very common and inexpensive entertainment tool. In fact, culturally advanced countries have regarded it as a necessity for every household, like beds, tables, and chairs. It also has the functions of reporting news, education, and entertainment, which are encouraged and promoted by the government. Now that the Broadcasting Association has greatly increased the listening fee, we ordinary people will no longer be able to listen to or have this cheapest entertainment and education tool. Last year, 10 yuan per month was a small amount. Even though my five-tube radio only listened for an average of three hours a day, the electricity bill was 6 or 7 yuan per month, and the listening fee was already 10 yuan. However, after a year, under the effort to reduce electricity consumption, the listening time of the radio has decreased. This is inevitable for every family with a radio. Even if it is set to listen for three hours a day, the electricity bill is 31.5 yuan per month (calculated based on the September electricity bill), and the listening fee is 100 yuan. Moreover, how can we listen freely every day at this time and place without worrying about the possibility of a power outage? Once the listening fee rises sharply, if we stop listening, we must dismantle the machine and submit it to the Broadcasting Association for verification and permission, which will turn it into waste. Moreover, it will not be desired by others for transfer in the future. If we put it aside and do not listen, it is impossible, and it is easy to break. If we sell it immediately, how many people want to buy it at this time of electricity saving? Moreover, my machine is old and has poor reception. Selling it is not worth much, and it is a pity to discard it. For the above reasons, I dare to boldly ask the Broadcasting Association to consider the limited entertainment and education of ordinary people and the original intention of the state to set up radio stations, and maintain the original listening fee as much as possible, then the ordinary people will be fortunate, and the national broadcasting industry will be fortunate.

### Recent Youth (2)

At this critical moment for the Empire, I am extremely honored to have a place to die. I respectfully shout "Banzai" to His Majesty the Emperor. For the past twenty-three years, I have been blessed by the kindness of my parents and family, and I have also received guidance and teachings from the teachers of primary and secondary schools, as well as the naval instructors and superiors. I am extremely grateful. I can only express my condolences to the bereaved family of Petty Officer Hatahata, who was on the same ship. Finally, I must declare that I am deeply regrettable to die before repaying even one ten-thousandth of the Emperor's kindness— (This is truly like the state of mind of a real person, truly like a real person's will.) Longfu read the abbreviated handwriting scraped on the newspaper, once from the left and once from the right. The sacred kindness, parental kindness, and teacher kindness, which are unforgettable in the heart, are indeed good customs in the hometown, but flowing out from the tip of the real person's pen, each word seems to turn into a gentle and elegant voice, spreading to Longfu's ears. Even with the care for his subordinate, Petty Officer Hatahata, Longfu indeed felt that this was the real person's aura. In the Hachiman School and the Second Middle School era, the real person was always like an older brother to me. Although Longfu himself was in the same class, he always felt like a younger brother. The love for his younger brother was not exactly the same. Ah, yes, when eating at the Wu Zhen Water Exchange, the real person narrowed his eyes and talked about the subordinate he met in Sakashita. (Then, isn't that non-commissioned officer Petty Officer Hatahata?) Although Longfu thought of this, there was no evidence to prove it. Longfu immediately thought of a part of the public will of Commander Sakuma. Do not let the bereaved family of my subordinates suffer from hunger and starvation—isn't the commander's intention completely manifested in the real person's will? Perhaps the real person was aware of Commander Sakuma when writing his will. But after thirty-two years, they are connected due to the same state of mind and the same underwater soldiers. (This must be a legend!) Longfu was in awe. Naval soldiers pass on to each other and inherit this invisible, unseen legend. (149)

### Old People's Home Calls for Donations

Goal: 5 million yuan Period: From October 10 to November 10 Collection Location: Social Service Department of This Newspaper Date of Publication: Founded for nearly 40 years, it houses 350 orphaned elderly men and women over the age of 60. The nuns personally care for them until the end of their lives. The expenses of the hospital were formerly subsidized by European and American foreign firms to the greatest extent. Since the environment has changed, this source of funds has been suspended abruptly. At this time, when everything is expensive, it is difficult to maintain. The accumulated debts have reached 600,000 to 700,000. If there is no way to help, it will inevitably be tied up and waiting for death. Therefore, we have to make a call for help. Yesterday, those who responded to the news were extremely enthusiastic. In one day, 340,000 yuan has been donated, which shows that the society is enthusiastic and cares deeply about the elderly relief movement, which is admirable. We still hope that all sectors of society will generously contribute with a heart of kindness. We respectfully ask for the sake of the lonely and helpless elderly.

### The Current Problem of Educational Reform

— Xie Yaoshou

Recently, donations to various scholarship funds have been very enthusiastic, demonstrating that the general public has a clear understanding of the importance of education. However, on the other hand, many insightful people are deeply dissatisfied with the current education system, believing that such education is enough to ruin the country. This statement is perhaps a bit too激烈的， but it is not to say that education is bad. It is only to say that the current school education is far from the original purpose of education! The general public often attributes the shortcomings of schools to the narrowness of school buildings, the lack of funding, and the incompleteness of equipment. These are all due to environmental limitations and are not the fundamental problem of current education. As for abolishing arts and commerce subjects and shortening the length of schooling, these are only temporary measures for extraordinary times and not a long-term plan for nurturing people. Therefore, to speak from the branches and leaves is too trivial! Let us leave aside the branches and leaves and discover the root cause! The basic shortcoming of general schools today can be summed up in one sentence: [neglect of moral education]. In the school's view, it seems that as long as knowledge is instilled in students, that is enough. As for the students' character and thoughts, it is not their business. In the students' view, the only purpose of coming to school is to seek knowledge, and being able to receive all kinds of knowledge without missing anything is considered a good student! As for how one should live one's life, they not only think it is unimportant but have never even considered the question at all. This is like a rudderless boat sailing in the turbulent sea, not knowing where to go. How dangerous is that! Moreover, schools are places for training citizens. If one is muddleheaded in school, how can society have excellent citizens? If the school does not take this responsibility, who should take it? In fact, treating moral, intellectual, physical, and social education as equally important is already inappropriate: moral education is the foundation of everything. Moral education is the proper development of intellectual, physical, and social education. It is not that there is moral education apart from intellectual education, etc., nor is it that there can be intellectual education, physical education, social education, etc., without moral education. Xunzi said: [Only after the bow is adjusted can one seek its strength; only after the horse is tamed can one seek its quality; a scholar must be sincere before he can be intelligent. If he is not sincere but capable, he is like a jackal and cannot be approached.] Those who are good at all kinds of tricks to deceive and exploit, have they not received intellectual education? Those who rob along the road and do business without capital, have they not received physical education? Those who form cliques for private gain and collude to commit fraud, have they not received social education? Without moral education, the greater one's ability, the greater one's ability to do evil. It is like adding wings to a tiger. When people hear the word moral education, they laugh at it as being pedantic. But have they really known the importance of moral education? The most harmful consequences of the general school's neglect of moral education are roughly as follows:

Let us examine the purpose of general students seeking education. Those who only want to get a diploma are not worth mentioning. Even the more outstanding ones only say that they are learning a skill for future use in society. But this is also selfish. They do not know the purpose of life at all and only want to seek benefits for themselves. Why study science and engineering? Because there is a lack of talent in science and engineering, which will make it easier to make a living in the future. Why study arts and commerce? Because the courses in arts and commerce are easy, and it is easy to get a title. Utilitarianism has a deep impression in the minds of general students. Even if they make some contributions to society in the future, it will still be based on the motive of seeking benefits. Therefore, they often complain that there is too much theory in the courses and that it is not practical. In their opinion, they think they are not being impractical. But they do not know that practicality is the application of theory to practice. Without theory, how can one be practical? The reason why general students are not practical now is not because they only have theory, but because they cannot thoroughly understand the theory. Cheng Yi said: [Only with true knowledge can one act]. Mr. Sun Yat-sen clearly pointed out the importance of theory in Knowing is Difficult, Acting is Easy. Therefore, practicality comes from theory, and without theory, there is no practicality. Moreover, the world today is multifaceted. One skill alone cannot cope. To think that those who study science and engineering should not know economics, and that those who study politics can ignore history, is completely wrong. What is generally called practicality today is actually just being greedy for small gains and quick results, seeking immediate benefits, and pursuing personal enjoyment. Have they really had the ambition to [open up things and complete tasks] [establish oneself and reach others]? Greed for profit and small gains is a major shortcoming of current education.

Because the motive for seeking education comes from greed for profit, students only seek to get by in their courses, recording notes word for word. As for what is outside the course and not taught by the teacher, they ignore it. When it comes to exams, they are all very nervous, treating it as a big deal, asking the teacher to specify the scope, not to test what was tested last time, burning the midnight oil desperately, memorizing by rote, hoping to get a score of 80 or 90. This is still the so-called hardworking student; those who do not work hard try all kinds of cheating methods, hoping to pass by luck this time. Whether hardworking or not, they all focus on the score and do not consider what relationship the course they are studying has with them. Needless to say, those who cheat, even those who are called hardworking, treat exams and weekdays as two separate things. Are they not also being hypocritical? Therefore, once the exam is over, most of what they have learned has been forgotten! They also feel that the exam is over, the goal has been achieved, and it is time to forget. Teachers who [make it easy for others] specify the so-called [important] points, so students naturally do not review what is outside the specified scope! Teachers who think they are strict deliberately dig out minor and irrelevant questions from the seams of the book to make things difficult for students. Students also try to memorize many dispensable answers to cater to the teacher's intentions. Teachers and students suspect each other and try to guess each other's minds, neglecting the important main points! Confucius said: [Ancient scholars studied for themselves]. I don't know if today's students are studying for themselves! The school should also bear considerable responsibility for this behavior of students. On weekdays, they regard classes as unimportant, but when the semester ends, they make a big fuss, announcing: the big exam will be held on such and such day, students should work harder. This is very ridiculous. Only work hard before the exam, so can you not work hard at other times? If you work hard on weekdays, then when the exam comes, you only need to [bring out what you know], how easy it is! Why work hard! Because the school regards this as a big deal, the students also follow suit. So isn't the student's hypocrisy induced by the school? Moreover, once the exam comes, students desperately compete with each other for better grades. Even good friends are jealous and unwilling to discuss with each other, for fear that their grades will surpass their own. If there are special rewards for those who are at the top, then the competition will be even more intense! Students with similar grades become like enemies. Schools are supposed to teach people courtesy and humility. Doesn't the exam encourage people to compete? Moreover, during the exam, so-called strict schools arrange seats, verify photos, and send people to monitor all four corners, glaring like tigers, as if everyone taking the exam in the room is intent on cheating. How disrespectful is this to others' self-esteem! In fact, if the school discovers someone cheating, it shows that its teaching is ineffective and cannot find a thorough way to eradicate it. How can it boast of strict management by catching cheating! In the past, during the imperial examination era, there should have been restrictions such as guarantors and searches. Aspiring scholars all thought that it was treating scholars like thieves and would rather not take the exam. How can we still retain the bad habit of treating scholars like thieves now? The school may say that cheating and taking exams for others are not allowed, but if it does not pay attention to daily courses and exaggerates the exam excessively, the result cannot be avoided! To be perfunctory and get by on weekdays, and then rush to work hard at the last minute, is this not deceiving oneself? Is this not cheating? Replacing the me who does not work hard on weekdays with the me who hugs Buddha's feet at the last minute, is this not taking the exam for others? Young people are the future masters of the country. They don't know how great a responsibility they will bear. When faced with the small matter of an exam, they are so nervous that they are at a loss. How can they [turn the tide]? When they are young, they don't know how to respect themselves, can't be confident, and endure the contemptuous treatment during exams, only hoping to pass by luck. How can they [be independent and fearless, and not be troubled by being reclusive]? Being perfunctory on weekdays and seeking luck during exams is another major shortcoming of current education.

A person who grows up in the countryside begins to feel the loveliness of the countryside. A person who grows up in the city will not have this feeling. Therefore, those who have deeply studied their own culture will naturally love their own country. Moreover, society is accumulated by countless years of history. Those who do not know the previous culture cannot understand today's society. But current education clearly does not pay attention to this point. It seems that everything in the past is useless and empty. It only pays attention to foreign culture and does not know about its own culture. Isn't this putting the cart before the horse? General students know Shakespeare and Dickens, but when it comes to Tang Xianzu and Cao Xueqin, they don't know! They know Kant and Hegel, but when it comes to Cheng Yi and Lu Xiangshan, they don't know! In their imagination, it seems that China was still in the Stone Age one or two hundred years ago, and everything was uncivilized. There is no culture worth paying attention to. This attitude can be felt everywhere. They know how all the etiquette in society should be in the West, and they imitate it, but they vaguely don't know how it should be according to the opinions of the ancient sages of China. In a conversation, they always want to mix in a few English words intentionally or unintentionally, as if not doing so is not enough to show that they have received higher education. Even if we don't overthink what this will lead to, just the [not paying attention] point is not a good phenomenon! Not knowing one's own culture is another major shortcoming of current education.

Human affairs are interconnected, so all knowledge is closely or distantly interconnected. There are absolutely no two subjects that are unrelated. So-called flexible application is the ability to discover the relationship between subjects and their relationship to life. So-called rote learning is to put all subjects in opposition to each other, not interacting with each other. They don't even know how to connect the subjects, and they are even more isolated from the relationship to life. Therefore, seeking education and life are clearly divided into two things, and seeking education is also clearly divided into several subjects. What is the use of such knowledge? Let's take an example. Plato announced at the gate of his academy: [Those who do not know how to learn Eudoxus' geometry are not allowed to enter.] What is the relationship between mathematics and philosophy, literature, art, etc.? This is because the basic purpose of learning mathematics is not just to be able to calculate. Calculating can be said to be secondary. The most important thing is to train people's ability to analyze and deduce. But now general students only think that being able to solve every problem is a big deal. As for dealing with human affairs, they are at a loss and don't know where to start, where the main point is, where the secondary point is, how to analyze it, and how to deal with it. This situation is the easiest to encounter. They all complain that the school doesn't teach them. In fact, the school can't teach them. Even if it wants to teach them, it is impossible in fact. Human affairs change at any time, and no two things are exactly the same. So how can we predefine fixed methods? But as long as you have the ability to analyze things, aren't you afraid that you can't deal with them? This situation is also the result of greed for profit. They cannot sincerely and earnestly seek self-attainment, only knowing how to seek knowledge but not knowing its relationship to life is another major shortcoming of current education.

In summary, all the shortcomings are only because of the neglect of moral education! People say: [Society is a big dyeing vat, and many pure young people are dyed bad by it!] That's right, but the school itself is a small dyeing vat. Which of the various pains and mistakes is not secretly brewing in the school? On weekdays, they only know how to study for profit, and in the future, they will naturally [beg at the grave] [climb the dragon], [bend the ruler to seek the straight]. How can they [see profit and think of righteousness] [not be careless in the face of wealth]? On weekdays, they only seek to get by, and in the future, they will naturally be perfunctory, procrastinating and lazy in everything. How can they [devote themselves to the task until death]? When faced with the small matter of an exam, they are still panicked and hoping to pass by luck. In the future, they will naturally [worry about gains and losses] [go with the flow]. How can they [be neutral and upright] [bear heavy responsibilities]? Studying hard is one's duty, but they compete with each other for classification and bonuses. In the future, they will naturally be uneasy in their humble circumstances, showing off their power. How can they [be indifferent to fame and fortune, and be quiet to reach far]? On weekdays, they don't know their own culture, and in the future, they will naturally be infatuated with foreign races, [destroying their crowns and tearing their robes]. How can they [restore my country] [share the same hatred with you]? On weekdays, they divide studying and life into two separate things, not really communicating with each other. In the future, they will naturally have no fixed opinions and float with the customs. How can they distinguish between righteousness and profit, and clearly discern right and wrong? Precisely because the education they receive is like this, once they enter society, it will become deeper and deeper, until they lose their original heart completely. Therefore, the result of neglecting moral education is: emphasizing theory creates new-style bookworms; emphasizing practicality creates civilized exploiters; being perfunctory in education creates mediocre fools; being strict in education creates shrewd merchants. Such education is disappointing. Zhu Xi said: [If the court wants to restore the Central Plains, it must abolish the imperial examination for thirty years!] If we want to find a way to clarify the source for the current society, then the education system really needs to be thoroughly reformed!

Speaking of reform methods, they can be divided into the following points:

1.  The students' academic performance largely depends on the teacher's teaching. A good teacher, in addition to surpassing knowledge, must also have a voluntary enthusiasm for education. If they have no intention of teaching and only seek to get by, what is the use of even abundant knowledge? Therefore, strict selection of teachers is the first step in reforming education. Once the selection of teachers is determined, their treatment should be improved. This will not only enable them to stay in their positions for a long time, but also show respect for teachers. Then the teachers can [patiently and skillfully guide], and the students can [sincerely and faithfully follow]. Compared with teachers changing all the time, its efficiency will naturally increase a lot. Most of the current job seekers say that they are just trying to make a living, but this can never be the case in the education field. It is excusable in other industries, but if teachers also put making a living first, the result will be perfunctory. They themselves have not deeply studied the courses, but come to teach students, deceiving themselves and others, which is simply unforgivable.

2.  When new students enter school, they should be strictly examined. It is better to have insufficient numbers than to over-enroll excessively and lower the standard of education. This may lead to other problems such as insufficient funding, but these are matters outside of education itself, so I will not discuss them in detail for the time being. The general situation now is that excellent students are often unable to continue their studies because they are poor, and those who are able to continue their studies often give up on themselves and are unwilling to make progress. The establishment of scholarships has more or less solved the former problem, but the latter problem also urgently needs to be solved. The goal of education is not so much to increase the quantity as to improve the quality; it is better to have fewer educated people and enable all educated people to become the pillars of the country in the future. We must never allow spoiled elements and excellent students to receive higher education together, which will lead to a decline in morale.

3.  Once the selection of teachers and students is determined, education begins. The school's responsibility is to train excellent citizens, not just to impart some knowledge, making people like machines or learning how to make a living and becoming merchants. Therefore, cultivating oneself and rectifying one's heart is the essential task of education. General schools all have school mottos and rules grandly displayed, but how many students can abide by them? They are just treated as official articles! Even during class, there are still sounds of ridicule and arrogance. If school rules cannot be followed in school, it is no wonder that behavior is not disciplined in a society without general rules! In recent years, most schools have resumed reading the classics, but this is also largely unnecessary. Reading without acting, in one ear and out the other, is truly what Confucius said, "I can do nothing about it." Zhang Yu, Kong Guang, Liu Xin, and Ma Rong were not all famous Confucian scholars? Therefore, reading the classics may not be necessary, but it is necessary to constantly persuade and prohibit students' daily actions, whether inside or outside the classroom.

4.  Speaking of the reform of the school system, the first thing is that the examination system must be abolished; even if it is difficult to change due to long-standing habits, the examination should be slightly de-emphasized, and more emphasis should be placed on daily performance. In fact, the student's learning can be determined in daily Q&A. Why wait until the exam? If you need to wait until the exam to determine the student's merits, then the teacher is also extremely incompetent! Some people think that exams are the only way for schools to supervise students. Once abolished, they will inevitably be lazy and unwilling to work hard. This statement is specious. All things are only afraid of not having interest, not of not working hard. Knowing it, you will definitely like it, and liking it, you will definitely enjoy it. It's just one thing. Strictly reviewing students' admission, there will naturally be no slackers who cheat for diplomas; with the earnest teachings of excellent teachers, they will naturally have a great interest in the courses. How can they be lazy and not study things they are very interested in? If they have no interest at all, and use exams to force them to work hard, isn't that teaching people to be hypocritical and deceive themselves? Such hard work, I am afraid, will outweigh the benefits!

5.  It is good to have regulations on the length of schooling to avoid the disadvantages of accumulating and waiting, but everyone's talent is different, and applying the same rules to everyone will inevitably prevent those with high talent from fully developing their individuality, and those with low talent will suffer from being too forced. Therefore, the length of schooling should be slightly flexible so that both high and low talents can develop as much as possible without being forced. Moreover, there is another point. The current education system, except for those who are hopelessly foolish, can graduate after reaching a certain age. Does the student really thoroughly understand it? Or are they just getting by? This is a big question. Some people say: Current education is really similar to donating an official position in the past. As long as you pay enough tuition and pass a certain period, you will get a diploma. I don't know what those who aim to get by feel about this.

6.  The teaching methods of general teachers mostly tend to memorization, teaching students to read and recite by rote. These teachers think that as long as they cram enough knowledge like stuffing a duck, they don't care about the advantages and disadvantages. As for the students, they only know how to desperately memorize, but they are ignorant of the main points of the book. Wang Yangming said: [If you only want to remember, you will not understand.] This is true. Moreover, some teachers ask students to directly copy the book word for word during the exam, deducting points for every word missed. This is dictation, not learning, not the person reading the book, but the book using the person! Therefore, in the future, the method of reform should be to make teachers use discussion methods, so that students can understand and gain on their own, forming the ability to analyze things, not focusing on memorizing words and sentences.

The above are all the most important points I have discussed. As for other trivial matters, I do not have time to list them in detail for the time being. As long as the fundamental shortcomings are corrected, everything else can be solved easily and does not need to be discussed in detail. Cheng Yi said: [If we try to rectify it without changing it, then it will be incurable; if we must save it, we must change it. A big change will bring great benefits, and a small change will bring small benefits.] The importance of education is well known to everyone, so there is no need to elaborate. The shortcomings of today's education are so obvious, so how to reform education is what we need to work hard on now. We must not give up because the procedures are troublesome and the accumulation is difficult to reverse, and just let it pass!

### Humble Suggestions for Improving the Pathological State of Education in Our Country

— Shi Puyu

The reason a nation is strong or weak, the reason a people rise or fall, in examining their causes, there are certainly many, but whether education is managed well, whether schools are established widely, is truly a very good compass and touchstone. Since ancient times, our country has attached great importance to education. For example, Confucius's school divided teaching into six areas: ritual, music, archery, charioteering, mathematics, and writing. Mencius said, "[Carefully attending to the teaching of schools, emphasizing filial piety and brotherly respect]," and thus, in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, talent emerged in great numbers, enjoying a period of great prosperity. Since the Han Dynasty, officials were selected based on their understanding of the Five Classics or their virtuous and upright character. Since the Tang Dynasty, officials were selected through the imperial examination system. Although the methods have changed slightly, the emphasis on education remained the same, as did the intention to have scholars shoulder the important responsibilities of the country. What is regrettable is that they only knew to emphasize moral principles and textual exegesis, without studying practical learning. Moreover, they put the two areas of physical training, archery and charioteering, out of their minds. Therefore, for thousands of years, culture, industry, and commerce have not developed substantially, but have stagnated midway. By the late Qing Dynasty, the sea ban was widely lifted, and European and American countries, with their strong armies and advanced products, simultaneously invaded and dumped goods, like mercury seeping into the ground, entering every crack. The shortcomings of our country's original education system were completely exposed at this point, and it became necessary to make major improvements in order to adapt to the environment. Therefore, prominent officials at the time, such as Zeng Wenzheng, Grand Tutor Park, and Li Wenzhong, among others, successively sent students abroad to study science. Later, Zhang Wenxiang put forward the saying "[Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for practical application]," hoping to achieve integration and establish something truly significant. The imperial examination system, which was popular in the past, was decisively abolished, and schools that suited the trend were established one after another. Counting on our fingers, there are already less than a hundred years of history. Although the scale is roughly established, its achievements are still far from ideal. Especially in recent years, with the decline of discipline and the slackening of study, everything feels like it is going downhill. Now, I will list the major pathological states below:

    One, From the perspective of schools: Since the incident occurred, people from all over the country have moved to Shanghai, and schools are no exception. Moreover, with the changes of the times and the confluence of opportunities, newly established schools have sprung up like bamboo shoots after the rain. Therefore, there are as many schools in Shanghai as there are crucian carp crossing the river, especially primary and secondary schools. However, examining their content, most are simple and crude, mainly focusing on business considerations. As for those that teach earnestly and have complete equipment, it can be said that less than one in ten are like this. For example, physical and chemical experiments require sufficient instruments and machinery and actual experimentation. The study of social sciences requires abundant reference books and a large library. However, the old ones have either been destroyed in wars or damaged long ago. Moreover, due to the interruption of sources and the high cost, replenishment is not easy to achieve. Furthermore, because of the high prices and the increasing expenses, in order to maintain the lives of teachers and the expenses of the school, the collection of tuition and miscellaneous fees naturally rises like water, increasing proportionally. However, once tuition and miscellaneous fees are expensive, the students coming to the school will also be affected accordingly. For the sake of attracting students, they have to compromise and give students various conveniences. The trend of transferring schools and skipping grades, and selling diplomas follows. In addition, the capacity of classrooms exceeds the prescribed number, the equipment of sports fields is completely lacking, the lack of transparency in school finances, and the prevalence of speculation and profiteering can be said to be one of the current pathological states of education.

    Two, From the perspective of teachers: It can be said that teachers in our country have meager incomes and heavy responsibilities. This was the case in normal times, and it is even more so today. Affected by the high-price policy, most of the general teachers are overwhelmed by the heavy burden of family expenses, it can be said that eight or nine out of ten, and only one or two out of a hundred can maintain their family life. However, life cannot be lived without food. In the absence of any other way, they can only increase the number of teaching hours to supplement their income; if the school is insufficient, they can seek compensation from other schools. As a result, it is very common to teach more than thirty hours a week and rush between four or five schools. This is not only the case for primary and secondary school teachers, but also for university professors. However, personal spirit is not infinite, and one's expertise is also limited; because of the large number of hours taken on, the explanation is inevitably loose, and there is no mood to grade papers. From the students' point of view, the benefits are inevitably reduced, but from the teachers' point of view, they are already sweating profusely and exhausted. After returning home, they have to rest earlier, and there is absolutely no time or courage to study. However, learning is like sailing against the current, if you don't advance, you retreat. Moreover, the world's trends are constantly in turmoil and evolution. If you cannot catch up, you will become outdated, which can be said to be the second of the current pathological states of education.

    Three, From the perspective of students: Students are the future masters of the country, and the relationship is of great importance. When studying at school, they should concentrate and strive to be diligent and industrious, exercise their bodies, and study their subjects, in order to make more contributions to the country. However, our country's science is originally backward, and in recent years, because of the difficulties of life, most parents have already felt that they are at the end of their rope and are in a terrible state for the seven things needed to start a day, and except for a few exceptions, they can be said to be unable to do anything about their children's education expenses, and their love is unable to help, let alone the tuition fees are increasing day by day, so the number of students is decreasing day by day. Not to mention universities, the situation in primary and secondary schools is also the same, what a profound crisis this is! Not only that, but among the students at school, those who can truly study for the sake of studying can be said to be rare; the poor are mostly distracted by family affairs, and the rich are subdued by love, regarding the school as a decoration, as a title, only seeking to graduate as soon as possible, so that they can get by in society. Therefore, the trend of transferring schools and skipping grades, and buying diplomas is very prevalent. The level of proficiency is rapidly declining. Even students who fail in School A go to School B and are promoted by two grades, and many students who have not graduated from high school are studying at university. From the school's point of view, in order to cope with the environment and increase income, it has to have its difficulties. From the students' point of view, it is not too much to blame them for taking advantage of the opportunity to obtain qualifications as soon as possible, but from the country's point of view, the general level of knowledge of students is declining day by day, how can they shoulder the important task of building and restoring the country. From the social point of view, the opening of this trend is enough to have a bad influence and reduce the faith in schools, which can be said to be the third of the current pathological states of education.

    Four, From the perspective of the country: Developing education and cultivating talents is originally the special responsibility of the country, so the great powers allocate educational funds generously and actively carry out the elimination of illiteracy. Since the funding for schools is quite generous, and the equipment is quite complete, it can gain the faith of society and produce good results. Since the income of teachers is rich and their lives are quite stable, they can avoid changing their minds and regard it as a lifelong career. Our country has never attached importance to education funds in normal times, let alone today, when the country is in a state of war and military letters are flying around, it can be said that it is not surprising that education funds cannot be generously allocated! Therefore, except for national or public schools, the education authorities and the school authorities can be said to have no contact. The subsidies of the past have long been abolished, and the nominal inspections are equal to formalities. The two sides are as unrelated as horses and oxen in the wind. Not only that, but the education authorities, even for national or public schools, also issue insufficient funds or arrears of several months due to financial difficulties. Due to the financial difficulties of education, it is difficult to be strict with the supervision of schools, so everything is not on track and is becoming increasingly corrupt, which can be said to be inevitable, which can be said to be the fourth of the current pathological states of education.

According to the above, it can be seen that there are many reasons for the current pathological state of education in our country, and they are mutually cyclical and mutually causal, resulting in today's situation, and the reason why education in our country can be maintained without falling is the support of enthusiastic people in society. For example, the scholarship of Shen Bao, the loan of Xinwen Bao, and the scholarship of Uncle Ping are particularly famous. They either invite powerful and enthusiastic people in society to donate, or they pay out of their own pockets, all of which are well-managed and have outstanding reputations. Hearing the news, there are the scholarships of the Guangdong, Hubei, Changzhou, and Shaoxing fellow villagers associations, and the number of students who have received assistance is no less than tens of thousands, which is really a grand event that should be written about in detail. What is regrettable is that the establishment of this type of scholarship can only supervise students, and the standard for admission is based on the students' academic performance. As for the schools and teachers, they are not asked, which is inevitably biased. Furthermore, due to the limitation of the amount of money, it is still impossible to eliminate illiteracy and popularize education. Therefore, I am not talented, and I will briefly list a few important adjustment methods below:

    First, what the education authorities should be responsible for can be divided into nine points as follows: (1) They should generously allocate education funds so that those engaged in education can be free from the pressure of life and be able to concentrate on education. Continued on the second page of the special issue.

## Page 6

Continued from the first page of the special issue: (2) Establish national or public elementary schools and compel children to attend, so that illiteracy can be reduced day by day; (3) Establish more practical schools such as agriculture, industry, commerce, and medicine, to benefit our country's economic construction; (4) Establish more vocational supplementary schools and night schools to benefit the continuing education of young people in their spare time; (5) Strictly supervise private schools, and promptly ban those that are poorly managed or corrupt the atmosphere; (6) Increase the salaries of teachers, strictly screen them, and stipulate the number of teaching hours per week, so that they can work wholeheartedly and not mislead the children; (7) Implement a unified examination system to improve the level of students; (8) Make efforts to provide special allocations for faculty and staff, and it is best to handle it separately according to the population of the teacher's family, so that it is fair; (9) There should be clear regulations for the collection of tuition and miscellaneous fees for schools at all levels.

    Second, what the school authorities should be responsible for can be divided into seven points as follows: (1) The finances should be absolutely transparent, and the salaries of teachers should be paid entirely from the income from tuition fees. If it is possible to use this to handle in-kind payments for teachers, that would be best, but it is absolutely not allowed to engage in speculation and hoarding; (2) All equipment should be as complete as possible within the possible range, in order to benefit the students' studies, especially the light in the classrooms and the capacity of the students should be carefully considered, and should not be done carelessly; (3) The selection and removal of teachers must be strict, and the diligence and laziness of teachers should also be investigated; (4) School teachers should be full-time in principle. Primary and secondary school teachers should not teach more than 20 hours per week, and university professors should not teach more than 12 hours per week, in order to facilitate grading papers and continuing education after class; (5) The management of students must be strict, and the trend of transferring schools, skipping grades, and selling diplomas should be jointly banned to maintain the reputation of the school; (6) The whole school should often hold important subject examinations or speech competitions to encourage students' interest; (7) The collection of tuition and miscellaneous fees should take into account the ability of parents.

    Third, what teachers should pay attention to can be divided into four points below: First, classes should start and end on time, and the explanations should be clear, and the attitude should be sincere, so that students can gain faith; second, the number of hours teachers teach per week, whether in primary and secondary schools or universities, should be limited, and they should not be greedy, so that they have the opportunity to continue their studies and not become outdated; third, teachers should teach exclusively in one school in principle, and if it is absolutely necessary to teach part-time, it should be limited to one school, so that the spirit can be focused and there is enough time; fourth, they should use summer or winter vacations to carry out tutoring or travel to enrich their knowledge. If the income of teachers can maintain a family life, all problems will not be difficult to solve.

    Fourth, what students should pay attention to can also be divided into several points as follows: First, they should study practical subjects, and if they do not understand something, they should ask in detail and not let it pass vaguely; second, they should exercise their bodies more, so-called strengthening the body can also strengthen the country; third, they should encourage good character and strive to be complete people, and they should especially prohibit absenteeism and asking for leave; fourth, they must not transfer schools, skip grades, or buy diplomas in order to seek quick success. Although this may be a small benefit at present, if the basic knowledge is not sufficient, they will not be able to pursue advanced studies, and when they enter society in the future, they will feel the lack of knowledge, and it will be too late to regret it!

Looking at the world's great powers, the reason why they have reached today's status can be said to be starting from the development of education. If you want to develop education, you must have sufficient funds and excellent talents. The reason why education in our country is not easy to manage well can also be said to be affected by funds and talents, and in today's situation, it can be clearly recognized. It is hoped that the education authorities can generously allocate funds, employ talents, and be able to consider reducing tuition fees, then there is hope for the development of education in our country!

### My Views on the Current Educational Reform Issues

— Zhu Zuocai

To discuss what the current educational problems are, one must first understand what the goal of education is. Speaking of educational goals, from ancient times to the present, Chinese and foreign educators have all had their say. Due to word count limitations, it is not convenient to introduce them one by one. Here, the training objectives of middle schools, which are located in the central hub of the school system and connect the upper and lower levels, are used as a reference for us to examine the current educational problems: 1. To cultivate strong physical fitness. 2. To cultivate civic morality. 3. To cultivate national culture. 4. To enrich biological and vital knowledge and skills. 5. To cultivate a scientific foundation. 6. To develop labor habits. 7. To stimulate artistic interests. The above seven points, although encompassing society, the individual, material things, culture, morality, knowledge, skills, language, science, and art, can be summarized into four categories: health, vocation, citizenship, and leisure. Health includes the preservation of life and health; vocation includes the use of tools, symbols, and other special skills required in civilized life and practical business, to enhance work efficiency; citizenship includes the individual's restraint and coordination with society, and cooperation and participation in group activities; leisure includes the use of free time to make life more uplifting and fulfilling. If the goal of education is like this, then what is the current state of education, the general education situation in Shanghai today? To what extent are health education, vocational training, civic education, and leisure activity training implemented in schools? It is undeniable that most schools, due to simple equipment, substandard school buildings, lack of qualified teachers, lackluster school management, and poor teaching interest, reduce educational efficiency and even achieve the opposite effect, much like a patient who consults a quack doctor and takes the wrong medicine, not only failing to cure the disease but also deepening it or turning it into an incurable terminal illness. So, is all this responsibility on the shoulders of those running the schools and the teachers? No! We cannot place all the blame on the teachers. The majority of the responsibility still lies with the various members of society and the authorities responsible for educational administration. Teachers are only responsible for the actual work, much like the bricklayers, carpenters, painters, and laborers who build houses. I ask, can these craftsmen, with their bare hands, build skyscrapers? Furthermore, do all school-age children in Shanghai and other places have the opportunity to attend school? If we do not eliminate the 80% illiteracy rate, can a small number of scholar-officials save the country and build the nation? In short, the problem lies in [economics], the problem of education funding, which cannot be universally solved by a few philanthropists. Every member of society must treat education with enthusiasm, and the government authorities with the power of educational administration should also vigorously raise funds for education, strive to promote it, and take on the responsibility of supervision and leadership. Then, there will be nothing that cannot be achieved. Since the cause of education is the foundation for national prosperity and national survival, the cause of education should be directly managed by the state, planned comprehensively, so as to achieve the expected effect of uniformity. Private schools are always inevitably scattered, lax, and each doing its own thing, resulting in a shop-like situation that is shocking. Shanghai is the largest city in the country, the center of economy and culture. Although it has not lost its position in this wartime state, practically speaking, with Shanghai's talent and wealth, what difficulty is there in achieving ideal goals by devoting itself to education? I hereby offer my sincere suggestions, discussing matters as they stand, for the reference of those who are reforming current education. 1. Add public schools. Given the size of Shanghai and its large population, compared to the existing number of public school students and the number of students in the city, there is a huge disparity. Therefore, under the current circumstances, if it is not possible to establish them universally, public schools should be added in appropriate locations. These schools, whether in teaching methods, school administration, school equipment, or training implementation, should be models for private schools of each level in each region. Tuition and miscellaneous fees should be waived across the board. The principal is the head of a school and is related to the success or failure of a school. Therefore, the selection of principals should be carefully selected. Those who do not have a spirit of service and practical educational experience should not be appointed. 2. Rectify private schools. Because public schools are scarce, private schools have emerged in response to social needs, so that school-age children have places to study, and the foundation of the country can continue. This should be credited to many private school organizers who are enthusiastic about education. However, today, there are indeed many who are truly educating for the sake of education, but there are also not a few who treat education as a business, using it to obtain profits and suddenly become wealthy. Moreover, many schools have narrow school buildings, polluted air, dark light, and simple equipment, which affects the health of students; teachers are of poor quality and lack spirit, which affects students' academics and character; the board of directors exists in name only and not in reality, and funding relies entirely on tuition fees and is not disclosed; if there are too few students, there is multi-grade teaching; if there are too many students, the classroom is crowded, regardless of the teacher's energy or whether the students can benefit. All of this inevitably misleads the children and destroys the pillars of the country. How can we not rectify it and make mistakes in the future? The method of rectification should first determine the principles of rectification: excellent schools should be commended, corrupt schools should be banned or ordered to improve. 3. Cultivate educational talents. The so-called educational talents refer to the cultivation of educational personnel who are responsible for supervising and guiding the development of education. Graduates from the education departments of various universities who have participated in practical teaching work for several years before and after their studies, or normal school graduates with more than five years of educational experience who have received short-term training, are most suitable to be educational administrative cadres. One is a teacher who is directly responsible for education. In addition to having expertise in a specialty, secondary school teachers should be nurtured by educational courses and have a full understanding of educational principles, educational philosophy, secondary education, and various psychologies, teaching materials, and teaching methods. As for the original secondary school teachers, they should use holidays or self-study methods to improve themselves. Primary school teachers should be trained in normal schools as a principle. At present, there is a lack of teachers. Normal schools should be added or classes expanded, and non-normal school graduates among the original teachers should be tested and identified, removing the dross and keeping the essence. Elementary teachers should be selected from outstanding junior high school graduates who have received one year of teacher training (simplified normal school method) to fill the position. All living expenses of normal school students are provided by the school to show preferential treatment. In addition to cultivating teaching skills, training methods are also important in teacher training. Attention should be paid to the teacher's own academic and moral cultivation to create excellent teachers. The times are advancing, and learning is endless. Assistance and encouragement should be given to the original teachers' further studies. Teachers who are ambitious and work-study should be given various conveniences and assistance. 4. Stabilize teachers' lives. Teachers' lives have always been known to be poor, and today, they are even poorer. No wonder many teachers, tormented by life, abandon their chalk and seek other development. Some who are steadfast can barely maintain their lives, and are particularly interested in educational work; some are single and only need to take care of themselves; some want to do business, but have no capital and no recommendation to join other industries. They cannot get out, and they have to take care of their children. However, we must pay attention that in a situation where salaries are increased every half year and prices rise day and night, if teachers' lives continue to be so poor, teachers who can barely maintain their lives will eventually not be able to maintain them; teachers who are particularly interested in educational work will also find it difficult to work on an empty stomach; single men will also have to start a family one day. When the cloth gown has to be taken off and the children have to be taken care of, they will also leave the school and seek another livelihood. At that time, who else would be willing to enter normal school and become a normal school student preparing to change careers? What kind of people will be responsible for the important task of education at that time? Of course, it will be a group of mediocre and incompetent outsiders who fill the ranks. It is not difficult to imagine what stage the education cause will reach. Not to mention the future, even in reality, the number of people who have not received teacher training and have no teaching ability and are acting as teachers is increasing day by day. Isn't this a major crisis? If we want to revitalize the spirit of teachers, develop an interest in educational work, and enhance educational effectiveness, we must first stabilize the lives of teachers. The high hats of [purity], [sacredness], and [longevity] can no longer be worn on the heads of smart and capable teachers who are freezing and starving. The specific measures to stabilize teachers' lives, as far as I can see, are described below: A. Increase salary standards. Public schools should calculate monthly according to the cost of living index. Private schools should disclose their finances and use more than 70% of the school's total income as salaries for all school teachers and staff. Salary standards should be divided into different grades according to the amount of classwork and the complexity of the work. The maximum difference should not exceed 50% of the lowest salary. For middle schools that use the minute system, 24 periods per week are calculated as one full-time teacher. B. Schools provide accommodation for teachers. Teachers living on campus can reduce the waste of time and transportation costs on the road. At the same time, it is reassuring and convenient for handling school affairs and classwork. The environment is pure, and common learning can also achieve the benefits of collective wisdom. The solution to the teacher accommodation problem will surely increase educational efficiency. C. Special rationing of daily necessities. Teachers serve the public and the country, and their treatment should be the same as ordinary civil servants. During the implementation of the wartime controlled economic policy, the government should allocate daily necessities to each teacher and their direct relatives according to actual consumption, such as rice (special rice allocation, which the authorities are working on), briquettes, oil, salt, sugar, and clothing, to reduce worries about life. Then, teachers will no longer always think about the firewood problem at home in the classroom. D. Exemption from self-defense corps service. The Baojia organization is to protect local security, and young people of the age of self-defense corps service should have the obligation to serve and seek local security together. However, teachers have a heavy responsibility for educating children and heavy workload. In their spare time, they have to correct homework and handle miscellaneous affairs. Therefore, they should be treated preferentially and allowed to be exempted from service. 5. Subsidize private school funding. Schools with very abundant funding do not need subsidies, but most private schools have tight funding, which makes everything simple and unable to do anything. The situation should be considered and various subsidies should be given to ensure that some educational schools are no longer in a precarious position and encounter abandonment halfway, or affect the educational spirit and the physical and mental development of students. 6. Support poor students. It is too early to say. But we also have ways to support poor students, such as instructing private schools at all levels to set a few percent of free quotas and half-fee quotas, exempting tuition fees, and having the government supply news or encouraging various public groups to bear the burden separately; or designating more complete private schools to specifically recruit free students or half-fee students, and all expenses are allocated by the government according to the expenses of public schools. (That is, the previous substitute method) Among these poor students, if there are particularly outstanding students, in addition to completing elementary education, they should be promoted to middle school and university at public expense. 7. Reward private school founders. Education is best run directly by the state. When the economy is unable to do it all, people from all walks of life should be responsible for working together to ensure that every school-age child has the opportunity to be educated. The government should reward those who donate funds to build schools, or record them in books, or erect monuments for them, or give them items as souvenirs, or make them famous in the world, so as to create an atmosphere in society where private individuals donate funds to build schools. Public groups that donate funds to build schools should be commended in the same way. 8. Establish compulsory schools. Compulsory schools, in addition to not charging any fees, also provide books and stationery. In this kind of school, writing and calculation are the most important courses (that is, the three Rs). Therefore, it is most appropriate to have half-day classes to meet the principle of economy. Students are recruited from poor children who cannot afford to go to school on their own, and who must assist in school affairs, or have fixed jobs, or run small businesses. Thus, the unfortunate children who have always been rejected outside the school gate can also have the opportunity to study. 9. Value health education. [Great achievements reside in a healthy body]; [To strengthen the country, first strengthen the race]; [Health is the key to happiness]. These are all truths. Since we understand the importance of health, we should pay more attention to health education, and the depth of our attention should be above academics. I ask, in addition to focusing on academics, do school administrations pay attention to the health of students? We can no longer let students be locked up in classrooms and study to death. Health facilities should be held more and more, and the environment that hinders the health of students should be improved one by one. Municipal public gymnasiums should also be opened more and more. As for leisure activities that are beneficial to physical and mental health, they should also be promoted more and more, so as to replace improper entertainment. 10. Enhance the inspection system. The connection and close cooperation between schools and the administrative authorities should be fully responsible by the supervisors who are in charge of the inspection work. The inspection of the supervisors has the positive construction and the passive improvement. The promotion of educational efficiency depends on how the supervisors' inspection work is done. Therefore, the educational administrative authorities should value and enhance the supervisors' inspection system. Furthermore, due to the importance of the inspection work, supervisors should not be selected unless they have a spirit of service, more than five years of practical teaching experience, excellent results, and new ideas. If the supervisor district system is implemented, it will be even more appropriate to have full-time supervisors for teaching, training, general affairs, and health.

### Security Funding and Tax Revenue Consolidation and Increase

— Wei Mou

The war has reached a decisive stage, and strengthening political power has become an urgent task. The only characteristic of victorious politics is that all facilities of the government can deeply win the hearts of the people, so as to establish outstanding prestige. In peacetime, the existence of the government plays a great role in the economic development of the country. The production, distribution, consumption, and exchange of wealth are all affected by the government. Because the government's security duties can maintain social justice and security, people's lives and property can be guaranteed, and social order can be kept quiet. All of this is necessary for production. In order to increase economic production and enrich the lives of the people, it is necessary to consolidate local security at any time. When the country is at war, local security is even more important. In order to enhance the power of war and strengthen the belief in victory, if local security cannot be maintained, the people will not be able to live and work in peace and contentment, let alone other things. Conversely, if the people's lives can be free from worry due to good security, then the people will have a special affection for the government, and the political foundation will inevitably become stronger. The maintenance of security agencies requires huge funding. If funding is not sufficient, administrative efficiency cannot be achieved. If salaries are not sufficient, the minimum standard of living cannot be maintained. Taking Shanghai as an example, the security agencies include public servants, police, and security team service personnel. Their current treatment is too meager. Although Shanghai has established a police cooperative and increased special allocations, life is still difficult to solve. If their lives cannot be reasonably adjusted, the future of social security is worrying, and evil deeds such as extortion, fraud, blackmail, excessive collection, and embezzlement cannot be eradicated. Passive repeated orders and spiritual training cannot stop the continuation of corrupt politics. The fundamental way to implement clean politics is to solve their living problems, that is, to make them full. Only after they are full can the people be full. To make them full, their real income must be increased, so that they can take on the important task of security, and the people's model and example can also be established from this. The source of all expenses is income, and the government's main income is tax revenue. Increasing tax revenue can be done by adding new taxes and increasing old tax rates. It can also be done by consolidating old taxes. Consolidating taxes is a stable way to increase tax revenue. It does not disturb the people, but can make tax revenue move towards self-discipline, economy, and progress. The increase in security funding is nothing more than the application of tax consolidation and tax increase. After financial consolidation, income will inevitably increase and funding will be enriched. Then, the salaries of public servants, police, and security teams will be fully increased to stabilize their lives. If it is still not enough, it is better to make up for it by increasing taxes. How to consolidate taxes and increase taxes, I will express my opinions as follows: 1. Abolish the tax contract system. The emergence of the tax contract system was originally a temporary measure because the organization of financial institutions was not perfect and tax revenue could not be abandoned. The tax contract system itself has many shortcomings. Those who obtain the contracting rights often have relatives or fellow villagers with the tax authorities, or they get it by being good at flattering. Contractors naturally take a purely profit-oriented view of tax contracts. When collecting taxes, they not only use commercial means but also rely on special forces to collect taxes. The contracted amount is often far less than the actual amount collected. Therefore, the benefit to the government is very small. The biggest regret in Shanghai's finances now is the existence of the tax contract system, which is not allowed to exist for a sound tax system. Shanghai's financial institutions are not flexible and not sound. A unified collection method should be adopted to enrich Shanghai's income. 2. Prevent illegal tax evasion. Illegal tax evasion is a type of tax evasion. The benefits obtained by tax evaders are the losses suffered by the government. Therefore, the financial authorities should prevent illegal tax evasion. Shanghai's current special consumption tax is paid by the merchants themselves, and tax evasion occurs from time to time. The initiators of tax evasion are merchants or consumers. Merchants often exempt consumers from taxes in order to attract customers. Sometimes merchants conceal reports for profit, and even collude with tax collectors to evade taxes. Preventing the evasion of special consumption taxes can also increase Shanghai's tax revenue. The methods to prevent the evasion of special consumption taxes are: 1. Issuing special consumption tax tickets; 2. Adopting uniform invoices, and the financial authorities can strictly check the account books of various stores. In this way, tax evasion can be prevented, and merchants and the people will know to self-check, and tax revenue will not be lacking. 3. Abolish harsh and miscellaneous taxes and consolidate the land tax. When the political situation is chaotic, the only characteristic of local finances is the heavy burden of harsh and miscellaneous taxes. In recent years, the Chinese countryside has been affected by the war and has also increased many miscellaneous taxes. The payment of land tax is still light, but the additional miscellaneous taxes are really unbearable for farmers. The existence of miscellaneous taxes not only indicates the corruption of local politics, but is also the source of all disasters. In Shanghai's finances, the income from land tax also occupies an important position. However, the various miscellaneous taxes and harsh taxes in the rural areas near Shanghai include township fees, garrison fuel supply fees, military and police lamp oil fees, garrison food allowances, troop transit reception fees, military and police rice allowances, police officer uniform fees, defense construction fees, and residence permit fees. They not only violate the principle of tax certainty, but also extremely disrupt the rural economy. To increase the income from land tax, harsh and miscellaneous taxes must first be abolished. Regarding the consolidation of land tax, in addition to adhering to the consistent policy and stepping up the implementation of land registration and land survey, which are both fundamental and symptomatic, it is especially important to revise the scientific principles and adjust the tax rates to suit the current socio-economic environment. 4. Thoroughly reform financial administration. The reform of financial administration is closely related to the entire tax revenue. Now, Shanghai's financial administration needs to be thoroughly reformed. The most obvious manifestation is the issue of discipline among tax personnel. No one admits that there is no need for reform. The discipline of tax personnel is only one aspect of financial administration. If financial administration can be thoroughly reformed, then other small problems can be easily solved. The focus of reforming financial administration is the rational adjustment of people and money, and the establishment of a good system for people and money. Establishing a civil service system and a public treasury system is what Shanghai's financial administrative organs must achieve now. First, establish a civil service system: the so-called system does not mean ignoring the conditions of people. Governing people and governing the law should be given equal importance, and neither is indispensable. Regarding the establishment of the civil service system, the purpose is to select outstanding talents to carry out affairs and ensure their stable lives and secure positions. All financial administrative personnel, even if they are truly talented, must be drawn from objective standards, so that they come from the way of examination and training. After serving, all performance evaluations, promotions, guarantees, and pensions are formulated into rules and regulations, so that there is an objective standard to rely on. All talents are not promoted based on personal feelings, but based on the system, not based on subjective preferences, but based on objective standards. Second, establish a public treasury system. The fundamental spirit of the public treasury system is that tax collectors do not handle money. Taxpayers should directly pay into the national treasury after the tax collection agency investigates and approves the tax amount. There is an idiom in our country, "[passing through the hands, three parts fat]" means that as long as you are an official and handle banknotes, even if you are not corrupt, you can still have a wide hand and get some oil and water. If the public treasury system is strictly implemented, the tax collectors will not handle banknotes, and there is no opportunity for embezzlement and enrichment at all, and tax corruption cannot be done. If the Shanghai Municipal Government can consider the situation and implement the public treasury system universally and completely, then there is a great guarantee for the increase in tax revenue. The above is the method of consolidating taxes. To increase Shanghai's financial income, the above four items must be fully achieved. The methods for increasing taxes are described below: Increase retail donation: Retail donation is a type of consumption tax, and its income is very elastic and very common. Therefore, if you want to increase taxes, it is better to increase retail donation. The original tax rate for retail donation was 4%, of which 2% was paid to the central government, and the remaining 2% was local income. In order to increase Shanghai's local security funding, the retail donation tax rate can be increased to 6%, of which 2% is fully used for local security funding. In order to prevent misappropriation, a special fund can be set up for safekeeping. In order for Shanghai to become a national political model area, the maintenance of security must be strengthened. To strengthen security, security funding must be increased. The way to raise funds is through tax consolidation and tax increase. What is discussed now is detailed in tax consolidation and simplified in tax increase. This is not a bias on one side. I believe that there must first be tax consolidation and then tax increase can be implemented. Otherwise, the old tax will still not be consolidated, and only tax increase is planned. The people's burden is increased and the tax revenue will not be increased in a reasonable proportion.

### Review of Tax Increases and Tax Collection Methods

Finance is what all people desire and what governance requires. If the people's wealth can be used to manage the people's affairs, and all policies can be implemented with impartiality, then the government and the people will both benefit, and there will be no shortage of funds. There will be no increases to budgeted amounts, and practical use will not be excessive. Taking from the people and distributing to the people, both fairly and transparently, will foster trust between the government and the governed. All advanced countries operate in this way. If taxes are low, national funds will inevitably be insufficient. Officials cannot be expected to ruin their families to relieve the nation or exhaust their private resources to serve the public. Ultimately, they will still have to take from the people, but outside of regular taxes, this will turn into hidden regulations and endless embezzlement, seeking exceptions in every way, cleverly seizing and arbitrarily levying taxes, many times more than the regular tax. The government gains nothing, while the common people suffer the harm. Even among public servants in the same tax collection agency, those without the power to handle disbursements appear incompetent. In today's environment of expensive goods, those who must remain honest on their monthly salary are essentially working on an empty stomach. Those who enrich themselves are full of ill-gotten gains, as if it were their due. I personally believe it is better to thoroughly investigate and openly increase taxes.

Consider the tax increases in this city. At a time when civil servants and police officers are not adequately compensated, if the city treasury is not balanced with the district treasury taxes, the monthly loss is approximately 60 million. This is why tax increases cannot be delayed any longer. The Baojia (community policing) donation was initiated after the annual budget was already set, so it was organized separately. The amounts set, such as ten yuan per month for dependent households and thirty yuan for primary households, are collected by the Jia chiefs on a per-household basis. The amounts are appropriate, easy to collect, and the burden on the people is relatively equal. This can be continued next year. Property tax has already been increased by 60 percent. The valuation for determining the tax amount is based on the building's construction and facilities, as well as the location's accessibility, to determine the amount. Land tax has not yet been increased. If it were also increased by 60 percent, its valuation could also be based on the quality of the environment and the accessibility of transportation to determine the different grades. This is something that urgently needs to be implemented. The increased amount will be fairly distributed between the rich and the poor. Moreover, prosperous areas in this city account for the majority, so the amount of tax increases will differ greatly from rural areas. The total amount of the increase should be substantial.

Consider the methods of tax collection that urgently need to be investigated, such as the consumption tax on vendors and small shops. There are no accounts to verify; even if there are rough accounts, they are illegible and their authenticity cannot be determined. Either the officials embezzle, or the merchants do, or they share the profits, with the merchants taking seven parts and the officials taking three. It would be better to adopt a contracted tax method, such as for traders of antiques, jade, and other objects who have no accounts to verify and use oral agreements. Each trade association should estimate the amount, submit it to the relevant authorities for approval, and the merchants should pay the tax accordingly. This is also a way to investigate and reduce corruption. Consider that the tax collection agencies under the Ministry of Finance's Tax Bureau continue to use the precedents from before the incidents, establishing inspectors and supervisors. For example, stamp tax has regular inspections, or quarterly inspections. Although the methods are not as complete as before, they still retain their concrete and minor functions. The inspections are conducted jointly with the local district police, but the deliberation on penalties has lost the previous good method of joint discussion with police officers. However, spot checks on field staff, verification of shop guarantees, and thorough investigation of public complaints against illegal acts by officials are all the exclusive duties of inspectors and supervisors. This is also a good system for investigating long-standing malpractices and preventing illegal activities. It is recently learned that the newly established Special Tax Office of this city was established on September 16, with sections for investigation, survey, review, and management. After this rectification, and prohibiting merchants from taking advantage of loopholes, it should not let the previous good methods be the only ones. The way to manage finances is simply to circulate wealth and implement fair policies. There is no other way. When the country clearly knows that national funds are insufficient, yet is content with collecting little, it is because when starting anew, the people's trust has not yet been cultivated, and when at peace, the nation's treasury has not yet been depleted. When the situation is not yet critical, the laws are not changed. Today, we are in a time of many events and face a difficult situation, so what are we waiting for to change? To sit idly by and watch the slackening of governance, the poverty of the government, and the distress of officials, while remaining indifferent, like the physician Bian Que looking at superficial ailments. The troubles of society will become deeper and deeper over time. Alas!
