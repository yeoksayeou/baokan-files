### Correcting the Amount of Living Subsidies for Teachers

Currently, the salaries of primary and secondary school teachers are meager, insufficient to maintain a living, which affects educational efficiency. This is an undeniable fact. In order to maintain the effectiveness of education, we strongly advocate for improving teachers' salaries. Recently, the municipal authorities initiated the collection of living subsidies for primary and secondary school teachers and staff. We strongly agree with this in principle. Therefore, in addition to repeatedly appealing to all sectors of society in writing, we also collected donations, with satisfactory results. Within two weeks, we have completed the target of one million yuan, marking a stage. Hereby, we would like to express our sincerest gratitude to all the generous donors.

However, recently, we have received reports from many parents of students. On the one hand, they feel helpless towards the school's collection of subsidies due to their own economic difficulties. On the other hand, they express disagreement with the amount and method of collection. For example, the article "Unspeakable Distress" by Chang Henjun in today's National Forum published in this newspaper is very profound and sincere. Furthermore, reading the notice of the collection of subsidies from the Municipal He'an Elementary School states: "To Whom It May Concern: The cost of living in this city has recently increased sharply, and the salaries of teachers and staff are meager. Working on an empty stomach affects the educational effect, which is far from trivial. We have repeatedly petitioned the municipal government to provide relief. Upon the decision of the municipal government and educational authorities, each school is allowed to collect living subsidies from students' parents to supplement their income. Detailed methods have already been announced in the newspapers, and we believe you are aware of them. Our school will collect 300 yuan per student as a one-time living subsidy for teachers and staff, starting from today. Please pay to the school's accounting office immediately and receive a receipt. We believe that your parents are wise and, for the sake of your children's studies and the maintenance of education, will be able to understand and support this." The school notice seems to be acting under orders, with no room for flexibility. Although the notice does not include the sentence "Failure to pay within three days will result in immediate expulsion," it also lacks the explanation that "those with economic difficulties may be exempt from payment."

It is very common and ordinary for parents to have several children attending school at the same time. It is also very common and ordinary for parents to be salaried employees. In the current price situation, it is already difficult for salaried employees to support their children's lives. Being able to attend school is already a stretch. If they suddenly have to pay a considerable subsidy (for example, three children would require 900 yuan), it would indeed be difficult under an unbalanced budget. Secondly, considering the prevalence of applications for student loans and scholarships, poor families would find it even more difficult to bear. As a result, if students are forced to drop out of school because they cannot pay the subsidy, wouldn't that be contrary to the original intention of subsidizing teachers' lives and maintaining the effectiveness of education?

The motivation for initiating subsidies for teachers is definitely not based on the idea of "robbing Peter to pay Paul." Therefore, in principle, poor families who are unable to provide subsidies should be exempt. Even those who are able to afford it should be divided into different levels based on their ability to pay. The meaning of a subsidy is a moral obligation and should not be regarded as a compulsory responsibility. It is fundamentally different from paying taxes. Therefore, item three of the collection method promulgated by the authorities stipulates four levels: 20 yuan, 30 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan, which students' parents can determine based on their economic situation. If a parent has the economic ability to pay 100 yuan but only pays 20 yuan, it means that the parent lacks a sense of public morality and only bears moral condemnation, which can only be tolerated and cannot be held legally responsible. Therefore, it is against the principle of the regulations promulgated by the authorities for schools to collect the highest amount uniformly without specifying different levels of self-assessment. This only arouses parents' dissatisfaction with the school and completely loses the beautiful intention of subsidizing teachers and respecting their profession.

We do not wish to delve too deeply into this matter. We hope that the educational authorities will pay attention to the reality that poor families cannot afford the burden and adhere to the original intention of the promulgated methods, correcting the amount and method of collection in various schools so that this very sacred motivation does not lead to a very bad outcome. May the future of education be fortunate, and may the social enterprise be fortunate.

### On the Imphal Northern Front, the British Urgently Attempt to Open a Retreat Route; Japanese Forces Annihilate Many Enemies on the Kohima Highway

Rangoon, 19th (Central News Agency) According to reports from the Indian front, the enemy forces are currently urgently trying to open up a retreat route on the northern front of Imphal. It seems that they are trying to allow British soldiers to escape. Almost all the corpses abandoned by the enemy since the 12th are British soldiers. On the 11th, 400 trucks headed north on the road parallel to the Iril River. All those on board were British soldiers. The right-wing Japanese forces, waiting for an opportunity to intercept them, intercepted them. On the afternoon of the 12th, Japanese forces annihilated hundreds of British soldiers on the Kohima Highway. On the Ukhrul Highway, Japanese forces defeated the attacking British forces on the 4955 Highland on the 13th. Two hundred British soldiers attempted to recapture the 4241 Highland, but were severely counterattacked by the Japanese forces. Many British corpses were left behind, and they retreated in defeat.

Rangoon, 19th (Central News Agency) Since the Indian National Army entered India, Britain has been deeply embarrassed and has been conducting counter-propaganda against the Indian people. It is now repeatedly conducting false propaganda among the Indian soldiers in the British Indian Army on the Palel front. The New Delhi radio station initially concealed news about the Indian National Army, but since the Indian National Army began broadcasting, it has been difficult to hide. It then mentioned the so-called Indian National Army and later referred to it as the Indian National Army. Fearing that the successive advances of the Indian National Army would have a great impact on its subordinates, it launched a slanderous campaign against the Indian National Army, claiming that it was of poor quality, revealing its ugly face. At present, many Indian soldiers on the front line hope to emulate the Indian National Army. As a result, the British army's propaganda has become increasingly absurd and ridiculous, such as claiming that those who surrender to the Japanese army will be killed, that the Japanese army's bullets are mixed with wooden ones, that the Indian National Army is just a name, and that Jiang Tela Baus has died, and so on. The Indian soldiers who surrendered to the Indian National Army were shocked and astonished to see the truth of the Japanese-Indian alliance and bitterly resented the shamelessness of the British army.

### Report on the Situation on the Palel Front by a Japanese Officer

Shonan, 19th (Central News Agency) The battle between the two armies for the Imphal Fortress has attracted worldwide attention. A Japanese officer was recently dispatched to the Indo-Burmese border to inspect the front line of Palel and various locations in detail for two months. The following is his report: The enemy's ambition to recapture Burma has been completely shattered by the Japanese army. The Japanese army is now focusing all its efforts on attacking Imphal, a strategic point in eastern India, and its progress is highly noteworthy. Looking back at the beginning of the Indo-Burmese campaign, the Allied forces of the United States, Britain, and China planned to launch a counter-offensive against Burma, using Chittagong, an important location in the Bay of Bengal, as a base, and simultaneously advancing from four directions: Akyab in the southwest, northern Imphal, eastern Fort Dufferin, and Yunnan Province, in an attempt to recapture Burma in one fell swoop. Therefore, the enemy forces deployed the 15th Army Corps in the Akyab area, including the 5th, 7th, and 26th divisions of the British Indian Army, and the 81st division of the West African Army. They gradually began to move. However, the main forces of the 7th Division and the 81st Division of the West African Army were almost completely annihilated in the Sinzwe Valley and the Kaladan River Valley during the operation in February of this year. Currently, the Japanese forces are operating in that area and are making smooth progress. The enemy has deployed the 4th Army Corps, namely the 17th Division of the British Indian Army, in the Imphal area, the 27th Division in the Tonzang and Tiddim areas, the 23rd Division in the Palel area, and has dispatched reinforcements. In addition, the 33rd Army is deployed in the Chukru area of Assam, with the 2nd and 36th divisions of the British Army and the 44th Mechanized Division as the main force. The 2nd Division of the Chinese Army, the 1st Division of the US-British Army, and about 15 divisions of the Chinese Expeditionary Force are deployed in the Fort Dufferin area and Yunnan Province, respectively. In addition, an air transport unit of several thousand men under the command of Wingate was dispatched to the Bhamo and Katha areas of northern Burma, transported by aircraft, and landed by air. Although this unit safely reached its destination, it did not achieve any military success and was gradually annihilated by the Japanese army's attacks. From this point of view, the enemy's deployment of forces was intended to invade Burma from four directions by land, reopen the Ledo Road, use Chinese territory as a base, and seize the opportunity to attack Japan. However, Imphal, a strategic point in eastern India, has been threatened by the Japanese army, and the situation has been reversed. They recognize the importance of Imphal and have repeatedly engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army using its natural fortress and superior military facilities. However, once the battle for Imphal ends, the strategic situation on the Indo-Burmese mainland will not only change accordingly, but India will also be established. In reality, the Japanese army has grasped the key to attacking India. Since the Japanese army began attacking India in late March, looking back at the results of the war to date, it has obviously achieved unexpected success. According to the enemy's observation, the Japanese army may not have the elements of victory, but the Japanese army has turned the impossible into the possible and is seriously threatening Imphal today. Moreover, the Japanese army did not use tanks in this operation, so how did it achieve victory? This is due to the spirit of the Japanese army and the results of its military operations. The difficulty of operations in that area is beyond our expectations. After the Japanese army's operations progressed, supplies became difficult. This must be attributed to the efforts of a certain engineering unit, which closely cooperated in building roads and other works during the Japanese army's operations. In addition, the Indian National Army's assistance to the Japanese army in operations was very effective, as they were determined to restore their homeland and were willing to die for their country. The Burmese also automatically cooperated with the Japanese army, engaging in relief and transportation of supplies near the enemy's bombing, which moved the frontline Japanese soldiers to tears. For example, a Burmese person once said: Although we have suffered great losses due to the war, we all deeply understand the great meaning of labor production and serving the country.

### Enemy Aircraft from an Aircraft Carrier in the Indian Ocean Attack Eastern Java; Three Aircraft Shot Down in the Suburbs of Surabaya

Jakarta, 19th (Central News Agency) According to an announcement by the Japanese military authorities here: a combined formation of fifty enemy fighter-bombers attacked the eastern Java region from the Indian Ocean on the morning of the 17th. Ten of them flew to the suburbs of Surabaya, attempting to bomb blindly. Three were shot down by the Japanese army's ground fire, and the enemy aircraft fled in defeat. Part of the Japanese army's land facilities suffered very slight damage. The enemy aircraft seem to be part of a mobile unit centered on an aircraft carrier and are still lingering in the Indian Ocean, waiting for an opportunity to attack. The Japanese army, with the cooperation of the navy, is firmly defending and waiting.

Enemy Aircraft Attack Sumatra Three Times

Jakarta, 19th (Central News Agency) According to military authorities here: after enemy aircraft bombed Sumatra on the 17th, they attacked Sumatra again on the morning of the 18th at approximately 1:00 a.m. with a total of four aircraft of the "Unified Type," in three waves (one aircraft each time). However, after being intercepted by the local Japanese army's air defense forces, two were damaged and their fuselages caught fire, and they fled in a panic. The enemy aircraft mistakenly believed that the air raid on the 17th had achieved great results, so they attempted to attack again in order to inflict significant damage on the area, but as a result, they were heavily damaged and fled in defeat due to the Japanese army's interception. When the enemy aircraft attacked Sumatra, the local officials and people cooperated in air defense and were extremely active. The enemy aircraft that attacked on the morning of the 17th had set sail from the Indian Ocean. To prevent future enemy aircraft attacks, the local Japanese army, navy, and army are cooperating to ensure complete safety.

### After the Japanese Army's Offensive in Henan, Britain and the United States Are Disappointed with Chongqing and Will Soon Abandon the Chongqing Regime's Administration of the Yangtze River Basin

Madrid, 19th (Central News Agency) The new offensive operation launched by the Japanese China Expeditionary Force has given Chongqing a major shock. Ever since the battles in the Marshall Islands, the idea of "attacking Japan from the Chinese mainland as a base" has been widely touted. Japan has been preparing to deal with Nimitz's operational plan with all its strength. This new operation by the Japanese army has caused great disappointment to the United States and Britain. At the same time, the corruption of the Chongqing army and the untrustworthiness of the Chongqing regime have been fully revealed. Just as Wei Daoming, the appropriate ambassador to the United States, returned to Washington to appeal to the US government about its economic difficulties, it was greatly shocked, resulting in the conclusion that "aid to Chongqing is ineffective." The increasingly urgent offensive operations of the Japanese Indian Army left Britain with no time to spare, and it had no choice but to slightly change its policy towards Chongqing. Earlier this month, Britain established a new loan of 50 million pounds to Chongqing, and a new weapons loan case between the United States and Chongqing was also established. This is the result of Chongqing's flattery. When British Foreign Secretary Eden was questioned on the issue in Parliament, he replied that the government was, of course, very vigilant about the use of the loan to Chongqing, but it was impossible in fact due to the severance of the Burma transport route. In addition, Eden answered the question about the CCP's inside story, saying that the government had no intention of interfering in China's internal affairs. This reveals Britain's contradictions and deception towards Chongqing. This time, the enemy's new operation on the mainland caused the Chongqing army to collapse in a panic, further increasing the disappointment of the United States and Britain with Chongqing. It is reported that a London telegram broadcast on the 16th said: "Chiang Kai-shek is requesting final assistance from Britain and the United States." At the same time, as US Vice President Henry Wallace's visit to Chongqing approaches, the true situation in Chongqing will not be difficult for the United States and Britain to recognize, and the abandonment of the Chongqing regime is not far off.

US-Chongqing Relations Become More Difficult Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) According to a Washington telegram, US Vice President Henry Wallace had a final consultation with Roosevelt on the 18th regarding his visit to Chongqing. After the consultation, Wallace claimed that he was scheduled to depart in the middle of this month and return home at the end of July when the Democratic Party convention was held. Regarding the purpose of the visit to Chongqing, US political circles believe that it is to strengthen the issue of material assistance. This question believes that Wallace's purpose in visiting Chongqing is more than that. If the United States wants to double its material assistance to Chongqing today, it must first resolve the following prerequisites: (1) Guarantee that Chongqing's materials are used entirely for operations against Japan; (2) The Chongqing army's operations against Japan must completely obey the command of the United States and Britain. Looking at the recent arguments made by the British and American sides regarding the adjustment of Chongqing-CCP relations, the democratization of Chongqing, and the re-recognition of Chongqing's anti-Japanese capabilities, they have all become preconditions for Britain and the United States to coerce Chongqing. What the United States hopes for is that Chongqing and the CCP will stop their internal strife and listen entirely to their dispatch. If Chongqing cannot satisfy the desires of Britain and the United States and automatically reorganize its political system, then seeking the United States' trust in today's assistance is like chasing fish in a tree. Wallace's visit to Chongqing will inevitably be based on the desire to seek assistance, and must obey the command of the United States and Britain, and negotiate with Chongqing to obtain guarantees after the CCP. Otherwise, the issue of assisting Chiang will not be established. What is the so-called guarantee? Chongqing will also give deep consideration to whether the United States will consider it exhausted when aid materials are consumed to a certain extent. The difficulty of US-Chongqing relations will be more numerous in the future due to the issue of assisting Chiang.

US Air Force Officer Shoots Chongqing Students

Guangzhou, 19th (Central News Agency) Since the United States used Chongqing as a base for counter-offensive, the conflict between Chongqing and the United States has increased daily. In particular, the disputes between the US Air Force and the Chongqing Air Force are almost daily occurrences. The arrogant attitude of the US Air Force has made the Chongqing student community even more dissatisfied. According to information recently received here, the conflict between the two has now reached the stage of armed fighting. An incident occurred in Kunming in which a US Air Force officer shot Chongqing students, resulting in many casualties, which aroused public outrage among students in various parts of Chongqing. Five hundred students from Yunnan University, after hearing the news, formed a team and shot dead fifteen Americans, causing diplomatic negotiations between Chongqing and the United States. Forced by the threat of the United States, Chongqing arrested students in large numbers under the pretext of being pro-Japanese. However, the anti-American resentment among students in various places is still extremely high, and the waves of dissatisfaction and discontent are now spreading throughout the country.

### General Nomura Appointed Privy Councilor

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) After the death of Privy Councilor General Arima on May 2, the vacancy was filled by former Ambassador to the United States, Navy General Kichisaburo Nomura. The enthronement ceremony was held in the Imperial Palace at 2:50 p.m. yesterday. General Nomura is from Wakayama Prefecture, born in 1877, and is 68 years old this year. He graduated from the Naval Academy in 1898. In 1933, he was promoted to Navy General. During this time, he served as a military attaché in Australia, Germany, and the United States, captain of the Izumo warship, first overseas commander, and commander of the Kure Naval District. During the "August 13" Incident, he served as commander of the Third Fleet. After returning, he served as commander of the Yokosuka Naval District. In 1933, he was appointed Councilor. In 1937, he was appointed President of Gakushuin. In September 1939, when the Abe cabinet was formed, he was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. In 1941, when the diplomatic situation between Japan and the United States was tense, in order to break the deadlock, he was entrusted by Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Matsuoka to replace Ambassador Horiuchi as Ambassador to the United States. After arriving in Washington in February of that year, he began to negotiate with US President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull. Later, Ambassador Kurusu hurriedly traveled to the United States in November of the same year to assist the ambassador in handling everything, but eventually broke down due to the United States' lack of reflection.

### Gandhi to Meet Jinnah to Discuss Indian-Muslim Issue

Gu, 19th (Central News Agency) A Reuters report from Bombay: Gandhi will probably meet with Muslim leader Jinnah in Bombay at the beginning of next month to discuss the issue of establishing an agreement between India and the Muslims.

The content of the meeting was mentioned in Gandhi's letter to Jinnah on May 14, 1943, but this was prevented due to the Indian government's prohibition of Gandhi's contact with the outside world.

### Riot in Kucha City, Bengal

### Celebes and Other Rice-Producing Areas Seek Regional Self-Sufficiency - A Five-Year Increased Production Plan Has Been Established

Makassar, 19th (Central News Agency) The food policy of the Japanese naval military administration in 1943 (32nd year of the Republic) was to meet the needs of the local army and to procure food in the main rice-producing areas of Celebes, Buton, and Balikpapan. At the same time, Java rice was imported to ensure the quantity of supply. On the one hand, various measures such as research on two rice harvests per year, construction of full irrigation waterways, and reclamation of rice paddies were implemented. At the beginning of 1944, a five-year increased production plan was established, which not only aims to achieve regional self-sufficiency, but also to supply other regions. As the war situation progresses, the mission of the region as a food supply base will become more important. The food production increase movement currently underway throughout the region is expected to meet current needs, so the future is promising. Southern Celebes is the main outstanding rice-producing area of Celebes. At the end of last year, local officials and people established the Southern Celebes Rice Production Increase Guidance Headquarters, and branches were established in various places, enlisting all agricultural technicians to form the center of the production increase movement, and allocating production responsibilities to each county. At the same time, under the principle of not hindering the increase in the production of glutinous rice, cotton is planted. Various measures are currently being implemented, and various production increase facilities are being actively added, namely, irrigation construction projects, which are actively underway. In addition, the research results on two harvests per year have revealed that it is absolutely possible to shorten the seedling period. In addition, wasteland is being actively reclaimed to ensure that all of Celebes can achieve food self-sufficiency. In southern Celebes, the Makassar Research Institute is now working to supply seeds.

### Minister of Judicial Administration Zhang Discusses Impressions of Inspection in Beiping, Quite Satisfied with the Judicial Situation in Various Parts of North China

Beiping, 19th (Central News Agency) Since Minister of Judicial Administration Zhang Yipeng of the National Government came to Beiping, he has been busy visiting the Political Affairs Committee and officials of various allied nations on a daily basis, as well as inspecting courts at all levels. A reporter recently visited Mr. Zhang and asked for his impressions. He said: "When I was a child, I followed my father's official travels and lived in Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Zhengding, and other places. After I became an official, I served in the judiciary in Beijing for many years. Therefore, the Beiping-Tianjin area is like a second hometown. In January of this year, I was appointed to head the national judicial administration and eagerly sought a trip to North China to observe the judicial situation. I arrived in Beijing by plane on the 10th of this month. In recent days, I have personally visited courts at all levels and visited the authorities of the Political Affairs Committee and officials of various allied nations. I am very satisfied. Since the establishment of the North China Affairs Office of the Ministry of Judicial Administration in Beijing on November 31st of last year, the judicial administration has become more unified with the central government. All judicial organs in provinces and cities in North China are under the jurisdiction of the Affairs Office. This is a very appropriate measure under the current special local circumstances. Based on what I have observed in the past few days, I have the following impressions: First, in terms of personnel, half are old employees, maintaining the past scale. The annual budget is approximately 17 million yuan in joint currency, which is more than the judicial budget of the Ministry of Judicial Administration in Central China. This is enough to show that the authorities attach importance to the judiciary. Second, Director Gui of the Affairs Office has a wide range of jurisdiction, and the three departments and ten sections are extremely busy. However, they are able to use few people and not leave any cases pending. Third, prison operations are in line with the wartime production increase method. The workshop equipment is complete, and the manufactured goods not only supply the public sector but also supply the market with cheap goods. If expanded, it will not be difficult to achieve self-sufficiency. The above three points are based on the Beijing area. I still plan to take this opportunity to visit Tianjin, Jinan, and Qingdao before returning south."

### German Troops in Italy Successfully Defend, Shift from Itery Region to New Line

Berlin, 19th, Central News Agency Dispatch, German News Agency: The major offensive by British and American forces in Italy continued across a wide front on Wednesday. The enemy, with fresh infantry and artillery units, constantly attacked on the Tyrrhenian coast and northwest of Cassino. After multiple battles in the Itery region, the enemy finally made some progress, paying a very high price. However, the enemy's attempt to break through the German defense line in this area and further north was ultimately thwarted by the resolute resistance of the German grenadiers. The new claim that they have reached and broken through the so-called "Hitler Defense Line" is entirely fabricated by the propaganda machine. In fact, there is no such position. German troops withdrew in an orderly manner to the rear defense line, which American and North African troops were unable to prevent. Their attempt to encircle the German troops was also thwarted by the German rearguard. All heavy weapons that could still be used by the German army were moved to a safe area. Following the retreat from the Itery region, German troops recovered the positions in the Esta region on the afternoon of the same day, and the German troops in the Cassino region also moved to the eastern positions. The Polish auxiliary team in the Cassino region launched a fierce attack on the German positions all day, resulting in a major defeat. Only the remnants of their original formation were able to retreat to their original positions. The enemy suffered very heavy material losses in this area and the Liri River basin. The British and American forces and their North African and Polish auxiliary units launched an attack with superior numbers, under the cover of powerful artillery and main force aircraft formations. The fact that the German army was able to achieve a defensive victory in difficult circumstances is truly commendable.

### British Landing on Paros Island Failed

Berlin, 19th, Central News Agency Dispatch, German News Agency: Last night, a British landing party launched a surprise attack on Paros Island in the Aegean Sea and failed, suffering heavy losses. The enemy commander was also captured.

### Berlin Appoints Commander of German Forces in Western Europe, Atlantic Wall Unbreakable

Berlin, 19th, Central News Agency Dispatch, Huitong News Agency: The People's Observer reported on the morning of the 19th that the commander-in-chief of the German forces in Western Europe is Field Marshal Runstedt, with Field Marshal Rommel and Field Marshal Blaszkowitz under him. This is the first time the commander of the German forces in Western Europe has been mentioned. Field Marshal Sperrle is the commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe in Western Europe.

Berlin, 19th, Central News Agency Dispatch, Huitong News Agency: The strength of the Atlantic Wall should move the enemy air force.

Stockholm, 19th, Central News Agency Dispatch, Huitong News Agency, American sources: Western European climate affects air operations, and the schedule for invading the European continent will also be greatly affected. This climate refers to the recent conditions in the English Channel.

### American Planes Attack Southeastern Europe, 35 Shot Down

Berlin, 19th, Central News Agency Dispatch, Standard National News Agency: Yesterday, American planes carried out terror air raids on several locations in Southeastern Europe, causing considerable damage to the civilian population, especially in Belgrade and Bucharest.

### Anti-Axis Ambition to Destroy Germany Only Strengthens German Fighting Spirit, Roosevelt Proposes Establishing Kiel State

Berlin, 19th, Central News Agency Dispatch, Huitong News Agency: The anti-Axis war plan mentioned by British and American newspapers and magazines is to destroy Germany and the German people, which is tantamount to providing "fresh information". According to Saturday's "Every Evening Post," Roosevelt suggested at the Tehran Conference that a Soviet Free State be established in the Kiel City and Wilhelm Kaiser Canal area. "Daily Mail" diplomatic correspondent Barclay suggested destroying German heavy industry and chemical industry. It can be seen that the British and American ambition to destroy Germany is very obvious. On the eve of this offensive, the German people, upon hearing this, will only strengthen their fighting spirit to avoid this fate.

Stockholm, 19th, Central News Agency Dispatch: It is reported that the Kiel Free State proposed by Roosevelt will be under international administration in order to allow the Soviet Union to have free access to the sea after the war. This so-called Kiel State will not be allowed to have its own army and independent foreign policy, but will be controlled by the anti-Axis organization. Stalin felt satisfied with President Roosevelt's proposal. This Roosevelt "Kiel State" ideal is an attempt to prove the US international relations loyalty to the Soviet Union's accounting division.

### Japan Reorganizes Private Schools, Newly Established 21 Science and Engineering Vocational Schools Achieve Ideal Goal of Three Arts and Seven Sciences

The Japanese Ministry of Education, based on the "Emergency Wartime Measures for Education and Reorganization of the School System" decided by the Cabinet in December last year, is actively reorganizing public and private universities and higher vocational schools. This reorganization was announced on the 27th and will take effect this semester.

Accordingly, there are three university mergers and five vocational school mergers involving ten schools. Twenty-one new science and engineering vocational schools have been established with the aim of training public works technicians and physicians. After this reorganization, the number of new admissions to private universities and higher vocational schools will decrease by approximately 17,000 in the liberal arts and increase by approximately 7,000 in science and engineering. The ratio of liberal arts to science and engineering was previously 7.5 to 2.5, with a heavy emphasis on liberal arts. Now, the ratio is equal, resulting in achieving the ideal goal of a combined three arts and seven sciences for both public and private schools.

To compensate for the sharp increase in the operating burden of private schools due to this emergency measure, the Ministry of Education will allocate 2.5 million yen in the 18th fiscal year and 7.5 million yen in the 19th fiscal year, totaling 3 million yen, focusing on assisting the equipment of science and engineering departments. In the future, requests will also be made to use the second reserve fund to subsidize school finances to prevent defects in educational facilities.

### Reorganization Guidelines

The measures announced by the Ministry of Education regarding the reorganization of private schools are as follows:

Organization, Education Content, and Other Updates and Reorganization: While fully respecting the traditional characteristics of private schools, they will also be updated and reorganized in accordance with public schools. For example, changing the names of economics vocational schools and foreign affairs vocational schools, reorganizing academic courses, shortening the length of study, or reorganizing academic organizations, is being carried out in considerable numbers.

Reducing the Enrollment Quota of Liberal Arts Schools:

According to the reorganization guidelines, the enrollment quota for the liberal arts preparatory courses of universities is about one-third of the previous quota, and the enrollment quota for liberal arts vocational schools is about one-half. As a result of this reorganization, the above goals have been achieved.

The new quota for university departments and preparatory courses is about 3,500, and the number of reductions is about 5,200, which is about 60% less than before the reorganization.

Vocational schools (including university vocational departments) have been reduced by slightly less than 50% of the previous level, with a new quota of about 12,000.

The above totals a reduction of approximately 56%.

Reorganization and Expansion of Science and Engineering Schools:

Necessary expansion is implemented to meet the country's urgent demand for cultivated personnel.

Because the expansion is mainly aimed at short-term training, the focus is on vocational schools, with little attention paid to university departments and preparatory courses, with only an additional quota of 80 people.

As for vocational schools, new departments and classes have been added to train industrial technicians and physicians. Because the cultivation of industrial technicians is the focus, the expansion of industrial vocational schools is the main focus.

1. Seventeen new industrial vocational schools have been established (including nine industrial vocational schools, four aviation industrial vocational schools, four gliding industrial vocational schools, four radio wave industrial vocational schools, and one petroleum industrial vocational school). Among them, those transformed from liberal arts schools include Koyo Industrial Vocational School, Tohoku Gakuin Aviation Industrial Vocational School, and eleven other schools. In addition, those that are most urgent under the current situation and have considerable existing equipment include the National Defense Science and Technology Academy, Radio Wave Science Vocational School, East Asia Petroleum Industrial Vocational School, and Greater Japan Gliding Industrial Vocational School.

2. In order to train physicians in a short period of time, affiliated medical vocational departments have been established at Keio Gijuku, Jikei University School of Medicine, and Nippon Medical School (enrollment quota of 100 people).

3. In order to meet the need for training veterinarians, a veterinary animal husbandry vocational school has been established at Keio Gijuku.

As a result of the above, the enrollment quota for science and engineering has been expanded by about 6,000 people. After deducting this from the number of reductions in the liberal arts enrollment quota mentioned above, the number of reductions in the liberal arts enrollment quota is still slightly less than 17,000, and the reduction rate is approximately 42% compared to before the reorganization. Also, due to the above reduction in liberal arts and expansion in science and engineering, the previous ratio of liberal arts to science and engineering of 7.5 to 2.5 has been revised to a ratio of 5 to 5.

### School Mergers

Some mergers have been completed, and some are in progress. The situation is as follows:

Vocational Schools Merged (schools being merged in parentheses):

1. Meiji Gakuin Vocational School (Aoyama Gakuin Vocational Department, Kanto Gakuin, and Meiji Gakuin).

2. Kyushu Economics Vocational School (Kyushu Vocational School and Fukuoka Higher Commercial School).

3. Matsuyama Economics Vocational School (Matsuyama Higher Commercial School and Fukuchi Higher Commercial Vocational School).

4. Kansai Gakuin Vocational School (Kansai Gakuin Higher Commercial School and Kansai Gakuin Vocational Department).

5. Japan Christian Theological Vocational School (Japan Eastern Theological School and Japan Western Theological School).

Three universities are currently in progress.

Other

Among private universities, the universities that have stopped recruiting new preparatory course students are "Takushoku University", and the university that has been transformed into a vocational school is "Ritsumeikan University". The universities that do not recruit new liberal arts vocational department students are "Keio Gijuku University" and "Nihon University". The men's vocational school that has been transformed into a women's vocational school is Musashino Music School, Osaka Women's Economics Vocational School (formerly Showa Higher Commercial School).

### First District Economic Office to Conduct Registration of Daily Necessities, Clarify Inventory Volume, Not a Mandatory Purchase

The Economic Office of the First District Public Office issued a statement on the registration of daily necessities as follows:

Matches, candles, washing soap, and coal are all essential daily necessities for people's livelihood. Due to electricity, raw materials, and source relationships, the production situation may not be as abundant as before. However, it seems appropriate to statistically analyse the volume of remaining inventory in the region, so that the relevant parties can plan to increase production or dredge sources. The motivation behind the Public Office's registration of the inventory volume of the above items is to clarify the amount of such items in the region, and there is no intention of compulsory purchase. This registration must be followed by civilians storing items for personal use, or by merchants using them for trade. If there are any concealments in order to avoid registration, once discovered, a confiscation penalty will be imposed. The execution of this penalty shall be handled by the Economic Security Office. It is hoped that citizens or merchants will cooperate and not hoard excessively. As for the main items of matches, candles, washing soap, and coal after registration, they can still be freely bought and sold. However, once the transaction exceeds one crate for matches, one case for candles, one case for washing soap, or one ton for coal, the buying and selling parties should report to Room 701 of this office within three days of the transaction, so that it can be verified.

### Household Rice to be Distributed Soon, Quantity and Date in Preparation

It has recently been received from relevant parties that the household rice will soon be distributed through the hard work of the distribution agencies. The quantity and date are being prepared. It is also heard that the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee has repeatedly discussed the issue of Shanghai people's food, and exchanged views with relevant parties. The proposed plan has been sent to the authorities and will be implemented after a decision is made. It is hoped that the situation of Shanghai's food distribution will improve thereafter.

### Mr. Tomono of Central China Promotion Company Speaks

Mr. Tomono, director of the Central China Promotion Company, once went to Tokyo to contact the relevant ministries and departments to discuss the investment in important wartime enterprises and the development plans of national policy companies in Japan. He recently returned to Shanghai on the 18th. He gave a statement to reporters at the company that day: "The Japanese government understands the funding plan for the Central China Japanese national policy promotion-related companies for the 19th fiscal year (1944). This year's funding plan has a close relationship with the completion of the Greater East Asia War. It is centered on the development of important enterprises and the promotion of increased production and transportation. The total budget of the main funds exceeds about three times that of last year, and the actual budget increases by more than 80%. Therefore, in order to adjust the required funds, we will try our best to avoid relying on subsidies from Japan and strive to release local funds. Therefore, the amount of local funds in this year's funding plan actually exceeds that of Japan by about 20-30%. According to the revised Central China Promotion Company Law passed by the 84th Diet of Japan, the industrial equipment colors of the promotion companies must be unusually strong. In the future, in addition to the national policy companies, it will also be necessary to adjust the funds and materials of the important wartime companies."

### Postal Savings Bureau Handles Children's Savings

The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of the Ministry of Construction has been actively improving the savings and remittance business recently. In particular, it is necessary to vigorously promote children's savings. The bureau has instructed its business and savings departments to work hard to promote it, and has revised the regulations for this type of savings, formulated a plan for implementation, and submitted it to the Ministry for approval. It has also requested assistance from the Ministry of Education, Propaganda, and Finance, so that students in primary and secondary schools can cultivate the habit of children's savings, in order to live up to the government's ambition to promote assistance and savings. The advantages of children's savings are listed below: Children's savings are very convenient, because all post offices that handle savings business also handle this type of savings. The interest rate on children's savings is set at five percent per week, which is half a percent higher than ordinary savings. Children's savings can be deposited with a passbook. The total amount of deposits for children's savings is limited to 2,000 yuan per household. Children's savings can be withdrawn at any time, but accounts cannot be closed if the deposit has not been held for six months.

### Establish Management Office for Loan Collection

In Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Jiaxing and other areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the spring cocoons of this year are about to be released and prices are about to open. Silk companies in Shanghai have been preparing to collect cocoons in the producing areas. Other silk mills in various places have also begun collecting. Regarding the cocoon collection funds, the Silk Industry Association has organized a loan syndicate with 16 banks, including the local traffic Bank, with a loan of 60 million yuan, which will be lent to the silk mills to buy new cocoons. If a silk mill that is a member of the association needs cocoon collection funds, it can entrust the association to apply to the syndicate. In order to carefully manage the loan collection for the industry, the association has specially organized a collection management office, and district management offices have been set up in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Wuxi, and Suzhou to be responsible for handling loan collection matters.

### Minister Matsushima Elaborates on the Pacific War Situation

### Japanese Forces Prepare to Wipe Out American Enemies in One Fell Swoop

The spokesperson for the Japanese Fleet Press Department in China met with Chinese news reporters in this city yesterday (the 19th), as usual. Minister Matsushima of the Press Department delivered a speech on the Pacific War situation and the domestic situation in Japan, as follows:

The War Clouds Gather and Could Erupt at Any Moment

Recently, war clouds have gathered over the Pacific, and an attack by the American Navy could erupt at any moment. Our elite forces are standing by, ready to meet them. Although the American enemies have landed and invaded in the Hollandia area of New Guinea, they have gained nothing. Our brave air force has been carrying out fierce bombings day after day, causing heavy losses. Since the enemy troops landed in these two locations, their mobile forces have not yet joined the battle. Judging from the situation, it is likely that they are engaged in other preparations. Furthermore, Forrestal, the new American Navy Secretary who succeeded Knox, stated that he would continue his predecessor's plan to advance on Japan. Therefore, it is predicted that the American Navy will take action after a period of silence. The enemy America's most recent goal is to enter the Chinese mainland by way of the Philippines. However, their supply lines are the biggest problem. The enemy America's island-hopping strategy is due to its lack of continuous tactics. Once attacked fiercely by the Japanese army, it is repeatedly defeated, backfires, and turns into bloody battles everywhere.

Lack of Resources and Difficult Supply

In terms of resources, no matter how abundant American materials are, its human resources are extremely scarce, which is inevitable. Especially in the Pacific war, human resources are even more essential. Recently, it has been heard that the United States is recruiting two million women to engage in wartime work, which shows the general shortage of American human resources. Another report: The number of American reserves is only 100,000. With this limited manpower, they still want to divide their forces to fight on various fronts, and their failure is inevitable. The recent successes of the American army in the Solomon Islands and New Britain are due to their proximity to their base in Hawaii. The farther away from the base, the more difficult the battle becomes. Not only are there problems with the transportation of ammunition, aircraft, food, personnel, and military supplies, but the two locations are 6,000 miles away from the Hawaii base, and the number of guards and supplies required, as well as the supply problem, cannot be easily solved. Moreover, the American army is now gradually penetrating into the Japanese air control zone. Our air control is as solid as a rock. If the enemy America enters lightly, the Japanese army will lure them deeper, wait for the opportune moment, and then concentrate its main force to attack them, so as to wipe them out in one fell swoop.

Japan's Wartime Production Advances Rapidly

Finally, let's talk about the domestic situation in Japan. In recent times, Japan's wartime production has advanced by leaps and bounds, especially in aircraft and ships. It has also received a lot of assistance from China, for which we are extremely grateful. However, the enemy America's production is now showing a downward trend. In terms of manpower, Japan also has ample surplus. Furthermore, Japan has suffered very little damage due to submarine attacks. Recently, the American Southwest Pacific Fleet Commander-in-Chief, Buldoge, was transferred to Chief of Staff of the Pacific Fleet. His future operations will surely seek rapid progress, just like his name "Tiger Dog." However, he can only achieve superficial success.

### Short Commentary
### The Dawn of People's Food

In the last ten days, the black market price of rice has soared, and citizens are feeling threatened in their lives. They are all eagerly awaiting the continued distribution of household rice, like clouds in a severe drought. According to today's news in this newspaper, after the efforts of the distribution agencies, it has been decided to distribute one liter in the next few days. Although the quantity is extremely small, it shows the concern of the Municipal Government for the people's food problem.

The Municipal Advisory Committee has drafted a complete solution to the people's food problem, which can be implemented after approval by the authorities. Therefore, there is hope that the people's food problem will be gradually improved in the future.

We know that the Municipal Government is paying great attention to municipal facilities and the lives of citizens. In the current situation, the rice and grain problem is not something that the Municipal Government can solve alone. However, the people's food problem in this city is the most important issue in the lives of the citizens of this city. The Municipal Government should strive to solve it. Now that the Municipal Government is very concerned, further improvements can be expected.

I am a civil servant. My duty is to stabilize prices and eliminate the black market. I deal with various industrial and commercial firms in this city every day. Friends and relatives envy my position, and the industrial and commercial sectors compliment my words and deeds, but I have unspeakable distress. May I ask, what can I buy with a salary of 2,554 yuan? In addition to my wife, there are six children, aged sixteen, fourteen, twelve, ten, eight, and five. Except for the five-year-old, they can all be said to be of school age, but due to family economic reasons, only the fourteen-year-old, twelve-year-old, and ten-year-old children enjoy the "honor of studying." (My fourteen-year-old daughter died of meningitis last month, not of disease, but of poverty.) The sixteen-year-old helps her mother with housework every day. I am often depressed about their tuition fees.

I know the poor, miscellaneous doctors, and some big shots in Shanghai (due to auditing), but I never ask them for "student loans." I am ashamed that I cannot donate to others myself. How can I make other students who are more financially constrained than me lose their opportunity to apply for the sake of my children? My children are all studying at He'an Elementary School. I thought the tuition fees of municipal schools would be cheaper, but I didn't know that the cost of books and mandatory tutoring fees (said to be for helping teachers) added up to be more expensive than the formal tuition fees. Today, I received a notice from the school saying that each person has to pay an additional 200 yuan, and it must be paid within two days, otherwise they will be expelled (again, coercion). This adds to my worries. 600 yuan is not 60 yuan. It is not a problem for the wealthy, but it is really difficult for the salary class whose income cannot cover expenses.

I am not sympathizing with those of you who are in the same situation as me. There are not a few in the central government office. The Education Bureau should have overall planning.

In the newspapers, I only see the grand theories of the dignitaries. They praise foreign countries, and say that Japan is worth imitating. Please see how many national schools Japan has opened in Shanghai, which are said to be inexpensive. Why don't our authorities follow suit? If you say that this is a time of great difficulty, then how about Japan? They are in even more difficult circumstances than us. The difference is that the Japanese authorities are willing to do it, and our authorities are not. The Japanese adhere to a consistent policy, while we are inconsistent. People are focused, while our officials have too many concurrent positions.

I am a small employee who broke ground in the history of China's controlled economy. I can also be said to be a very responsible investigator, but my job is not guaranteed. A reorganization comes, and then a merger. I am truly like an official for five days. I worked under Europeans and Americans for twenty years and under the Japanese for one year. I admire their work spirit. Now, the people in Chinese agencies only know how to "please the powerful." In this harsh environment, I truly have unspeakable distress.

### Letter to Amao (2)

### By Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang

It was just like a scene in a movie, appearing in the blink of an eye. Although the time was short, the impact on Takao was very great.

(Ah! Warships!)

It was a sea as narrow as a pool, with clumsy, thick, gray warships floating on it. There were not one or two. In an unexpected place, even more unexpectedly close, they stood tall, like floating on the ground, looking at each other. He felt strange and terrible instead.

Takao was like a little bird that had been suddenly injured, so he lost his resistance. His eyes were wide open, staring without blinking.

(There are warships here! There is the "Navy"!)

Not knowing geography, he did not know that this was Yokosuka Naval Port. At the same time, he had lived in Tokyo for more than two years and had not seen the "Navy" in this form. Although there is a Naval Ministry in Tokyo, there is no trace of the appearance or taste of the "Navy."

This blow was like a thunderclap from the ground. So, Takao didn't know when the train entered the tunnel. At the same time, he didn't know when the train stopped at Yokosuka Station. Although his eyes were wide open, he couldn't see anything. The impression of the blink just now was deeply imprinted on his mind, disturbing his thoughts, so he couldn't see anything in his consciousness. He only knew that his mouth was dry. He only knew that his heart was beating violently.

Not long after, he woke up. At that time, the train had already passed Yokosuka. Near the train track, he could see the villas for escaping the heat and the quiet inner sea waves.

He suddenly tried hard to think about what he had seen, but he didn't have the strength, so he couldn't help but feel sad.

If I make an analogy, Takao's mood is like a hot man who suddenly sees his lover marrying someone else somewhere. He tries hard to forget what he can't forget, but the wound in his heart is aching faintly. His wound is expanding its opening. The extent of it is just like the feeling in the heart after seeing your lover walking intimately with someone else.

He looked around the car to drive away his sadness. However, no one had started to eat.

Several naval officers got on the train from Yokosuka Station. There were petty officers and sailors. At this time, a bespectacled officer was continuing to read in front of Takao. Takao, who had naval knowledge, could tell without looking at the epaulettes and collar badges.

(It's a paymaster sublieutenant.)

So he stopped staring and closed his eyes. When the train reached the terminal, Uraga, and he had to open his eyes, the bespectacled officer had gotten off the train at some point and was now gone.

### Social Service

### Nanyang Hospital Provides Free Tuberculosis Prevention

### Patient Statistics Report

### Elementary School Teachers Should Not Miss This Opportunity

Nanyang Hospital Director, Mr. Gu Nanxun, is providing free tuberculosis prevention for elementary school teachers. The examination period is specified as three months, from May 1st to August 1st. According to the hospital's report, as of yesterday, within fourteen days, a total of eighty-five people were introduced by this newspaper and the News Daily Social Service Center for examination. The X-ray results showed: forty-six people with normal heart and lungs, three people with pleural disease, thirteen people with disease in both lungs, eight people with disease in the right lung, and five people with disease in the left lung.

Based on the above diagnosis results, in order to seek treatment, twenty-two people went to the outpatient clinic, sixteen people were given medication free of charge, nine people were given medication at cost, four people had their sputum tested free of charge, and two people were hospitalized for artificial pneumothorax treatment (one of whom will recover soon and can be discharged next week). Forty-five people went to the hospital to request free diagnosis and treatment or reduced medical expenses. The prevalence of lung disease among elementary school teachers is evident from this. When it is deemed necessary to investigate, they will visit. In half a month, they visited sixteen times. During a certain visit, they found that several members of a family all had lung disease, which was so serious.

In order to inform elementary school teachers and take advantage of this opportunity, the hospital recently sent letters to various schools, stating that any faculty and staff who need to be examined can go to the social service centers of the Jiaxin and Xinbao newspapers to obtain free X-ray examination vouchers. Those who wish to apply for free treatment or reduced fees should first ask themselves how much strength they have, and then contribute as much strength as they can. Because there are many people in the education sector, if you can contribute more strength, the public will have more strength to serve others. This is also beneficial to oneself and others.

### Donation of Meningitis Medicine

We are sending fifteen bottles of effective meningitis medicine, manufactured by the Shanghai Branch of the World Red Swastika Society, with enclosed treatment methods. We hope that you will distribute them to poor patients. We are looking forward to it.

Sincerely, Yi You Dehao
