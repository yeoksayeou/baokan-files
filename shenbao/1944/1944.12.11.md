### Fierce Battles Underway on the West Coast of Leyte: Enemy Airfields Enveloped in Flames

Philippine Frontline Base, 10th (Central News Agency) – After the enemy's counterattack from the Damulaan area failed, they attacked the coast about 10.5 kilometers south of Alvera on the west coast of Leyte on the 6th with landing ships. However, they were bombarded by the Japanese garrison in the area, and part of them sank immediately. Four amphibious tanks that forcibly landed under the cover of Japanese artillery fire were also destroyed by the Japanese. Suffering heavy losses, the enemy ceased landing and fled in disarray. On the 7th, the enemy attacked again with many destroyers, transport ships, and landing craft, and forcibly landed under the cover of naval gun fire. The Japanese garrison immediately launched a fierce attack on the enemy fleet, causing most of it to collapse and flee. At that time, some enemy troops took the opportunity to land on the nearby coast. The Japanese army, with the cooperation of the Air Force, launched a fierce attack, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. The two armies are still engaged in fierce fighting. Enemy ships also invaded Ormoc Bay, attempting to land, but were heavily bombed by the Japanese Air Force and suffered heavy losses. At the same time, near Alvera, one enemy large transport ship was destroyed, one enemy transport ship was sunk at Bapa, and one destroyer was destroyed.

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese garrison west of Tagami, from the night of the 5th to noon on the 6th, air-raided the area near the north and south Broon airfields, suddenly entering the north airfield and completely occupying it. At the same time, dozens of enemy aircraft parked on the ground were destroyed by bombing, five bombers caught fire and burned, and other enemy aircraft were destroyed because they had no time to take off. The enemy airfield and all facilities fell into the hands of the Japanese army. Although the enemy struggled to resist, they failed due to the fierce Japanese attack. Also, the south Broon airfield and the San Pablo airfield are now surrounded by flames. The enemy's 7th Division, 9th, and 11th Divisions lost all will to fight due to the Japanese army's surprise attack, so the entire enemy line in that area is becoming increasingly shaken. In addition, the first unit that forcibly landed near the Broon airfield on the 26th of last month also participated in the battle and achieved great results.

### The Present and Future of Rural Construction Work

– Min Xian

—— An Interview with Mr. Zou Jingfang ——

Implementing rural construction work to ensure people's livelihood and increase production is an urgent task during the current cooperation in the Greater East Asia War, and it is also a task that cannot be delayed after the final victory is achieved. No one can deny this. Over the past month, I have toured dozens of villages in the peaceful areas and have seen that the economic bankruptcy of most villages is becoming increasingly acute, and most farmers cannot avoid groaning in hardship. This phenomenon is difficult to avoid in various countries during wartime, especially in our country where the situation is unique. Speaking of rural construction at this time and in this environment is a difficult task. The establishment of the Rural Construction Implementation Committee by the National Government this year shoulders this heavy responsibility and is worthy of anticipation. To understand the progress of the association's work, I interviewed Mr. Zou Jingfang, the chairman of the association, and had the following conversation.

Professor's Demeanor

Mr. Zou Jingfang is from Hunan Province, in his forties, and graduated from the Department of Political Economy of Waseda University in Japan. Before the incident, he taught at Guangzhou Zhongshan University for several years. After I explained the purpose of my visit, Mr. Zou immediately said that the implementation of rural construction work should first target experimental counties and districts, and then be promoted throughout the country. The implementation work this year is divided into eight main points: (1) organizing and training the people, (2) reorganizing the group police, (3) clarifying taxes, (4) revitalizing agriculture, (5) building water conservancy, (6) supervising side occupations, (7) practicing circuit education, and (8) supplementing air transport work. It has been decided that these eight main points must be implemented on a scale in each experimental county district within this year in order to continue to promote the second phase of village autonomy, strengthen people's organizations, ensure local security, implement agricultural improvement, promote seedling cultivation and afforestation, build water conservancy roads, establish agricultural banks, assess agricultural product prices, supervise rural side occupations, expand rural education, improve people's hygiene, and implement abstinence from smoking, gambling, and prostitution. Speaking of this, I explained that I had recently visited several experimental counties and districts, and the situations were not the same. If the work outline is strictly and rigidly stipulated, will it not be difficult to implement in the various counties in the future? Mr. Zou replied that he had also seen this level and planned not to send other personnel to reside in the experimental counties and districts. From the conversation, it can be seen that Mr. Zou is a frank and pragmatic official.

Pragmatism and Unification of Institutions

I also mentioned that the people's pain and suffering seen and heard in the various villages cost more than 10 million yuan, and that the people inevitably suffered a lot from this unreasonable situation. He is currently supervising the county to prepare a budget and seek other legitimate ways to provide funds in order to reduce the burden on the people. Other counties with similar situations should also be handled in this way. Mr. Zou also said that he has always held a pragmatic attitude in doing things and never aims too high. Therefore, he has decided to authorize the county heads of the experimental counties to determine the urgency and formulate regulations to carry out the work step by step, with the committee supervising and rigorously assessing the work at any time, and absolutely not allowing any excuses or procrastination. He himself will go to the various experimental counties and districts to inspect at any time. Mr. Zou said with a smile that except for the necessary technical personnel, the situation is in dire need of rescue. Mr. Zou also nodded in agreement, saying that he has long been aware of the suffering of the general public in rural areas. Taking Jiangning Experimental County as an example, the total population of the county is only 600,000, including the elderly, weak, and women, and the various tasks undertaken by the county each month, especially the deep understanding that rural construction work must go deep into the bottom layer and be pragmatic in order to be effective, and that it cannot be solved by simply holding a few meetings in the city, and that he is extremely willing to accept all legitimate opinions. Speaking of meetings, Mr. Zou mentioned the situation of the last experimental county government meeting, saying that only the county heads of Futu, Jiangning, and Kunshan attended the meeting to listen to their reports, and although they had only met a few times, he was already clear about their individual personalities and abilities, and said how to supervise them separately in order to achieve the results. I have recently visited these three counties and districts, and I have seen the results and how the personalities of the county heads are in line with what Mr. Zou said. Mr. Zou's concern for talent and willingness to cultivate people is commendable. I think these three county heads should strive to live up to Mr. Zou's expectations. I mentioned that the Executive Yuan has also established an Agricultural Production Promotion Committee and a Cooperative Undertaking Committee. These two institutions are closely related to rural construction work. Will the implementation of the work be redundant or even counterproductive? Mr. Zou thought for a moment and said that the establishment of these three institutions successively had its own special reasons. For the convenience of administration, it seems necessary to have a unification, and the government may adjust them in the future.

The Fundamental Issue of Stabilizing Prices

Because Mr. Zou is also the Secretary-General of the National Economic Commission, I asked him about the current serious price issue. Mr. Zou said that it is inevitable that wartime prices will be higher than peacetime prices, but the situation in our country is unique, and there are many internal difficulties, which have led to a very serious situation. He deeply feels that the only way to fundamentally solve the price problem is to actively increase production. In order to increase production, it is necessary to ensure smooth exchange of materials and appropriate adjustment of power supply. From the government's standpoint, it should start from the root and promote all parties to obtain assistance in order to achieve a thorough solution. If rural construction work can successfully reach a certain stage, the price problem may be solved incidentally. Therefore, he often said that the future of the National Government depends on the success of rural construction work, and it is not just a price problem. (Sent from Nanjing)

### Reporting Director Matsumura's Speech: "The Victor of Leyte" - Only the Stern Spirit of the Special Attack Corps

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Matsumura, the reporting director of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters Army, gave a radio address after reporting the news at 7:00 p.m. on the 9th, entitled "The Victor of Leyte," detailing the progress of the Battle of Leyte, saying that victory can only be achieved with the stern spirit of the Special Attack Corps. The general meaning is as follows: Three years have passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Judging from the vast battlefield of the Pacific and the material resources held by the enemy Americans, this war cannot be ended in a short period of time. The great war in human history should be viewed from the overall situation, and the decisive battle of Leyte is the largest of the Pacific War and will have the greatest impact on future wars. Since the end of October, it has been intensifying. Last month, the enemy landed at Tacloban and Tarac under the cover of superior tanks, and the Japanese side has been preventing them. Now, the enemy is being contained by assault troops. In November, part of the enemy army attacked near Managasnas in the north of Caligala and advanced to the vicinity of Bapa on the east coast of Ormoc Bay, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese army's elite troops. At sea, there was the Battle of the Philippine Sea, and in the air, the Japanese Air Force launched a fierce attack every day. The deployment of the Special Attack Corps has inflicted major blows on enemy ships and airfields. The fiercest fighting has been around Managasnas and Limon for three weeks since the beginning of November, and by the beginning of December, it had reached a stalemate with no major changes. The enemy's attempt to retake the Philippines is contrary to expectations. What did the enemy Americans expect in the fierce battle of Leyte? It was for the US Army Corps of Engineers to prepare Leyte Bay and for the P-38 and B-24 fighter-bombers and the mobile units on the eastern sea of ​​Luzon to cut off the Japanese supply routes. But can their expectations be realized? Leyte is different from the Solomons and the Marianas. Although they have tried their best to hinder it, the Japanese army can continue to supply from the central mountains of the Philippines. The airfields they prepared, such as Tacloban, Tarac, San Pablo, and Broon, began to be used one week after the invasion. In mid-November, there were about 300 fighter planes, and at the end of November, they were bombed by the Japanese air force. In December, they were attacked by the Takachiho parachute unit and the ground forces' desperate charges, one after another, causing the north and south Broon airfields and the San Pablo airfield to be unusable, and the aviation power of the base was significantly reduced. On the Morotai Island side, the bombing posture of the Japanese land air force has been increasing. Although the enemy airfield has been built in six places, only two can still be used. Today, the main enemy air base in Leyte, the land battle near Broon, is gradually becoming advantageous for the Japanese side. Therefore, no matter what, the enemy is eager to break this difficult situation. On December 7, the enemy, about a division, landed near Alvera on the east coast of Ormoc (Bay), and the Japanese Air Force immediately launched a fierce bombing of this, and the land forces also attacked. Fierce fighting is now underway. Therefore, the stalemate in the Battle of Leyte for the past three days has shown activity. We should know the truth of the current war situation, eliminate all hardships, and move towards victory. The Leyte War is linked to the spirit of the 100 million people and the special attack corps. Its tragic fighting spirit is the Yamato spirit. When this spirit penetrates all occupations, the victory of Leyte will naturally come.

### Japanese Bomber Squadrons Raid Suichuan and Ganzhou

A total of sixteen Chongqing aircraft parked at the two airfields were burned down. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base. The results of the battle are recorded as follows: (1) In Ganzhou, a total of two large and two small Chongqing aircraft were burned down, six small Chongqing aircraft were destroyed, and three of its facilities experienced major explosions. (2) In Suichuan, one small Chongqing aircraft was burned down and five small Chongqing aircraft were destroyed.

### Reflections on the Third Anniversary of the War — Broadcast Speech by Information Director Matsudaira —

Matsudaira, the Information Director of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy in China, delivered a broadcast speech on Shanghai Radio at 7:20 last night, entitled "Reflections on the Third Anniversary of the War." The content of his speech is as follows:

Differences Between Easterners and Westerners

Knowing oneself and knowing the enemy is a prerequisite for victory. Battlefield calculations go without saying. Whether it is a declaration of war betting on the fate of a nation, or diplomatic negotiations in peacetime, one must accurately grasp the other party's situation, measure one's own strength, and make a proper judgment. The victory or defeat of a war depends on the correctness of the judgment, which is by no means an exaggeration. However, such judgments often differ greatly depending on the observer, so they are sometimes inaccurate. In general, the difference between us Japanese and the British and Americans lies in the perception that serves as the basis for judgment, or the attitude of thinking. In short, our perceptions, what we hear, and our thinking are all very different. If you ask what the difference is between Japanese and British and Americans, anyone will immediately answer that it is a difference in race. The differences in color or the special features of the nose, in short, are associated with differences in appearance. But aside from what is said, it is difficult to answer what is different. If you ask what the difference is not in appearance, but in content, it is difficult to investigate its limits.

Different Views on Observing Things Although this difference only results in different views. Japanese people observe things only in the Japanese way, while British and Americans observe things in the British and American way. In other words, Japanese people tend to be more unthinking and act on intuition. They often observe things intuitively and make intuitive judgments. This is the biggest difference between Japanese and British and Americans. On the other hand, the thinking of British and Americans is not unthinking. They observe things analytically and interpretively and then make judgments. Their intuition is not a sluggish activity. This is a characteristic of British and Americans. The Japanese style of observation is the so-called Eastern style of observation. Chinese, Indians, and various southern ethnic groups all have this characteristic. The British and American style of observation is the so-called Western style of observation. All Europeans have common characteristics and views. The Chinese are the most thorough in this Eastern style of observation. Generally, they proceed by intuition. China has the concept of "taking the world," "the world being at peace," and "everything under heaven belonging to the nation," without establishing boundary lines or terms of demarcation anywhere. If they adopt analysis or statistics, they are not very clever. For example, their population is said to be 400 million or 450 million, roughly estimated. That is why, during the Washington Conference, the French representative Briand asked, "What kind of country is China?" In short, it is difficult to understand China if you observe it in the Western way, which is why such a foolish question was raised.

The British and American View of Japan

However, how do the British and Americans observe Japan? The views of the generally knowledgeable classes are that there is a small island nation in the east of the Chinese mainland along the Pacific coast. The people who live there have the wisdom of monkeys, are imitative, and are warlike and aggressive. But the Japanese in this small island nation possess considerable military power and are ranked among the world's first-class nations. Although they sometimes speak arrogantly and rudely, they would be foolish to fight against Britain and America. It is an "incomprehensible country" and an "incomprehensible race." This view is still considered polite. As for the common people, they do not know anything about Japan at all. Generally, middle school history textbooks have about one and a half pages describing Japan. A Japanese painter, a friend of mine, once directly heard this said by a model. He had been working as a model abroad, and gradually developed a good relationship with the painter while diligently learning to paint. They often went out for tea or meals together, and he tried his best to please her. But one evening, they went to see a movie together. The screen showed a "head sacrifice" of African natives and a hula dance scene. The model sitting next to him whispered in his ear, "Your country's scene has already been shown, do you miss me too?" The painter was very angry when he heard this, and could not refute it. His enthusiasm for the model completely cooled down. The foreign country referred to above is probably France. This situation is roughly the same for British or Americans. The general public does not go beyond the scope of this model's view. If you ask how British and American politicians and military leaders observe Japan, they still observe it analytically, interpretively, and with all kinds of statistics and mathematics, calculating Japan's area and resources, and comparing Japan's national power to a fraction of that of Britain and America. Therefore, they said the war would be a three-month affair. This was their observation three years ago, and the generally ignorant public believed it.

Completely Wrong Estimate of Japan Ms. Sakanishi, who worked in the library there for more than ten years in Washington, once said that when she returned on an exchange ship, American friends gave her particularly harmless advice, many saying, "If it takes three months, the war will be over, you don't need to take an exchange ship back to your country, you might as well stay in Washington." Such a view meant that Japan had no strength at all. At that time, America's view of Japan was completely wrong. Why was this? Because the basis of their judgment was based solely on superficial figures and statistics, seeing only Japan's material resources and not taking spiritual aspects into account. This is probably the main reason. But it is probably impossible to express spiritual strength in numbers and statistics and calculate it. The result of the wrong judgment is that America's initial judgment has collapsed, which is fortunate for us. However, the enemy is re-examining Japan's national power to find a way to resist, and has begun to supplement its wartime strength. So far, it has spent an unprecedented 200 billion US dollars in military spending, rapidly increasing the production of airplanes, ships, tanks, large and small cannons, heavy trucks, and other military supplies. The observation that the war would end in the first three months has been thrown to the winds. Therefore, it has converted peaceful industries into military industries, so it has had to drastically suppress civilian needs. As a result, three years later, the national life is getting worse and worse, and social unrest is occurring unexpectedly. The production of military supplies of America, which boasts of its material resources, is also rapidly declining. (To be continued)

Editorial

### Paying Attention to Rampant Prices

The city's Economic Security Office convened a symposium with the chairpersons of various trade associations the day before yesterday. The purpose was to ensure that the trade associations would maintain close contact and cooperation with the Economic Security Office in the future. The trade associations should strictly order their member firms not to raise prices without authorization before the approved price limit is raised. The trade associations should report the improper behavior and irregular business practices of their members so that they can be strictly investigated. Amidst this rampant price surge, we hope that the responsible persons of each trade association will fully recognize the situation and cooperate.

The price problem has been fluctuating for the past few years, and the time between fluctuations is getting shorter and shorter. For example, the price fluctuations in the middle of last year were separated by half a year or several months. During this period, they could remain stable for a while, and each fluctuation had a leading cause. The situation this year and recently is that each fluctuation is separated by a month or a week, or even fluctuates daily, and there is no so-called leading cause for the fluctuation. This phenomenon can be fully seen in the last few days. Whether it is daily necessities, rice, firewood, vegetables, transportation costs, etc., everything is different today than yesterday, and the market changes three times a day.

Why is this happening? We believe that the simplest reason is that general merchants—to put it more broadly, those who hold goods—have a fixed view on the selling price of all goods, watching each other. If you raise prices, I will raise prices too; if you lower prices, I will not lower prices. So everyone only raises prices and does not lower prices. The general public's psychology of valuing goods over money is becoming more and more intense, so at the time of each fluctuation, they scramble to buy and store goods, and merchants see this as an opportunity to raise prices.

The above are all actual phenomena of rising prices over the years. As for the theoretical knot of the price problem, it is of course due to the shortage of goods, the increase in currency issuance, and the obstruction of transportation. However, these are all inevitable in a wartime economy. However, we always believe that although these are inevitable, it cannot be said that there is no considerable limit. However, the actual phenomenon of rising prices has already exceeded these theoretical limits. In other words, the multiple of the shortage of goods, the increase in currency issuance, and the decrease in transportation is no longer parallel to the multiple of the actual rise in prices.

So why is price inflation so rampant? To sum it up in one sentence, it is due to poor politics. Because of poor politics, the institutions managing prices are fragmented, the laws are inconsistent, and the personnel are incompetent. In the laxity of the entire institution's laws and personnel, even if one or two institutions' laws and personnel have some spirit, it is difficult to reverse the entire adverse phenomenon. The goodness or badness of politics is of course man-made. Therefore, the formation of the phenomenon of rampant prices is also man-made. For example, the recent surge in gold prices is unreasonable, avoidable, and entirely caused by man-made speculation and rumors. Unfortunately, the authorities are sitting by and watching the rampant speculation, unable to directly attack the speculators and strictly investigate them. There have been many examples of rampant speculation in various industries in the past, and this is just one of them. However, the Allied nation Japan also has the same inevitable economic phenomena during wartime, but prices have always been stable, and speculators cannot indulge in evil. This is concrete proof of good politics.

We have always been pleased with the establishment of the Economic Security Office in this city and the devotion to duty of Director Wu Dao and other senior officials. However, the Economic Security Office is only one link in the price management institution. As the saying goes, "A single tree can hardly support a tall building." We hope that the Economic Security Office will pay more attention to the causes of price fluctuations in the future, fully exercise its authority, and strictly investigate and crack down on speculators. At the same time, we also hope that the price management institutions and personnel will be comprehensively rectified and truly assume responsibility. Speculation and profiteering, rampant prices, threats to people's livelihood, and hidden crises all require close attention from the relevant authorities.

### Prices are Soaring Unabated — Take Effective Countermeasures Quickly — Do Not Allow Speculators and Profiteers to Engage in Disguised Activities

In Shanghai's financial, industrial, and commercial markets last week, prices continued to rise amidst public anxiety and uncertainty. Incited by speculators and profiteers, the trend of price gouging continued, and it was difficult to reverse the downward momentum. In the financial sector, the price of red gold continued to rise, with purchases accounting for the majority. Outsiders found it difficult to enter the market to buy. Silver prices rose for three consecutive days, reaching 50 yuan. The interest rate on money shop bills remained unchanged, but the hidden interest rate increased, and the situation seemed tight, as those in urgent need of funds did not hesitate to pay higher interest rates. Hua stock prices were relatively stable on Monday and Tuesday, but on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, due to unfavorable market sentiment, rumors were rife. Bullish traders were reluctant to close their positions, so prices rose for three consecutive days. The market only calmed down slightly in the first half of Saturday, as the bullish traders stopped closing their positions and market sentiment turned bearish. In the industrial and commercial sectors, all factories were affected by power outages, making it impossible to continue operations. Production was difficult. Although there were reports of using engines instead, it was only in the initial stage of preparation. It was difficult to predict when the original industrial production would be restored, so the prices of industrial materials did not fall. The market prices of other daily necessities, food, rice, oil, firewood, and miscellaneous grains were all secretly rising. This situation is a real threat to people's livelihood and causes increasing anxiety. Therefore, the general public hopes that the relevant government authorities will quickly devise thorough and effective countermeasures to prevent speculators and hoarders from having room for disguised activities. This will be a blessing for the citizens.

### Facilitating Accommodation for Merchants — Detailed Management Measures for Inns are Being Drafted

The city police department has found that inns are specifically for visiting merchants to stay in, but at present, most of the inns in the city are used by idle people for entertainment, and they are always full. As a result, visiting merchants have nowhere to stay, which is unreasonable. Therefore, it has decided to manage them, stipulating that each inn must reserve a certain number of empty rooms every day specifically for visiting merchants from other places to stay in. The room numbers of the empty rooms must be publicly listed in the accounting room until the time of the last train or ship. If there are still no merchants staying after that time, they can be rented out. Detailed management measures are being drafted.

### Jianghai Customs Deadline for Collecting Tax Refund Vouchers

Jianghai Customs issued a notice yesterday regarding the deadline for collecting tax refund vouchers. All tax refund checks approved and issued from January 1, 1941 to December 31, 1941 that have not yet been collected must be collected by February 1, 1945. Otherwise, they will be cancelled. Tax refund checks that have already been collected but have not yet been cashed must be cashed at the bank by January 31, 1945. Otherwise, they will also be invalidated.

### Sugar Control Problem — Pending Approval from the Executive Yuan

The sugar control problem after the reorganization of the Commercial Administration Council has not yet been resolved. As a result, the sugar control organization of the original Sugar Industry Professional Committee of the Commercial Administration Council has been set up for several months without any real function. Chinese and Japanese sugar merchants have negotiated with the relevant authorities several times and plan to establish a Sino-Japanese Sugar Industry Association to jointly handle the sugar control task. However, whether the Sino-Japanese Sugar Industry Association will be established or not, whether it will be supervised and guided by the Commercial Administration Council after its establishment, whether the Sugar Industry Professional Committee will be abolished, or whether the original organization will be adjusted and reorganized, is still pending approval from the Executive Yuan.

### The City's Increased Production Outline — Implemented in All Counties

The city Economic Bureau has accepted the Agricultural Increased Production Promotion Committee's proposal for increased production work, which cannot be delayed due to its responsibility. Therefore, it has formulated 15 articles of the city's increased production outline for implementation in all counties:

(1) The implementation agencies for guiding increased production work in various places should maintain close contact with the Economic Bureau and other relevant agencies in the future.

(2) The technical personnel of the farms under the jurisdiction of the city and the various improvement zones, the production mutual aid cooperatives affiliated with the cooperative branches, and the responsible personnel of the township and town promotion associations should be given academic and spiritual training at any time.

(3) Each place should promote and reward the planting of agricultural crops with the highest yield per unit area based on the local environment, climate, and soil quality, without adhering to customs and trends. Special attention should be paid to crop rotation to maintain soil fertility.

(4) The purchase price of agricultural products should take into account the cost of farmers and the prices of important agricultural products to each other, or exchange goods for goods based on the needs of farmers.

(5) Training for core farmers and farmer lectures should be held extensively during the agricultural off-season to impart agricultural knowledge.

(6) Spring plowing should be vigorously promoted next year, and rewards should be given for implementing suitable seedling fields and capturing egg-killing rice stem borers to prevent the disaster of rice stem borers this year.

(7) Since the outbreak of the war, the source of chemical fertilizers has been lacking, and farmers have a poor understanding of the use of chemical fertilizers. The use of chemical fertilizers should be promoted and guided to farmers.

(8) Farmers in the countryside are extremely poor. The Economic Bureau and various cooperatives should be responsible for providing low-interest loans from China and Japan and banks to production farmers.

(9) In addition to demonstration operations, local farms and cooperative farms should also pay attention to experimental research work.

(10) Idle wasteland along the railway lines in the city and its counties should be designated for farmers to cultivate or recruit unemployed vagrants in the city. The government should allocate a portion of the funds to establish a reclamation bureau to be responsible for management.

(11) All places feel that there is a lack of agricultural technicians. County governments and cooperatives should run agricultural vocational schools, recruit students with a junior high school graduation level or above, provide them with room and board, and do not charge miscellaneous fees, so that they can receive more than two years of agricultural education. After graduation, they will be assigned to work in the township and town promotion associations.

(12) During the winter, farmers in various places should be encouraged by cooperatives to repair embankments, dredge rivers, and open ponds for water conservancy projects for irrigation and drainage.

(13) Farmers in various places feel that there is a lack of working cattle. Farmers do not know how to raise breeding livestock and allow them to be slaughtered. Therefore, it is planned to conduct working cattle registration. In addition to rewarding the raising of breeding livestock and assisting in the purchase and transportation, slaughtering will also be restricted.

(14) Promote and reward agricultural by-products, such as the processing and manufacturing of agricultural products and livestock products, and the breeding of poultry and fish.

(15) In this year of increased production, funds and materials should be concentrated on increased production. Unnecessary decorations, drinks, and food only increase consumption. Sales of drinks and food should be restricted so that citizens not only develop a habit of frugality, but also shift useful money to prosperous national and people-benefiting undertakings.

### Child Welfare Association Fundraising — Extended Deadline

The current fundraising campaign of the China Child Welfare Association was originally scheduled to end on the 10th of this month. However, many fundraising committee members were unable to complete their donations on schedule due to busy work. The association's standing committee members, Lin Kanghou and Tang Jinqing, etc., decided to extend the fundraising period by three weeks, until the end of this month. It is hoped that all sectors will continue to assist in raising funds and jointly support this righteous cause.

### A Record of Su Kunyu's Inspection of Rice Producing Areas (5)

The Suzhou Cooperative has a capital of 300 million yuan, of which 30 million yuan is from membership fees. It purchases six types of agricultural products: rice, wheat, beans, cotton, rapeseed, and castor beans. Currently, in order to adapt to the current situation, the cooperative is shifting its focus from consumption-based distribution to active production.

The Kunshan Cooperative branch is responsible for purchasing grain in five townships in the second district. The branch has 15,042 members, of which 8,614 are fee-paying members (100 yuan per year). There are 80 mutual aid societies for training farmer cadres, with a total of 6,951 members. When purchasing rice, in addition to paying cash, the following distribution methods are used: 1. For every stone of white rice sold by a farmer, they receive 5 yards of white cloth, priced at 600 yuan (black market price 2,000 yuan), and 3 bean cakes, each priced at 150 yuan. 2. For every two stones of white rice sold, they receive 5.25 yards of black cloth, priced at 600 yuan (black market price 2,700 yuan), and bean cakes. 3. For every three stones of white rice sold, they receive 5.25 yards of bleached cloth, priced at 600 yuan (black market price 2,500 yuan), and 7 bean cakes. 4. For every five stones of white rice sold, they receive 5.25 yards of twill cloth, priced at 600 yuan (black market price 3,600 yuan), and 8 bean cakes.

The reason why the cooperative can achieve such excellent results in purchasing grain is due to the following points:

1. The cooperative can directly contact farmers and understand the people's hearts, while rice merchants and farmers are separated by brokers, which inevitably creates distance.

2. The cooperative's purchase price is absolutely fair and paid to the farmers. Rice merchants and brokers may exploit the farmers to gain profits.

3. The cooperative cares for farmers throughout the year, while rice merchants and brokers only contact farmers during the rice harvest season and then neglect the farmers' welfare.

Since the cooperative has such advantages, it is hoped that those in the National Government who are enthusiastic about rural construction will not establish organizations such as rural production increase groups, which would result in a proliferation of institutions and a dispersal of power. It would be better to concentrate all efforts on strengthening the cooperative system so that it can be universally applied in rural areas. At the same time, the work of purchasing agricultural products should no longer be handled by intermediaries (such as rice merchants and brokers), but should be directly borne by the cooperative.

7 Farmer's Livelihood Issues

During the inspection trip, the reporter was constantly concerned about the living conditions of the farmers. Listening to lengthy theoretical speeches is not as practical as talking directly to the farmers.

According to the farmers' discussions, the main points can be summarized as follows:

1. In the Suzhou area, landlords own 70% of the land, while self-cultivating farmers only account for 30%.

2. 60% of farmers in various parts of Jiangsu Province lack funds for farming and borrow high-interest loans from landlords or others, with interest rates reaching 20%.

3. The cost of farming in Jiangsu Province has increased dramatically. Taking the second district as an example, in addition to land rent and taxes, fertilizer is also needed, with each mu of land requiring five bean cakes, costing 2,000 yuan. At the same time, local miscellaneous levies amount to 60 yuan per mu per month.

4. The grain stored by farmers in several districts of Chu County is exhausted between February and March after the autumn harvest. They rely on the harvest of small grains (wheat, naked barley, barley) for a living, and what they eat is "mai tang" (wheat bran gruel). Some even eat wheat bran gruel all year round. In the rural areas near Pengpai Town in Kunshan, most of the rice is sold and transported to Wusong and then to Shanghai, so the farmers eat thin porridge and pot scrapings.

5. Farmers are very concerned about the selection of township and baojia chiefs, because these intermediaries inevitably engage in embezzlement and other activities. For example, when farmers in Changshu sold rice last year, the Rice Control Association issued white, blue, and red vouchers for the distribution of supplies (each voucher could be exchanged for cotton cloth, soap, matches, sugar, and cigarettes). As a result, the farmers only received one and a half feet of cloth, while the township and bao chiefs each had several bolts of cotton cloth, soap, and other large quantities. They swallowed their anger because these people had local power and dared not report them.

The current living conditions of farmers are like this. In Japan, farmers have unlimited self-esteem. For example, in the rural areas of the Bikai district, known as the Denmark of Japan, young people must print "Farmer So-and-So" on their business cards. In China, farmers are pitifully the targets of exorbitant taxes. Now that farmers are the production warriors in the rear, the authorities should treat farmers with respect and reverence, investigate and prosecute corrupt township and baojia chiefs, provide farmers with guarantees, and not only think of farmers when purchasing grain. The policy of valuing agriculture should not be temporary, but should be long-lasting, providing farmers with thorough protection and enthusiastic assistance at all times and in all places throughout the year.

8 Issues of Corrupt Officials and Dishonest Bureaucrats

If there are no corrupt officials in the government and no unscrupulous merchants in the marketplace, then the people's lives will be bright. Since the Hu Incident this spring, thanks to the authorities' decisive action, the people have been very happy. Such corrupt elements cause great suffering to farmers.

When the reporter held a forum in Suzhou, Mr. Takemoto (of the Continental News), a Japanese staff member, cited a concrete example of a corrupt official based on what he had seen to prove the debauchery and shamelessness of such people.

At the same time, he put forward the following methods to thoroughly eliminate such destructive elements.

1. Stabilize the livelihood of officials.

2. Establish strict courts in various places to investigate and thoroughly punish officials who have engaged in corruption.

3. Use local cooperative organizations to implement farmer distribution and purchase to reduce the opportunity for corrupt officials to take advantage of them.

4. It is hoped that the authorities will give the press absolute freedom to thoroughly expose the issue of corrupt officials in order to eliminate those who use good names to deceive farmers.

Expectations from All Walks of Life in Shanghai

After arriving in Suzhou, the reporter paid respects to Colonel Kaneko, the liaison minister of Jiangsu Province. Mr. Kaneko was energetic and put forward two points to the Shanghai side to draw attention:

1. Shanghai is the economic center of China. It is hoped that the financial community of the city can be mobilized to assist in the work of rice management in terms of business, and to inject funds into the rural areas to carry out agricultural loan work.

2. The household registration distribution system in Shanghai must be absolutely accurate. For example, in one district, the allocated household rice is calculated for 80 people, but the actual population is only 70 people. This point must be corrected.

In his conversation with the reporter, Colonel Kaneko advocated a distribution system based on key points: those who contribute to society and the national war should receive increased allocations; otherwise, the allocation should be reduced.

During the inspection period, the reporter was always concerned about the food problem in Shanghai. When inquiring with military officers and those involved in purchasing, he reported the real situation of the food situation in Shanghai to provide them with reference. After completing the inspection and returning to Shanghai, he would like to discuss the following with all sectors of Shanghai society based on what he has seen and heard:

1. Some financial and industrial circles in the city may use their funds for speculative hoarding purposes and are indifferent to rural loans. As a result, 62% of farmers suffer from high-interest loans. It is hoped that they can wake up and inject funds into rural areas, establishing agricultural loan offices to reduce the burden on farmers.

2. It is hoped that citizens will think of the greater good in everything they do, take a long-term view, and immediately stop the brewing of alcohol that wastes grain (especially white wine, which consumes a great deal of grain), and the sugar manufacturing industry!

3. In order to save grain, it is hoped that citizens will eat as much miscellaneous grain as possible.

Finally, the reporter informed the citizens that the municipal government has accepted the recommendations of the Municipal Advisory Committee and the support of the industrial sector and will issue Shanghai municipal bonds with a total amount of 150 million yuan. It is planned to use 100 million yuan as a fund to adjust the rice grain funds to adjust the price of allocated rice, to maintain the price of 5,000 yuan per stone as the standard, to protect the people's food in the city. Roughly, this kind of temporary relief treasury bills will be issued before January 1 of the following year. The reporter would like to look forward to this with enthusiasm.

Conclusion

Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions stated that revolution cannot succeed without the help of farmers. Therefore, farmers are the driving force of the country. As a result of the reporter's inspection, he deeply felt that the farmers' responsibilities were lofty and great, but their current situation was also extremely difficult. He would like to appeal to the authorities with the heart of a child, hoping that the authorities can devote all their efforts to eliminate bad elements that hinder the livelihood of farmers, and ban all acts of excessive taxation and extortion against farmers. Only by loving farmers and protecting farmers can production be increased, and society and the country can survive, and the victory of the war can be relied upon. (The End)
