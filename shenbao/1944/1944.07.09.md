### "Making a Mountain Out of a Molehill"

— Yoshida Tosuke

I recently encountered such a thing. The apartment I live in is managed by a large Japanese national policy company. Recently, in order to save electricity, it greatly shortened the use time of the elevators. As a result, two of the three elevator operators hired were dismissed. However, the severance pay for drivers with more than three years of service was only two-thirds of one month's salary. According to previous practice, the severance pay for this apartment would be set at two months' salary. However, the new manager, the national policy company, disregarded the usual practice and paid the dismissed employees one-third of one month's salary. When the drivers negotiated with them, the person in charge looked stern and scolded, "Get out!" What's more, the Japanese supervisor specially dispatched by the company even punched the old man twice. This kind of lawless phenomenon can really be said to be unheard of. I dare to ask this Japanese, late at night, to ask himself, would the Japanese have such a wild act towards the wood-like people all day long? The reason why Japanese people have such a fierce attitude towards Chinese people is nothing more than that Japanese people have a wrong view that since the other party is Chinese, they can be buried at will. Empress Dowager Cixi sighed: "They (Westerners) look down on us only because they think we are just Chinese." (From "Two Years in the Forbidden City" by [unclear]). In the final analysis, this Japanese is really the same as those Westerners who do not recognize Chinese people as human beings. As long as the Japanese have such erroneous thoughts and absurd behaviors, no matter how flowery and grand the Japanese government's declarations are, the Chinese people will not sincerely accept them.

Everyone knows that the spirit that currently dominates China is to inherit the consistent fine traditions of the Xinhai Revolution. The Xinhai Revolution, of course, was superficially a "national revolution against the Manchu Qing," but the so-called "Manchu" had long been assimilated by the Han Chinese, and it can also be said that the Manchu's ruling relationship with the Han Chinese had long disappeared. Therefore, the launch of the Xinhai Revolution was by no means caused by the irreconcilable hatred of the Han people towards the Manchus. So what was the real motivation for the Xinhai Revolution? In fact, due to the international environment at that time, as long as one was considered Chinese, one would be looked down upon by foreigners. The Xinhai Revolution broke out against this point. The Chinese people rose up in anger, wanting to lay a strong foundation for China and get rid of this humiliating environment. But the Chinese people all noticed that the Manchu Qing government did not have the guiding force of a world-class country like the Japanese government guiding Japan. Therefore, in order to first remove the obstacle in the process, the Manchu Qing government, they launched the Xinhai Revolution. Therefore, as Gu Hongming said, the Xinhai Revolution was a "people's revolution against the government that tolerated foreigners' insults to the Chinese people." To be more precise, it was "not a revolution against a corrupt government, but a revolution against a weak or cowardly government." At present, the fundamental traditional spirit of this national revolution is still being carried forward in China. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, after several efforts and struggles, it has tried to jump out of the bad environment where it is insulted by people all over the world just because it is Chinese, and wants to create a good environment where it is respected by people all over the world just because it is Chinese. Anyone who hinders the Chinese people's demand for Taoism is regarded by the Chinese people as the evil enemy of the Chinese nation, and anyone who supports this demand is regarded as the comrade-in-arms of the Chinese nation. Therefore, the above-mentioned insulting attitude of a large Japanese national policy company towards the employment of Chinese people, although the matter is small, is greatly contrary to the fundamental beliefs of the Chinese people. Therefore, no matter how loudly the Japanese government shouts out new policies, and no matter how many beautiful theories the Japanese publish in newspapers and magazines, as long as the Chinese people find that the Japanese people's wrong views on the Chinese people have not changed in their daily lives, in other words, as long as they are beaten, scolded, and insulted by the Japanese people just because they are Chinese, then the Japanese should not expect the Chinese people to recognize Japan as a friendly country of China.

I heard that there is a story in Chongqing recently. Namely: An American airplane pilot was drunk, with a cigarette in his mouth, and staggered on the right side of the road. Smoking cigarettes on the road and walking on the right side are not allowed by the New Life Movement, but the police did not dare to stop him because the other party was American. At this time, a young military officer happened to pass by the place, so he severely criticized the American, saying: "This is Chinese territory, so you must abide by Chinese laws." In this way, the Chinese people certainly have no special ambition to put on airs towards other countries, but they will never allow foreigners living in China to look down on the Chinese people. Although China is currently divided into peaceful areas and resistance areas, the requirements of all Chinese people are only one. Therefore, it must be known that the insult of a large Japanese national policy company to the Chinese people will not only have a bad impact on the Chinese people in the peaceful areas, but also have a bad impact on the Chinese people in the resistance areas.

### Enemy Ships in the Central Pacific Sunk and Destroyed Exceed Fifty; Japanese Troops on Saipan Continue to Fight Fiercely

A certain Japanese military base in the Central Pacific, Central News Agency dispatch dated the 11th of June: Since the enemy appeared in the Mariana Sea area on June 11th, the Japanese army, navy, and air force have fought bravely and well. As of the 20th, they have shot down or destroyed more than 40 enemy aircraft carriers, battleships, and other ships, inflicting great damage on the enemy. It has been clarified that on the nights of June 18th and 19th, two enemy aircraft carriers were sunk near Saipan, for a total of two ships. It has been confirmed that they have been sunk. Therefore, the actual number of enemy ships sunk or damaged in the Mariana Sea area and the Ogasawara area from June 1st to 30th has reached more than 50.

Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: A dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in the Central Pacific states that the Japanese troops on Saipan are still fighting fiercely under the two-pronged attack of the enemy's sea, land, and air forces. On the 5th, they launched a fierce battle in the area extending approximately six kilometers south from Tero Cape, the northern end of the island. Afterwards, the Japanese army shortened and reorganized the front line to the north, and are currently continuing to fight fiercely. On the other hand, a strong Japanese army assault force slipped into the enemy's position near Mount Tapochau and carried out a surprise attack, throwing the enemy into confusion. The Japanese Air Force also echoed the brave fighting of the ground forces, bombing the enemy troops on the island on the night of the 6th. On the night of the 7th, they braved enemy anti-aircraft fire to bomb the area around Aslito airfield. In this battle, the Japanese aircraft returned after bombing. It has been determined that the battle in the Tero Cape area at the northern end of the island is very fierce. Near the foot of Mount Tapochau, the enemy army is constantly firing flares and is currently engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese assault force.

### Enemy Aircraft Re-attack Kyushu; Repelled Again with Ease; Japan's Homeland Defense as Solid as an Iron Wall

Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 6:00 AM on July 8th: At around 2:00 AM on the 8th, more than ten enemy aircraft infiltrated the western and northern areas of Kyushu from a mainland base. The Japanese air defense forces immediately intercepted them and repelled them. The Japanese side suffered no damage.

Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: The enemy army attempted a second air raid on Northern Kyushu at dawn on the 8th, but was defeated again by the Japanese army. In this battle, the enemy army first divided into three squadrons of several aircraft each. One squadron invaded the Nagasaki and Sasebo areas from the western sea and fled towards the Genkai Sea in the north. The other two squadrons took the same route as last time, invading the Northern Kyushu industrial zone from the north. One squadron turned east and fled north over Yamaguchi Prefecture, while the other squadron retreated west and fled to the Genkai Sea. The Japanese side had completely prepared for the interception about an hour before the enemy aircraft appeared, especially because of the second attack, the preparations were extremely rapid. The enemy aircraft's aim in this air raid seemed to be to bomb the Northern Kyushu industrial zone and the naval areas of Omura and Sasebo. During their attacks, they tried to avoid using bombs and mainly used incendiary bombs. What is particularly noteworthy is that, as of 8:00 AM, according to the report transmitted to this agency by the North Kyushu branch of the Domei News Agency, it has been confirmed that three enemy aircraft were shot down. Most of the incendiary bombs used by the enemy army this time did not explode. Those that did burn were completely extinguished due to the dispatch of fire brigades and the courageous rescue efforts of neighborhood fire prevention teams. As far as is known now, only two or three private houses in cities such as Kokura City and Tobata City were destroyed, and there were no casualties. This is truly a great ironclad proof that civilian air defense has been successful. Furthermore, according to reports from the Nagasaki, Sasebo, and Omura branches, the enemy aircraft that attacked these areas were one squadron composed of five to seven aircraft. However, no enemy bombs fell in any of the areas. Bombs were only dropped in the sea southwest of Nagasaki City. When the Japanese air defense forces pursued them, one B25 aircraft was shot down off the coast of Shisa Town, Nagasaki Prefecture. The enemy's air raid on that area also ended in failure.

Minister Matsushima Issues Statement

Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet Press Department in China issued a statement yesterday, saying: According to the announcement by the Imperial Headquarters, the enemy American air force stationed in Chongqing attempted to attack our homeland Northern Kyushu and Western Kyushu again with B29 bombers. However, our air defense forces detected the enemy aircraft's movements in advance and immediately rose up to intercept them, repelling the enemy's air raid force, which relied solely on material quantity, while our side's damage was negligible.

The enemy Americans have recently suffered unexpected and heavy losses in their operations in the Pacific. For example, in the Ogasawara Islands area, as announced on the 4th, over seventy-four attacking enemy aircraft were shot down, and the remnants fled in a panic. Also, in the Saipan area, as of June 30th, the total number of enemy ships sunk or destroyed was over forty-eight, and the number of enemy aircraft shot down reached over six hundred and sixty-six.

The enemy, feeling impatient about this, seeing that the Chongqing army has suffered major blows in the Japanese army's mainland operations, to the extent that Wallace's blank check is also difficult to use, is now trying to air raid the Japanese homeland in order to achieve their goal.

Although the enemy aircraft have already been defeated and fled, considering that today's enemy aircraft's actions in the Central China area are related to the air raids on the Japanese homeland, we must still be strictly vigilant.

Looking at the recent situation in which the United States, regardless of sacrifice, is gradually falling into a hot spot, it can be judged. For example, the American Undersecretary of the Navy once said, "This war will last until 1949," and was therefore regarded as incompetent, and there was talk of "dismissal," which is just one example. Even if the enemy Americans increase their quality and quantity and repeatedly air raid, we will not care. If they come to invade, we will definitely destroy them anytime, anywhere. We will not stop intercepting them for a day until they lose their will to fight and their combat power.

### Japanese Troops Reinforce and Attack Near Qingyuan; Japanese Aircraft Vigorously Bomb Hengyang Chongqing Troops

A certain Japanese military base, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: The Chongqing Reserve 10th Division and the Provisional 54th Division in Hengyang City, although they have become rats in a bag, are still stubbornly resisting. In order to completely annihilate them, the Japanese bomber squadrons carried out a major bombing on them on the evening of the 6th. That night, the weather was clear and the moon was bright. The Japanese aircraft squadrons that killed to the skies over Hengyang aimed at the enemy army headquarters in the northern end of the city, and the houses and city walls where the remnants of the enemy were gathered, and dropped huge bombs. As a result, flames suddenly soared into the sky and black smoke filled the area in Hengyang City, as if it were hell. The entire Japanese aircraft squadron flew back safely.

Lisbon, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing military authorities are still continuing to fight fiercely around Hengyang. On the 5th, the Japanese army supplied a large amount of weapons and ammunition by airplane and fiercely bombed the Chongqing army's positions. The infantry then carried out a strong assault under this cover. The attack continued on the night of the 6th, and the Chongqing army also worked hard to defend. On the Guangdong front, the Japanese army near Qingyuan, having obtained reinforcements from all sides, is attacking the Chongqing army's positions again.

British Newspaper Comments on the Chinese War

Lisbon, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: According to a London dispatch, the diplomatic correspondent of the Observer, on the 5th, specially selected the following events of the Japanese operation in China: After occupying Changsha and passing through Hengyang, the Japanese army is currently advancing south. The Chongqing side has lost important transportation lines and granaries due to the Japanese army's advance. This has a great impact on military affairs and the economy. Especially in military affairs, it will deepen the suffering of the Chongqing people who have been through wars. Furthermore, the increasingly isolated Chongqing side will deepen the atmosphere of the people's participation in the war. Due to the Chongqing side's loss of fertile areas, the Chongqing area has fallen into a state of famine, and its economic and financial position has become exceptionally weak, etc. Furthermore, the Manchester Guardian also criticized the difficulty of rescue, saying that Chongqing is now in the most severe period of testing. Because the anti-axis countries cannot provide a large amount of materials to aid Chongqing, Chongqing, which has been feeling economic pressure for a long time, will soon lose the rich rice-producing areas of southeastern China.

### Roosevelt Discusses the Chinese War Situation

Lisbon, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: Washington dispatch, US President Roosevelt met with a group of newspaper reporters on the 7th and issued a statement saying: The recent war situation on the Chinese front is worrying. The Chongqing army cannot stop the Japanese army's advance. The general American people do not understand the seriousness of the actual situation in China. If Chongqing is completely defeated, then the Japanese-American war will tend to be prolonged.

### The Battle on the Myitkyina Front in Burma is Currently Unfolding Fiercely; Japanese Elite Troops Destroy Enemy's Attempt

Japanese frontline in North Burma, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: The Chongqing-British-American Allied Forces are currently invading near Kamaning on the Myitkyina front. Relying on manpower and material quantity, they have attempted to link up with the Yunnan Expeditionary Force that crossed the Salween River after occupying Myitkyina and Mogaung, and have repeatedly attacked. In order to destroy the enemy's intention, the Japanese army has launched a fierce battle with them with elite troops. The enemy's military strength is gradually weakening. From November last year to June this year, the number of enemy soldiers killed or wounded, surrendered and fled, and captured totaled more than 36,000. Taking a certain division of the Chongqing army stationed in India as an example, the damage before June has reached 1,786 people, of which 30% were killed in battle, and about half of the officers were killed. Therefore, the commanders feel that they are insufficient, and because of the Chongqing-British-American cooperative relationship, the command system has fallen into confusion, so it has a great impact on the operation.

### Tokyo and Other Cities Decide to Evacuate School Children

Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: Recently, Tokyo and other important cities in Japan have been strengthening defenses. Previously, the Japanese government had considered evacuation plans for the protection of schoolchildren. It has now decided on a guiding policy and will implement it soon. The Japanese Information Bureau issued the following statement on the 8th regarding this matter: The government has decided on a guiding policy regarding the evacuation of schoolchildren from Tokyo and other important cities. It is now actively considering specific plans and will implement them soon. The evacuation of schoolchildren will avoid compulsory implementation and will be based on encouragement as a principle. It will actively encourage evacuation to the residences of close relatives. For those who do not have suitable relatives or friends, a group evacuation will be implemented according to plan under the management of the government. The students who should be evacuated as a group are stipulated to be students from the second grade and above to the sixth grade of elementary school in national schools. The evacuation locations should be selected as much as possible in locations with convenient transportation to and from their families. After the evacuation is completed, the current teachers will have to go to continue teaching, and food and other necessities must be prepared and stored. The details will be announced soon.

### Japanese Buddhist Association Holds Great East Asia Ullambana Festival

Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: The Japanese Buddhist Praise Association, in order to comfort the spirits of the war dead in various countries within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, specially held a "Great East Asia Ullambana Festival" at the Kudan Military Hall here at 1:00 PM on the 8th, presided over by the chief monk of the Higashi Honganji temple.

The meeting adjourned after 5:00 PM.

### Japanese Government Implements Reform: Decisive Battle Local Administration; Setting Up Full-Time Vice-Minister of Air Defense Headquarters

Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: In order to revitalize the local administration during the decisive battle, and especially in order to increase production in industrial and economic administration, the Japanese government had previously carefully examined this matter and decided on a concrete plan at a cabinet meeting on the 4th. The official gazette was published on the 8th and it was decided that it would be implemented from today. The main points of the publication are as follows: Set up a full-time vice-minister at the Air Defense General Headquarters; Consolidate and strengthen the local administrative structure; The economic departments of the prefectural governments and counties will implement a two-department system; Consolidate the local labor administration structure. In the past, the position of vice-minister of the Air Defense General Headquarters was held by the minister, who devoted himself to the post. This time, it has been changed to a full-time position to assist the Minister of Home Affairs and devote himself to air defense countermeasures. Regarding the strengthening of local administrative structures, vice-ministers will first be set up in the three major important prefectures and counties of Osaka, Fukuoka, and Aichi to assist the prefectural governors and county chiefs and be responsible for the comprehensive operation of local administration. The so-called two-department system of economic affairs: the first department is in charge of food. General industrial economic administration and civil engineering related matters other than administrative food are under the control of the second department, and it is the central district for external liaison for military demand and production increase in order to smooth economic administration. Furthermore, in view of the importance of labor administration in the current situation, the organizational structure of the Ministry of Health and Welfare's labor department is strengthened. Labor departments are set up in the Metropolitan Police Department and the Police Bureau to specialize in the management of labor administration in order to make the national labor and labor allocation more streamlined. Regarding the revitalization of local administration, since the establishment of the Administrative Council in July last year, the results have gradually progressed. After this new reform, it will definitely achieve the expected results.

### Bose Unveils True Feelings to Gandhi

Rangoon, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: On the 6th, Bose unveiled his true feelings to Gandhi on the radio, saying in essence: Gandhi, India's dawn is getting closer and closer, so my two major convictions recently are getting stronger and stronger, that is, the opportunity to liberate the divinely endowed motherland has come, and it is definitely not a difficult thing to succeed. Secondly, in order to expel the British, one must borrow external forces. Your Excellency also knows very well that it is impossible to achieve results against the cunning British government by relying solely on morality and non-violence. Now the intention of the British government is to extract our bones. Therefore, what we should strive to do is to cultivate the Indian people's fierce anti-British strife and assistance from the struggle for India. The outbreak of the Greater East Asia War can be said to be a good opportunity for India to unite and obtain assistance from the Axis powers. The Japanese have fully considered that the assistance of third countries is contrary to what the British have publicized. I believe that this kind of assistance is absolutely beneficial to India.

### Japanese Prime Minister Mizuno Cables Congratulations to Bose

Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: Japanese Taisei Yokusankai Kōa Honbu Prime Minister Mizuno, on the occasion of the "Independence League Week" sponsored by the Immediate Independence League, specially sent a congratulatory telegram to Chairman [Bose] to wish free India to achieve independence immediately.

The friendly relations between China and Myanmar have always been harmonious, and Dr. Ba Han's visit to China will further strengthen them.

In the future, our two countries, together with our allies, will work together to complete the war. Finally, I sincerely wish Dr. Ba Han and all members of the delegation good health.

### Director Lin's Broadcast to Chongqing: "Striving for a Proactive Way Out" (Continued)

The second question, "How should we handle the possible changes in the political situation caused by the European war situation?" After this question was raised, it seems that Chongqing has already started to deal with it, so there are exchanges between Chongqing and Moscow, and Wallace's visit. In fact, this kind of handling is more passive than active. We want to ask Chongqing to pay attention and not be fooled again, and have their own country exploited by others for nothing.

The third question that was asked at that time was, "How should we cooperate in the Greater East Asia War and the European War stages, seize the critical moment, and strive for the only possible and favorable solution? Is it going to end up unresolved, and be controlled by others in a state of neither war nor peace?" There will naturally be different views on this issue. Some people think that since we have been fighting for six or seven years anyway, why not drag it on a little longer and wait and see. Some people think that the outcome of the victory or defeat is still unknown. Even if the United Kingdom and the United States lose, they will never be destroyed. It is more cost-effective to be with the United Kingdom and the United States. This is simply the inferiority of being a slave to the United Kingdom and the United States. It can be said that "right and wrong are unclear, and interests are indistinguishable." Leaving aside the fact that the United Kingdom and the United States will lose, even if the United Kingdom and the United States win, based on the past events of the United Kingdom and the United States dominating the world for three or four hundred years, wouldn't China become meat on the chopping block at that time? The interests here are obvious. As for right and wrong, the allied nation of Japan has repeatedly stated the significance of the Greater East Asia War and is willing to be friends with China and not enemies. Why be enemies?

The fourth question that was asked at that time was, "The Communist Party has become a prairie fire. Should we allow it to sit idly by and watch China not perish from the disastrous defeat of the war, not perish from the failure of peace, but perish from the Communist Party taking advantage of the fire?" Regarding this issue, the Kuomintang comrades in Chongqing and other people must know it more deeply and anxiously than we do. Putting aside the friendship with other countries, as well as the Communist Party's theory and political propositions, just in terms of the practical issues, the Communist Party's strategy of resisting Chiang Kai-shek by force and the Communist Party's plan to launch a civil war before the end of the war abroad, the Communist Party's anti-Japanese strategy of restraining Chiang Kai-shek with democratic movements, and then limiting Chiang Kai-shek's power, and then obtaining strong international power and triggering the outbreak of the anti-Chiang movement, are all the Communist Party's propaganda outlines. The secret agents in Chongqing should have very detailed reports to Mr. Chiang. (To be continued)

### Ministry of Education Clarifies Key Points for Collecting Tuition Fees

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - The central education authorities stipulate that from the next academic year, in order to improve the salaries of teachers and staff, all schools at all levels, except for normal schools, must collect tuition fees. The Ministry of Education has clarified the key points for collecting tuition fees as follows: Education is a national undertaking, and efforts should be made to reduce the cost of education for the people. However, at present, the general salaries cannot be increased along with prices, and the salaries of teachers are even more meager. It is indeed necessary to use tuition fees to provide temporary stability to the lives of teachers. In recent years, price changes have been unpredictable. The cost of living in Area A and Area B are vastly different. The amount of tuition fees should not be uniformly restricted. Each province and city should consider the actual situation and the needs of the schools, formulate standards, and implement the collection after approval. After collecting tuition fees, each school must still set up free places to accommodate poor students, children of education and cultural workers, and children of low-level civil servants, so as not to be deprived of education due to inability to pay fees.

### German Army Actively Reinforces: Caen Area Falls into Melee; US Army Launches Large-Scale Offensive on Sanlo

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to German front-line news: In the twelve-kilometer continuous arc-shaped battle line in the Caen area, the two armies have a total of 100,000 troops and 2,000 tanks, and are currently entering a close-quarters melee.

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters field correspondent, the German army continued to reinforce its troops to the Caen area from the southeast on the evening of the 6th.

Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a Haitong News Agency report, British sources said that the British army launched an offensive southwest of Caen at 4:30 AM this morning, and it is reported that the US army on the Carentan-La Haye front has advanced to one mile north of Saint-Jean-de-Daye. It is also said that the US army's bridgehead in Villers has expanded to one mile wide and two and a half miles long. It is also learned that the battle of La Haye-du-Puits has now evolved into an artillery battle, with the German army in an advantageous position. At the extreme southern end, the US army has advanced to Mobeck, two miles southwest of La Haye.

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to Haitong News Agency: The US army on the Cotentin Peninsula launched a large-scale offensive in the direction of Sanlo yesterday.

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to German News Agency: Although the British and American armies fought with superior troops on Thursday, they failed to penetrate the German line everywhere, and there was no progress on the positions, which could be used as a prelude to a major offensive. The German army had to abandon its positions and retreat north in some places, but the units did not lose contact with each other and were still able to control the situation everywhere. The anti-axis forces have begun new operations south of Arezzo, and it is expected that large-scale offensives will continue in the area. The British and Polish forces launched a strong offensive in the Adriatic region. After several hours of fierce fighting near Osimo and Filottrano, the enemy broke through several gaps at a heavy price. The fighting in each gap was still ongoing on Friday morning.

### Declaration of War by the National Government

At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th of the year before last, the National Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Basic Treaty between China and Japan, declared its determination to share weal and woe with the friendly nation of Japan. Since then, it has launched a new national movement, engaged in safeguarding security and improving people's livelihood, with the aim of enhancing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States still use their century-old policy of dividing East Asia and have become even more aggressive. They have even colluded with elements in Chongqing to participate in the so-called Anglo-American front, sending troops to Myanmar and India to make East Asians kill each other. Recently, because their forces have been successively defeated by the friendly Japanese army, navy, and air force, and the bases for aggression in East Asia have also been lost, they have become more cunning. They are also jealous of the peaceful development of the areas under the rule of the National Government, and they have incited elements in Chongqing to constantly harass us in order to hinder the progress of various constructions, and they have even used their own aircraft, based in Chongqing, to repeatedly bomb Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. The elements in Chongqing, who are willing to be driven by the United Kingdom and the United States and become traitors to East Asia, are indeed shameful. However, the United Kingdom and the United States have been scheming against East Asia for a long time, doing their best to sow discord in order to achieve their ultimate desire for annexation. This is something that the East Asian nations should hate together. The National Government hereby declares that from today onwards, it is in a state of war with the United Kingdom and the United States. It will do its best to cooperate with the friendly nation of Japan to eliminate the brutality of the United Kingdom and the United States in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The countries of Manchukuo and Thailand have always maintained good relations and have the same heart for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In the future, we will work together to build a new East Asian order based on morality. The allied nations of Germany and Italy have been dealing with the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States in the West for many years and have repeatedly won glorious victories. Our country is now participating in the Greater East Asia War and will echo each other in order to make a contribution to the just new order of the entire world. All our citizens should know that this is the only opportunity to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Greater Asianism. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the attainment of faith, peace in the entire world, depend on this. Let us work together with one heart and one mind to carry out the great mission of this great era!

January 9, 1942, Chairman, Wang Zhaoming

### Eastern Front Summer Offensive: Focus Shifts South; Fierce Fighting Continues in the Northern Wing of the Central Route

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: The characteristic of the Eastern Front battles on Thursday was the southward spread of defensive battles. The Soviet army began operations in Kovel, Lutsk, and Ternopol, and its scope has exceeded the nature of the usual scout-type fragmented offensives. The operations west of Kovel and Lutsk advanced under the cover of a tank army brigade. A gap was broken through west of Lutsk, but was closed by a German counterattack. The Soviet command apparently wanted to expand its offensive to various areas of the southern front. The battles that occurred near Kovel, Lutsk, and Ternopol are probably the first step in this trend. The defensive battles in the central route are still concentrated in the old focal points, and the battle for the Baranavichy isthmus southeast of Vilnius and northwest of Lake Neroch is particularly fierce. The German defenders are concentrated on the eastern border of the city, and the Soviet army has repeatedly attempted to launch a flanking encirclement strategy, but was blocked by the German army. The battle south of Slutsk is particularly fierce, and the German line retreated to the forest area near Khotsyn. Fierce fighting also took place near Smolyany on Thursday. The Soviet army attempted to break through under the cover of motorized formations, but was repulsed. Two German bridgeheads on the south bank of the Dvina River were abandoned. The Soviet army repeatedly attempted to defeat the German positions north and northwest of Polotsk with concentrated riflemen and tank army formations, but the results collapsed under the German defensive artillery fire.

### US Aircraft Launch Large-Scale Attack on Germany, 77 Shot Down

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities announced that US heavy bombers, escorted by a strong fighter fleet, attacked central and southeastern Germany on the morning of the 7th. As a result of the air battle, 77 US aircraft were shot down.

### 17,000 Killed in French Air Raids Last Month

Paris, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: A total of 17,233 people in France were killed in air raids last month.

### Two More German Generals Sacrifice for Their Country

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a Haitong News Agency report: On June 23, the day General Dietl died in a plane crash in Finland, two other German generals also passed away on the same day. German newspapers announced last night that German Infantry General Wigot and Mountain Infantry General Egerqi died in an accident. General Wigot was famous for the Battle of the Dyansk Fortress, and General Egerqi was credited with fighting in the Caucasus Mountains. The details of the deaths of the two men are unknown.

### A Report on Mr. Chen Youren

— Li Weichen

Three

Now that Mr. Chen has passed away, the immediate matters to be dealt with are the funeral arrangements and burial. Because the handling of these two matters is related to Mr. Chen's wishes and will, I should also briefly report on the process and disclose his will.

Half an hour after Mr. Chen's death, we discussed his funeral arrangements in his study. At that time, there was a proposal to temporarily place Mr. Chen's remains in Shanghai, and after the war, move them to Wuhan, which would permanently symbolize his involvement in the war, his meritorious service, and the lively and creative era of the Chinese revolution. But Madam Chen did not agree. She calmly said to us: "My husband often told me that if he died, I should cremate his body, without extravagance, without erecting a monument, and scatter his ashes in the ocean, into the vast emptiness." She also told us: The funeral should be based on her husband's simple and unadorned habits during his lifetime, and the burial clothes should be the same blue robe that he usually wore and that his friends were familiar with. The appearance of the deceased should not be altered, the cremation should be held as soon as possible, and all customary rituals should be avoided. All flower wreaths and elegiac couplets should be declined. We had to follow Madam Chen's opinion. According to this will, everyone discussed until about four o'clock before dispersing, with only Ms. Zhang Yunying staying to accompany Madam Chen. I silently sat alone in the study.

Around five ten, Mr. Chen Fumu, a friend who did not often meet Mr. Chen but always appeared in times of trouble, rushed over. He lingered and looked at the deceased's face for a long time, shaking his head, unable to say anything, only expressing his willingness to help with everything and provide his car for funeral use. In today's lack of transportation, this is rare.

Originally, it was agreed to send the body to the funeral home around six o'clock, but Madam Chen ordered to delay it a little longer, and then, in tears, stood in front of the couch and drew a final sketch of her husband. The scene at that time and her state of mind cannot be described with words. Please forgive me for not being able to depict it.

About ten minutes later, Mr. Chen Fumu and I took a carriage in the faint morning light, with the wind whistling and the rain drizzling, and accompanied Mr. Chen's body to the International Funeral Home.

Around nine o'clock, Mr. Yan Junren and Mr. Ze Hanliang both came to the funeral home and gave a lot of guidance on everything. It was at that time that it was decided to hold the simplest ceremony at the Jing'an Temple Auditorium at three o'clock on the afternoon of the 22nd, followed by cremation.

Around ten fifteen, Madam Chen arrived. Many friends also came and sincerely expressed their willingness to help. Because the cremation procedure requires the court to examine the body first, and that day was Saturday, and the court did not usually work in the afternoon. Fortunately, Mr. Chen Binhe enthusiastically ran around and pleaded with the court to send someone to inspect it immediately, otherwise, I am afraid that the cremation on the 22nd would not be in time. The ceremony held on the 22nd has been recorded in various newspapers, so I don't need to report it in detail. I can only say that this ceremony was extremely simple. Dr. Huang Hanxiang announced the start of the ceremony, and Dr. Yan Junren gave a brief eulogy. It goes without saying that Mr. Yan's words were moving. From his experience of 33 years of friendship, he very humbly, fairly, and appropriately spoke about Mr. Chen's knowledge, ambition, and especially emphasized his spirit of loving the country. If I were to strictly analyze Mr. Yan's entire eulogy in detail, the only thing I could disagree with is one sentence. This point will be reserved for later when explaining Mr. Chen's words, actions, and thoughts.

In addition, those who came to pay their respects on that day included not only Mr. Chen's friends but also people from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign. General Kawamoto, the Japanese Shanghai Army Commander, also came in person to pay his respects and expressed his condolences to Madam Chen, saying that if there were any difficulties, he would provide convenience as much as possible. This kind of sincere sympathy is a moral principle that cannot be ignored. In addition, a German consultant who was once prominent under General Chiang Kai-shek and several Soviet and French writers also came to pay their last respects.

But the most moving thing was an old woman from the countryside. She came staggering before the ceremony, bowed her hands together to the coffin, and then quietly left. Another was a former soldier who had seen Mr. Chen in some occasions. He actually ran from Suzhou that day and asked me to give him "errands." Later, I gave him money for food, but he firmly refused and said to me: "Little brother, I respect Minister Chen. If I take money for food, it is not respect." After Mr. Chen passed away, I had no tears, but the earnestness and moving attitude of this former soldier made me unable to restrain myself, and my tears welled up in my eyes.

There was also a Japanese soldier. During the ceremony, he actually started to cry and sobbed uncontrollably. If there had been music that day, it would not have been surprising to see tears, but there was none that day. He had no acquaintance with Mr. Chen, so of course there was no relationship to speak of. He was probably a young Japanese intellectual. How touching were his tears that transcended national borders and the atmosphere of war!

Finally, the grief revealed by the young people when they paid their respects to the deceased was an emotional and rational grief. They represent the young generation of China. I want to say to them: Mr. Chen has always been looking forward to you, and he is still looking forward to you, the young people of China!

Many friends were concerned about the funeral expenses because Mr. Chen had always been honest and self-disciplined. I must state here that this time, because the person in charge of the funeral home admired Mr. Chen's personality, they were particularly polite. The cremation and all expenses only cost 25,000 yuan. Therefore, the total funeral expenses did not exceed 30,000 yuan. I must also state that although the generous gifts sent by friends were well-intentioned, most of them were returned. This is how I had to handle it based on my understanding of Mr. Chen. If this offends anyone, I am sorry.

The report on the funeral is now at an end.

Now I should report on Mr. Chen's will. As mentioned above, Mr. Chen's will was to "scatter his ashes in the ocean, returning them to the vast emptiness," but after the will was found, it was learned that Mr. Chen had made some revisions to this point. He advocated that his ashes be "scattered in China's great rivers or along the coast," he was forever nostalgic for his motherland! He will always protect China's rivers and seas.

The following is a translation of the will:

"This is my last will and testament. My name is Chen Youren, also known as Eugene Chen; my wife's name is Chen Liying or Chen Zhang Liying, also known as Georgette Chen. All that I currently own or will own in the future, or own at the time of my death, regardless of the type or nature of the property or personal belongings, I hereby grant, bequeath, and devise entirely to my wife.

"I declare as follows: Only my wife may represent me in using my name and speaking on my behalf; only my wife may make statements, deny, or refute anything that belongs to or concerns me, and that pertains to my reputation and name; my wife has full power to dispose of my body in any manner and method she deems appropriate, including cremating my body and scattering my ashes in China's great rivers or along the coast.

"I also declare: I am purely Chinese. Both my father and mother were registered in Guangdong. I also want everyone to know that I reject and do not recognize any kinship or family relationship with anyone, male or female, who is not of pure Chinese blood. If anyone dares to object, I hereby entrust my wife to uphold my original intention. If my wife takes any action or lawsuit for this purpose, I earnestly request all my friends, whether Chinese or other people of yellow race, to assist and support my wife. Established in Shanghai on November 26, 1942, Chen Youren (Eugene Chen)."

This is Mr. Chen's will, and it is of course completely different in nature from the will he dictated to me at the Hong Kong Hotel as mentioned above. That will does not need to be disclosed now and can only be locked deep in my heart for my appreciation and as a clear mirror for me to refer to when I encounter difficulties.

Regarding the will published above, I should also make some clarifications.

One: The original will is in English. English legal documents do not seek to be detailed but to be clear. Therefore, many words and phrases with seemingly repetitive meanings but with slight differences are used. When I translated it, I had to follow the style of the original text, hoping to preserve the original appearance, but the conciseness of the original wording and the beauty of the sentences are beyond my translation.

Two: Mr. Chen clearly stated in his will that only his wife can represent him, use his name, and speak on his behalf. I would like to draw the attention of those who are now falsely using Mr. Chen's name to engage in activities, claiming to implement the so-called "brilliant strategies to manage the current situation and govern the country."

Three: Mr. Chen solemnly declared in his will that he is purely Chinese, and there is a reason for this. Because Mr. Chen felt that his Mandarin was not sufficient to convey complex thoughts, he often used English. This is undeniably the greatest weakness of his life. Because of this weakness, his opponents slandered him, saying that he was of mixed blood and not purely Chinese. During the Wuhan era when he vehemently spoke on behalf of Chinese nationalism, this slander was most prevalent and often appeared in British magazines and newspapers. Even in John Gunther's "Inside Asia" a few years ago, this malicious but meaningless slander continued. Gunther may have had no other intention but was probably fooled by [William Henry] Donald. "One dog barks, and a hundred dogs follow," and human nature and reason have not yet transcended this stage, which is a pity. Mr. Chen's ancestral home is Shunde, Guangdong. His mother was registered in Panyu, Guangdong. At the age of eight, she fled overseas with her parents due to the failure of the Taiping Rebellion. She is now over ninety years old, and communication has been cut off due to the war. I hope she is still alive. Mr. Chen's father also fled overseas due to the collapse of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Therefore, in terms of bloodline, what flows in Mr. Chen's veins is not only the blood of a purely Chinese person but also the hot blood of a Chinese nationalist and revolutionary. His revolutionary character and revolutionary passion can be said to be "in his blood" and are by no means accidental.

Four: In the last paragraph of his will, Mr. Chen declared that he would reject and not recognize any kinship or family relationship with people of non-purely Chinese blood. This decision was well known to Mr. Chen's friends. In his replies to friends' letters, he had repeatedly stated this very clearly. Six years ago, because a related relative falsely used his name for political activities, he also reported this to the relevant military and political authorities twice, making solemn declarations. Five years ago, he also publicly published a similar statement in the Hong Kong English-language South China Morning Post for this matter. Mr. Chen's attitude towards people and things is unambiguous, and this is one example. (To be continued)

### Today's Air Defense Day Training: Traffic and Sound Control; Strict Nighttime Light Control

Today (the 9th) is the seventh Air Defense Day. The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters has stipulated that various air defense drills will be held, and citizens must follow the regulations of the air defense authorities and implement them effectively.

Pay Attention to Traffic and Sound Control

Special attention should be paid to traffic and sound control. After the first and second alerts are issued, all vehicles must park in places that do not obstruct traffic, and pedestrians should immediately wait quietly on both sides of the street in an orderly manner. Traffic can only begin five minutes after the vehicles and pedestrians are arranged. Except in unavoidable circumstances, cars and other vehicles must absolutely not honk their horns arbitrarily. At the same time, with the assistance of the military and police, the department will dispatch special enforcement teams to check the sound devices and light covers of various motor vehicles. If there are any imperfections, they will be rectified. After the third alarm is issued, in addition to implementing the same training as in the first and second alerts, light control must be strictly implemented. Citizens must absolutely pay attention to avoiding light leakage. Even when using flashlights, they must cover them with blackout cloth or paper, to thoroughly implement various traffic and light controls.

Each District Holds Separate Drills

In addition, various air defense drills will be held in various districts of the city today. The special defense groups of factories and large businesses will also separately carry out rescue, firefighting, and extinguishing exercises. In order to make all city defense personnel proficient in various city defense measures and prevent the occurrence of any emergencies. The first district's Baojia self-defense force and the general headquarters, in cooperation to complete the air defense wall of Greater Shanghai, will conduct traffic and sound control training from 10:00 AM to 10:30 AM and from 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM today. Light control will be implemented from 9:00 PM to 10:30 PM. The air defense headquarters of the First Police Bureau has ordered the self-defense forces of Nanshi and the Baojia personnel in the entire district to strictly comply with all points indicated by the Army and Navy Defense Headquarters, in order to improve the air defense measures in the district. At the same time, strict enforcement will be carried out for nighttime vehicle light control.

Air Defense Songs Recorded into Records

The Shanghai Special City Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters previously offered a reward in this newspaper to solicit lyrics for citizen-composed city defense songs, in order to promote the air defense will of the five million citizens of Shanghai and strengthen Shanghai's determination to defend itself. The lyrics written by Jin Yugu, the first-class winner, have been commissioned by the composer Shen Le Yin to set to music. The Asian Record Manufacturing Factory has produced a record called the Greater Shanghai Air Defense Song, with the issue number 1009, which is scheduled to be released within days. The melody reveals the heroic spirit of the German nation, which inspires people to rise up. In order to help popularize the air defense song, the China Music Industry Co., Ltd. has also commissioned its composition department to set the lyrics to a popular song and invited Ms. Li Xianglan to record it. The test record has been completed and is scheduled to be produced and sold at the end of this month.

The air defense song will be broadcast on the radio starting from the morning of the 9th of this month to entertain the citizens. In addition, the first episode of the air defense film being produced by the China Film Culture Production Factory will be completed in mid-month. At that time, a simultaneous screening and singing conference of the air defense film and the air defense song will be held. The Air Defense Headquarters will do its utmost to make the air defense song penetrate the people, so that the air defense will can be naturally promoted and achieve great results. It is hoped that all sectors will do their best to assist in achieving this.

### The Second Police Bureau Captures a Major Bandit

Recently, the guerrilla bandit teams in the suburbs of the city, under the instigation of Chongqing, have been constantly stirring up trouble and plotting wrongdoing. The Director of the Second Medical Inspection Bureau of the city is paying close attention to this and has instructed Gao Zu and others stationed in the suburban areas of the city to maintain close contact and intensify prevention and control measures. On the 30th of last month, Chai Enyuan, the captain of the third brigade of the police corps stationed in Beixinjing by the bureau, received a confidential report that two companies of bandits were discovered near Yufubridge on the Lianshi Highway. He bypassed the Chengjiaqiao Seventh Bridge from the Liushi Highway to surround and search. At the Sixth Bridge, he divided into two routes to surround Yufubridge, immediately sealed off the area for inspection, and arrested Gu Runzhi, the action team leader of the Chongqing-based Zhejiang-Suzhou Provincial Third Administrative Inspector's Office Anti-Weapons Brigade, and Lieutenant Adjutant Wang Duanlin. Two Mauser pistols were found on the suspects. After the team sent them to the Second Police Bureau, the bureau chief immediately ordered the Special High Section of the bureau to conduct a thorough interrogation and try to capture the remaining members of the gang. On the 6th of this month, Yao Guomei, also known as Wang Shuying, the cousin of the suspect Gu, went to the bureau's detention center to visit him. The detention center reported this to the Special High Section, which temporarily detained her for questioning. According to Yao Guomei's confession, the murder of Supervisor Cha Zizhou of the Fourth District Office on Hongqiao Road on May 1st of this year was entirely planned by Gu Runzhi, who instigated his gang to attack A Zheng (that is, A Zheng), and committed crimes such as kidnapping and extortion. After the bureau interrogated the suspect Gu, he confessed to everything. It was also revealed that on June 15th, bandits robbed Zhou Wang's 32,520 yuan of goods and three bicycles belonging to French soldiers in Caohejing, and kidnapped Chu Gentao, a velvet merchant from Tushan, extorting 200,000 yuan. It is reported that Director Lu is currently unaware of the whereabouts of the fugitive assailant, A Zheng, and has instructed his subordinates to cooperate in the search and to continue to strengthen investigations and collect clues, so that all the fugitive bandits can be caught.

### Various Schools Prepare to Organize Group Rice Purchases

Due to the recent surge in rice prices, especially for the general education community, which has always lived a very difficult life, it is even more difficult to support themselves under the current situation. The Municipal Education Association initiated a method for member schools to purchase rice collectively and established regulations. A meeting of affiliated schools at all levels was convened at the association's headquarters at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss specific implementation methods. More than 30 principals from schools such as Zhengfeng Middle School attended the meeting, chaired by Zhou Huarin, a standing director, who reported on the motives for the initiation. The collective rice purchase regulations were then passed on the spot as follows:

(1) Due to the recent surge in rice prices, the lives of teachers and staff are becoming increasingly difficult. If there are no emergency relief measures, it will inevitably interrupt the singing and have a profound impact on national education. Therefore, the Shanghai Special City Education Association Member School Collective Rice Purchase Committee is specially organized.

One: The committee will have 31 members, elected by the meetings of participating schools.

One: Committee members will be unpaid, and they will be elected every six months, with the possibility of re-election.

One: The committee plans to designate Wuxi, Suzhou, Taicang, Qingpu, Wanshan, and other producing areas as the purchasing scope.

One: The regulations for applying to participate in the collective rice purchase are as follows:

(A) Applications for participation are limited to teachers and staff, and the number of people is divided into four categories: A (30 or more people), B (20 to 30 people), C (10 to 20 people), and D (5 to 10 people). (B) The amount of rice to be applied for by teachers and staff is limited to 1.5 shi per person per semester. If the amount is insufficient, the distribution may be reduced. (C) The amount of rice to be purchased by the applicant schools must first pay 60% of the approximate price of the rice. (D) The insufficient amount will be borrowed from the bank by the committee, and the interest and difficult printing costs will be shared by the applicant schools. (E) The applicant schools must provide their own rice sacks, which will be returned when the rice is issued. (F) After receiving the notice of rice issuance from the committee, the applicant schools must go to the designated location to collect the rice on time. (G) If the market price fluctuates, and if the rice is not collected after the notice is given, the committee has the right to reallocate it to other schools, and any losses incurred as a result shall be borne by the original applicant school.

One: The committee's address is specially set at 5 Dihua Road.

One: The committee's regulations will be implemented after being approved by the committee meeting.

One: If there are any imperfections in these regulations, they must be amended with the approval of more than half of the committee members.

### City Residents' Park Lecture Meeting Held Enthusiastically Last Night; President Jiang of the Central Naval Academy Gave the Main Speech

The Shanghai News Association, in order to deepen the understanding of the current war situation in the Pacific among all citizens and strengthen their belief in victory, held a city residents' park lecture meeting yesterday (August 8th) at 7:00 PM at the Harding Garden on Jing'an Temple Road. They specially invited Lieutenant General Jiang Xiyuan, President of the Central Naval Academy, to give a difficult speech. Citizens from all walks of life in the city rushed to the medical details in large numbers, which was quite unique. There were also movie stars singing famous songs and screening movies to add to the entertainment. The situation was very enthusiastic before the start. The details are recorded as follows:

Grand Occasion of the Meeting

The venue for the City Residents' Park Lecture Meeting was set up in the central square of Harding Garden. The First Police Bureau's band specially played music on the spot. China Film Company also sent personnel to shoot newsreels of the meeting. President Meng, along with his colleagues, arrived at the meeting on time. Also present were Captain Hirata of the Allied Forces Press Reporting Department, Trustee Lin, and prominent figures from industry and commerce, Chen Juntatsushiro, Chen Shaodi, as well as the association's executive directors Xu Liqiu, Chen Binhe, Lu Guangjie, Weng Yongqing, Lu Feng, Zhu Yongkang, Cheng Zhongquan, and Executive Secretary Ren Yunpeng, among others. No less than several thousand citizens listened to the lecture, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. The meeting was opened by Xu Liqiu, the chairman of the board of directors for the month, who said: "At this crucial stage of the Greater East Asia War, the news from the front lines has been reported in various newspapers. In order to strengthen our belief in victory, we are holding this park lecture meeting today and have invited President Meng to give a speech. The President has devoted himself to cultivating Chinese naval talents over the years. Therefore, after listening to President Meng's speech today, I believe everyone's belief in the current war situation will be further strengthened, and the final victory of the Greater East Asia War is imminent." Finally, he expressed his infinite gratitude to the military authorities for assisting in maintaining order at the meeting and to the various departments that participated. Then, President Meng was invited to give a speech, first providing a detailed analysis of the current war situation in the Pacific and expressing his deep hope that the Chinese people would strengthen their belief and work together to complete the Greater East Asia War, and so on. Afterwards, there were singing performances and the screening of the China Film Company's epic film "Phoenixes Singing in Harmony." The gathering ended joyfully at 10:30 PM.

Jiang's Speech

Jiang Xiyuan, President of the Central Military Academy, spoke, saying briefly: "Today, I am grateful for the invitation from the News Association to explain the current situation of the Pacific war to everyone. I cannot refuse this brotherly duty. At this critical period of the Pacific decisive battle, what kind of determination should we have? Since June 11th, in the (lonely) Pacific, we have taken the opportunity to launch an attack. After the enemy's island-hopping strategy failed, they advanced to a central assault, hoping to threaten the Allied mainland in the Pacific or seize Southeast Asia. However, with no progress in Southeast Asia, they resorted to their tricks, adopting a central breakthrough towards the Mariana Islands and the Ogasawara Islands. These methods are not worthy of being called by the brave Allied soldiers. The enemy's American tactics will definitely fail to manifest. Therefore, our judgment of the war situation should be based on the overall situation and not on small-scale speculation. The enemy's lucky dreams will inevitably lead to failure and nothing to gain. Now, our observation of the future war situation is that, during the current operational phase, there is no clear victory or defeat. Once the regular war begins, the remnants of the enemy will be defeated and scattered in chaos. Secondly, the enemy's use of a small corner to threaten Japan is practically impossible. Moreover, they are attacking Japan's inner defense line, and they feel the difficulty of a distant supply line. The future of the American enemy will be even darker. The enemy's previous island-hopping strategy in the Pacific has resulted in broken legs and arms, suffering serious injuries. Now, they have lost more than forty changes in their battle plan for Saipan Island, and their aircraft have reached six or seven hundred. Therefore, after further fierce attacks by the brave Allied soldiers, they should be completely collapsed. The enemy's own efforts are not the best. Using a small island and exhausting a large number of weapons is not something a wise person would do. The enemy's attempt this time is nothing more than to ease domestic public opinion and save people's hearts. The fighting in the Allied Japan has always followed the immortal spirit of Marshal Togo, waiting for work in leisure, and will be fully demonstrated in the upcoming regular war. It is clear that the enemy still does not realize its mistake, but its morale is declining. At the same time, the enemy's American's inner anxiety is due to the fact that the climate in the Pacific after July and August will change drastically. At that time, hurricanes will erupt, and the pitifully educated enemy's navy will hardly be able to endure the hardships of the wind and waves. Only the Allied soldiers are well-trained and able to cope with the financial situation. Therefore, geographically, it is another example of the enemy's failure. Therefore, we must not stand by and watch during the current stage of fierce fighting. It is unacceptable to stand idly by during the process of participation in the war. When the last World War ended, why did our country not gain benefits despite declaring victory? Therefore, we must make redoubled efforts this time and reflect on past mistakes. The military should deeply understand that the Greater East Asia War is a shared hardship for the people of East Asia and cannot be shirked. Therefore, the government's participation in the war has far-reaching implications. In the past, there were disputes between China and Japan, which were tragically separated by foreigners. Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, under the determination of one nation, we have jointly resisted foreign aggression. Therefore, we should endure hardship and work hard, cooperate with each other for the future of China and Japan, and drive out the aggressive forces of Europe and the United States."

### Uniform Implementation of Buying Rice for Five Dou; The Emblem Lecture Issuance Office Received Orders to Start Yesterday

The temporary permit issuing offices of the Rice and Grain Control Committee received a letter from the Inspection Office of the committee on July 6th, 33rd year of the Republic stating, "According to the Secretary-General's instructions, all temporary permit issuing offices must also requisition those applying for temporary certificates for five dou or more, and so on. Therefore, this is hereby notified." After receiving the order, the temporary permit issuing offices, in addition to posting notices for public knowledge, began to implement the uniform requisitioning starting on July 7th.

Brief Commentary

### Can We Still Ignore and Disregard It?

The Rice Control Committee has been implementing the requisitioning of rice and grain for households with five dou or more since July 1st, and since the 7th, those with five dou have also been uniformly requisitioned. We have already spoken about the shortcomings of the requisitioning method in the editorial of the 7th based on statistics. The public opinion of various newspapers in Tai City has also unanimously suggested solutions to the rice and grain problem, but the speakers are earnest, and the listeners are indifferent. The Rice Control Committee authorities have failed to pay attention to public sentiment and public opinion, insisting on their own way, making the food problem increasingly serious, which is regrettable.

The matter of concealment can be seen from the poor results, and it is clear that problems are arising. In fact, the situation is restrictive, but they insist on adhering to their own views, putting people's livelihood at risk. How can they explain themselves? We believe that the soaring price of grain and the heavy suffering of the people's livelihood are the absolute responsibility of the Rice Control Committee. Since the Commercial Control Committee has been adjusted to be the supervisory and guiding organ of the Rice Control Committee, the Commercial Control Committee has the responsibility to correct the unreasonable measures of the Rice Control Committee and cannot shirk its responsibility. The Shanghai Municipal Government authorities are the parents of all the citizens, and the municipal government also has the responsibility to correct the serious suffering of the people's livelihood due to unreasonable rice and grain measures and should not allow them to act arbitrarily. At the same time, the Allied authorities have been concerned about the people's livelihood in China, and the current food problem in Shanghai has reached a serious life-and-death issue. It is expected that the Allied authorities will not sit idly by.

Finally, we want to ask, to which organization does the Rice Control Committee belong? Should the superior organization exercise its supervisory and corrective functions? Now, whether it is any individual, any family, any public or private institution or organization, who is not anxious and uneasy about the issue of rice? Since the Rice Control Committee can insist on its own views, disregard the people's livelihood, and disregard public sentiment. However, the severity of the people's food has reached such a point, can the Commercial Control Committee and the Municipal Government district bureaus also disregard and not address the increasing suffering of the people's livelihood?

### Insights on Air Defense

— Aichiro Fujiyama

The European landing invasion war has finally begun. The Allied German forces are very welcoming of the Anglo-American landing operation, and the whole country is sharpening its swords and entering the decisive battle stage. We are also looking forward to the American Pacific invasion operation, hoping to have the opportunity to give them a head-on blow. Since last year, the increase in aircraft and ships required by the whole country has been my personal preparation. Now, all levels of society, regardless of old or young, male or female, should devote all their efforts to the production increase movement within their respective areas of responsibility. This is the only element of victory for us in dealing with the materially abundant United States. The decisive battle stage is approaching day by day, and enemy aircraft raids will surely materialize. We should be fully prepared for the sake of perfection. The large-scale air raids on Hamburg and Berlin since last winter have given us very good lessons.

The purpose of air warfare is to disrupt people's minds by using urban air raids, and at the same time, to destroy production facilities, thereby reducing the enemy's combat power.

If port facilities and bridges are destroyed, transportation capacity will inevitably be reduced, which will inevitably affect production. At the same time, if factory towers are destroyed, it will directly affect the country's fertility. This is what the enemy hopes for.

In the past, the people responded calmly and overcame various difficulties. Under the bombing of groups of five hundred or one thousand enemy aircraft, the German people were able to responsibly defend their country and prevent the erosion of productive forces. Not only did they prevent the decline of productive forces, but they also continued to work hard to increase production under fierce air strikes. Therefore, Germany still has the surplus to fight against the Anglo-American landing forces.

In Japan, we also anticipate the arrival of air raids, so we are either working on evacuation or air defense training. No matter when the enemy aircraft come, we are preparing at all times. The government's enthusiastic guidance and the tense awareness of the nationals themselves have made every national deeply feel the importance of air defense. Therefore, the evacuation work is progressing very smoothly, and training is uninterrupted. The work of defending the soil is becoming stronger day by day, which is gratifying.

However, this cannot make us fully satisfied. The current air defense system cannot make us absolutely at ease.

In the past, our country's air defense strategy focused on controlling lights or other disguises to avoid enemy aircraft bombing as much as possible, minimizing casualties, and at the same time, using fire training to prevent the expansion of the damaged area. In the past, the training of the people has achieved considerable results in the above points.

However, does this kind of air defense strategy fundamentally ignore the most important work in air defense?

Judging from the current war situation, the most important work is how to quickly restore the destroyed productive forces so that productive forces do not decline due to air raids; at the same time, how to restore the destroyed transportation capacity so that it can still transport production materials and maintain the people's food supply in an instant. As for communication equipment, it must also be restored immediately so that production work is not affected in the slightest.

In Germany, the people's production activities were completely restored within a few days after the air raid. However, although the German production sector has been subjected to such large-scale air raids, it is still prepared to recover quickly, preventing the decline of productive forces to a minimum.

Under today's circumstances, officials and civilians should work together to seriously study how to restore and quickly rebuild the damaged areas, so that all preparations can be perfect. Therefore, training and exercises are very necessary.

To rebuild a destroyed factory, how to mobilize the necessary workers, how to concentrate a large number of materials? At the same time, if the damaged factory is moved to another location, how should it be handled to increase productivity? If these many questions are not fully prepared now, it will inevitably lead to panic and helplessness in the future.

In order to quickly restore damaged factories, it may be necessary to remove part of the walls of neighboring production companies. Therefore, various laws and regulations must also be appropriately prepared. As for the movement or concentration of workers, if it is still based on the old concepts, good results cannot be obtained.

The sections related to production problems are extremely broad, not just material and labor issues, but even transportation, food, and finance must echo each other and establish a detailed plan. If the communication and communication links under the air raid lose their function, the transmission of various management policies cannot proceed smoothly, and it will only lead to a state of confusion. At the same time, it will affect the unrest and shaking of the entire economic world. If people's hearts are unstable, the decline in production efficiency will be unspeakable.

The establishment of a plan is indeed difficult, but the more difficult it is, the more we should have the courage to deal with everything. In the call to increase aircraft and ships, this kind of countermeasure must be fully prepared. When the government is examining major issues, it must start from now to make full preparations; at the same time, in the private sector, the Tongzhi Council should be used as the center to fully develop appropriate solutions to various problems. Especially for production problems, if they are divorced from reality, various laws and orders are just empty words.

On the other hand, the private sector must also consider countermeasures at the same time. If the opinions of various industries do not sweep away past prejudices, the important responsibility of restarting production will not be able to be promoted.

This is the most important air defense countermeasure, the most important countermeasure against air raids to carry out the war.

The two major elements of air defense are: maintaining the damage to a minimum, and having various preparations so that damaged factories can be quickly restored. If these two points can be completed, the purpose of air defense countermeasures can be said to have been achieved. (Translated from the June 11th Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun)

### Who is Misleading the Nation? - Information Department Chief of the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai

— Tadahisa Matsudaira

Seven years have passed since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, and two and a half years have passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Now, the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia are facing a stage that will determine their destiny.

I have no intention of arguing about who is responsible for this war, but calmly observing the relationship between China and Japan over the past ten years or so, which has led the destinies of the two countries to misfortune, there are indeed reasons for this. Moreover, it is possible to reverse the fact that a portion of future world wars – the Anglo-Japanese War and the Japanese-American War – will rage even more fiercely on Chinese territory, and there are also reasons for the increasing difficulties of the Republic of China. Now, I will elaborate on my humble opinion based on past fair history (part of which is not yet public).

Who made Britain and the United States join the disputes in East Asia?

The historical turning point in East Asia began with the Incident, but Japan advocated: 1) a policy of non-expansion; 2) direct negotiations. At that time, the Chinese National Government initially expressed agreement with Japan's proposal. Ambassador Ariyoshi began consultations with T.V. Soong, but on the third day, T.V. Soong suddenly changed his mind and informed Japan that China would bring the Manchurian Incident to the League of Nations. In the spring of that year, Wang Jingwei, Sun Fo, Gu Yingfen, Tang Shaoyi, Chen Youren, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Chen Jitang, Tang Shengzhi, and others gathered in Guangzhou to convene an extraordinary meeting and establish a National Government opposed to Chiang Kai-shek. The Guangzhou National Government advocated direct negotiations. When Chen Youren and Sun Fo proposed preparing various basic conditions for formal direct negotiations with Japan, I was present and clearly felt the expressions of Sun Fo and the complexion of Chen Youren. However, Japan had recognized the Nanjing National Government but not the Guangzhou government, so it proceeded according to the opinions of T.V. Soong and others. Representatives of the Chinese and Japanese, yellow races, stood before the white races in the League of Nations and were questioned. The intervention of Britain and the United States in East Asian affairs became more and more assertive.

Exposing the Conspiracy of the People's Front Faction

Before the Xi'an Incident occurred, Yang Yongtai, Chairman of Hubei Province, was suddenly assassinated. At that time, I was working in Hankou and had the last meeting with this senior member of the Political Science faction before his death. When Mr. Yang was carried to Tongren Hospital, I immediately went to comfort him. At that time, He Chengjun was already there, earnestly comforting Mrs. Yang, who was crying in pain. Yang Yongtai was attacked by the People's Front faction on his way home after attending a luncheon with the American Consul General. Before this incident, many ominous events occurred between China and Japan, such as the Chengdu Incident, the murder of Mr. Nakano, a Japanese resident in Beihai, and the assassination of patrolman Kichi in Hankou, all of the same nature, which were only discovered later. Subsequently, the murderer who assassinated Yang Yongtai was arrested. After further investigation of the party, it was learned that all the ominous events directed at the Japanese were the work of the Communist Party, which claimed to be the People's Front faction. Their conspiracy attempted to provoke disputes between China and Japan, assassinate anti-communist elements, and even target Chiang Kai-shek himself. According to He Chengjun, the Communist Party had a plan to send special personnel to infiltrate the sedan bearers used when Chiang climbed Lushan, attempting to poison him in the valley while Chiang Kai-shek was climbing Lushan. It was also learned that Zhang Xueliang and the Seven Gentlemen of Shanghai were in contact with each other, and many of his subordinates were communist elements. After Chiang Kai-shek spent his fiftieth birthday in Luoyang, he intended to inspect Zhang Xueliang's communist suppression troops, but Chen Cheng went to Luoyang in advance to report the Communist Party's conspiracy and tried his best to lure Chiang to Xi'an. However, Chiang did not care and was detained in Xi'an, which made a 180-degree turn in Chinese history.

The Mystery of the End of the Xi'an Incident

After the Xi'an Incident occurred, He Yingqin and others in Nanjing advocated attacking Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng, even if the attack would endanger Chiang Kai-shek's life. Most people thought that there was little hope that Chiang Kai-shek would return to Nanjing safely. However, at that time, I indirectly received surprising information from a Communist Party member, saying that Chiang Kai-shek could return to Nanjing within two weeks, or that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party could reach a compromise and that the policies of the National Government would undergo major changes. At that time, I thought that there was such a fact, and only laughed it off. However, not long after, Soong Mei-ling and T.V. Soong took the opportunity to go to Xi'an, and the war faction led by He Yingqin and others disappeared invisibly. Chiang Kai-shek also survived, and Zhang Xueliang and others followed and were instead placed under arrest. This kind of fact can be said to be extremely ridiculous. Chiang and Soong's "Xi'an Diary" does not mention a single word about the Communist Party's negotiations. How exactly did they get Chiang Kai-shek to survive with just one sentence is still a mystery. However, the subsequent changes in the situation were roughly the same as what the Communist Party member had said before.

Regarding the Restoration of Peace between China and Japan

Why was Chiang swayed by the opinions of other countries? After the Incident, Germany acted as an intermediary to start peace negotiations between China and Japan, which took place from the 27th to the beginning of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1938-1939). This is a well-known fact. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek's attitude, including his opinions on the peace conditions, was described in detail in Chairman Wang's "Give an Example" paper. The opinions of Bai Chongxi, Xu Yongchang, Tang Shengzhi, and others present were also described in detail in this paper.

Chiang Kai-shek said: "If there is no such clause, then this condition is not a condition for national subjugation, so even if we talk about peace, it doesn't matter." Bai, Xu, Tang, and others also expressed their agreement. However, Chiang later informed a certain country of the peace conditions, and Chiang listened to the opinions of that country and took action.

Why Chiang Kai-shek did this, whether he was encouraged by T.V. Soong and Soong Mei-ling, is also unknown. But in short, this is the same as the method of introducing the League of Nations in the Manchurian Incident, which only increases the voice of foreign countries in East Asia. This is definitely not an attitude that a government that flaunts independence and autonomy should take. Moreover, by allowing other countries to interfere in diplomacy, they are always in a subordinate position, and they have to follow the whims of other countries. Their national policies are swayed by other countries. Although they verbally claim to hope that the people will rise up, the result is to put them in the unfortunate situation of colonial people.

Why did Chongqing Declare War on Japan?

The China Incident can also be called a civil strife in the Greater East Asia War, and it is not the same as the war against Britain and the United States. Japan had not declared war on Chongqing, and even when Japan declared war on Britain and the United States, it still had not declared war on Chongqing, because the relationship between China and Japan was not like a quarrel between partners, but a dispute between brothers within the walls.

However, Chongqing immediately declared war on Japan after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. It had not declared war for more than four years in the past, and after four and a half years, it declared war again. What is the reason for this? I think it is only due to the pressure from Britain and the United States.

What will happen if Chongqing declares war on Japan? This means that a world war can be conducted on the Chinese mainland. In other words, Britain and the United States do not have to notify Chongqing and can freely use Chongqing's territory as a base of operations. Chongqing cannot refuse Chongqing's territory to become a battlefield for Japan's war against Britain and the United States. As a result, the Chinese people will suffer heavy losses. The mainland operations currently underway are, from Japan's perspective, unavoidable measures for self-defense, but for the Chinese people, it is truly regrettable. This kind of result has to be attributed to the Chongqing side's diplomatic policy mistakes, and most of the responsibility should be borne by them.

Conclusion: Who does not maintain the face of East Asians? Last year, someone came from Chongqing, and I asked him: "When you learned that the Japanese army destroyed the American navy in Pearl Harbor and sank two British warships in the Malay Sea, what were your feelings?" He replied: "Most people in Chongqing felt happy, thinking that there was not a great difference between Britain and the United States and us." We also have the same feelings as the people in Chongqing, thinking that "blood is thicker than water" after all. Looking at the recent situation, there are many things that Chongqing has changed its policies under the pressure of Britain and the United States. To give one example, Britain and the United States said that the book "The Destiny of China" has totalitarian and xenophobic content, so it must be revised, or that the draft of the May Fifth Constitution does not conform to British and American democracy and must be revised and implemented as soon as possible, and even that Chongqing should listen to the claims of the Communist Party and show concessions. And the so-called "pro-American faction" such as T.V. Soong would rather sacrifice the people and follow Britain and the United States. I really don't know what their intentions are. When we look at the results of the Cairo Conference, Britain and the United States even raised the issue of Korea and Taiwan. At that time, an agreement was discussed that if this issue was not resolved, the war would continue forever. This was a malicious conspiracy to obstruct the progress of peace between China and Japan and to make China and Japan eternal enemies. However, Chongqing was extremely excited about the results of this meeting, unaware that they had been used by Britain and the United States. These people have lost their original East Asian face, and their nature has become slaves to Britain and the United States. Who is misleading the nation? Future generations of the Chinese nation will judge this, and history will prove it.

Social Services

### Blue Swastika Society Establishes a Plague Hospital in Tushanwan

The residents in the Xujiahui area of ​​western Shanghai mostly make a living by peddling, and they have never paid attention to hygiene. Therefore, every summer, plagues are prevalent, far more so than in other places. In the past, local gentry managed Chinese medicine clinics to provide diagnosis and medicine, which was convenient for the poor and sick. However, when encountering acute illnesses such as infectious diseases, they had to be sent to other places for treatment, which was quite difficult. Now, the Blue Swastika Society has agreed to establish a plague hospital, borrowing Chen's residence in Tushanwan Huinan Elementary School as a temporary hospital site, and appointing Dr. Zhang Xuecheng, the director of Xuhui Hospital, to preside over the hospital affairs. It will start accepting patients from today. The hospital will temporarily set up 40 beds, specializing in the treatment of cholera, vomiting, diarrhea, acute gastroenteritis, dysentery, etc., and also treating ordinary internal and surgical diseases. Whether it is outpatient or inpatient, it is completely free, and emergency treatment is available all night. However, due to the huge expenses and the urgent need for medical supplies, we urgently hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will generously donate, so that not only the remote residents of Xuhui will benefit greatly, but also the farmers in the nearby suburbs will receive endless benefits. If you would like to donate medicines (cash donations are declined), please call 75465 at Xuhui Hospital for contact, or send them directly to Huinan Elementary School, Chen's Residence.

### Navy

(This must be what the teacher made it.)

Longfu suddenly thought of this, and felt very ashamed, so he wanted to immediately run to Mr. Ichiki's house to apologize.

He quickly put on his clothes and went to wash his feet. In fact, it was as he had speculated.

"No, I originally wanted to send that painting to the Art Exhibition. But after careful consideration, a warship painting is slightly unsuitable for the Art Exhibition, and I am an examiner, so it is actually unfavorable to you."

The painter Ichiki seemed not to notice Longfu's indifference to the painting and his rudeness to his elders, and he did not boast about his deliberate order to 童隆夫 to send the painting for exhibition.

"Because you haven't come lately, I gave it to the exhibition without seeking your consent. Although it is not a famous exhibition, it is somewhat gratifying to have the award from the Minister of the Navy. It would be better to have a gold star award."

Longfu felt very 羞 when he heard such understated words. So he deeply appreciated the teacher's kindness.

"Why don't you take this opportunity to go back to your hometown? You can say that you are returning home in glory. Perhaps in Kagoshima Prefecture, you are the only one who has received a special selection from the Art Exhibition with the award from the Minister of the Navy. This will allow your father to no longer worry about you."

"Yes."

Longfu was very happy and accepted the advice.

After eating dinner at the painter's house that day, he happily returned to Koenji.

When he looked at the newspaper the next morning, his name was published in the corner of the social column as the winner of the Sea Country Exhibition. Even if many readers would gloss over this news, it appeared in Longfu's eyes like a monument.

(For the first time in my life, the world knows about me.)

Hot tears streamed from his eyes, and he wiped them away with his fingernails.

He didn't even eat breakfast and ran to the hall of the Nihonbashi Department Store. There were only two or three people. He ran to his painting and stood in front of it like a statue. His face was a little red, his feet were jumping, and he didn't feel like he was looking at the painting. After a while, he calmed down and the words "Minister's Award" came into view. He saw many shortcomings himself, and he should have painted it better. He didn't know that this was proof, that he had improved since he painted it half a year ago.

(If it were now, I wouldn't paint it like this.)

He expressed a sigh of loss, but when he discovered that the frame was the painter Ichiki's favorite, his heart was filled with gratitude. (114)
