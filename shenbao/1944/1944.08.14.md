### Organizations for Village Construction

Since the National Defense Conference passed the General Outline of Village Construction Plan on the 26th of last month, it seems that all parties are actively promoting it. The importance of villages is like the foundation of a house and the roots of a tree. Without first strengthening the villages, there is no way to talk about other constructions. Since the National Government moved its capital, it has been dealing with the aftermath of internal conflicts and coping with international affairs, so it is excusable that it has not been able to catch up with this. At this critical moment of impending decisive battle, the decision on this important matter demonstrates that the government has never forgotten the general outline of basic work despite its myriad responsibilities. However, due to its earnest expectations, I cannot help but offer heartfelt advice for the authorities to consider. Therefore, this newspaper's editorial on July 29th took this as its starting point, focusing on how to first eliminate the various factors that destroy villages. Now that the National Government has, based on the prior resolution of the National Defense Conference, established the Village Construction Implementation Committee and officially announced the organizational regulations, I will further analyze the administrative organization, hoping to contribute a small amount.

According to item three, section one, of the General Outline of the Plan, a Village Construction "Promotion" Committee should be established under the Executive Yuan. However, what was announced on the 7th was the organizational regulations of the Village Construction "Implementation" Committee, and Article 1 explicitly stipulates that it is directly under the Executive Yuan. It seems that the former is a tentative name, while the latter is the decided name, which seems to be beyond doubt.

If the only difference between the two is in the name, then the organizational principles must follow the regulations of the General Outline of the Plan. According to the General Outline of the Plan, the committee should have a vice-chairman and be composed of the ministers of the Ministries of Interior, Finance, Education, Industry, Propaganda, Construction, and Social Welfare, as well as the Director of the Health Bureau, the Governors of the provinces, the Mayors of special municipalities, the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, the Secretary-General of the National Economic Council, the Secretary-General of the New Life Movement Promotion Committee, and the Chairman of the Cooperative Enterprise Committee. However, the organizational regulations not only do not list a vice-chairman but also stipulate that there should only be seven to nine members. It seems that three standing committee members are to replace the vice-chairman. However, the number of members is too small to manage effectively. What is to become of the General Outline and the regulations? Perhaps the scope of the General Outline is too broad, and except for military and diplomatic affairs, its scale is so large that it encompasses all departments of the Executive Yuan, even replacing them entirely, and therefore, it has been revised and compressed. However, since both are resolutions passed by the National Defense Conference, it is probably inappropriate for them to be contradictory only ten days apart.

If the "Promotion" and "Implementation" committees are indeed separate organizations, then the Executive Yuan would suddenly have two major organizations. Although village construction is an extremely important basic task, it is still necessary to consider whether it is appropriate to have such a setup. Furthermore, according to the matters stipulated in Articles 6 and 7 of the regulations regarding the responsibilities of the first and second sections of the committee, when summarized, they are nothing more than a portion of the duties under the jurisdiction of the Ministries of Interior, Education, Industry, Construction, and Social Welfare. There is no need to establish another committee. If the "Promotion" and "Implementation" committees are established separately, would it not be redundant and further disrupt the administrative system? Village construction is indeed a local issue, and perhaps the highest officials of the central ministries cannot personally handle it. Therefore, a special organization is established to specialize in this matter in order to deeply penetrate the grassroots. However, whether it is the "Promotion" or "Implementation" committee, both explicitly stipulate that they are directly under the Executive Yuan, so their status is equivalent to that of the ministries. The qualifications of the committee members in the "Implementation" aspect are all high-ranking officials above the rank of Simplified Appointment, while in the "Promotion" aspect, according to the provisions in the General Outline, they are all ministers, secretaries-general, and chairmen. How can this be justified?

Efficiency is valued in governance, and efficiency is greatly affected by the organization. Villages are indeed the cornerstone of the nation and society, and their prosperity and decline can affect the fate of the country. However, village construction is ultimately a part of the national policy of the political party, and it is not an excessive demand for the political party organization to take full responsibility for it. Even if the situation is urgent and the work is intense, why not designate one or two section chiefs in the relevant departments of each ministry to specialize in village affairs, formulate more practical principles, and, after approval by the Executive Yuan, distribute them to the provincial governments and special municipalities, allowing them to supplement them based on their specific circumstances? Then, issue a general order to the county governments to implement them in phases, granting them the special privilege of adapting to the environment under the condition that they do not violate the major principles, but requiring them to report the results on time to judge the performance of the county magistrate. This would be both direct and effective, achieving twice the result with half the effort. Otherwise, each of the committee members is already knowledgeable about everything and concurrently holds three or five important positions. If village work is added to this, frequently adding several meetings, even if they do not want to do things perfunctorily, their energy will be insufficient. To not apply practical methods to practical work and expect it to be successful is like climbing a tree to catch a fish. Moreover, China has always felt a lack of talent. There are many who engage in lofty discussions, but few who bury themselves in hard work. Now, according to the organization of the "Implementation" Committee, not to mention the high-ranking officials above the rank of Simplified Appointment, the section chiefs, section members who should be appointed, and the members of the attached "Design" Committee total about forty people. If we add the staff of the "Promotion" Committee that is yet to be established, there will be about a hundred people. These forty or even one hundred people must all be vigorous, energetic, and capable civil servants who are interested in and have researched village construction. Otherwise, they will not be able to use their talents happily, and the plans they come up with will be irrelevant and unhelpful. Why not directly assign these talents to village work, giving full play to their abilities on the spot, rather than having them waste away in a life of armchair strategizing? Wouldn't that be a pity?

Now, someone is suffering from internal decay and external paralysis, emaciated and on the verge of death, with only a breath left, not knowing if they will survive until tomorrow. Their parents are building temples for them and sculpting statues of gods, intending to seek miraculous cures from the immortals. Their hearts are pitiful, but their ignorance is extreme. Before the miraculous cure is obtained, the wood for the coffin has already been prepared. Moreover, the miraculous cure is not guaranteed to be obtained. Good doctors and good ministers share the same principles. In today's world, especially in governing today's China, one must be careful to prevent collapse and adopt emergency measures to preserve vitality. One must never again delay and procrastinate, trying to get by with superficial appearances. Village construction is like this, and so are all other constructions!

### The Italian Concession in Tianjin Will Be Returned to Our Country Today - Foreign Ministers Broadcast Speeches on the Significance of the Reception

Tianjin, 13th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the return of the Italian Concession in Tianjin, an agreement was signed on the 14th of last month in the National Government building in Nanjing by Foreign Minister Chu Minyi of the National Government and Chargé d'Affaires Spinelli of Italy, representing the two governments. It was also decided that the handover procedures would be officially carried out in Tianjin on August 14th. It is learned that Chargé d'Affaires Spinelli of Italy, as well as the Director of the European and American Affairs Department and the Director of the Asian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, Fan and Xu, arrived in China from the capital a few days ago to preside over the handover.

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - On the 14th, our government will officially recover the Italian Concession in Tianjin. Foreign Minister Chu gave a radio address to the nation on the 12th titled "Respectfully Informing the People of the Country about the Reception of the Italian Concession in Tianjin." The gist of the speech is as follows:

Fellow compatriots, August 14th is the day we officially recover the Italian Concession in Tianjin. The Italian Concession in Tianjin should have been returned earlier, but due to the various attempts and conditions proposed by the former Italian government, it was not returned at the same time as other concessions. This year, as Italy itself has gradually stabilized, this issue can no longer be delayed. Thanks to the enthusiastic efforts of our ally, Japan, the situation took a sudden turn for the better, and we were able to achieve success. The agreement was signed on July 14th, and it was also agreed that the details of the agreement would be signed in Tianjin on the morning of August 14th.

After the return of concessions by various countries, many people have doubted the delay of the Italian Concession in Tianjin, wondering why the Italian Concession in Tianjin has not yet been returned. I would like to inform the people of the country that the reason why the Italian Concession in Tianjin has been delayed until today is that the Italian side naturally had its reasons for delaying the return. On our own side, we have been constantly anticipating, closely watching, carefully searching for opportunities, and firmly preparing our actions, without revealing anything or relaxing our efforts. The existence of the facts has already answered the doubts of the people of the country. I have nothing more to say here.

Continue to Resist Foreign Aggression

The Tianjin Concession is the last of the foreign concessions in China, and the return of the Italian Concession in Tianjin is also the last of the foreign concessions in China. From now on, the worries in the heart of China have been completely eliminated, and the great danger of China's demise no longer exists. I have two humble thoughts: First, the movement to recover concessions has been going on for decades. Countless lives and money have been sacrificed for this cause, but it has never been achieved. The Founding Father never forgot this matter and even left it in his will. This is no easy feat. But now we have finally received the last one. Another point is that the existence of concessions was indeed a worry in the heart of China, because the main reason for the establishment of concessions was for foreigners to destroy our country's base, and economic and cultural aggression were facilitated by the concessions, thereby undermining us. Our recovery of concessions directly reduces the pressure of aggression and indirectly saves us from demise. However, although the concessions have been recovered, will the foreign aggression and oppression be reduced? Will the salvation from demise be effective? Therefore, although the concessions have been recovered, our work of resisting foreign aggression has not ended, and our goal of saving hope has not been achieved. We still have intangible concessions that we should continue to recover, and we still have work greater than recovering concessions that we should continue.

Preserve Various Strengths by All Means

Now that the concessions have been recovered by us, we must not think that the work has ended and the hope has been fulfilled. We must recognize the life of the concessions, understand the soul of the concessions, add a new soul to their life, and give birth to a new body for their soul. If their effects and strengths are harmful to us, we should find ways to eliminate them. If they are beneficial to us, we should find ways to inherit them. This is the only way to live up to the success of recovering the concessions. Otherwise, although the superficial concessions have been recovered, the actual concessions still exist. Then, although the concessions have been recovered, there is no difference between recovering them and not recovering them.

Furthermore, although the concessions have been recovered, they also have their strengths, such as cleanliness, orderliness, perfection, and comfort. But they also have their weaknesses, such as licentiousness, extravagance, gangsterism, heavy social darkness, and dangerous and decadent lives. The strengths should be preserved by all means, and the weaknesses should be driven out and improved. This is the responsibility that all our compatriots should actively undertake.

Respectfully and Solemnly Thank the Allies

In addition, the return of the concessions by various countries this time was first advocated by our ally, Japan. In March of last year, Japan voluntarily returned all the concessions in various places without reservation, and completely abolished the extraterritorial rights enjoyed by Japan in China. The coordination of the allies also played a major role. As for the return of the Italian Concession in Tianjin this time, it was entirely due to the assistance of the allied governments. Therefore, China has been able to eliminate this century-old problem, and it can be said that it was entirely accomplished by our ally, Japan. Therefore, on the eve of the final recovery of the Italian Concession in Tianjin, I solemnly express my gratitude to our ally, Japan.

Pacific Area

Overall Battle Situation of the Japanese Army

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - In the South Pacific, air raids by our army on Rabaul have been very frequent this week, but the number of attacking aircraft seems to have decreased slightly. However, the number of air raids on Kapingamarangi Atoll in the Caroline Islands seems to have increased. At the same time, enemy aircraft have recently appeared in the Kavieng area. On the morning of August 11, nine enemy heavy bombers attacked a certain area in Sumatra. (1) In the Central Pacific, since July 31, when enemy forces on Tinian launched an offensive led by mechanized units and broke into the Japanese army's last line of defense, the front line in that area has been chaotic. Japanese army units are currently attacking enemy forces in various locations. Also, on Guam, after the Japanese army contracted and reorganized its line of defense north of Agana, it is now severely damaging enemy forces near the mountainous area northeast of Agana. However, since August 8, when enemy tank units have been separately and safely penetrating the Japanese army's positions in various locations, fierce battles are currently taking place day and night in this area. On the night of the 10th, enemy warships launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army's positions on both islands and dropped flares. Currently, the Japanese army on both islands is waiting to fully display the traditional spirit of Japan. On the evenings of July 25, 26, and 27, enemy forces used hundreds of carrier-based aircraft to attack Saipan and Palau. Subsequently, on August 4 and 5, cruisers and destroyers shelled Chichi-jima, but after the local Japanese army bravely fought back, they immediately shot down 41 aircraft and repelled the attacking cruisers.

Japanese Army in the Southwest Pacific, 13th (Central News Agency) - Enemy air raids in the Southwest Pacific are becoming increasingly fierce. On the morning of the 9th, about 50 enemy fighters attacked Port Moresby, New Guinea. The Japanese army destroyed one enemy heavy bomber. Also, on the morning of the 11th, about 20 bombers attacked Kamano, northwest of New Guinea.

The Fierce Fighting of the Japanese Army in Northern Burma

Northern Burma Front, 13th (Central News Agency) - The key point of Myitkyina in northern Burma has experienced four months of bloody fighting, with extremely fierce battles. The Nanyin River flowing north and south of Myitkyina has turned deep red. Over 10,000 troops of the Allied British and American forces fought to the death with the elite Japanese army. The Japanese army, outnumbered, fought to the last soldier. By the end of July, after four months of fighting, the enemy side had abandoned, captured, surrendered, and wounded over 15,000 soldiers. On August 2nd and 3rd, the brave Japanese soldiers who fought to the end withdrew from Myitkyina, moved their positions, and prepared for the next operation.

The Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association

Refreshes its Lineup

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - The inauguration ceremony for the new president of the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association, Kōbayashi Seizō, was solemnly held on the 11th of this month. All parties have great expectations for the new president to lead its members with his seasoned political experience. The reorganization of the association's internal affairs is especially anticipated by all parties. From now on, the resolution of the following issues will be used as an opportunity to establish a wartime posture that is in line with the times: (1) Improving relations with the new government, (2) Strengthening and refreshing the association's management and guiding principles, (3) Reforming new national organizations, and (4) Refreshing personnel organization. The adoption of a secretary-general system is also being considered in order to absorb talent and refresh the lineup within the association.

### Ambassador Aikawa Visits the Vietnamese Governor-General

Saigon, 13th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam Aikawa, accompanied by Information Department Director Watanabe, arrived in Da Lat on the 9th.

Japan Actively Adjusts Coal Industry to Increase Production

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - Coal is a basic raw material for military production. Japan's production situation from April to July of this year shows only a slight increase in output compared to the same period last year, and there is a huge gap compared to the ambitious production plan for this year. Therefore, establishing fundamental measures to increase coal production and implementing them rapidly has become an urgent task. In particular, the labor problem in coal production needs to be fundamentally resolved. The main points are as follows: (1) "Adjustment of Military Mobilization and Industrial Mobilization" Most of the coal mine workers who are drafted into the military are skilled workers, and their production capacity is equivalent to several unskilled workers. Coal is the foundation of strategy, and military mobilization and industrial mobilization must be fundamentally adjusted. (2) "Implementation of General Conscription" Although the conscription of coal mine workers has already been implemented, the recent implementation of designated conscription for experienced workers has failed to achieve the desired goal due to the insufficient number and quality of current coal mine workers. Therefore, general conscription must be implemented.

### Japanese Air Force Surprise Attack on Xi'an and Hanzhong Airfields - Aircraft and Military Facilities Destroyed

Chinese Front Base, 13th (Central News Agency) - A bomber squadron of the Japanese Air Force launched a surprise attack on the Northwest Chongqing-American Air Force base, the Xi'an and Hanzhong airfields, in the late hours of the 11th, inflicting great damage. Despite the adverse weather conditions, the Japanese army destroyed two heavy bombers and burned seven heavy bombers at the Xi'an airfield, destroying two ammunition depots, one of which exploded, and starting fires in three places. At the Hanzhong airfield, two light bombers were burned and fires started in eleven places. The entire Japanese bomber squadron returned to base safely.

Chongqing Radio Broadcasts the Fall of Hengyang

Guangzhou, 13th (Central News Agency) - Chongqing Radio has acknowledged that Hengyang, a town in the Ninth War Area, has fallen, and believes that the Japanese army will continue to advance south. According to the broadcast, the Japanese army has been launching a fierce attack on Hengyang since August 4th, and on the 7th, they broke into the central part of the city. At that time, the commander of the defending army, Fang Xianjue, commander of the Tenth Army, requested instructions from the military authorities, and on the 8th, the city fell. Although the Japanese army may not advance immediately, they may continue to advance south in the future, aiming to open up the Yuehan Railway line or attack the American air force bases in the southeast.

### North China Development Board Adds Construction Team

Beijing, 13th (Central News Agency) - The North China Development Planning Board previously reduced one section and two teams due to the establishment of the Police Labor Headquarters. Now, in order to expand the organization, it has added a construction team. This team is responsible for reviewing civil engineering, construction, and other construction projects related to development, as well as procuring the necessary materials. Recently, various related enterprises have been striving to develop important projects, so the progress of the construction team's work in the future is highly anticipated.

### The Rice Control Association Will Establish a Branch in Nanjing

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Rice and Grain Control Committee of the Business Control Association, in order to strengthen the procurement and distribution of rice and grain in the Nanjing area, has decided to abolish the existing office in Nanjing in view of the unsatisfactory results of its activities in the past. It will instead establish a Nanjing branch of the Rice Control Association. This move will be implemented around the 20th of this month, and a steering committee will be established within the branch, inviting the heads of relevant agencies as members. Colonel Toda, the Nanjing Liaison Officer, will serve concurrently as the chairman. The general public is greatly anticipating the establishment of the branch and the future development of its work.

### The National Health Administration Carries Out Anti-Smoking Campaigns in Various Places

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - After the Ministry of Interior conducted a registration of smokers, it entrusted the National Health Administration to open smoking cessation hospitals in various provinces and cities during the summer of this year to eradicate opium addiction and provide financial relief. The National Health Administration has established smoking cessation hospitals in Nanjing and Shanghai, which will be established within a month and implement smoking cessation. As for the selection of hospital directors, the National Health Administration has invited a director of the Medical Administration Department of the National Health Administration to serve concurrently as the director of the Central Smoking Cessation Hospital, and Guan Suihuo has been appointed as the director of the National Shanghai Smoking Cessation Hospital. As for the smoking cessation preparation in 72 counties in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, the National Health Administration has designated the larger public and private hospitals in each province and county to handle it concurrently, and the central government will provide subsidies to facilitate universal opium abstinence and achieve complete success. It is heard that six Class A hospitals have been designated to handle the smoking cessation preparation, and the plans have been completed. It is also scheduled that the directors and responsible persons of the Class A concurrent smoking cessation hospitals will come to Nanjing on the 30th of this month to discuss the implementation methods. The responsible persons of the Class B and Class C concurrent smoking cessation hospitals will also be convened next month. This is a prelude to the efforts of the Ministry of Interior and the National Health Administration to eradicate opium addiction.

### The First Administrative District of Jiangsu Province Relocates its Anti-Communist Office

Yangzhou, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Special Commissioner's Office for Anti-Communism in the First Administrative District of Jiangsu Province has been ordered to move to Nantong for office work.

### Jiangsu Province's Land Tax Will Be Converted to Collection in Kind

Suzhou, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Jiangsu Provincial Government's proposal to convert the province's land tax to collection in kind has been approved by the Executive Yuan in a reply telegram, and the principles will be followed. The regulations have been drafted, and a county magistrate meeting was convened yesterday, the 12th. Those present included Governor Chen, directors of various county bureaus and offices, and more than 90 county magistrates. First, Director Wang of the Finance Department explained in detail the key points of the land tax conversion to collection in kind, and then the discussion began. As a result, it was decided that 22 kilograms of rice per mu would still be collected based on the trade, equivalent to one dou of polished rice.

### The European War Changes Strategy - A Grand Decisive Battle Will Unfold in Normandy - The Main Force of the US Army Advances North Along the Sarthe River

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - German authorities told a group of reporters on the 12th: The strengthening of the anti-Axis forces in northern France may be the prelude to an unprecedented decisive battle between the two armies. The anti-Axis army originally attempted to sweep the German army's positions from the south along the Mantes-la-Jolie to the Loire River, which is the characteristic of the current battle situation. The US army will move north from Mantes-la-Jolie towards the German army's positions in Caen, while also advancing southeast from Caen towards Paris, uniting with the US army fighting in Brittany. However, this anti-Axis operation plan has only succeeded in one stage so far, that is, only the invasion operation in Brittany has been completed. Therefore, the anti-Axis army command has had to abandon its previous enterprise and return north from the Normandy front in order to isolate the German army in that area. In view of the above changes, it is feared that an unprecedented and unparalleled great naval battle will inevitably unfold.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - Transocean News Agency: The reinforcement of the anti-Axis army, after the US army crossed the lower Loire River, claimed to want to attack Bordeaux, which proves this. The enemy on the south side of the river is obviously carrying out reconnaissance activities or protecting the right wing of the US Third Army. Most of the US army has advanced to the northeast and north of the Sarthe River, and its purpose is obviously to directly target the rear of the German front line in Normandy, that is, to first occupy Alençon. Currently, the tank armies of the two armies are engaged in fierce fighting. The British Second Army on the left wing, between Mantes-la-Jolie, Rouen, and the Grimbosq Forest, has advanced slightly, which is in response to the Canadian army's attack on Falaise.

Surrounded German Army Firmly Refuses to Surrender

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to news from the front last night: The anti-Axis forces have twice issued final ultimatums to the German army defending the port of Brest, urging them to surrender, but they have been rejected. The German army in Brest has been fighting bravely and holding the port since the 5th, when it was surrounded by the US army, and is still continuing to fight hard.

### The Battle Situation in the Vistula River Bend is Still Serious - The Soviet Army Failed to Cross the River

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - Transocean News Agency: The focus of the battle on the northern route of the Eastern Front is south of Lake Peipus and throughout Latvia. The Soviet army has been attacking for two days, attempting to break through the German army's retreat defense line with ten infantry divisions and three tank regiments, but their plan has not succeeded. The point of breakthrough has been blocked on the new defense line. The German army has achieved defensive victories in the eastern and southeastern parts of East Prussia. The Soviet army has the latest tank units there. Since the two cities of Wielbark and Niedenburg are still in the hands of the German army, it proves the Soviet army's offensive. The Soviet army on the Warsaw front launched another attack, but the German army's reinforcements have stopped the Soviet army's advance. The situation in the Vistula River bend is still serious. The Soviet army's goal is obviously to cross the river. The German army is now blocking its advance north and south of the Baranów Sandomierski bridgehead, but the southern position has retreated three kilometers, with the purpose of avoiding the German army being surrounded.

### City Authorities to Conduct Electricity Consumption Survey of Factories, Survey Forms Distributed to Manufacturers

The Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs, the Bureau of Public Utilities, and the China Central Water and Electricity Company plan to convene specialized technical personnel from various bureaus in the near future to form a factory electricity consumption survey team. They will investigate the electricity consumption of the entire industrial production in the city, categorized by industry. For factories producing essential daily necessities and related to wartime production increases, electricity allocation will be appropriately increased to adapt to the wartime system and increase production. Survey forms for factory production and electricity consumption have been printed and distributed to manufacturers for completion. This matter concerns the overall adjustment of electricity consumption for all factories in the city. Manufacturers are requested to assist the authorities by providing accurate information.

Entertainment Venues Adjust Hours

After the municipal government authorities stipulated temporary measures to restrict the time of electricity usage for entertainment venues in order to conserve electricity, the police authorities immediately followed and strictly implemented the measures. Citizens have also strictly complied with and implemented these measures. The business hours of various entertainment venues have also been adjusted accordingly. Movie theaters and theaters have moved their evening shows earlier, with movie theaters starting their last shows at 8:00 PM and theaters starting their evening performances at 6:30 PM. Dance halls, cafes, and other restaurants have also closed at 10:00 PM since the 12th of the month. Lights in all hotels and apartments must be switched off by 11:00 PM. On the night of the 12th, when the electricity conservation measures were implemented, reporters inspected various districts and found that most people complied with the regulations. However, there were also those who violated the rules. According to the authorities, those who violate the rules will be severely warned in accordance with the municipal government's order. If they continue to offend, their electricity supply will be suspended, or their business license will be revoked.

Telephone Users Automatically Save Electricity

The China Central Electrical Communications Company has recently undergone changes to the "02" telephone exchange, increasing the burden on the exchange's efficiency. Therefore, the telephone bureau is requesting users to automatically conserve electricity. The main points of conservation are: 1. Avoid unnecessary socializing on the phone. 2. Telephone calls should ideally not exceed two or three minutes. 3. Do not make calls unless absolutely necessary.

### Seven Suburban Districts Restore County Administration

The seven suburban districts of Shanghai Municipality, which were temporarily converted into special public districts during the "cleansing villages" campaign, have had their administrative sovereignty unified since the Allied Powers and Japan jointly recovered the concessions last year. The city has obtained central government approval to restore county administrations to the seven district offices. On the first anniversary of Restoration Day, August 11th, each county received instructions from the government to formally revert to using the name "County Government."

### The Problem of American Blacks is Getting Worse
— Mr. Matsudaira Tadahisa, Information Officer of the Japanese Embassy

According to foreign telegrams: On the 2nd of this month, in Philadelphia, USA, due to excessive oppression of blacks by whites, black employees of public transportation such as buses and subways went on strike, followed by riots. The U.S. authorities finally mobilized the military to suppress them, resulting in thirteen people being injured. Another group of young black workers, armed with pistols, knives, sticks, and tiles, invaded the streets, resulting in the arrest of over three hundred people by the authorities. The city's transportation is now maintained by the military. As a result, the so-called "black race problem" is getting worse.

Last summer, black riots broke out in twelve cities in the United States over several weeks, resulting in six deaths and over sixty injuries. The most violent struggle was in Detroit. The reason was that since the war began, hundreds of thousands of blacks had moved there, and local white workers had repeatedly clashed with black laborers due to so-called racial animosity. In addition, groups such as the KKK organized oppression against blacks, trying to prevent blacks from living there after the war, causing blacks to be in a difficult situation with no houses to live in. Therefore, blacks used this as a motive to fight and riot.

The problem of blacks in the United States began at the beginning of its founding, when many black slaves were brought from Africa. Later, the United States caused the Civil War due to the handling of the black issue. Therefore, the black issue is an endless source of trouble for the United States. The author recalls his observations on the black issue in the United States during his service in the United States:

Inequality of Blacks in Social Life

Since Lincoln emancipated slaves, although the law prohibits the use of blacks as slaves, blacks still suffer extremely unequal treatment. This is an undeniable fact. There are fewer blacks in the western and northern United States, so the treatment they receive is unequal, but it is not very obvious. On the contrary, there are more blacks in the southern United States, so the reaction is more obvious. When the author first arrived in Washington, D.C., the first thing that surprised him was that the elevators used by blacks and whites were different. Black porters who carry luggage can only use the elevator used by whites when it is necessary to accompany the guest, otherwise they must use the elevator specifically for blacks. The author once asked a porter from the embassy to carry luggage into an apartment, and suddenly the porter disappeared. Later, he saw him taking another elevator upstairs. At that time, the author asked him, "Why didn't you take the same elevator as me?" He replied, "We blacks cannot take the same elevator as you." He further explained the general situation of their low social status. Also, when the author first arrived in the United States, his friend told him not to sit in the back of the bus, because if he sat in the back, he would be mistaken for a black person and be bullied. Later, when the author took the bus, he saw that the front and rear were divided into black and white.

If one goes to the southern United States, this situation is even more obvious, which is very unpleasant. In public toilets, there is a distinction between those used by whites and those used by blacks. Movie theaters, restaurants, and other public gathering places often have a sign that says "Whites Only." The author was in a small town in North Carolina when he saw a Japanese friend witnessing a black man being subjected to extreme torture. This kind of behavior is difficult to describe in words. In short, it is barbaric and inhumane. The author often questioned how this kind of behavior could be applied to human beings. At that time, if the situation were described in detail, it would be banned during inspection. After seeing this torture, the author felt nauseous and went to a nearby drinking fountain to rinse his mouth, and saw a sign that said "For Black People Only." The author still remembers this situation very clearly. The above examples are just the tip of the iceberg.

Inequality of Blacks in Occupation

What is described here is that their status is slightly more advanced than slaves, but their industries are mostly labor, and the lowest-level labor, so they are all groaning in the lowest-level standard of living.

Recently, the education level of blacks has improved compared to the past, and there are many who have received university education, but their outlets are restricted, and it is extremely difficult to obtain an occupation with a slightly higher status in society. Black lawyers have no white people going to consult them, and black doctors have no white patients. Scholars cannot be professors in schools run by white people. Even citizens of Chinese and Japanese descent who have obtained American citizenship generally suffer the above situation in the United States. The most annoying thing is the inequality of blacks in occupation, which is even more obvious.

When the author was studying at the University of Michigan, he had a black classmate who was studying law. He often saw the professor despising him, and he often took a resistant attitude and asked the professor difficult questions to expose his incompetence. The author once asked him, "What will you do after graduation?" He said, "After graduation, I will work in a school run by blacks. There is no other way to find a job." He also expressed his indignation that there was only one black politician who was a member of the House of Representatives. There was an economics professor at the University of Michigan named Remer, the author of "The Foreign Trade of China." He lived in Shanghai for three years and seemed to have taught at St. John's University. He treated the Chinese with a friendly attitude - the attitude of dealing with servants. However, he treated blacks with a cold and disgusted attitude. He said, "I can use East Asians as my assistants, but no matter how smart blacks are, I will never use them as my assistants."

Among the blacks who are famous in the United States are the famous boxer "Louis" and the world sprint athlete "Owens," etc. However, American whites do not express happiness that blacks have become world masters, and say that their skills were learned from whites, so it is not surprising, and no matter how much blacks can exert their talents, they cannot guide whites. From the above, we can see their inequality in occupation.

Reasons for the Recent Deterioration of the Black Issue

The United States declared that this war was a war for the liberation of the oppressed. Black leaders pointed out: "There is still a distinction between black and white races in the United States, so it is contradictory to call this war a war for the liberation of the oppressed," and shouted "After the war, the oppressed state of blacks should be liberated" and "When discussing post-war issues, blacks should be given equal rights and a voice at once," etc. General blacks also echoed. Blacks also strongly demanded that there should be no distinction between black and white when serving in the military. Their requirements are roughly as follows: 1. Equality in factories, 2. Equality in the military, 3. Equality in legal and civic rights. Regarding the first point, because the United States is in a state of labor shortage, the proportion of blacks employed is relatively high, so this point has been largely improved. However, in military factories, blacks can only obtain jobs below the semi-skilled worker level, and the number is no less than several hundred people. The second and third points have not been considered by Americans at all, so blacks are extremely dissatisfied. This is one of the main reasons for the deterioration of the black issue. Also, there are very few blacks advancing into the industrial sector, especially in shipbuilding, aircraft, and electrical machinery manufacturing plants, etc. In the past, factories that blacks could not enter are now employing more blacks, and white labor will return after the war, so they have more animosity towards blacks. This is the second reason for the deterioration of the black issue this time. In addition, due to the excessive population in major industrial cities and the incompleteness of living facilities, the actual life is deteriorating, and the minds of both black and white races are restless, and their policies are inconsistent. As a result, this issue is difficult to resolve.

General Attitude of Blacks

The judicial authorities deliberately do not pursue the root cause of this issue, and although the federal government knows the importance of this issue, it is trying to suppress blacks for fear of frequent disputes in the country during wartime. Also, the members of the Southern Congressional Delegation and some conservative members of parliament absolutely oppose improving the status of blacks. Therefore, the industrial sector also does not consider hiring blacks, and white labor unions often exclude black workers. As for the general psychology towards blacks, it is as described above, containing a reactionary nature. Among them, only a few have sympathy for this issue. For example, the writer "McWilliams" advocates human justice and promotes that the federal government should resolve this issue. Also, Mr. "Weibaikai" of the wartime production authority's black employment training department said: It is urgent to improve the treatment of blacks and whites in the industrial sector and the military, and there should be no discrimination after the war, and a certain guarantee should be given.

In short: After this war, the black side has awakened, and although the white side knows something, the aversion to blacks is increasing. Although the general public knows a little about the importance of this issue, they have not considered it carefully, and those who know the root cause of this issue are also worried. On the other hand, the attitude of the authorities is only to take repressive measures every time an incident occurs, and not to solve the root cause of the issue. Therefore, it is predicted that the black issue will inevitably get worse and expand.

### Mortgaging of Major Materials Requires a Registration Certificate

The Municipal Economic Council, in order to investigate the major materials in the city to prevent hoarding, has previously held a registration of major materials. In order to seek further statistics, it notified the Municipal Bankers Association and the Central Reserve Inspection Financial Affairs Office on the 21st of last month to cooperate fully. When factories or businesses use the major materials designated by the Ministry of Industry as collateral to borrow money from financial institutions such as banks or trust companies, they must submit the major material registration certificate issued by the Economic Council. Merchants in the city are requested to pay attention.

### Examination Papers of Poor Students Have Been Graded

A total of sixty high school students and three hundred middle school students were admitted. It is expected that the admitted students will receive their money on the 10th.

### Bicycle License Renewal to Begin Tomorrow

The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has decided to renew the second half of the year's bicycle licenses in the first district at the vehicle registration offices on Jiangning Road and Gongping Road starting tomorrow (the 15th). The bureau believes that there are a large number of bicycles in the city, so in order to avoid crowding, save citizens' time, and facilitate all bicycle owners to renew their licenses, it has stipulated that each vehicle registration office will handle a maximum of 500 bicycle license renewals per day. It has also designated the dates and locations for each bicycle to renew its license and publishes them in advertisements in various newspapers every day. Citizens are requested to cooperate and go to renew their licenses on time to avoid crowding.

### Shanghai Market Situation Stable Last Week, Prices of Daily Necessities Fall with Arrival Prices

The financial and industrial market situation in Shanghai last week has become normal and stable. Because the Central Reserve credit regulation is becoming more smooth and the exchange of materials is more active than in the past, transactions are becoming more prosperous in the midst of easy money, and the prices of all industries are falling. The comprehensive short-term interest rate changed from rising to flat, the interest rate of the money industry remained unchanged at 3.7 cents, and the Joint Reserve Notes also did not change on the horizontal line. The Hua Gu stock market situation has turned to normal improvement because the government sent personnel to thoroughly investigate short selling and speculative transactions. The most optimistic thing in the price of daily food is that the authorities announced the restoration of household rice rationing and the doubling of household flour rationing, and the people's food has become greatly stable. The black market price of rice has fallen frequently by more than 20%, so the market prices of various daily necessities have fallen slightly. Although the factory industry in this week was affected by the restriction area, the production was affected, but according to the people in the industry, the production raw materials are easier to purchase than before, and the transportation is not much difficult. The factories of the main commodities necessary for the people are mostly working hard to increase production in order. Therefore, in view of this situation, the prosperity of the industrial and commercial sectors is promising.
