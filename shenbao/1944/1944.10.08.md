### What Exactly is the Way to Solve the Rice and Grain Problem?

— Chen Binhe

Yesterday, the *Continental Daily News* published an editorial titled "[The Essence of the Rice Problem]," criticizing the Advisory Committee's recommendations regarding the rice problem and the arguments of Chinese public opinion. Standing as a member of the Advisory Committee and a member of the press, I cannot remain silent. I wish to express my feelings with the utmost sincerity as follows:

The main points of the *Continental Daily News* editorial can be summarized as follows:

*   Strengthening restrictions on the import of food grains is one of the factors stimulating rice price increases. Therefore, the Advisory Committee's recommendations reflect the demands of the people and represent their interests. However, the people only pay attention to their current lives, and their demands are often unrealistic and can even hinder unified policy implementation. However, using public opinion as a basis to attack the authorities is by no means a constructive attitude, nor is it something that should be done in cooperation with the authorities.

*   The most practical thing at present is how to ensure the smooth progress of purchases in the interior, and the effectiveness should be determined within three months. The day the purchase work is successful is the day the people's food in Shanghai is resolved.

*   If it is believed that the free import of rice and grain hinders the purchase work in the interior, then small sacrifices should be tolerated at present.

*   Restrict free movement to ensure the success of the current urgent purchase work, or succumb to the impatient demands of the public, resulting in the failure of the work. One of the two should be chosen.

*   The Advisory Committee is a bridge between the government and the citizens. If it uses public opinion as a reason to force the authorities to implement impossible recommendations, it will not only fail to be a bridge, but will also become a divider between the authorities and the people.

Now, I will discuss the above points:

Strengthening restrictions on the import of rice is enough to stimulate rice price increases. The newspaper editorial has already recognized this as a fact and as the demand of the people. So, why insist on strengthening restrictions? Why insist on stimulating price increases? Why insist on violating the demands of the people? If it is said that the people's demands only consider their current lives, and are often unrealistic and can hinder unified policy, then what is considering future life? What is realistic? What is not hindering unified policy implementation? The Rice Control Committee has been established for more than a year, and purchase work has been done more than once. Is it considering future life to sit and watch the rice price jump from several thousand yuan to more than ten thousand yuan and continue to rise? Is it realistic? Is it unified policy implementation? Historical facts are the most powerful dialectic.

We also know that the purpose of the Rice Control Committee strengthening restrictions is to smoothly complete the purchase work within three months. The ideal is that after the rice from the interior cannot reach Shanghai, the rice price in the interior will be cheaper, so the purchase will be profitable, and both public and private rice can be resolved. However, our purpose is exactly the same, but our ideal is not like this. Based on past experience, what we are concerned about is whether we have the confidence to achieve the following within three months: ○ sufficient amount of rationed rice. ○ accurate rationing period. ○ stabilize Shanghai's rice price. ○ stabilize the rice price in the interior. If we have these guarantees, then, let alone restricting within eight kilograms, even if the transfer is absolutely prohibited, the people will not object. We believe that without the above guarantees, then the rice price in Shanghai cannot be stabilized, then the citizens of Shanghai will suffer, and the rice price in the interior cannot be stabilized, then the ideal of cheap purchase cannot be realized. The result is that the purpose of strengthening restrictions completely fails. We look back at the fact that the rice price in Shanghai immediately fluctuated and the rice price in the interior followed suit during the past two strengthenings of restrictions, and we feel even more that strengthening restrictions on transfer is a method that cannot communicate ideals and purposes, and is not a step that should be taken in unified policy implementation. Therefore, we always feel that the method of strengthening restrictions on transfer is a risky move, where the disadvantages have already arrived, and the advantages are not necessarily present.

As for the arguments of the press, the editorials of the *Zhonghua Daily*, *New China Daily*, *Xin Shen Bao*, and this newspaper all unanimously believe that strengthening restrictions on transfer is inappropriate. However, Mr. Ueda, in his position as the deputy director of the Rice Control Committee, believes that it is "[seeing the trees and not the forest]," and the *Continental Daily News* editorial believes that supporting the Advisory Committee's background to attack the authorities is not a constructive attitude and is not something that should be done in cooperation with the authorities. This kind of argument inevitably disregards the facts. Is it more reasonable for a few people in the Rice Control Committee to rely on subjectively decided methods? Or is it more reasonable for the majority of the press to objectively decide the demands of the people? I think the facts can prove it, and there is no need to argue too much.

Our central idea is to make the government understand the suffering of the people, to ask the authorities to relieve the people of unnecessary suffering, and to make the people also understand the good intentions of the government and the good intentions of the Allied authorities. I personally believe that we are generally the most loyal to promoting Sino-Japanese cooperation. Because we value reality, tell the truth, and are even less willing to simply say "yes" or "no" without adding our own opinions, so as not to make the people resent the government, and even less to make the people misunderstand the meaning of the Allies. Those who always say "yes" or "no" to the government's policies and the Allies' policies without telling the truth are the dividers between the authorities and the people.

In my personal opinion, the Advisory Committee, the Rice Control Committee, and even the press all have the same purpose in solving the rice problem, but there are different opinions on the way to solve it. This is a public matter, not a private matter, and there should only be public reason and interests, and not emotions and anger. The attitude of the press should be especially cautious, and it should not be rash to apply words such as "divider" to others.

Finally, this newspaper will specially translate and publish the opinions of Mr. Ueda, the deputy director of the Coming Control Committee, and the opinions of the *Continental Daily News* editorial, even though they differ from our arguments, so that Allied personnel can refer to them. In this way, the way to solve the rice problem will be closer to a unified approach!

### The Essence of the Rice Problem

Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee, regarding the Rice Control Committee's measures to prohibit the free import of more than eight kilograms of rice into Shanghai, has suggested to the Municipal Government to restore the free transport system within ten shi. The Chinese public opinion in Shanghai is very supportive of this proposal, and the speeches of various newspapers express their support for the Advisory Committee. This argument believes that Shanghai's rationed rice cannot meet the needs of the general public, so it has to recognize the existence of the black market rice. At the same time, if the free transport is strengthened, the result will inevitably cause the soaring of the rice price in Shanghai, which will have an adverse impact on the purchase of rice in the interior.

It is a fact that the strengthening of restrictions on the import of rice is one of the materials that have become the stimulus of the soaring rice price in Shanghai. At the same time, it is also very obvious that the current rationed rice is not enough for the needs of the people. From this point of view, the Advisory Committee's proposal can be said to reflect the demands of the people, and it can also be said to represent the interests of the people. However, the task of the Advisory Committee is not just to demand the authorities to adopt the demands and propositions of the people without any change. Generally speaking, the masses often only pay attention to their current lives, and what they demand is often unrealistic, and at the same time, it can sometimes hinder unified policy implementation. The suggestions on [fully increasing the rationed rice], [otherwise, easing the restrictions on mobility] are indeed direct requirements in the lives of Shanghai citizens, but this kind of proposition is based on the support of public opinion to attack the authorities. It is by no means a constructive attitude, nor is it something that should be done in cooperation with the authorities.

At this moment, the most urgent and practical thing about the rice problem is how to make the purchase in the interior proceed smoothly; and this purchase problem must be decided within three months, so the problem is very urgent. All efforts must be put into promoting the work, and the day the purchase work is carried out smoothly and successfully will also be the day when the problem of people's food in Shanghai is solved. If we believe that the free import of rice and grain hinders the purchase work in the interior, then although small sacrifices are tolerated at present, only cooperating with the authorities' policies is the real constructive method and practical attitude, because in reality, there cannot be policies that do not contain some contradictions and shortcomings. Regarding the rice problem, either the current urgent purchase work can be successful, or it will succumb to the impatient demands of the public, so that the work will end in failure. One of the two should be chosen.

The Advisory Committee must be a good bridge between the government and the citizens of Shanghai. If it ignores reality, does not consider the environment, and forces the authorities to implement impossible proposals simply because of the support of public opinion, it will not only fail to become a good bridge, but will also become a divider between the authorities and the people. For all suggestions and proposals, no matter how reasonable they are on the surface, we must think about them, and consider and deal with them in the context of overall policy implementation, so that they can be changed into realistically possible proposals. The proposition of relying solely on the name of public opinion to put the authorities in a difficult situation is not what we should adopt. (Translated from the *Continental Daily News*, October 7)

### The Japanese Prime Minister Declares His Determination and Urges Cabinet Members to Promote Policies and Work Together to Complete the War

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Pacific war situation has now entered an important stage that will determine the rise and fall of Japan, so it is necessary to develop strong war policies. Regarding this point, Japanese Prime Minister Koiso called the attention of all cabinet members at the cabinet meeting held on the 6th, in order to implement the imminent decisive battle, and declared his firm determination as follows: The situation is becoming more and more urgent. As of today, we are at the stage of decisive battle. Naturally, we should not focus on the organizational structure, but in order to complete the war, if there are obstacles, we should actively and boldly overcome the difficulties in the organizational structure and personnel, so that strong policies can be promoted. What I hope for in the future is that cabinet members should exchange opinions frankly with each other. In the past, although we have gained understanding among cabinet members, it is inevitable that there have been regrets that things could not be thoroughly promoted in terms of affairs. Regarding this point, I hope that all cabinet members will work together with one heart and one mind to complete the war and the prosperity of the Empire.

### The Supreme Policy-Making Body Will Be Established Soon

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Supreme War Guidance Council not only decides the supreme policy for guiding the war, but also decides the supreme policy for all policies that are indispensable for completing the war, such as politics and diplomacy. This has already been made clear by what Prime Minister Koiso announced at the previous temporary meeting. However, how to specifically implement the already decided supreme policy was only limited to planning to establish an appropriate organization in the cabinet at that time. Now it is learned that at the cabinet meeting on the 6th, Prime Minister Koiso specifically emphasized the following three points: ○ In terms of the strategic situation, although it is appropriate to adopt a policy of not changing the organization, the necessary reforms of the organization should be carried out to carry out the war. ○ Regarding the operation of policies, it is planned to carry out strong and bold implementation. ○ In the past, things that have been completely understood among cabinet members may not have been thoroughly implemented by the administrative authorities or the lowest-level organizations. Due to the above explanation by Prime Minister Koiso, the administrative organizations of the army and navy will become simpler and more powerful in terms of military production in the future, and the preparations for production mobilization, the thorough implementation of the policy of increasing military food production, and the simplification of the lowest-level administration that has the closest contact with the public, and the streamlining of administrative affairs will be resolutely implemented. From Prime Minister Koiso's words, it can be seen that the Japanese organization for specifically implementing the supreme policy decided by the Supreme War Guidance Council will be established soon.

### Japanese Headquarters Announces Japanese Army Occupies Fuzhou

The U.S. Admits that the Japanese Army is Approaching Guilin

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Headquarters announced at 3:00 p.m. on the 7th that the Japanese army, which was attacking Fuzhou, defeated the stubbornly resisting Yu's 80th Division in the established positions around the city, and completely occupied Fuzhou City on the 4th.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) After the Japanese army launched a surprise landing operation near Daijiang, 40 kilometers northeast of Fuzhou, on September 27, they captured Lianjiang, an important and dangerous road, on the 28th, pointing directly to the Yu army south of Fuzhou. They formed a solid defense line within a radius of two li around Fuzhou, with the 70th Army (Commander Chen Kongda) and the 80th Division (Division Commander Li Liangzi) as the mainstay, stubbornly holding on and launching an ambush against the Japanese army. The Japanese army gradually approached the defense line on October 2, and after starting the attack in the morning, successively implemented day attacks and night surprise attacks. On the afternoon of the 3rd, they occupied Banling (8 kilometers northeast of Fuzhou), and on the 4th, they broke through Zhonglun Mountain (5 kilometers southeast of Fuzhou). The Japanese army was like an angry wave, rushing to the Fuzhou plain in one breath, and completely occupied the streets of Fuzhou at 8:00 on the 4th. In addition, the Japanese army's separate detachments also successively occupied Wuhu Island (20 kilometers east of Fuzhou), at the mouth of the Minjiang River, and Wuke Island to the north. At the moment, the Japanese army is carrying out a mopping-up operation. Fuzhou is a base for enemy American submarines, so the occupation of this port is extremely noteworthy. This time, because the Japanese army preemptively launched an operation, their attempt has been completely crushed. The Japanese army's control over the east coast of China has now been completed, and maritime transportation in the Greater East Asia Sea is guaranteed, so the US military's plan to land on the Chinese mainland has completely failed.

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency), according to a Washington dispatch, US Secretary of the Army Stimson met with a group of reporters on the 5th and mentioned the war situation in China, admitting that the Japanese army was approaching Guilin. At the same time, he emphasized that the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing covered the operations of the Chongqing army, saying that the Japanese army was expanding its occupied areas. According to various sources, they are now approaching an area 20 kilometers away from Guilin. At the same time, the Danzhu US Air Force base south of Guilin was lost due to the Japanese army's westward advance from Guangdong. However, the US 14th Air Force is still working hard to actively hinder the Japanese army's operations.

Japanese Army Front Line, 6th (Central News Agency) The Japanese army attacked the first line of defense, Xing'an City, which defended Guilin, from the east, west, and north, and occupied it at dawn on the 1st, and continued to advance south. After a fierce battle, they defeated about 2,000 men from the 8th Provisional Division of the 93rd Army of the enemy in the area, and seized Lao Chating, about 15 kilometers west of Xing'an. They are currently mopping up the remaining enemies.

### Important Issues in North China are Increasing Production: Takeuchi Heihachiro Gives a Talk

Beiping, 7th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Takeuchi, Undersecretary of the Japanese Ministry of Greater East Asia, met with reporters at the Japanese Embassy here at 10:30 a.m. on the 6th and stated that he had no special purpose in this trip. His general impression of North China was only that Beiping, from the surface atmosphere, did not have a sense of urgency to rise up and struggle.

At present, the most important issues for the promoters of the construction of North China are increasing production and transportation.

### Police Bureau Chiefs Lü and Li Respond to Police Administration Questions

22nd Regular Press Conference Held Yesterday. The Municipal Propaganda Department convened the 22nd regular press conference yesterday, where Lü Qi, Administrative Chief of the First Police Bureau, and Li Shiyu, Judicial Chief, answered various questions raised by reporters.

### Crackdown on Police Extortion

(Central News Agency Question) Police often exploit their authority to extort money from citizens, especially traffic police. Is the authorities aware of this, and what effective measures are being taken to prevent it? (Administrative Chief Answer) The issue of police extortion and the unauthorized actions of traffic police in arbitrarily inspecting pedestrians was discovered six months ago. It has been discussed during administrative meetings. A diligent traffic police officer would have no time to interfere in extraneous matters. Otherwise, regardless of the motive, it is an overreach of authority. The Bureau has ordered all branches to thoroughly investigate and report on this issue to facilitate punishment. At the same time, we sincerely hope that citizens can assist us. If they discover traffic police interfering in matters outside of traffic control, such as arbitrarily questioning pedestrians, they can record the location, time, and police number and report it to the Bureau. We will investigate and rectify the situation strictly to maintain law and order and protect the welfare of the citizens.

### Entertainment Venues Operating Past Hours

(Central News Agency Question) The authorities have restricted the operating hours of entertainment venues to conserve electricity. Why are some dance halls still operating past hours, even until dawn? (Administrative Chief Answer) The Police Bureau has been handling the restriction of entertainment venue operating hours in three stages to conserve electricity. Initially, the closing time was set at midnight, then at 10 PM. However, it became increasingly difficult to enforce. If the police enforced it too strictly, it would have a significant impact on their business. However, we cannot simply ignore the regulations and allow them to operate freely. Therefore, the Bureau initially adopted a persuasive approach, appealing to them to voluntarily comply. The second step was to take strict measures and crack down on violations. We have now entered the crackdown phase, and the Bureau will strictly enforce the regulations. In the past, we delegated the enforcement to the branch offices. In the future, we will further assign personnel to conduct spot checks. However, due to limited staff, we may not be able to cover all locations. Recently, we received reports that some entertainment venues have installed police alarms or assigned lookouts to notify the premises when police officers approach, allowing them to conceal the violations. The Bureau is currently investigating and cracking down on these practices.

### Judicial Police Using Torture

(China Daily Question) The responsibility of the police is to protect the people. They should use peaceful methods to persuade and admonish in all situations. However, many police officers in this city still retain the bad habits of former constables, resorting to beatings at the slightest provocation. Furthermore, there are still instances of private torture within the police detective squads. We hope the police authorities will take steps to improve this. (Judicial Chief Answer) Since the takeover of the concessions, the Bureau has been making every effort to rectify this. We have repeatedly warned police officers. The extent of improvement is clear to everyone. As for the detectives, we have been working hard to rectify all aspects, including personnel and operations, for the past year. The Judicial Police, under the Judicial Office, are constantly focused on handling everything related to the safety and security of the people's lives and property, as well as the maintenance of the law, and strive for simplicity and efficiency. We are doing our best to instill legal knowledge, provide investigative skills training, and supervise the conduct of our staff. Regarding the issue of using torture, we will thoroughly investigate and hope that citizens will report such incidents.

### Extortion by Police at Suzhou Creek Docks

(China Daily Question) Police officers stationed at bridgeheads and docks along the Suzhou Creek, such as the Tianhou Temple, openly obstruct and extort money from pedestrians carrying non-controlled prohibited items. Does the police authorities have any measures to address this? (Administrative Chief and Judicial Chief Answer) The Bureau had heard of the aforementioned situation as early as February. We have ordered all branch offices to strictly crack down on it. We have also been dispatching personnel to conduct regular inspections. At the same time, we sincerely hope that citizens can assist the authorities to achieve twice the results with half the effort.

### Embezzlement Suspects Escorted to Beijing

(Central News Agency Question) We have heard that important suspects in the embezzlement case have been escorted to Beijing for interrogation. Could you please provide information on the progress of the case and disclose the names of those escorted to Beijing for interrogation? (Judicial Chief Answer) Regarding this case, the police are only responsible for the investigation, which is confidential and cannot be disclosed. This is clear to everyone. After the investigation is completed, the case will be transferred to a special court in Beijing for trial. To my knowledge, the trial can be either public or private, and whether it is disclosed or not is not determined by this office.

### Degree of Reduction in Crime Cases

(Central News Agency Question) Since the establishment of the Crime Prevention Section, what has been the effect of its work, and to what extent has crime decreased compared to before? (Judicial Chief Answer) Since its establishment several months ago, the Crime Prevention Section has not had a significant impact due to the complexity of society in this city. As for the extent to which crime has decreased, there are no clear figures yet. We are currently in the planning and development stage.

### Inspection Notes Along the Hangzhou-Ningbo Highway

- By Our Correspondent Liu Hanru

○ The Rich Eastern Zhejiang - From crossing the river at Zhakou, through Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, to Ningbo, along the highway for more than three hundred li, the fields are filled with ripening rice, stretching endlessly as far as the eye can see, showing that Eastern Zhejiang is a rich rice-producing area. According to farmers, the rice harvest in Eastern Zhejiang is slightly later than in other places, generally around the end of the eighth lunar month, similar to the late rice harvest in southern and northern Anhui. Cotton is a specialty of Yuyao, with very high yields. It is said that the value of cotton clothing that can be exported this year is over 100 million yuan. Therefore, Yuyao's affluence is also the highest among the counties in Eastern Zhejiang, with Shaoxing's wine and tinfoil being the roots of Eastern Zhejiang's economic prosperity. As the vehicle enters Shaoxing County, the houses on both sides are all tiled houses, built on stone foundations that are very high, constructed along the water. Several willow trees grow next to the houses, swaying in the wind. Occasionally, several sailboats sail with the wind, the boatmen holding long pipes, steering and sailing leisurely. Three or five village children either lie on the backs of cattle or play by the creek, and farmers bow their heads to cultivate. Hearing the sound of cars, they all stand up to watch. The frightened cattle scatter in a panic, and the mischievous children clap their hands, greatly amused. This scene is truly delightful and makes one forget the troubled world. Shaoxing is famous for its wine production, and Shaoxing wine is world-renowned. Tin foil, silk, patterned gauze, fragrant cakes, fermented bean curd, etc., are all famous products of Shaoxing. Therefore, Shaoxing not only has a good output in agriculture, but its commerce is also very prosperous, comparable to the port of Ningbo. Taro and cotton are also produced in large quantities in Xiaoshan. Eastern Zhejiang is indeed a very prosperous region.

○ People's Livelihood in Distress - Eastern Zhejiang is known as a prosperous region, so the people's livelihood should be relatively affluent. However, because the people are being excessively exploited, their livelihood is unbearable and extremely difficult. According to inquiries: The government collects 35 catties of grain per mu of farmland in Eastern Zhejiang. However, the old regime outside the peaceful area also collects 35 to 25 catties per mu. This is the regular tax. In addition, local troops and layers of tax collectors take advantage of the situation to impose additional taxes. As a result of this excessive taxation, the farmers only receive a small portion of their production. This small portion must cover the food for the entire family and the cost of cultivation. Therefore, when discussing their economic situation with farmers, they all shake their heads and sigh, lamenting their suffering. The farmers' grain income, in addition to paying various official taxes, cannot be freely disposed of. They must also sell to the government at a fixed price for both official rice purchases and military rice purchases. After selling, they have to buy rice back at a high price to eat. Other daily necessities such as soap, matches, and cloth must also be bought at high prices. What is grown in their own fields is not worth much, but what they need to eat, wear, and use must be bought at high prices. Farmers cannot help but express their resentment when discussing this matter! In fact, we also know that this situation is not unique to Eastern Zhejiang. Other places also have similar situations, or perhaps Eastern Zhejiang is even worse. The price of rice in various places along the Hangzhou line is mostly around four to five thousand yuan per dan. People's food consists of half taro and half rice. Taro costs about five yuan per catty, which is not much cheaper than in Beijing and Shanghai. The security situation in the Eastern Zhejiang area, after the village cleansing, seems to be fine in points and lines. Apart from cities and large towns, there are traces of guerrillas, bandits, and [Three-Five Detachments] in most places. The truly wealthy villagers have moved to the cities, and those who are not in good condition live under multiple ruling classes, struggling to survive.

○ The Life of Civil Servants - On this trip, I met several military and local officials, such as the outgoing Governor Chuan, Shaoxing Administrative Commissioner Bu Yumin, Ningbo Administrative Commissioner Tao Xiaojie, Yin County Magistrate Qin Yaxiu, and Xie Wenda, the commander of the Tenth Division stationed in Eastern Zhejiang. After discussing with these military and political officials, we learned something about the living conditions of general civil servants. Generally speaking, the life of civil servants in Eastern Zhejiang is still passable. The biggest reason is that they have rationed rice for themselves and their families. Each person and family member has more than three dou of rationed rice, allocated according to the number of people. There is no problem with the rice supply until the end of the year. Firewood only sells for 1.5 yuan per catty in Ningbo. With rice secured and firewood cheap, other problems are easily solved. Therefore, the life of general lower-level civil servants is much better than in Beijing and Shanghai. Middle and upper-level civil servants, such as important administrative officials below political officials, like section chiefs and above, seem to be living a very decadent life. Those with power in [individual units] live very lavishly. In the [flower] dens in the back market of Ningbo, those who seek pleasure, in addition to profiteering merchants, are this large group of middle and upper-level military and political civil servants and those with power, toasting and drinking, gambling and carousing. We believe that these people know very well the reasons for the suffering of the general public in Eastern Zhejiang and should bear the majority of the responsibility.

○ Conscience Politics - Ningbo Administrative Commissioner Tao Xiaojie once told reporters: [I often warn my subordinates that although our salaries are not enough to live on, the standard for making money should not exceed what is necessary for ordinary life. If we live a luxurious life and still try to squeeze money, then we have no conscience]. (Roughly meaning). At the same time, Xie Wenda, the commander of the Tenth Division in Ningbo, also told reporters: [The military pay issued by the higher authorities is not enough for the soldiers' rations for a few days. The insufficient amount is all maintained by me personally. My method of maintaining the soldiers' lives is to make them [warmly clothed and well-fed]. Raising funds should be done in a way that does not disturb the people or harm national taxes. My soldiers will never ask the people for a penny. I use [business and production] methods to raise funds to support the soldiers. At the same time, I use six words to train the officers and soldiers, which are [with conscience, take responsibility]]. Both Tao and Xie are the highest-ranking military and political officials in Eastern Zhejiang. We believe in their personalities and deeply believe that they can implement their conscientious political views. (End of the full text)

### The Valor of the Japanese Air Force in the Southwest Pacific

At the base of the Japanese Army Air Force in the Southwest Pacific, every day is tense. They do not let any good opportunity slip by, always prepared to seize it and annihilate the enemy. Under the battle clouds, the Japanese Army Air Force in the Southwest Pacific has long been preparing for a general offensive. Once the opportunity arrives, they will unleash their might. Here is a brief report on the recent situation of the Japanese eagles in the Southwest Pacific, showing how they are fiercely flying and fighting in the new offensive.

### New Reconnaissance Squadron

To defeat enemy aircraft, it is necessary to fully understand the enemy's situation first. The enemy's air power in the Southwest Pacific is moving under the protection of bad weather in the steep and inaccessible mountains. Therefore, the Japanese reconnaissance aircraft must brave the cumulonimbus clouds and soar over the monstrous Stanley Mountains to search carefully. Their hard work is beyond description. This battle-tested unit honorably received an award during the first attack on Australia. Their sharp eyes will never let enemy aircraft slip away. Coinciding with the establishment of the Second European Front, enemy four-engine large aircraft suddenly disappeared around Australia and New Guinea. The discovery of this situation was the great action of the New Reconnaissance Squadron. When attempting to launch a counteroffensive in the Pacific, there were 300 B24s on Lorengau Island in the Admiralty Islands, 200 P38s and others in Dutch New Guinea, about 100 in Wakde, and 150-60 small aircraft in Australia, totaling about 800 aircraft. As the New Guinea operation progressed, the B24s advanced further to Biak Island, but because of the fierce attacks by the Japanese bomber squadron, many of the precious large aircraft were lost. Therefore, they were frightened and had no choice but to move these large aircraft back and forth, even though it caused some inconvenience in the operation. All of this was detected by Japanese reconnaissance aircraft. One day, Captain Sasaki flew over the Stanley Mountains and returned from reconnaissance of a certain enemy base in New Guinea. He saw only white clouds floating above the mountain peaks. When a certain mountain, whose peak is often invisible, faintly appeared on the left, it was suddenly enveloped by cumulonimbus clouds. The aircraft was hit by severe turbulence and spiraled down, two hundred meters, three hundred meters. The canopy above his head was also torn off. Captain Sasaki knew things were going badly and made a final struggle to break through the dangerous situation. In the mountains, where his vision was blocked by the cumulonimbus clouds, he boldly made a steep descent. At this time, his vision suddenly cleared, and he realized that the aircraft was flying over the valley in the booklet. Captain Sasaki then followed the valley, passed through the clouds, and looked down, unexpectedly finding the enemy base. He immediately calmly reconnoitered and then returned along the same route. At this time, the cumulonimbus clouds in the valley had dissipated, and Captain Sasaki took the opportunity to conduct a thorough meteorological reconnaissance. In this way, he completely solved its secrets and finally conquered the monstrous Stanley Mountains, which had swallowed many comrades. Now, the New Reconnaissance Squadron knows the terrain and meteorology of the Southwest Pacific like the back of their hand and continues to be active in preparation for the offensive.

### Military Reconnaissance Squadron

The military reconnaissance squadron's active stage was originally the main battlefield of the mainland operation. This entry into the ocean is indeed unprecedented. Because they are rich in practical experience, they are quite able to innovate. Therefore, although they have not been active at sea for long, they are competent in performing tasks such as escorting convoys, commanding communications, bombing, and intercepting. In addition to sinking and destroying eleven enemy submarines and shooting down three enemy aircraft, they have also won seven awards for their meritorious escort of convoys. They have established such remarkable military achievements in the Pacific shortly after their deployment. Captain Shimada of the Maritime Military Reconnaissance Squadron was about to land at a certain base on August 8th when he suddenly encountered a formation of enemy P38s attacking the base. Captain Shimada immediately abandoned the idea of landing and decided to intercept them with a single aircraft. He turned the nose of the aircraft and suddenly rushed into the enemy aircraft formation. The enemy aircraft hastily opened fire. Captain Shimada, known as the authority on model aircraft, had superb piloting skills. The enemy aircraft formation was disrupted by his冲 and 撞, their bullets were wasted, and they had no choice but to return empty-handed. Captain Shimada had also run out of bullets and was about to return to base. Unfortunately, at this time, a new batch of enemy fighter aircraft came. As a result, Captain Shimada, who intercepted more than 30 enemy aircraft with a single aircraft, died heroically in the southern sky. Now, the warriors of the Maritime Military Reconnaissance Squadron are gearing up, determined to avenge their captain.

### Bomber Squadron

To counter the enemy's delusions of a general counter-offensive, the Japanese bomber squadron avoids unnecessary attrition, seizes every opportunity to strike at the enemy's key points, and destroys their various forces with clever tactics. Upon receiving reports of enemy troop concentrations, it immediately dispatches a small number of bombers at night to drop precise heavy bombs. For example, in the recent attack on Wakde, Biak, a few Japanese bombers single-handedly annihilated more than ten times the number of enemy aircraft, while the Japanese side did not lose a single plane. MacArthur stated that, with the acquisition of bases such as Matang, Hollandia, and Biak, the operations around New Guinea have completely ended. However, the ingenious tactics employed by the Japanese bomber squadron force the enemy to go to great lengths to gather aircraft at suitable bases, and even if they are assembled temporarily, half of them must be constantly engaged in patrol flights. Unable to withstand the fierce attacks of the Japanese aircraft, they even resorted to distributing leaflets urging [mutual cessation of night bombing].

### Fighter Squadron

Since the outbreak of the war, aerial heroes have emerged one after another. In the past, there was Hayabusa Nangō, and more recently, there was Fighter Group Commander Takada. Under this tradition of immortal glory, the members of the Japanese fighter squadron active in the Southwest Pacific are continuing the fighting spirit of their fallen comrades, fighting bravely. Countless tragic stories abound, but let's just take the most recent one as an example. This incident occurred at a Japanese base at the tip of New Guinea. On that day, as usual, enemy aircraft arrived on time to harass, consisting of sixty P38s and B25s. The B25 formation flew in to launch a surprise attack from the shade of the mangrove forest sheltering the base at an ultra-low altitude of five to ten meters. At this time, the Japanese aircraft had already shot down more than half of the enemy planes. The enemy aircraft encountered by Sergeant Major Nakamura, unwilling to engage, hurriedly fled. Sergeant Major Nakamura wanted to pursue them, but it was too late. Just as he was feeling annoyed, he happened to see a B25 returning from strafing the ground. He immediately dove his aircraft and charged. Surprised, the enemy aircraft hurriedly raised its nose, intending to climb steeply. Unexpectedly, its tail dipped into the sea at that moment, and it was dragged down by the waves. Sergeant Major Nakamura found the enemy aircraft's predicament both amusing and irritating; amusing because it had tried to escape but instead perished, and irritating because he could not engage in a satisfying battle. In the blink of an eye, Sergeant Major Nakamura had already turned his aircraft and was rapidly approaching another one from the rear and above. The enemy aircraft was unaware of the danger behind it and was rapidly descending on a Japanese aircraft. Just as it was about to open fire, it discovered Sergeant Major Nakamura's aircraft behind it. Unable to escape in time, it plunged into the sea in a steep dive. Sergeant Major Nakamura, pursuing too closely, could not stop in time and followed the enemy aircraft, disappearing into the sea together. In this critical moment, Sergeant Major Nakamura fully pulled back the control stick. At this time, the ground troops watching Sergeant Major Nakamura pursue the enemy aircraft ran towards the beach, believing that Sergeant Major Nakamura had perished with the enemy. Unexpectedly, sea spray splashed, and Sergeant Major Nakamura's aircraft suddenly leaped out of the sea, flew to an altitude of about one hundred meters, and leisurely flew to the airfield, landing on the runway. Everyone who saw it was dumbfounded, stunned for a long time. The miracle of shooting down two enemy aircraft without firing a single bullet and surviving underwater. Therefore, when Sergeant Major Nakamura's aircraft landed safely, the base erupted in cheers, praising his vigorous fighting spirit and miraculous skill (Fukuoka Special Correspondent).

### The Story of a Violin

— By Merrill

[The time has finally come, old friend, the time has finally come—the time when you and I must say goodbye. God knows; I would rather sell myself to replace you, but I am worthless, yet you—do you know, my beloved? A merchant down the street, a man who has everything I have (except you), will give me five hundred dollars if I give you to him. He will give five hundred dollars to a poor wretch who is unclothed, unsheltered, and without even a piece of bread! Why do I hesitate? You are just a few pieces of wood and a few worthless strings, not worth starving for. I just need to take you downstairs—take a few more steps—put you on the counter, and that's it, I'll have five hundred dollars! I can leave this dilapidated garret, I'll have food to eat, which I haven't tasted for a year! I can mingle with a group of wealthy acquaintances, and I'll become one of them. Five hundred dollars! Ah, that's a fortune, a considerable fortune! All for you, you gutless thing, you don't know hunger, you, you soulless shell. No, wait! Am I sure?] The man plucked the strings of the Guarnerius with his finger and lowered his head to listen, the soft sound waves like sweet, blurred memories. [Your E string is a little low,] the man said, [well, that doesn't matter.] Overwhelmed by a sudden decision, he hastily stood up, opened the violin case, and threw the Guarnerius into it. He hesitated again, the faint sound of the instrument vaguely audible, as if a painful groan. The man picked up the Guarnerius again, cradled it in his arm, and pressed his cheek against it. [What, old friend, did I hurt you? Ah! I mistreated you, you do have a soul, I even believe you can remember?] [Let me think, how long has it been? Twenty, thirty, thirty-five years, we have spent most of our lives together, and before that, I had already known you. You were in an old goods store, the person who kept you had been with you even longer. Whenever someone came, he would show you to them, let them see your mark [Cremona, 1731], but he was unwilling to sell you, perhaps because he had not yet tasted hunger. I loved you then, loved this wooden, lifeless thing. I loved to hold you, listen to you sing, I yearned to have you—I had never yearned for anything before.] [One day, the old man gave you to me. [[Give me your old violin,] he said, [and you can take my Cremona!] [[Take it?] I exclaimed. [[Yes,] the old man said, [take it! Because I am sure you will take good care of it. I am old, others will take possession of it, the Cremona will surely fall into the hands of strangers, I don't want that to happen, I would rather give it to you.] [So I took you home, sat up half the night, gently drawing the bow across your strings. I was truly the happiest person in the world, I thought. I put you where I could touch you as soon as I woke up in the morning, not even a kingdom would I trade you for! But, I wasn't hungry then!] The man still held the violin, pressed against his cheek, tenderly plucking the strings, as if talking to himself in the night, seemingly unaware of what he was saying. [Thirty-five years, we have witnessed the world together, we have tasted joy and sorrow together, emperors, beggars, all have listened to you, loved you.] [Do you still remember that night in Berlin? When we were playing [Dream], that beautiful woman in the box on the right threw down a large rose, it caught on the strings—a thorn caught on the strings. When I tried to take it off, the blood-red petals fell at my feet, and so I played [The Last Rose of Summer]. I am sure you had a soul that night, I felt your heart trembling with the vibration of your strings. At the end of the piece, people's eyes were filled with tears, and she, music had possessed her, I thought. She stood up, shouting: [No, no! This is not the last rose, the world is full of roses, look!] She threw down a large bouquet of red and white flowers. [I wondered if she loved me more or you? When the roses (all the roses in the world) were in bloom, she faded away sadly. You must still remember these things, old friend! When it was dark, the others left her body and left, we went to say goodbye to her. At that time, the world was full of roses, and I placed them on her grave, and then you began to sing. Ah! How touchingly you sang! I often believed that your soul carried the fragrance of roses and spread it in your songs. Later, when we were performing, someone threw down a rose, I stepped on it. When she had disappeared, what right did roses have to bloom again?] [From that time on, our lives went bad, there was nothing in the world to fight for, and you became even more precious, because you were the only one who understood me. I even said you had no soul, forgive me, old friend! A person's words when hungry should not be condemned?] [Ah, what a foolish thing I am! Stop rambling on about an old violin, I must fill my empty stomach!] The man resolutely stood up, rudely placed the Guarnerius in the case, slammed the lid shut, picked it up, hesitated again, listening to the strings vibrating from the rough tossing. He heard a sigh, as faint as the last breath of farewell exhaled from the lips of a dead lover. The man took a distressed step, then another, and stopped abruptly, grabbing the violin and holding it in his hands. [No, no, I can't, I can't! I don't want to! I may be—I must be—I must be crazy, but I don't want to do this anyway, I'm not hungry anymore—] The man opened the case and picked up the violin again, holding it in his arms like a child. [I dreamed of selling you, my baby! But a demon tempted me! The demon of hunger, now it's gone, I'm very happy, very content. Come, sing me a song, I'm really happy.] The man raised the Guarnerius and drew the bow. [Ah, this E string is much better, now we are both well, we are happy, aren't we? Sing her roses for me, look! She's in that box over there, in the flowers, she's smiling, she's throwing bouquets at us, red ones. While she's listening, we must do our best, all the strength we have.] Bright eyes flashing with brilliance, pale cheeks flushed with red, hunger and annoyance had been banished to the distant clouds, things already forgotten. He was again the master of music, the garret room had gradually expanded... expanded into a magnificent concert hall, where thousands of distinguished guests sat, holding their breath under the sacred, harmonious sounds. His own soul was breathing on the strings, and people were moved, trembling with weeping, swaying with wild laughter, they were shouting loudly. [Listen! Listen! My companion!] The man shouted: [Good! Once more! Ah! Tonight we have conquered the world, how brightly the light shines! This is ecstasy—this is heaven!] The music sounded louder and louder, the bow moved faster and faster. Snap! A string broke, snap—another string! Transcendental syllables. Subsided into a sad whisper, the hand holding the bow became unsteady; the coarse gaze stopped its feverish flickering, focusing on a point to the right, the tense expression relaxed into a smile, the voice was low and slender! [Another rose, my beauty! My peerless beauty! The light is dim, my vision is blurred, I can only see you, only you!] Crack! The last string also broke. (Translated by Qi Luo)

### Recommendation of [Long Live Teachers]—An Introduction for Those Concerned About Education

— Lin Qiu

○...Recently, I had an extremely pleasant experience, which was seeing a good play and a good movie—[Jin Xiaoyu] and [Long Live Teachers]. [Jin Xiaoyu] (performed with great effort) can be said to be a work of [equal skill and strength] in the recent theatrical scene, whether in terms of writing, directing, or acting; and [Long Live Teachers] is a rare good movie in recent years. ○...As the title suggests, this film is based on the lives of teachers and truthfully exposes a corner of the rotten elementary school education in Shanghai, the hardships of teachers' lives, and also depicts a group of people working hard for this sacred cause in extremely difficult circumstances. War is a kind of ruthless destruction. On the one hand, we must try our best to make effective sacrifices, and on the other hand, we must try our best to make possible arrangements. The problem of education is a major issue in cultivating vitality. The enthusiastic support and generous donations from all parties to the student aid movement organized by Shen Bao in previous years are proof of the importance that people in society attach to this reality. However, [Long Live Teachers], as a film that is a part of cultural activities, can be so closely connected to reality, and express it in a very concrete and very moving way with mature art, cannot but be said to be an innovation. ○...We have seen Mr. Sang Hu, the writer and director of [Long Live Teachers], in his previous films [Flesh], [Wedding Night], [Meeting After Dusk], and [I Am Originally Sick]. Although he made appeals in each of his works, what was even more dazzling was the moving story. [Long Live Teachers] is the only example of being able to convey the author's thoughts so clearly and descriptively, following the intended goal. But our author is subtle, so he used such a light touch to write about such a major issue. It is light, but intimate, so that people do not feel awkward or heavy. The author's creative tendency can be especially seen in the depiction of the characters. These characters have some of the author's ideal colors, but they are all vivid and flesh-and-blood images. They are all very ordinary, with their upward mobility, but also with their shortcomings. They are human beings, not gods, even the dancer Zhang Nana, who is wandering in the mud, is just a [spiritual person] who cannot be said to be absent. ○...What is surprising is the author's directing skills. It is said that [Long Live Teachers] is Mr. Sang Hu's directorial debut, and from this, we can see the depth of the author's cultivation. The whole film progresses harmoniously, like flowing clouds and flowing water, natural and light, and the author's talent shines everywhere. Even the most subtle places are not let go. One point that can be specially mentioned about its unique technique is the [dissolve] between the scenes throughout the film. Such a bold attempt, and being able to do it so smoothly and freely, seems to be unseen in Chinese films in my shallow experience. ○...The author would like to recommend [Long Live Teachers] to audiences who love film art with great joy, and introduce it to people who care about education issues.

### Thoughts After Listening to the Sino-Western Music Charity Performance

— Shu Jun

The unprecedented Sino-Western music performance has ended yesterday! Of course, this performance is related to the fate of many students going to school, but at the same time, it can also inspire people in this city full of decadent music to have a little awareness of proper entertainment. In particular, national music, it is the national quintessence that has been handed down for thousands of years, but in recent years it has become like a lonely orchid in an empty valley, gradually withering due to being not valued by people! This time, with the efforts of well-intentioned people such as the National Music Research Association, it is blooming again with colorful colors! When I was sitting in the Lyceum and quietly listening to the performance, my heart and soul were also floating with the melodious and moving music! Although I am not Zhou Lang who cares about the music at the banquet, I would like to use the line [This song should only be in heaven, how can it be heard a few times in the world] to praise him. Everyone who has listened to the performance cannot say that it is an exaggeration, right? Especially Mr. Sun Yude's pipa is really playing with superb skills. The sentence [Big beads and small beads falling on a jade plate] in Bai Juyi's Pipa Xing is really not an exaggeration to describe it. The clear and melodious sound of the pipa deeply harmonized with my heartstrings, and I was completely intoxicated! There is also Mr. Zhang Ziqian's guqin, which is elegant and detached from the mundane. It is said that, like Mr. Sun's pipa, he has worked hard for more than twenty years, so it is no wonder that his reputation is famous at home and abroad, and it is by no means accidental. During the ensemble of various instruments, the sound is harmonious, melodious and moving, and there are no drawbacks of noise, unevenness, and disharmony. Perhaps some people say that national music is too monotonous and not as complicated as Western music, but I believe that the beauty of music lies in being able to move people and arouse inner resonance in the audience. If we only use the simplicity and complexity of notes to determine the entire art, it would be too [measuring the sea with a dipper]. In short, I feel that national music has both the desolation and generosity of tragedy, and the gentleness of clearness and moving, it is really a myriad of changes in the orchestra! It is the supreme holy product for cultivating temperament, and it is also the treasure of ancient oriental countries. I hope that the Chinese people who love good music will work hard to discover it, promote it, and carry it forward!

### Introduction to the Ten Powerful Teams in the Shen Bao Cup Basketball League A Division

The Shen Bao Cup Basketball League, organized by this newspaper, has been in preparation for more than a month. Thanks to the enthusiastic support from all parties, it is all ready. And the curtain was raised the night before last (the 6th) in the gymnasium of the Japanese Army Dormitory, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. Because the venue is suitable, it is expected that there will be even more grand occasions in the future. According to this time, all ten teams in Group A are invited, and Group B will first accept registration, and then select and record according to circumstances. As a result, 76 teams registered. Due to the problem of venue allocation, the authorities had no choice but to record only 36 teams, divided into 16 divisions for competition. The committee authorities expressed deep apologies to the teams that were not recorded. At the time of the opening of the curtain, a brief introduction to the strength and tactics of the ten strong teams in Group A is made to serve as a guide for fans.

### Abundant Talents in the Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory

This team is organized by colleagues from the Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory. In the last Xiqing League, they won the championship in one fell swoop, shocking the basketball world. The players are all veterans of the arena, and fans are already familiar with Qu Xilin and Kong Guangyi. What makes them superior is that they can see the enemy's weaknesses and launch attacks. Today's basketball games have progressed to the use of tactics to win. The team's tactics are diverse and can be said to be unique in Shanghai, which should be attributed to the brain of the instructor Zhang Weixiang.

### Zhongbei Military Team is the Male of the Northern School

Zhongbei is very popular among fans in Shanghai. This time, in addition to the original team, such as Li Zhenzhong, Shen Yugong, and Li Baozhong, they also invited the famous guard Zhuo Guorong to help. Zhuo's style is known for being fierce and powerful, which is the same as Zhongbei's ball style, and it will be even more exciting. It is expected that this northern school army will have a very satisfactory masterpiece in the Shen Bao Cup

### Dahua Recruits Old Soldiers

Under the planning of Yang Shuding, Dahua has recruited soldiers and sold horses this time. Zhang Banglun, a dual-purpose talent in football and basketball, and Zhang Jinxuan, a former famous general of Hualian, came to join him after hearing the news. And old soldiers such as Lu Zhongen, Xu Wenkui, Feng Nianhua, and Zhen Xianglong rose again. The lineup is neat. Its future will be brilliant, and the past glory of Paramount can be easily seen in this Dahua team.

### Huanan Liu's Rising Star

The Huanan team is organized by the Liu brothers. Two years ago, they were still in the B team, but because their team members are young and strong, not arrogant or impetuous, they have made rapid progress, not letting the old generals. Now they have also obtained the guidance of senior Zhang Le, so there is no need to worry about the lack of people to manage. The team's tactics are known for their speed and freshness, without any incompatibility. The spirit and technology have gradually improved, and it is worthy of being a rising star

### Shantou Hometown Ambitious

Renyu's main general Ma Canxi and forward shooting star Lin Weicong have been recruited by Lin Zuoshi this year and belong to the Shantou team. According to the Shantou team's performance, it is in a state of extreme progress. Now that Ma Lin has joined, the fierce tiger has wings, and it should not be taken lightly. It is predicted that when the team competes in the future, the Shantou folks will definitely cheer loudly. According to its performance, it can compete with the strong teams for a day's length, and it is also a promising team.

### Movie Stars Are Normal

Appearing on the court in the posture of a movie star has a greater appeal, but tracing back to the team's ball skills, because of Qian Xucang's patient guidance, Li Dashen and Wu Wenchao's supervision from the side, and the team leader Shu Shi's spiritual example. Therefore, the film has already made people in the basketball world look at each other. Recently, they won the Phoenix Cup championship, which shows their recent situation. Check that the team members are full of vigor, and there should be better harvests.

### Renyu Team is Hosted by Yu and Li

The last time in the Zhongqing League, it caused a sensation for a while, and they were hoping to achieve something. Unfortunately, Lin Weicong and Ma Canxi's departure reduced their strength sharply, and they are not what they used to be. The remaining two generals, Yu Huanzi and Li Zhaohe, host the Central Plains, and those who assist them are young generals who have just emerged and need to be tempered. However, it is also a great thing to extract new people from this.

### Star Perfume Leadership

The Star team organized by Zhou Wenji, the director of the Star Perfume Factory, has many strong players under his command, such as Shen Dafan, Xi Rong, and Wang Jinghu, who have long been famous. This time, Tao Shaosheng and He Xiaoguang also joined, and their strength is very average. The author believes that although the team does not have the ambition to win the Central Plains in the league, based on its experience, it will definitely pose a threat to the strong teams and may create upsets. Team leader Zhou Zhonggang has always had research on basketball, so he has created a lot.

### V Team New Army Zibin Training

The V team is a new army trained by Wu Zibin, and the list is full of unknown people. In the past, they were in the top state of Group B. When these young heroes are seeking to improve, being able to have this opportunity to learn from each other is the true meaning of liquidating the later generations. After this league, the V team's young generals will definitely be successful, and they will not be worthy of Wu Zibin's hard work.

### Tongren Xuanjia Shooter is Ill

The Xuanjia Class Tongren team must be the most loved by fans in every game, because they show their ball skills to the fullest during the battle, without any bad habits, and their ball skills are also above the standard. They defeated the Oriental and Monocle teams in the Xiqing League, adding to the good stories in the basketball world. This time, because the shooter Xuan Jun is in poor health and cannot exercise according to the doctor, the general hub of the points obtained will only be entrusted to Xuan Tong's hands alone, which will be relatively reduced. In summary, the ten powerful teams in Group A have their own merits. Furthermore, to evaluate it, Zhongbei, Hualian, Dahua, and Shantou teams should be called the Four Heavenly Kings, and the championship hope is also based on these four teams as seeds. However, the spirit and morality of each team are all excellent, and they will create the most complete page in basketball history for the Shen Bao Cup.

### McGinity's Punishment: Suspended from Competition for Four Matches, Pan, Chief Officer of the Three Provinces Overseas Chinese Association, Issues Statement

— Jie Mei

Recently, due to the issue of the Three Provinces Football Team's players' departure and the Overseas Chinese Association team's abrupt withdrawal during the first charity match, there has been much discussion in various circles, and newspapers have also reported on this matter extensively. Mr. Pan, the chief officer of the two teams from the Three Provinces, explained the matter in detail to the author. A record of his statement is as follows: [The other day, I discussed the issue of the players' affiliation and expressed my feelings about the sudden request for withdrawal by a small number of players from the Three Provinces team, which I organized. As soon as this statement was made, it provoked an immediate reaction. The players concerned appealed to various circles through newspapers, which I found astonishing after reading. The reason is that since these players have firmly requested to change their affiliation to other teams, I could not force them to stay. The Football Association has its own appropriate handling of the matter, so how can one allow those who speak irresponsibly to constantly criticize? Regarding the players' claim that they had to leave due to professional reasons, it is truly perplexing. Football and profession are two different things, and the principle is very clear. If one plays football solely for professional reasons, it will foster bad habits and even lead to misunderstandings with the players' amateur status, which I do not approve of. However, I will never hinder them in this matter, nor is there any need to hinder them. They can leave if they want to, so what more can be said? However, I feel regret that pure and flawless players are suddenly tempted by greed. Now that the Football Association gentlemen are handling this matter impartially, I sincerely hope that the general players will not make any more unnecessary appeals, which will only create another rift in the sports community. Also, during the first charity match the other day, the Overseas Chinese Association team withdrew halfway through, which has been widely criticized. In fact, while it is true that Captain McGinity's leading the team off the field was a lack of sportsmanship, McGinity is an Italian representative to the World Games, with advanced experience and skills. His quiet departure may have been due to his indignation. Whether the referee's judgment was flawed is a matter of opinion and difficult to conclude. I did not express any opinion when the team left the field the second time, so I did not try to stop them again. The reason was that McGinity and the others were at the height of their anger at that time, and trying to persuade them to stay might not have been effective. If that were the case, how would I have handled myself? The Football Association has now punished McGinity by suspending him from competition for four matches as a warning to others.]
