### The Divine Wind Special Attack Force Continues Fierce Bombing of Enemy Vessels; Enemy Ships Burning Near Mindoro Island

Central News Agency, Front Line Base, Philippines, 18th – Japanese air forces have been fiercely attacking enemy troops invading Mindoro Island for days. On the 15th, Japanese air forces discovered an enemy aircraft carrier heading north from the Sulu Sea towards Mindoro Island and immediately attacked and destroyed it. On the morning of the 16th, the Divine Wind Special Attack Force launched a fierce attack on enemy transport convoys sailing near Semirara Island, south of Mindoro Island. Although detailed battle results have not yet been confirmed, the damage inflicted on the enemy appears to be very significant. On the evening of the same day, Japanese air forces also attacked an enemy transport ship fully loaded with troops in the sea area north of Ilin Island, south of Mindoro Island. The enemy ship was hit and caught fire. Throughout the 16th, Japanese air forces continued to fiercely attack enemy ships, especially the Divine Wind Special Attack Force, which fiercely attacked enemy mobile units heading north from the Sulu Sea.

Sino-British News Agency, Front Line Base, Philippines, 18th – Since the enemy fleet appeared in the Sulu Sea three days ago, it has been repeatedly attacked by Japanese air forces, with 29 ships sunk to the bottom of the sea. Enemy ships, cruising in the sea area northwest of Panay Island and south of Mindoro Island, engaged in a fierce air-sea battle with Japanese air forces in the Sulu Sea area. On the 15th, Japanese fighter squadrons fiercely rammed enemy ships in the sea area west of Panay Island, displaying high morale and achieving great results.

Central News Agency, Japanese Military Base, Philippines, 18th – On the morning of the 17th, at approximately 10:00 AM, a Japanese reconnaissance plane scouted the sea area near the enemy landing site on Mindoro Island and confirmed that two enemy medium-sized transport ships and several landing craft were on fire.

### Asahi Light Flying Squadron Achieves Merit, Three Sergeants Specially Commended; Japanese Reconnaissance Squadron Also Given Award Certificates

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th – Since the enemy Americans landed near San Jose on Mindoro Island on the morning of the 15th, the battle situation in the Philippines and the fighting on Leyte Island have become increasingly active and significant. In response, new air force units and special attack units, embracing the spirit of daring to die and kill enemies, sank as many as 25 enemy ships in the three days from the 13th to the 15th. Subsequently, they combined with the army and navy to continuously and fiercely attack enemy transport convoys south of Mindoro and enemy mobile units east of Luzon Island. In the Mindoro Island area, attacks were launched twice, on the evening of the 15th and at dawn on the 16th. The battle results confirmed so far include the sinking of five warships and transport ships. In addition, it is assumed that there were also considerable battle results from Japanese aircraft that did not return. Furthermore, at the same time as the announcement of the battle results by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters today, special commendations were given to three sergeants of the Asahi Light Flying Squadron, Hotta Tatsushiro, Suzuki Muratoji, and Maruyama Yoshio, for establishing outstanding achievements. According to reports, Sergeant Hotta's aircraft invaded the sea area south of Mindoro on the evening of the 15th and launched a desperate attack on an enemy warship or large cruiser. After seventeen minutes, the enemy ship sank. At dawn on the 16th, two aircraft piloted by Asahi Light Flying Squadron members Suzuki and Maruyama first sank an enemy large transport ship in the sea area west of San Jose. The other aircraft further penetrated the transport convoy in the sea area south of that location and dared to ram it, but the battle results have not yet been determined. Regarding the battle results of the air force, on the evening of the 15th, a fierce attack was launched on an enemy transport convoy in the sea area southeast of Mindoro Island, sinking two of its large transport ships and one medium-sized transport ship. Following this battle result, an even fiercer attack was launched on enemy mobile units in the sea area east of Luzon Island, and the battle results obtained are also quite promising.

Central News Agency, Front Line Base, Philippines, 18th – In this fierce Philippine air battle, the Japanese reconnaissance squadron quickly scouted the enemy's landing situation on Mindoro Island, making many contributions to this operation, and was able to confirm the battle results of the special attack units and scout enemy mobile units, accumulating outstanding achievements. Lieutenant General Tominaga Kyoji, commander of the army air force units in the Philippines, specially awarded award certificates on the evening of the 16th.

### Fierce Battle on Mindoro Island, Enemy Blocked on Leyte Island

Central News Agency, Japanese Military Base, Front Line, Philippines, 18th – After enemy troops, along with an aviation construction unit of approximately one division, forcibly landed near San Jose on Mindoro Island on the 13th, they are currently engaged in fierce battles with Japanese troops. It is speculated that the enemy intends to use this as a foothold to then break out in other directions. On the 16th, a powerful enemy fleet was on standby in the Sulu Sea south of Mindoro Island and has been continuously and fiercely attacked by Japanese air forces. However, the enemy's intention to expand the Philippine operations further northwest seems to be something to be valued. Furthermore, on the Leyte front, the enemy continues to increase its troop strength. By the 14th, it had invaded the mountainous area north of Ormoc. The Japanese garrison there is working hard to block the enemy's 77th Division, which is attempting to move south, and at the same time, it is completely blocking the enemy's 7th Division, which is attempting to move north, in the area between Damulaan and Caridad. Furthermore, in northern Leyte, Japanese units, seeking to improve the battle results by cutting off the ground communication between the 77th Division and the 7th Division, have secured the mountainous area south of Managhas and Capoocan, completely blocking the enemy's attempt to move south.

### Enemy American Base on Morotai Island; Supply Weakening

Central News Agency, Southern Front Line Base, 18th – Japanese commando units on Morotai Island have been conducting overnight surprise attacks on enemy airfields and nearby camps and other facilities. The enemy's supply plan has been completely disrupted. Since December, the number of enemy aircraft attacking the Philippines via Halmahera Island has decreased. Before late November, the average was approximately 120 aircraft per day, but now it is only 35 aircraft. At the same time, the average number of enemy aircraft taking off from Morotai Island has dropped from 65 per day to 10 aircraft. This shows a glimpse of the weakening of the enemy's supply. To avoid bombing by the Japanese air force, the enemy bases on Morotai and in the Philippines have withdrawn their main large aircraft to the Twin Islands and Biak areas.

### Third Discussion on Rice Policy

Since this round of rice price surge, it has stimulated a general increase in commodity prices, and the people's livelihood has been severely threatened. People are panicking and extremely anxious. Relevant authorities have been very concerned. We have discussed this issue twice before, and still have more to say. Now, based on our observations, we would like to offer our humble opinions as follows:

(1) Yesterday, we pointed out that collusion between unscrupulous merchants in this city and some unscrupulous merchants in the suburban areas of counties is the main reason for this round of price increases, which should not be ignored. Before the soaring rice prices, rumors were fabricated, and therefore, there was a surge in gold and stocks first, which was a response. Because the unscrupulous merchants in the suburban areas of counties are not acting alone, the behind-the-scenes instigators are all big unscrupulous merchants who are accustomed to creating waves. These unscrupulous merchants are fat and bloated, filled with greed and selfishness, and only care about their own wealth and enjoyment. They pursue exorbitant profits by any means, one family laughs while ten thousand cry, they are simply bloodless devils. Therefore, we advocate thoroughly investigating and severely punishing unscrupulous merchants, which is a necessary measure. Instead of everyone crying, it is better for one family to cry. After investigating and finding solid evidence against these unscrupulous merchants, no matter who they are, they should be punished with the most severe penalties to achieve the effect of killing one to warn a hundred. Suppressing rice prices is the only way to realize the predetermined plan and achieve practical results.

(2) The amount of rice stored should not exceed three months' worth of needs, which has already been clearly announced by the city government. To prevent hoarding, the previous order should be reiterated immediately, that no matter factories, companies, or households, the amount of rice stored should not exceed three months' worth of needs. For those whose current stock exceeds three months, they should apply for registration. Those who are found to have exceeded the limit without registering will have their rice confiscated. To take a step back, storing two months' worth of rice is actually enough, which is already fortunate compared to the general poor citizens who do not have enough food for the next day. Because if the amount of storage is not limited, then those with money will freely compete to buy, giving unscrupulous merchants the opportunity to arbitrarily raise prices. As a result, the greatest victims are the poor masses.

(3) High-end restaurants are not allowed to sell rice, which has long been stipulated by the authorities. But in fact, high-end restaurants are still secretly preparing and selling rice, creating several more places for hoarding rice. We advocate that all first, second, and third-class restaurants should not be allowed to sell rice, but only allowed to sell miscellaneous grain rice, or at most stipulate that rice and miscellaneous grains be used together, in order to reduce the amount of white rice consumed. We believe that being able to fill one's stomach with miscellaneous grains is not a hardship in order to adapt to wartime life.

(4) Yesterday, we advocated centralized retail transactions, so that small vendors can be managed from shouting prices randomly and not be exploited by unscrupulous merchants. This is an emergency and necessary measure. Moreover, the rice for centralized transactions has already been brought into the city by Xiaoshan, it just concentrates those who sell retail along the way in one place for trading. At the same time, the officially set price takes into account the cost and reasonable profit of the small vendors, which has nothing to do with the purchase work in the producing areas. Therefore, we advocate implementing it as soon as possible. If the municipal authorities do not adopt it, then may we ask what other management and control methods the standing committee has to eliminate random shouting and price increases?

(5) Currently, there are approximately three routes for rice dealers to import: one is from Kunshan, Jiading, Zhenru, Caojiadu; the second is from Qingpu, Zhoujiaqiao; the third is from Songjiang, Caohejing, Xujiahui. The cost and profit for each route should not exceed 30,000 yuan. The so-called cost includes extortion along the way. Of course, extortion along the way is illegal and should be strictly prohibited by the authorities, so that the cost can be further reduced.

In conclusion, the severity of the rice issue has already attracted attention from all parties. However, it is necessary to quickly devise effective countermeasures to alleviate the threat to the people's livelihood and reduce the social crisis. We are not afraid of repeating ourselves and offer our humble opinions, and we earnestly hope that the authorities will consider adopting them. Finally, the allocation of rice to households must be advanced and not delayed, which is the minimum necessary condition.

### President Chen's Address to Students in Tokyo; Emphasizing the Responsibility of Cultural Communication

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th – On the fourth day after arriving in Tokyo (18th), President Chen of the Executive Yuan of the National Government specially convened more than 300 representatives of overseas Chinese from various regions and students studying in Tokyo at the Embassy of the Republic of China at 10:00 AM, delivered an earnest speech, and took a group photo. The gist of the speech is recorded as follows:

I am very pleased to be able to talk with you. What I want to talk to you about today is, firstly, the National Government's future主張, and I hope you will thoroughly understand this; and secondly, the awareness that you should have today. After the death of President Wang, the National Government has transformed its sorrow into a spirit of fortitude in order to complete President's will. The National Government's主張 can be simply divided into two: seeking national independence and autonomy externally, and seeking peaceful unification internally. To achieve this goal, we must realize that we cannot always rely on others, but must strive for self-reliance. Therefore, in order to seek national prosperity, we must first strive for self-improvement. Regarding yourselves, the history of Chinese students studying in Japan reached its peak at the end of the Qing Dynasty, with a number of 20,000, but unfortunately, Japan lacked a great politician at that time, which has become a common opinion of later generations. Therefore, very few students studying abroad at that time could understand Japan, which was a great loss between the two countries. But the past is gone, you must first firmly place your own culture in your hearts. The so-called culture can be simply divided into one: morality, and the other: technology. Since China has had students studying abroad, there has been great progress in technology, but in terms of morality, because Chinese and foreign ideas have not been unified, and the central thought has not been established, the country has been in turmoil for many years. In addition, your personal actions are also extremely important. Often, the actions of a few people can cause foreigners to think that the whole country is like this. It must be known that students studying abroad, in addition to studying, are sometimes the object of research by foreigners, so the importance of personal actions can be known. Also, in terms of studying, in addition to textbooks and laboratories, you should also pay attention to the organization of society at all times, choose its excellent points, understand and study them, and try to avoid the bad ones, otherwise you will lose the original meaning of studying abroad.

### Japanese Finance Minister Ishiwatari Hosts a Banquet for President Chen

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th – Japanese Finance Minister Ishiwatari held a banquet on the evening of the 17th to welcome President Chen Gongbo. Chen delivered a speech at the banquet as follows: Now the Greater East Asia War has reached the decisive stage, and China's economic problems also need the assistance and support of Japan. Although China's manpower and material resources are weak, it sincerely hopes to fulfill the obligations of a participating country and the responsibilities of a participating country, so as not to disgrace Mr. Wang's遗志, and to enable us to fulfill our duties and夙愿. Your Excellency has been in China for a long time, and is well aware of the economic problems. How to ensure that military needs are not lacking, how to stabilize people's livelihood, how to adjust finance, and how to continue production, all depend on Japan's cooperation. Your Excellency has a plan in mind, and the Chinese government and people are looking forward to Your Excellency's support, and deeply know that Your Excellency will 指敎. I have learned a lot from Your Excellency during Your Excellency's time in China. The Chinese government and people are deeply impressed by Your Excellency's enthusiasm for China and the appropriateness of Your Excellency's measures. The economies of China and Japan have reached an inseparable relationship. The stability of the Chinese economy is the stability of the rear of Greater East Asia. I hope that Your Excellency will, based on past friendship, examine the current situation and constantly give me 指正, then the Chinese government and people will be deeply grateful.

### Vietnam Will Become a Link in the Greater East Asia Economic Sphere

Central News Agency, Saigon, 18th – The opening of the Continental Longitudinal Road has had a great impact on Vietnam. Vietnam is only connected to Thailand by a single railway line, so the Indochina Peninsula is almost isolated. However, North Vietnam has now become an isolated area on the new continental front line, which will reduce its isolation. Secondly, from an economic point of view, Guangdong and Guangxi used to rely solely on supplies from Japan and central China. This Vietnamese land supply line can import rice from Vietnam, and Vietnam can also expect to exchange food for continental materials. Haiphong, which has been declining for a while, will also restore its former glory of seven years ago. From this point of view, Vietnam will become a link in the Greater East Asia economy and发挥its function.

### Capital's Youth Comfort Chinese and Japanese Wounded Soldiers

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th – The Capital's Youth兴亚 Total Mobilization Movement Implementation Committee, in order to comfort the wounded Chinese and Japanese soldiers, specially sent representatives from the Capital's schools, the New National Drama Troupe, and the Industrial and Commercial Youth Friendship Association, etc., to the Central Army Hospital, the Allied Army First and Second Hospitals, and the Navy Second Hospital at 2:00 PM on the 18th to offer comfort, carrying慰問品 such as fresh flowers and candies, distributed to the wounded soldiers, and there were singing and music performances to express their慰劳.

On the other hand, on the Yunnan-Burma Highway southwest of Bhamo, the Chinese Army, which had been preparing to attack in front of the Japanese army's forward positions, resumed its attack on the 11th. The Japanese troops lured them to the vicinity and inflicted a heavy blow, driving them back and securing the positions.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th – As Japan is about to hold its 86th Diet, the movements of the Yokusan Seijikai are attracting great attention. These movements are centered on the power of the House of Representatives. At this important stage, the Yokusan Seijikai, which has become Japan's only political group, must exert its true strength and fulfill its responsibilities. The specific manifestations are as follows: 1. Due to years of warfare, Japan's true spirit has been revealed. Therefore, the political, economic, and social systems expressed by the inherent spirit must be established as soon as possible. Therefore, the reconstruction of the domestic political system must be carried out decisively. 1. In order to implement strong politics, the government must first be strengthened. Therefore, it is necessary to have forces behind the government, and those forces must be one of the pillars of the people. Secondly, the organizations of the Yokusan Seijikai and Yokusan Sonenkan must be re-examined, and they must be able to adapt to all circumstances at any time. If the above situation is slightly difficult, the Yokusan Seijikai itself must at least acquire a stronger ability to act. 1. Regarding the revision of the laws and regulations on the control of speech, association, and assembly, which are part of wartime criminal law, in order to strongly convey opinions and allow the people's opinions to be conveyed to politics.

### Rural Construction Committee Sends Personnel to Inspect Various Regions

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th – Since the outbreak of the incident, the Rural Construction Implementation Committee of the Executive Yuan has ordered all experimental counties to follow the first phase of the work outline and authorized the county magistrates to handle matters carefully in accordance with local conditions, to be completed before the end of December of this year. Senior officials of the committee have gone to various counties at any time to investigate. In order to understand the implementation of this year's work, the committee has prepared investigation forms and sent special commissioners Wang Zhanglu and Shiru to Jiangning, Dangtu, Kunshan, and Jiashan counties to conduct on-site inspections and report. It is heard that these officials have already departed in recent days.

### The City of Nanjing Holds Winter Relief in the Bitter Cold

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th – In recent days, the north wind has been bitter, and winter has arrived. Poor people who have no clothes or food are in urgent need of relief. In order to understand the winter relief situation in the city this year, a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Mr. Huang Qingzhong, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Social Welfare, yesterday, the 18th. He briefly stated that last year, in order to hold winter relief, the Winter Relief Committee elected him as the chairman, and Mr. Wen Dougelian and Mr. Chou as the vice-chairmen. With the assistance of all parties, the progress was satisfactory. Later, since the winter relief in the city was organized by the city government, the winter relief this year was changed to be organized by the Central Government's Ministry of Social Welfare, and the Ministry of Social Welfare only subsidized a portion of the funds. However, commodity prices have risen several or ten times this year, so the 2 million yuan budgeted for the city is inevitably felt to be insufficient for the many monks, and it is particularly difficult to obtain wheat and rice. Therefore, it is feared that relief rice will not be distributed this year, and relief money will be distributed instead. As for the Social Welfare Bureau, it has already established a shelter yesterday to accommodate as many poor citizens as possible and is actively preparing to handle all relief matters.

Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - Havas reports: Soviet troops launched an offensive south of Slovakia. The Soviets deployed fresh troops to attack between the Ipel and Hron rivers, making only slight progress north of Miskolc. Soviet troops advanced from near Ipolyšág towards the Slovak border and were repelled by a German counterattack from the north. German-Hungarian joint forces attacked the flank of Soviet troops north of Miskolc, inflicting heavy casualties. Soviet attacks on the Engervár-Košice highway were repelled by German-Hungarian forces. The area between the Trave and the Danube has turned into positional warfare. On the east bank of the Danube, the Soviet offensive against the Hungarian bridgehead has slowed. Soviet assault teams are active in the east and north, but without success.

### Large Quantities of American War Materiel Transported to the Soviet Union

Stockholm, 18th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: More than 4.38 million tons of war materiel and other goods manufactured in American factories have been transported to the Soviet government through ports in the Persian Gulf.

### The Soviet-French Alliance and British Anguish

The British Labour Party's organ, the "Daily Herald," commented on the International Civil Aviation Conference currently being held in Chicago with difficulty, sharply attacking Churchill's foreign policy, saying in essence:

"The major governments are unwilling to take responsibility for future world peace. In particular, the American representatives at the conference only seek to maintain America's superior position, ignoring everything else, which has led to the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the conference. Britain, situated between these two major powers, is merely playing the pitiful role of mediator."

This criticism reflects Britain's sleepless nights as it watches the future of the recent Stalin-de Gaulle talks in Moscow. The outcome of the talks between the two giants, Stalin and de Gaulle, will decisively influence the current European political situation. If the Soviet Union and France establish a military alliance, Churchill's planned Western European alliance of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the Scandinavian countries would be stillborn. Britain still insists on this alliance policy, but it is impossible to ignore the Labour Party's constant attacks on Churchill's overly pro-American policy when considering Britain's future actions.

Therefore, the Soviet-French opposition to Britain's unrequited Western European alliance plan has caused an immense psychological crisis in British politics. This is because there is a Labour Party faction within Britain that firmly advocates British participation in the Soviet-French alliance, and there are other factions that emphasize organizing a British-American alliance with small European countries as a buffer. The United States is quite nervous about this pro-Soviet policy advocated by the Labour Party and other Churchill factions.

In summary, the opinions of these anti-Churchill factions are that "A Western European alliance is good, but what is most important is an all-European alliance that includes the Soviet Union." In principle, Britain's basic policy is to oppose the extension of Soviet power into Western Europe and prevent the communization of Europe, and it is most afraid of such events occurring. However, given the current international political situation, some concessions to Stalin's policies are unavoidable in order to avoid political and strategic crises. This painful approach to cooperation with the Soviet Union will naturally provoke two opposing reactions in domestic politics. That is to say, either to continue to depend on the United States along Churchill's political line, or to adopt a policy of distancing from the United States according to the Labour Party's proposal. That is, the opposition between these two proposals.

Washington officialdom is very nervously aware of this situation in Britain and openly criticizes the British government's "alliance plan." The "Nation" correspondent in Washington has firmly asserted: "If Britain and the Soviet Union persuade other European countries to forcibly implement the European alliance plan, the only course of action the United States should take is to not participate in any world security guarantee organization in the future."

There are certainly many reasons for American opposition, but the main one is that the United States believes that the Soviet Union will exercise leadership in a European alliance formed by the alliance of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Therefore, Britain's leadership over Western Europe has been greatly weakened by de Gaulle's recent pro-Soviet attitude, so the United States believes that it cannot but mediate in European affairs at this moment. According to recent news from Washington, American authorities are closely monitoring the left-leaning anti-Anglo-Saxon underground movements that have occurred in France and Belgium. The Soviet Union's diplomatic offensive has shattered the British Western European alliance plan supported by the United States. As long as the Soviet Union consolidates its position in Central Europe, Britain and the United States will inevitably feel uneasy about the recent European international situation. However, the current anxiety has already reached its peak. (Translated by An from the Asahi Shimbun, November 28)

### Central Bank Extends Large Loans to Regulate Interbank Operations / Totaling 200 Million Yuan for Creditworthy Banks

Due to shortfalls in the use of funds by major banks in this city, interbank transfer orders were previously issued for circulation among banks. However, the issuance of these transfer orders was in conflict with the government's unified currency regulations. Therefore, a joint request was made to the Central Reserve Bank to release funds to facilitate operations. This matter has been approved by Zhou (Zikai), the director of the Central Bank. Short-term loans of 200 million yuan will be extended to major banks with reliable credit and genuine needs. The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications will each borrow 50 million yuan. Jin Cheng, Da Lu, Zhongnan, Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial & Savings Bank, Shanghai Commercial Bank, Guoqun, Xinhua, and the Four Banks Savings Association and other ten banks will jointly borrow 100 million yuan. The allocation of these loans to each bank will be based on the amount of deposits as a ratio. It is reported that the two parties have already established a contract.

### Small Economic Restaurants Exempt from Special Consumption Tax / The Finance Bureau is Requesting Instructions on Procedures

On November 25th of this year, the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance issued Public Notice Jia No. 18, stipulating that 14 types of food related to the common people are exempt from the special consumption tax. Item 9 therein stipulates that small restaurants that sell only one rice and one dish specifically for the common people to satisfy their hunger are exempt from the special tax. However, in fact, the local special tax collection authorities in this city have not followed the above notice. In general, restaurants have continued to levy the tax as usual because they have not received a notice from the Special Tax Office. As a result, some customers who have seen the Taxation Department's notice in the newspaper have had disputes with the shops. Yesterday morning (the 18th), a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Director Yuan of the Municipal Finance Bureau specifically regarding this issue. Director Yuan explained the details as follows: According to the Taxation Department's notice, the standard for so-called small restaurants with one rice and one dish is difficult to determine. Currently, the Bureau is requesting instructions from the Ministry of Finance on what the standard should be so that it can be followed. At the same time, in order to prevent merchants from taking advantage of loopholes, the Bureau is notifying these economic small restaurants to register with the Bureau as soon as possible so that their business nature can be determined. Once confirmed to be restaurants selling food specifically to the common people, the Bureau will issue a special mark for identification.

The Municipal Government Orders Subordinate Agencies to Collect Special Tax

The Ministry of Finance believes that the military and political affairs of all provinces and cities have already implemented unification. In order to facilitate the implementation of the special consumption tax to increase tax revenue, it has been decided that the special consumption tax, which is managed by the Taxation Department, will be entrusted to the provincial and municipal governments for collection starting from January 1st of next year. The Taxation Department will still be responsible for supervision and assessment. It is learned that after receiving the order, the Shanghai Municipal Government, in addition to having the Special Tax Office of the Finance Bureau continue to collect the special consumption tax within the urban area in accordance with the regulations, is now preparing to order its subordinate agencies, such as the seven counties of Baoshan, Jiading, Fengxian, Chuansha, Nanhui, and Shenjiang, to collect the special consumption tax as scheduled.

### Price Assessment Committee Adjusts Price Limits for Daily Necessities

Four types of clothing, men's Chinese leather-soled leather shoes at 6,830 yuan per pair, women's Chinese leather-soled leather flat shoes at 5,123 yuan per pair, cotton fabric soled Chinese cloth shoes at 1,493 yuan per pair, and white No. 50, 200-yard, 6-strand, 40-count cotton yarn at 146.85 yuan per piece and 1,762.2 yuan per dozen. All stores must comply with the above price limits for sale. If prices are raised arbitrarily, citizens can report to the Price Assessment Committee or the Economic Security Office, which will impose penalties at that time, including suspension of business.

### Readers' Scholarship News / Promoting "Special Fundraising" is Everyone's Obligation

The reason why this newspaper launched "special fundraising" for scholarships this time and defined it as "special" was originally to raise the required amount in the shortest possible time. Since the time is very pressing, we will of course do our best to run around and respond to the scholarship cause until we are exhausted. The five thousand impoverished students are looking forward to it, as if they are little birds waiting to be fed. What they urgently hope for is that people of all walks of life with money and power will extend their help as soon as possible. First of all, we hope that the authorities of all banks and money shops will have a kind thought and respond enthusiastically by generously donating. A single call will naturally cause all industries to rise up together. Now, without fear of trouble, we are making a plea to the banking and financial community to donate generously to help young people who have dropped out of school. Thinking about the future of the country and the nation is an obligation that every citizen should fulfill, and it is not to be refused. Yesterday, Chen and Han, interns from Juyi Money Shop, donated one month's salary of more than 7,000 yuan, which is commendable. We only hope that everyone in the industrial and commercial community will smoke one less cigarette or save one bus fare. If it is collected together, it will be quite considerable. Reader Yongjun, with just your word, you can unleash the power of "collective" and have a great time.

Baihe Heming Responds to Special Fundraising

Mr. Chen Cunren, a famous doctor, organized "One Hundred Branches for Scholarships" and donated 150,000 yuan. "One Hundred Branches for Scholarships" has been organized for three sessions, independently bearing the tuition fees of 20 university students (changed to 15 in the last session). It has supported many students until they finish their university studies. Mr. Chen is an expert in internal medicine, with rich academic experience and excellent skills. He is not someone with great financial resources, but someone with a salary that is not much higher than others, but he is kind-hearted and determined to help poor students. In this regard, we can see his far-sighted strategy and great personality. There are more than a hundred famous Chinese and Western doctors in Shanghai, and it is hoped that they can all take on the scholarship cause. Mr. Zeng Dansheng promised in "Heming" that Mr. Yang donates to scholarships every year, and he is an enthusiastic person who is rare in the business community. If everyone in the industrial and commercial community takes Mr. Yang as an example and donates to scholarships, then the goal of 20 million yuan this time will not be difficult to achieve as scheduled. On behalf of the five thousand students, I implore you to read this appeal!

Yesterday, I visited students Yan Fang and Zhang Jia Song (who donated one month's salary for assistance) who jointly donated 7,155 yuan, Zhang Dapei and Gao Yongrong, 5,000 yuan each, and Zhang Wenzeng, Zhang Wenqing, Mr. Ye, Mr. Dong, and Mr. Ye, 2,000 yuan each. The students of a primary school kindergarten (savings from tuition fees) donated 1,455 yuan, Ye Yueyu donated 1,445 yuan, Zhang Jiuqing and Kong Youyu donated 1,000 yuan each, Yang Zhongyi and Mr. Shen donated 500 yuan each, Tong Yongji donated 200 yuan, Ms. Ling donated 100 yuan, and Mr. Shi donated 45 yuan. A total of 33,400 yuan was collected in banknotes, and the remaining balance was 6,892,973 yuan.

### Reorganization of the Commercial Control Commission: An Overview of the Work of the Five Control Committees (1)

The National Commercial Control General Association was ordered to reorganize, and the handover procedures between the old and new chairmen of the board of directors were completed on July 1, 1944. The internal affairs agencies were reduced from five departments (General Affairs Department, Finance Department, General Affairs Department, Materials Department, Audit Department) and one office (Secretariat) to two departments (Management Department, Planning Department) and one office (Secretariat). Under the General Association, there are five control committees for rice and grain, cotton industry, flour and wheat, oil and grain, and daily necessities, which serve as implementation agencies to handle all control matters separately. The main tasks of the General Association are supervision, guidance, liaison, research, and recommendations. The following is an excerpt of the overview of the work of each control committee after the reorganization:

(1) Flour and Wheat Control Committee (1) Process of Reorganization

In mid-June, this committee was informed by the Commercial Control General Association that, according to the Executive Yuan's Instruction No. 5866, in order to adapt to the wartime system, this committee should be reorganized into the Flour and Wheat Control Committee. All fifteen articles of the organizational regulations have been approved and promulgated by the Executive Yuan, and were issued along with the document, ordering immediate compliance with the reorganization. Subsequently, this committee was also informed by the Commercial Control General Association that, according to the Executive Yuan's Instruction No. 5915, Sun Zhongli was designated as the chairman of this committee, Inoue Yasutada as the vice-chairman, and Li Yingmao, Shi Fuhou, Jiang Hongbin, Konjo Tatsuo, and Nagata Hiroshi as standing committee members, and Wang Xiaoshui, Yamaguchi Hideo, etc. as committee members. Later, a special appointment certificate No. 670 from the National Government was received, specially appointing Sun Zhongli as the chairman of this committee. In accordance with these instructions, this committee was reorganized from the former Flour and Wheat Professional Committee into the Flour and Wheat Control Committee on June 21, continuing to handle control matters related to wheat and flour-based products such as noodles.

(2) Internal Organization

This committee has a secretary-general and two deputy secretaries-general under the committee. It adopts a "one office, three departments" system, namely, the Secretariat, and the First, Second, and Third Departments. Several secretaries and specialists are stationed, directly under the secretary-general. In addition, there are two sections, General Affairs and Audit, to handle personnel, documents, general affairs, and planning review and statistics. The First Department has three sections: Procurement, Special Needs, and Transportation, handling matters such as the procurement, special needs, transportation, warehousing, and insurance of wheat. The Second Department has three sections: Product Manufacturing, Factory Improvement, and Improvement, handling matters such as the manufacturing, processing, and distribution of flour bran, as well as inspection, production improvement, etc. The Third Department has two sections: Finance and Audit, handling matters such as accounting, cashier, and fund business accounting. Each department has a director and deputy director, and each section has a chief and deputy chief. Each section can be divided into units for handling affairs.

Summary of Work

1.  Formulation of Procurement, Processing, Movement, and Distribution Methods: The new control policy for this year adopts independent operation, which is more strengthened than last year. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate new regulations as a basis. Based on the new policy, four provisional methods, "Flour and Wheat Procurement," "Flour and Wheat Manufacturing and Processing," "Flour and Wheat Movement and Extraction," and "Flour and Wheat Distribution," were formulated separately and submitted to the Executive Yuan. They were amended and promulgated by the Executive Yuan's Instruction No. 6153 on July 5 and forwarded to the association by the Commercial Control Commission. All flour and wheat control matters are implemented accordingly.

2.  Designation of Agents and Purchasing Merchants and Registration of Grain Stores: According to the provisional method for flour and wheat procurement, the system of operators engaged in wheat procurement under the jurisdiction of this association should be "agents," "purchasing merchants," and "grain stores" in three levels. After selecting five companies with sufficient capital, excellent credit, and cooperation in control, namely, Fook, Fu-Hsin, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Shanghai Wheat Grain, as agents; and from the commissioned merchants and vendors of the previous year, selecting those who are excellent and trustworthy, recommended by the agents, and designated sixty-six companies such as Jifu, Fufeng, and Datong as purchasing merchants; as for grain stores in various places, they will be registered separately by each office. Each business will carry out wheat procurement under the leadership of the agent.

3.  Taking Over the Permit of Movement Affairs and Establishing Movement Rules: The permit of flour and wheat movement affairs has been handled by the Permit Office of the Commercial Control General Association. Since the establishment of this association after reorganization, according to the duties conferred by the new organizational regulations, after consultation with the Permit Office, this association took over the handling of the affairs on July 11. A permit affairs group was established under the Secretariat, and in accordance with the provisional method for the suppression of flour and wheat movement, thirty-one movement rules and sample certificates of permit were formulated and sent to relevant agencies for reference. Since the implementation, it has been going smoothly.

4.  Establishment of Procurement and Storage Funds of 300 Million Yuan Each: The procurement funds of the previous year have been gradually repaid. This year's payment is still being handled through the Central Reserve Bank and the Japanese Embassy. Through negotiations with the Bank of China and six Japanese banks, 300 million yuan for wheat procurement funds and 300 million yuan for flour and wheat funds were established, with Chinese and Japanese banks each bearing half, that is, 150 million yuan each. The aforementioned funds' discount contract was signed on July 25 and reported to the Ministry of Finance for guarantee. However, among the 150 million yuan of storage funds from Japanese banks, 40 million yuan is in the form of overdraft, which does not require the Ministry of Finance guarantee. The interest rate and term are the same as the previous term.

5.  Approval of Wheat Purchase Prices in Various Places: Last year's wheat purchase price was the same in all places, but in fact, the environment in each place is different, and the living conditions are also different, so it was not fair. This year, a flexible approach is adopted for the wheat price in various places, and it will be approved separately according to the situation in each place, and reported to the Commercial Control General Association for submission to the Executive Yuan for record. All wheat purchase prices for this year will be based on this approval as the standard.

6.  Using Own Funds to Start Procurement in All Locations: Wheat harvesting has a season. If the opportunity is missed, it will cause difficulties. Before the payment was established, in order to seize the opportunity, this association used its own funds of agents and purchasing merchants to engage in procurement in advance, and set up bonus measures to show encouragement. The procurement performance was satisfactory. When the loan was established and issued, the use of these own funds was stopped immediately.

7.  Designation of Wheat Storage Warehouses in Various Places: This year's control policy strengthens wheat, which is purchased by this association and entrusted to various factories for grinding. Therefore, in areas where wheat is concentrated, wheat storage warehouses are designated to facilitate centralized transportation and reduce procurement resistance. About 30 designated warehouses have been arranged in various places for the use of various businesses to store wheat.

8.  Convocation of Meeting of Directors of Various Offices: Since this year's new control policy is different from last year, in order to make the offices in various places fully understand, a meeting of directors of various offices was held from June 28 to July 1. The new organizational regulations of this association and the provisional methods for procurement, manufacturing, movement, and distribution were explained in detail by the responsible standing committee members and section chiefs in turn, so that the offices in various places could take this opportunity to communicate.

9.  Changing Yangzhou Branch to Office: This association originally had nine offices in Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Bengbu, and Taixian. Now, in order to strengthen wheat procurement and transportation management in the Yangzhou area, which is a transportation hub in the Jiangbei production areas, the Yangzhou branch, which belongs to the Zhenjiang office, is changed to an office to provide direct guidance. The director is still concurrently served by the director of the Zhenjiang office to achieve efficient results.

10. Adjustment of Work of Various Flour Mills: The flour milling facilities of the various flour mills under this association reach a total of 46,064 units per hour. However, according to this year's procurement plan, the flour milling capacity of about 23,323 units per hour is sufficient. Therefore, the production capacity of various factories still has a surplus. Therefore, the flour milling performance, electricity consumption, and geographical conditions of various factories are fully reviewed, and thirty factories are selected to continue operations. The remaining thirteen factories will be temporarily suspended uniformly to save consumption and facilitate consolidation. For factories that have stopped work, the association will provide maintenance fees to cover daily expenses. When the procurement performance exceeds the scheduled quantity, they will be prepared to start work at any time.

### On "Automatic Resignation"

— Xian

Due to the increasing approach of Shanghai's socio-economic crisis, business leaders in various locations had already begun discussing coping strategies a month or two ago. These business leaders believed that reducing sales expenses was the only way to prepare for the future, as increasing revenue was no longer possible today. And the most effective way to tighten spending was to reduce staff; thus, after one company initiated the "automatic resignation" of its employees, many companies (including printing, insurance, department stores, cotton cloth, pharmacies, and pharmaceutical factories) began to lay off employees under various pretexts.

This issue immediately captured the attention of public opinion. In addition to a discussion held by the Business School of a certain university in this city, two articles reviewing the issue of layoffs were published in Shen Bao one after another. The author believes that it is still worth discussing. Therefore, I hereby provide my opinions as follows:

(1) How is the problem formed? - Everyone with economic common sense can realize that the prosperity not long ago was morbid. Because this prosperity is not based on the coordination of production and consumption, but on the characteristic of hoarding and speculation. We see everyone busy, but where is the production? Isn't it just kicking the ball around, wearing hats, and shouting high prices? In fact, social wealth is only decreasing day by day. Since the necessities used as speculation objects are decreasing, the people engaged in speculation will naturally also decrease, and the scope of the agencies engaged in speculation will also shrink. With the increasing scarcity of daily necessities and the sharp rise in prices, the reduction of electricity, and the stagnation of production, the individual activities or company businesses belonging to this scope have also begun to shrink.

(2) What are the current standards and methods for layoffs? - As far as the author knows, the people who are laid off are probably of the following two types: (A) those with poor work performance and positions that are not very important; (B) those who do not have close personal relationships with industrial and commercial enterprises or who do not have any relationships at all. The methods of layoff include (A) when the number of people laid off is too large, the company drafts an "automatic resignation letter" and distributes it for completion. If the "applicant" is considered important or closely related by the company, the authorities will retain them; if the "applicant" who has been "predetermined" by the company does not apply automatically, there will be no severance pay for possible dismissal in the future. (B) Direct dismissal without any formalities. (C) Stipulating the percentage of people to be laid off and the standards for layoffs, implementing "automatic resignation," and no exceptions are allowed regardless of the relationship with the company or the situation of the laid-off person. The compensation for layoffs varies depending on the nature of the enterprise and the position. As far as the author knows, the highest is 800,000 (cotton cloth industry), and others include 250,000, 200,000, 100,000, and three months' salary, etc., while the worst do not even have one month's salary.

(3) My opinion on the attitudes of all parties towards the layoff problem - From the perspective of the enterprise itself, those who are laid off must be redundant staff, and even if excellent people really resign voluntarily, the authorities will not hesitate to pay a high price to retain them. On the employee's side, there are many people who hope to be laid off, because they think that receiving 100,000 or 10,000 can do some small business. However, from the perspective of society, neither of these two views can be said to be a proper solution. First of all, we must point out that the current problem is a social problem that is about to come. Business leaders must estimate how to reduce the number of unemployed people in society as much as possible, in other words, they must estimate the way out for employees after being laid off. If the laid-off people can only be "friends who sit and eat" in Shanghai, then it will make the social problem more serious, and the impact on the enterprise will be even greater. The painstaking efforts of business leaders to shrink the scope and safely tide over the difficulties will inevitably become impossible. Therefore, the author advocates that the usual standards for dismissal should be reduced to a secondary position, and a small number of elderly and frail people who have no home to return to and really have no way out can be retained even if their performance is not very good. On the contrary, people who have a better way to retreat (such as those with better family finances and other dependencies) can retreat first. That is, the economic situation and family environment of the employees should be the main standards for dismissal. Therefore, the author advocates

(1) Industrial and commercial institutions should plan from the standpoint of society and should not ignore the impact of layoffs on society.

(2) Industrial and commercial employees should look farther and not covet the current big rolls of banknotes.

Finally, it must be mentioned that some industrial and commercial organizations (especially private enterprises) that have already tightened their belts are taking the opportunity to implement salary cuts and rice subsidies, and it is hoped that public opinion will sanction such opportunistic exploitative behavior that disregards the facts.

### Charity Sale of Paintings to Help the Needy

Mr. Jin Ketian wrote in a letter: "Dear Sir, on the first day of the eleventh lunar month, four old colleagues, Xia Weiyi, Zhang Bu-nong, Cai Guanglu, and Qian Weilie, publicly presented me with a middle hall painting of old cypresses, strange rocks, mountains, and rivers by Lu Chi, with a cost of 45,000 yuan for the banquet (excluding labor according to custom), totaling 63,000 yuan. I firmly declined but could not refuse. Therefore, based on the meaning of being hungry and thirsty, I transferred half of it to your office as a winter relief fund, and half of it to the Xinwen Bao as a scholarship fund, to benefit everyone. In addition, I will temporarily keep a landscape painting by Lu Chi (that is, Lu Hui), planning to list it at 100,000 yuan, and a figure album depicting the story of Tao Yuanming by Zhao Ziang of the Yuan Dynasty, listing it at 200,000 yuan (both of which are definitely genuine). These will be the minimum prices, and they will be sold for charity at my residence. All proceeds will be used to help the needy and provide scholarships for the Shen and Xin newspapers. From then on, I will use this example to advise my children and grandchildren that the Jin family will always abide by this teaching and will not borrow life or accept gifts. My residence is currently located at 26 Shaoxing Road (formerly Avenue Albert), telephone 74865. Every day from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM, I respectfully await the arrival of great philanthropists to discuss until the end of the charity sale."

### Alumni Advancement Association Planning Variety Show

The University Alumni Advancement Association is an academic, cultural, and social service organization voluntarily organized by students from various universities in Shanghai. Since its establishment, it has been actively promoting association affairs and sparing no effort. Recently, in order to respond to the winter relief efforts of this office and subsidize needy students, the association has specifically launched a fundraising variety show in conjunction with university students, planning to perform at the Lyceum Theatre on New Year's Day.

### Children's Welfare Association Facing Difficulties, Hoping for Extensive Fundraising from All Walks of Life

According to the news from the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, the association received more than 180,000 yuan in donations from all walks of life in the past two days. Among them, Mr. Wang Bingchen raised 100,000 yuan, and Mr. Chu Zhaoxing raised 60,000 yuan. They are enthusiastic about relief and greatly benefit children. The association is deeply grateful. However, the association's expenses are huge due to the current sharp rise in prices, exceeding the original budget by a large amount, and it is increasingly difficult to maintain. The current fundraising campaign will end at the end of this month, and there is not much time left. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will generously donate and raise funds extensively. If you would like to donate, in addition to the association's direct receipt, the social service department of this newspaper can also receive donations on your behalf. Telephone donations are especially welcome. Please call 82273, and the association will send staff to collect the receipt.
