### Welcome Consultant Ogura

Mr. Tadashi Ogura, the newly appointed Supreme Economic Consultant of the National Government, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Tokyo and will soon go to Nanjing to take office. We would like to express our warmest welcome.

In early July of last year, the Allied nations sent an economic mission to consult with our country. At that time, Mr. Ogura served as the head of the mission and held numerous sincere talks with various sectors of our society. The economic mission issued a statement on its purpose of the visit: "To engage in concrete discussions with the Chinese economic community and the National Government on economic cooperation between the two countries, to fully accept the opinions of Chinese people, to take collective action as well as private consultations to exchange views, and to conduct thorough research on Chinese economic issues such as prices, finance, trade, and food." In order to contribute to the co-existence and co-prosperity of the industries and economies of the two countries, we have repeatedly contributed articles offering our humble opinions. Although nine months have passed since then, not only has there been no turnaround in the current morbid state of the Chinese economy, but it has also become more serious. Therefore, the opinions we provided in the past still have meaning to be reiterated.

The morbid state of the Chinese economy is already very deep. If the governments and people of China and Japan do not devise remedial measures as soon as possible, the crisis will be severe, with serious adverse consequences for China, for Japan, and for the entire Greater East Asia. As for the root cause of China's economic ills, it is inseparable from politics. Political illness is the cause, and economic illness is the result. Therefore, to cure the economic illness, we must first—or at least simultaneously—cure the political illness; otherwise, it will inevitably be in vain.

Increasing production is a fundamental way to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods during wartime, and it is also a prerequisite for implementing material control. If increasing production cannot be achieved, there will be no way to stabilize prices, control cannot be carried out, and people's livelihoods cannot be stabilized. However, the actual effect of increasing production is hardly worth mentioning. On the contrary, the productivity rate has shrunk. Taking Shanghai as an example, as the center of Chinese industry, the operating rates of various important people's livelihood industries have decreased (according to last year's survey, the textile industry was 40%, the oil pressing industry was 50%, and the dyeing and weaving industry was 30%, but in fact, it is currently even less than these numbers). The reasons for this are the lack of raw materials, insufficient power, and difficulties in workers' food supply. Therefore, the shrinkage of production has become the most serious economic morbidity in China today.

Secondly, soaring prices are certainly the most serious economic morbidity. Not to mention the distant past, taking the period from September of last year to February of this year as an example, October was 3.6% higher than September, November was 8.8% higher than October, December was 27.9% higher than November, January of this year was 36.4% higher than December of last year, and February of this year, which coincided with the Lunar New Year, was more than 50% higher than January. The endless rise in prices has caused great threats and pain to people's livelihoods, which goes without saying.

We sincerely look forward to a good doctor who can cure China's economic morbidity, with a feeling of eager anticipation like waiting for sweet rain in a severe drought. With a famous doctor, we can accurately diagnose the morbidity and prescribe the right medicine to cure the disease. Of course, the main cause of economic morbidity lies in political defects, and we urgently seek innovation. However, the technical aspects of economic measures are also very important. In particular, although the principles and systems of economic measures have been determined, the environment of adapting to China's national conditions and people's sentiments must be taken into account during implementation. Under the premise of not violating the principles of wartime economy, the measures should not be invariable. For example, the system and principles of controlled economy are certainly necessary for countries in wartime, but since their implementation in China, we have only seen their drawbacks and not their common benefits. China's implementation of control has not only failed to stimulate production, but has even hindered production. The reason for this is that we only know how to swallow principles whole without knowing how to adapt to the unique environment in the implementation technology. Therefore, it is worth considering to relax the control economy a little in terms of technology, in addition to the needs of wartime.

Mr. Ogura is an authority in the Japanese economic community with extensive experience. He came to China 30 years ago and has a good impression of China. This time, he is taking office as the Supreme Economic Consultant of the National Government. We believe that we have found a famous doctor who can cure China's economic morbidity. He will surely be able to diagnose accurately and cure the disease, and we cannot help but place deep expectations on him.

### Japanese-Indian Troops Repeatedly Occupy Fortresses and Advance Towards Imphal; Main Force of British Fourth Army Trapped in Difficult Situation

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram)—According to a dispatch from the Burmese front: The Japanese-Indian allied forces are advancing towards Imphal from the east, west, south, and north, engaging in fierce battles with enemy troops along the way, gradually seizing their forward positions. They are currently fiercely attacking the enemy's salient position in Pailel, completely controlling the main positions around Imphal and the narrow entrances to the roads in the Imphal basin, gradually shrinking the encirclement. Under these circumstances, the enemy is attempting a final tenacious resistance. The two sides are fighting fiercely for Hill 3833, a military stronghold ten kilometers north of Imphal; the two armies are facing each other only fifty meters apart, engaging in continuous hand-to-hand combat for several days. Furthermore, the Japanese-Indian forces spent 37 hours occupying Kanglatongbi, a key forward fortress of Imphal. The enemy's main defense positions in Imphal have gradually collapsed, and the fate of the main force of the enemy's Fourth Army, numbering tens of thousands, is at its most precarious. In addition, the Japanese army's northward unit is rapidly pursuing the defeated enemy, advancing towards Dimapur, a key point on the Assam-Bengal railway, and is currently advancing rapidly along the road. On the evening of the 12th, it had advanced to the plains of Brahmaputra, occupying the highlands around Nicima, ten kilometers southeast of Tenaphal, directly attacking the city and securing key military points.

Forests Turn into Seas of Fire as Fierce Battles Unfold Everywhere

The enemy troops are extremely embarrassed by the impending fall of Nicima and, in addition to mobilizing the 4th Mechanized Division and an Anglo-Indian division from the Shillong area, are also transporting three brigades by transport aircraft to defend Dimapur. The Japanese army units north of Imphal are currently suppressing enemy positions at a certain highland, a strategic point in that area, and at Sengumai and other places west of that highland, engaging in fierce battles everywhere. On the Pailel front, the Japanese army's attacks on the Pailel fortress are becoming increasingly active. The enemy army continues to fight a desperate defensive battle in the vast positions north and south of Dimapur. In order to stop the Japanese army, the enemy set fire to the large forests near the area, and the area has now turned into a sea of fire. The Japanese army is fiercely attacking the remnants of the British-Indian army in the fire. In addition, the Japanese army at the narrow entrances south of Imphal is engaged in fierce battles with strong enemy units. On the other hand, the Japanese army's assault team is attacking near Laimanai, west of Melaung, in an attempt to cut off the highway from Bishnupur to Silchar. The cutting off of this highway is imminent.

Enemy Parachute Troops Surrounded by Japanese Army

Imphal is facing such danger that the enemy has also mobilized its air force to assist in that area. However, the enemy parachute commando team near Fougakhong and Karsa in the north has no reinforcements and can only sit and wait to be annihilated by the Japanese army. This is in stark contrast to the defeats of the British-Indian army in the Bukhtan and Maungdaw areas. The enemy's strategic posture of counter-attacking Burma on the Indo-Burmese front, stretching for a thousand kilometers, has been disrupted by the attacks of the Japanese-Indian allied forces. In view of the seriousness of the situation, the enemy commander, Mountbatten, personally went to the Imphal front with his chief of staff to encourage the soldiers to reorganize their lines. However, the news that eastern India is becoming increasingly precarious has spread throughout India, and the anti-British independence sentiment of the Indian people is rising. The enemy camp is in a state of ____.

### Japanese Ambassador Tsubogami Discusses the Current Situation in Thailand; Cooperation with Japan Filled with Fighting Spirit

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—Japanese Ambassador to Thailand, Tsubogami, returned to Tokyo on the 12th of the month to discuss important matters with the Japanese government. He described the current situation in Thailand as follows: Thailand, based on the Japan-Thailand alliance, is cooperating closely with Japan in all aspects, including military, economic, and cultural, in order to complete the joint war as soon as possible. Thailand's enthusiasm for building Asia for Asians is becoming increasingly fervent, and its attitude is very active, having already fully demonstrated the great role of the Greater East Asia Declaration. Thailand has recognized the foundation of its national existence and its position within the Co-Prosperity Sphere based on the five principles of this declaration. To illustrate the active cooperative attitude of the Thai government and people, for example, at the recent annual meeting of the Thai Academy, the president of the Academy, Wan Waithayakon, stated that studying mutual cooperation with comrades in the Co-Prosperity Sphere and exploring various future strategies is a major task of the Academy. This shows that the Thai academic community is actively cooperating to complete the war and is worthy of attention. In other aspects, Thailand is also fully maintaining cooperation with Japan in basic matters such as building airfields, railways, highways, and military and logistics bases, and is strengthening mutual contact. The Thai government is currently striving to establish a wartime system. Regarding air defense measures, it has been transferred from the Ministry of National Defense to the direct jurisdiction of the Prime Minister. In addition, in order to unify national consciousness, youth movements have also been transferred from the Ministry of Education to the direct jurisdiction of the Prime Minister. At present, the national war consciousness is extremely high. A women's officer school was held in January of this year, and a women's regiment will be established on the 24th of June, the anniversary of the revolution. The position of regimental commander is expected to be held by Mrs. Phibun, the Prime Minister, who is currently a lieutenant colonel in the artillery. Therefore, the fighting spirit of women is also very strong.

### Serious Losses in Bombay Fire

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—According to a dispatch from Bombay: A fire broke out in Bombay harbor on the afternoon of the 14th. Although troops were dispatched to put out the fire, the fire was still extremely fierce and burned for twelve hours. As a result, the central area of Bombay became a ruin. According to the city authorities, as of now, hospitals have admitted more than a thousand injured people, of whom seven have died from their injuries, and the homes of about several thousand residents have been destroyed by the fire.

### Japanese Students Participate in Production Corps

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—In order to mobilize students across the country to participate in the production corps, the Japanese government previously decided on emergency measures for the decisive battle, ordering students across the country to devote themselves to the production corps for a period of one year. Now that the preparations for the first phase of mobilization have been completed, the second phase of mobilization has been started in recent days. It has now been found that students in Tokyo who will be working full-time throughout the year in the second phase have already been scheduled to work at various factories such as Sumitomo Communications from the 18th onwards. The participants include a number of students in their final year from 72 male secondary schools. As for the mobilization measures for female school students, they will be initiated after communication between the Metropolitan Education Bureau and the Metropolitan Police Department, and a survey is currently underway. In addition, other female schools are currently contacting aircraft factories, and most of the mobilization is expected to be completed by April. Personnel undergoing school factory internships will receive the same treatment in terms of working hours and various conditions as personnel serving in other factories. In addition, clothing labor will not be held temporarily until the Ministry of Education issues a notice.

### Portugal Sends Personnel to Inspect Timor Island; Japan Facilitates

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced at 2:00 PM on the 16th: In order to inspect the living conditions of Portuguese people in Portuguese Timor (i.e., Timor Island), the Portuguese government previously intended to send officials from the country to inspect the island. At that time, the Japanese government, in view of the friendly relations between Japan and Portugal, expressed its agreement with Portugal's hope and would provide the Portuguese inspection officials with various conveniences for travel. Therefore, after obtaining Japan's consent, the Portuguese government dispatched Captain Costa, the secretary-general of the Governor of Macau, as an inspector. After being ordered, Captain Costa departed from Macau in early March and arrived in Timor. After completing the inspection mission, he returned to Macau via Tokyo in the middle of this month.

### European War Unlikely to End This Year

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—German News Agency: According to a Washington dispatch, U.S. Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, Vice Admiral Horne, stated in the House Appropriations Committee that the European War cannot end this year. U.S. Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral King, also stated in the committee, predicting that the losses of the U.S. military will increase greatly in the next six months and will maintain their high rate during the war.

### Economic Administration Unified After Partial Adjustment by National Government; Economic Revival Prospects Promising

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—The 45th meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council on the 13th of this month resolved to abolish the Ministry of Food and transfer the original affairs under the Ministry's jurisdiction to the Ministry of Industry. On the 14th of this month, the National Government issued a decree announcing the transfer of Chen Chunpu, the Minister of Construction, to the post of Governor of Guangdong Province. The vacant post of Minister of Construction was specially appointed to be concurrently held by Chen Kung-po, the Minister of Industry. This partial adjustment of the National Government's economic administrative institutions and the change of personnel in charge has epoch-making significance for the future of economic revival and construction by the National Government during wartime. The reasons why the promotion of our wartime economic construction work has not achieved the expected results are certainly numerous, but the inability to unify economic administrative institutions and the inability to concentrate powers are undeniable facts. Taking the work of increasing agricultural production as an example, such as the increase in food production being under the Ministry of Food, the increase in water conservancy being under the Ministry of Construction, and the increase in cotton and hemp production and land reclamation work being under the Ministry of Industry, not only are human and financial resources dispersed, but the plans and programs also have the disadvantages of being complicated and divergent. In the midst of the current nationwide call for increased production, there is a definite need for readjustment. In order to eliminate the above-mentioned drawbacks, the National Government resolutely abolished the Ministry of Food and concentrated powers in the Ministry of Industry. At the same time, because of Chen Chunpu's succession to the governorship of Guangdong and the decision to have Chen Kung-po concurrently hold the vacant post of Minister of Construction, the economic administrative work will be carried out under a highly unified operation, with the hope that it can make greater progress and complete the great cause of economic construction. It is believed that after this adjustment, the administration of our country's wartime economic construction has been completely consolidated in terms of powers and unified in terms of institutions. In the future, as long as we proceed with our established national policies and strive to promote them, the prospects for economic revival, the completion of the Greater East Asia War, and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be as easy as moving our fingers and arms.

### Japanese Aircraft Bomb Nanxiong and Jian'ou

Guangzhou, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—Eight Japanese fighter-bombers bombed Nanxiong airfield in northern Guangdong Province at noon on the 14th. Braving heavy enemy fire, they destroyed enemy camouflage areas and ancillary facilities, and destroyed a small aircraft parked on the ground by the enemy. The Japanese aircraft have now safely returned to base.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—On the 15th, a new Japanese air unit made a surprise attack on the Neixiang Yuzhong airfield in southwestern Henan Province, with bombs hitting the airfield's runways. Another team of Japanese aircraft also attacked the Jian'ou airfield on the same day in adverse weather conditions. Braving intense anti-aircraft fire from the ground, they made accurate strikes, with bombs hitting runways and other locations. The airfield was temporarily unusable.

### Ochiai Concurrently Serves as Advisor to Wuhan Headquarters

Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—The position of advisor to the Wuhan Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission, previously held by Mr. Imai, is now concurrently held by Mr. Ochiai, the head of the Allied Liaison Department stationed in Hankou. The Headquarters specially issued a notice to its subordinates yesterday to inform them of this.

### Wallace's Mission to Chongqing

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency Telegram)—There has been much speculation about Vice President Wallace's decision to visit Chongqing this time. The Chongqing Central News Agency correspondent in Washington stated on the 13th that although many senior U.S. military officials have visited Chongqing recently, senior civilian officials have not visited as often. Therefore, Wallace's visit to Chongqing is attracting much attention. Wallace's visit will further strengthen U.S.-Chongqing relations and will be related to the internal affairs of the Chongqing government. At a time when the U.S. is advocating a re-recognition of the Chongqing government, Wallace's visit to Chongqing is noteworthy. According to another report, Roosevelt's envoy, Wallace's visit to Chongqing, is to mediate the recently deteriorating relations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Currently, the Chongqing government has strictly restricted communications from foreign correspondents stationed in Chongqing, but issues such as the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, currency inflation, and the rectification of the thoughts of students studying abroad still inevitably spread to the United States, which has caused anxiety in the Americas.

### Britain and the United States Make Demands on Turkey

Ankara, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—Reuters: There was extraordinary diplomatic activity in Ankara yesterday. President Ismet Inönü and Prime Minister Saraçoğlu held lengthy talks, while Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu had a long secret meeting with U.S. Ambassador Steinhardt. The content of the talks concerned the diplomatic steps taken by Britain and the United States regarding Turkey's supply of raw materials to Germany. Soviet Ambassador Vinogradov, who was not carrying any special diplomatic mission, departed from Ankara for Cairo and returned to Moscow. When he will return to his post is still unknown.

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—According to a dispatch from Ankara, Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu met with reporters on the 16th and spoke about the Allied policy towards Turkey, saying that the Turkish government has received documents from the British and American governments demanding that Turkey sever relations with the Axis powers, and the Turkish government is currently considering this.

### British Experts Leave Turkey and Return Home

Stockholm, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—German News Agency: According to a report from London, 340 British technical personnel have left Turkey since the breakdown of talks between Britain and Turkey in Ankara in February.

### German Troops on Eastern Front Adopt Offensive and Defensive Tactics; Attrition Warfare Unfolds on Crimean Peninsula

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—Reuters: The situation on the Eastern Front has changed slightly at the weekend in both the northern and southern sectors. In the northern sector, Soviet forces have deployed more reinforcements and concentrated their attacks on Pskov, but have so far been unable to break through the German defenses. The situation in Crimea in the southern sector is extremely tense. Soviet mechanized units and tank columns are attacking in two directions. The pressure from the Soviets on Perekop and Kerch, and the threat of flanking attacks, have forced the defenders of Simferopol to withdraw. Soviet naval infantry and the main force of the Red Army are jointly attacking from the north, attempting to encircle the entire mountainous area in southeastern Crimea. The German army is adopting a defensive posture in the northern sector of the Eastern Front and in the Crimean area. The Romanian army is becoming more active in both offensives. The Soviet forces seem to be waiting for the arrival of reinforcements, and are also using this time to deploy troops. The front line downstream of the Dniester River has shifted to the south bank of the river. The positions between the Dniester and the Southern Bug River are also being extended to Pascani to defend against Soviet advances towards Chisinau. German troops west of the Prut River have launched a strong counter-offensive. German troops in the Delatyn-Kovel area are also engaged in offensive activities. In addition to establishing strong defense lines in the area, the German-Romanian Allied forces will use the area as a base for launching offensives.

### German Preparedness on Mediterranean Coast; Active Submarines in the Adriatic Sea

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—Recently, the anti-Axis forces have been clamoring for the launch of an offensive operation in Europe, but the German army's state of preparedness has also been completed. Field Marshal Rundstedt recently inspected the defenses of the Mediterranean coast in southern France, met with the commanders of the coastal defense forces in the area, and reviewed the standby reserve units. It has now been confirmed that the German defense positions are extremely strong.

Agram, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—Reuters: Official sources state that enemy submarines attempting to approach the Dalmatian coast were repelled near Šibenik harbor and Hvar Island, between Split and Zadar.

Belgrade, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—Reuters: British and American aircraft bombed residential areas of Niš city again yesterday afternoon.

Dalmatia Suffers Air Raids for Days

Agram, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—Reuters: Official sources state: Enemy aircraft have been attacking various parts of Dalmatia for several days, causing considerable damage and casualties. Nine enemy aircraft were shot down in Croatian territory on the 13th of this month.

Guerrilla Warfare Occurs in Montenegro

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—Reuters: In recent battles to suppress guerrillas, German troops occupied the city of Polje, on the banks of the Lim River in central Montenegro. The guerrillas destroyed roads and bridges in an attempt to stop the German advance, but failed. Nearby farmers helped German troops repair the roads. There have also been battles in central and northern Montenegro.

### Tianjin Implements Permanent Blackout

Tianjin, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram)—In order to strengthen air defense and ensure the safety of the rear, the Tianjin authorities have decided to implement a permanent blackout and have issued an order for its implementation. The police and relevant authorities, in view of the fact that the city's street lights were still emitting light as usual, which was inconsistent with the air defense system, decided to remove all street lights in the city and install new ones. The work has now begun.

### Establishing a Planned Economy, Building a Sound India: Chairman Bose's Speech to the Press Corps

When the Provisional Government of Free India, established by the will of the Indian people, advances into the motherland, Chairman Jiangtela Bose, after issuing his first statement at noon on the 4th, immediately met with the press corps. In the question-and-answer session, he clarified the administrative guidelines of the Provisional Government of Free India, eliminating all the exploitative mechanisms previously established by the British, establishing a planned economy, and building a sound India. The following is the question-and-answer session:

(Question) What is the reason for issuing the second statement?

(Answer) To make the Indian people more aware of the whole picture of the Provisional Government of Free India, to counteract enemy propaganda, to obtain the cooperation of all the Indian people, and to build an India for the Indians.

Lofty Ideals

(Question) How is the progress of construction work?

(Answer) According to the concrete plan that has been decided, the necessary personnel have already arrived at the location and started construction work. The first step of construction lies in rebuilding the already destroyed economy.

(Question) What is the fundamental concept for rebuilding the economy of the free region?

(Answer) In today's India, under the free economic system, a few people possess huge private interests. Our fundamental concept lies in eliminating this situation, establishing a strong planned economy, and striving to improve the welfare of the people.

(Question) What is the fundamental concept of the new political order?

(Answer) We want to eliminate all the British exploitative mechanisms that protect the interests of the few and exploit the people, to ensure the minimum living standards of the people. This revolution is not only a political revolution but also a social revolution. And for the establishment of this new order, we do not expect any difficulties. We believe that the wealthy class will also gladly participate in our cause. The day before yesterday, a capitalist sent a blank check with the amount left empty, hoping that we would fill in the number as we wished.

(Question) What about the national question?

(Answer) India has many ethnic groups, so it is a very complicated issue. This was originally a cunning policy of the British. If we specifically raise this issue, we will inevitably follow in the footsteps of the British, so the Provisional Government will not interfere in this matter, and all Indians will be treated equally.

Reactions from Britain and the United States

(Question) What is the reaction to the first statement?

(Answer) First, let's talk about the enemy's reaction. The highest-ranking British authorities are very terrified of this. Before this, the highest-ranking enemy officers in India never mentioned the activities of the Indian National Army. However, the neutral countries and the United States are very concerned about this.

The United States is very worried about the great success of the Indian National Army, which is cooperating with the Japanese army in this campaign. From a military point of view, so is Chongqing, because they are afraid that the only transport route to Chongqing will be cut off. The neutral countries also attach importance to this campaign and predict that it will produce significant results. As for India, the American propaganda organs claim that the entry of the Japanese army into India is only a threatening attack. Previously, they broadcast from India to foreign countries, propagating that the Indian National Army was completely a puppet force of the Japanese army, and that the Japanese army would never enter Indian territory. However, since the Japanese and Indian armies marched side by side into India, they have been broadcasting that "the equipment and weapons of the National Army are extremely crude," making false propaganda.

Let's look at the reaction of the Indian people. The anti-British movement is becoming increasingly planned. This can be clearly seen from the fact that the government budget proposal was rejected in the Indian Central Assembly. The Indian Assembly is composed of a small number of elected members and a large number of officially appointed members. However, even though the leaders of the Congress Party members among these few elected members were imprisoned, the budget proposal was eventually rejected. This shows that the pro-British elements among the majority of members were also stimulated by the advance of the Indian National Army into their motherland and turned against the British. This is evidence that all of India is filled with anti-British sentiment.

What is noteworthy here is the active actions of the Indian youth. On the surface, due to the strong suppression by the British authorities, the anti-British movement centered on the National Congress Party seems to be quite calm, but the secret movements centered on the Indian youth are expanding day by day. These young people have already made preparations, and as long as I give the order, they can start an uprising immediately.

Secondly, I want to point out that Britain's fighting spirit is very weak. When the Japanese army advanced into Myanmar in 1942, the British had secretly issued a retreat order. From this, you can see how the current Britain is. In short, once India intensifies, the Indian revolution will lead to secret movements, and great expectations are placed on the results of our National Army's campaign.

### Re-issuance of Residence Permits in District One Must Begin Next Month. Re-issuance Applications Are Being Submitted One After Another.

Since the police substations and Baojia offices in District One (excluding the newly merged districts) began preparing for the re-issuance of residence permits in late last month, residents of various Baojia have been continuously submitting applications. According to reporters' inquiries from various offices, the re-issuance of residence permits must wait until the police authorities have completed the review of all the applications submitted by the residents before they can sequentially specify the dates and times for each Bao to collect them. Therefore, the official start of the re-issuance work should be after May 1st. At the same time, it was also learned that the re-issuance of residence permits in the West District did not start on April 10th, because the application procedures in that district have not yet started.

### Rice for Non-Local Residents in District One Will Be Sold Before the 20th

The 38th term of grain rations for non-local residents in District One has been approved by the Municipal Food Bureau and has been fully allocated. It has been ordered that the public rice shops in each district under its jurisdiction must pay for the rice and take it out of the warehouse by next Monday at the latest.

### Children Should Not Be Allowed to Go Out on Their Own to Avoid Being Abducted by Thugs

Recently, the number of missing children in the city has been increasing. The Administrative Office of the First Police Station and the Children's Protection Section of the First District Office are very concerned about this, fearing that unscrupulous people may be acting up and abducting children to sell in other areas. Therefore, the Administrative Office of the First Bureau has ordered each substation to pay close attention, intensify inspections of hotels and land and water transportation stations, and strictly interrogate those with suspicious behavior. If any cases of abduction and sale of children are arrested, they will be severely punished. The Children's Protection Section of the District Office hopes that citizens will pay attention and not allow children to go out on their own to avoid being abducted by thugs. If a child is missing, they should report to the police substation in charge, and fill in the missing time, appearance, and clothing in detail to facilitate the search.

### Improving the Efficiency of Public Utilities

— Nie Shi

The construction of modern cities depends heavily on the service efficiency of public utilities. Shanghai, as the largest city in China, has always been known for its developed public utilities. However, since the incident, due to the impact of the war and changes in the environment, the service efficiency of public utilities has gradually declined, and it is particularly severe today. What we have seen and heard can be summarized as follows:

Some are due to the wartime environment affecting efficiency, such as the panic of fuel and restricting electricity consumption, weakening the brightness of street lights for air defense, and affecting the operation of public vehicles due to restrictions on electricity and gasoline. There are also those who delay mail and telegrams due to military actions hindering the smooth flow of postal and electrical routes. However, these are all inevitable phenomena under wartime conditions, so let's not discuss them for now.

Some are deliberately neglecting service. We can cite examples that are commonly criticized by the general public: public military vehicles deliberately skip stops on the pretext of crowded passengers, even in non-crowded situations; water and electricity companies use the pretext of limiting electricity consumption to also limit water use, such as the French Water and Electricity Company; those responsible for delivering mail and telegrams use the excuse of being busy with private affairs and wartime conditions to deliberately delay, etc.

Some are using their positions to engage in malpractice. As is well known, the problem of ticket sellers on public vehicles skimming money has attracted public attention, and what is even more serious than the skimming problem is that today, employees of water and electricity companies, especially meter readers, accept bribes by falsifying records when consumption exceeds the limit. Today, the loss or shortage of a large number of mails, especially books and heavy parcels, is highly suspicious.

If we investigate the reasons for the above phenomena, in addition to wartime conditions that cannot be easily resolved, the biggest reason is that the living conditions of public utility service personnel are too difficult and their salaries are too meager. As far as we know, their average monthly salary is only a little over a thousand yuan. How can they solve the problem of supporting an average family of five or six people with this salary? No wonder there are various forms of malpractice. They spend their days racking their brains on how to engage in malpractice, not thinking about how to improve service efficiency. No wonder you can see many people wearing uniforms at stations and ports engaging in their own side businesses. They either take leave to do so or do it in their spare time, so the impact on service efficiency is self-evident. It is even less surprising that they cannot solve their living problems, cannot focus on service, and thus neglect service.

Therefore, we have to believe that adjusting the salaries of public utility service personnel is a prerequisite for improving service efficiency. Otherwise, if this continues, they may find other ways to make a living and scatter; or they may just barely cope, and things will get worse; or they may focus on their side business and be there only in name. Then the future of Shanghai's public utilities is simply unimaginable. On the other hand, the companies or bureaus concerned can imitate the First Police Station in organizing consumer cooperatives to reduce the burden on their colleagues. If the authorities concerned can take the initiative to launch and organize, powerful social organizations and people will be able to cooperate, just like the auxiliary police cooperative. We deeply hope that the bureaus concerned will consider the above points carefully.

Furthermore, we also hope that the municipal government and the authorities concerned of various public utilities will, within the possible scope, take the convenience of citizens as the premise and try their best to solve the difficulties. Such as dredging coal sources, in order to increase the electricity supply to meet the legitimate needs of citizens, increasing the brightness of street lights at night under the condition of not hindering air defense to improve the public security situation, and opening new postal and electrical routes in order to accelerate the delivery and transmission. At the same time, strictly warn service personnel not to make things difficult, neglect service, and engage in malpractice. Otherwise, they will be severely punished according to the law. Only in this way can the future of public utilities be promising.

### The Ministry of Industry Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Supervise Industrial Production Increase, Starting with Match and Soap Factories

In order to actively increase industrial production, stabilize people's livelihoods, and assist in the Greater East Asia War, the Ministry of Industry has specially dispatched five personnel, including Technical Supervisor You Yizhao, Counselor Hu Yu Shang, and Technical Officers Ren Letian, Wu Zhongda, and Qiu Jinyi, to Shanghai to handle the supervision of factories and make further efforts to increase industrial production. According to Technical Supervisor You's statement to reporters, "This time, we have been ordered to come to Shanghai, and we deeply feel that the task is heavy. We found that the current factory operations in this city are not on the right track. Large-scale manufacturers are unwilling to strengthen production due to the control of raw material consumption and strict price restrictions, while small factories have achieved abnormal prosperity because their manufactured goods can be supplied to the black market. It is necessary to make every effort to adjust this phenomenon. Minister Chen, in view of this, has specially dispatched us to be responsible for handling the supervision affairs, and plans to proceed gradually according to the established plan, starting with the match and soap manufacturing factories that are daily necessities. We have contacted the main personnel of the industry to supervise and strive to increase production to stabilize people's livelihoods," and so on.

### Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions Last Week

The financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions in Shanghai last week generally showed a trend towards a proper and stable state.

The ratio of joint ventures, stock prices insisted on stability, monetary conditions remained as usual, and there was ample demand for proper funds. In industry and commerce, because the government strictly cracked down on hoarding and actively carried out agricultural and industrial production increase work, commodity prices seemed to have a lasting stability.

### Illegally Pledged Articles in District One are Suppressed by the Articles Valuation Association

Illegally pledged articles in the South City have now unanimously stopped pledging and are waiting for redemption. Business is declining every day. It can be cleaned up in the short term. The illegally pledged articles in Taishan Road and other places in District One have recently become more rampant. Because they do not have a business license, they attempt to use the name of the "Articles Valuation Association" to obtain the approval of the authorities and continue to operate. It is heard that the company has applied to organize the Municipal Economic Bureau, and the Municipal Economic Bureau has paid strict attention to it. If what is said is indeed true, then this kind of disguised illegal pledge will never be allowed to open, in order to protect the livelihood of the poor and not be exploited by these people.

### Company Registration for Various Industries Ends at the End of April

The Ministry of Industry previously stipulated that the re-registration of companies would end at the end of last November. Various companies have not been able to comply with the deadline to submit their requests, and have directly submitted their requests to the Ministry for re-registration. The Ministry, in consideration of the commercial situation, has made appropriate changes. Those who have been approved and registered by the former Ministry of Industry or the relevant competent authorities and issued licenses will still follow the procedures for company establishment registration and extend the deadline to the end of April in order to restrict them. Those who still fail to register before the end of April will be subject to appropriate penalties. Recently, in the past one or two months, seven companies have been established and opened in this city.

### Industry Associations Charge Fees for Handling the Movement of Materials

Industry trade associations often feel that the income from membership fees is insufficient to cover expenses, and they have repeatedly requested to levy handling fees and administrative fees to make up for this. However, the various associations have limited income from fixed membership fees, and the handling of materials control affairs has increased and expenses have occasionally increased. For the sake of investigating the facts, the Business Consolidation Association has approved that the industry associations can charge 0.2% of the value of the controlled materials when handling the certification procedures for the movement of controlled materials in and out of the industry. Before the collection, each association should prepare a budget of income and expenditure and submit it for detailed review.
