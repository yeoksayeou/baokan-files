### Impressions of the Fourth Municipal Consultative Conference—Focus of Discussion: Food Issues

— Chen Bin

On the 10th of this month, the Municipal Consultative Committee of this city held its fourth plenary session, lasting two hours from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM. The discussion centered on the food issue. Mayor Chen Bito raised this issue at the beginning and at the end, his words fully expressing concern and revealing anxiety. At the same time, he encouraged colleagues not to be discouraged, emphasizing that the greater the difficulty, the more necessary it is to overcome it, and not to stop until the goal is achieved. Of course, the members of the Consultative Committee shared the same sentiment.

The mission of the Rice Control Commission is to increase food production, encourage farmers to plant, ensure public rice supply, stabilize people's food, and lay the foundation for winning the Greater East Asia War. However, since its establishment, the Rice Control Commission has not only failed to fulfill its mission but has also achieved the opposite effect due to flawed purchasing methods. Food production has decreased, farmers have avoided planting, the public rice supply remains uncertain, and people's food has not been stabilized, leading to today's serious crisis. This is one of the reasons why the Rice Control Commission must be reorganized.

For any business organization, especially a control agency, the first necessary factor for achieving success is sound personnel. Since its establishment, the Rice Control Commission has consistently failed to ensure sound personnel, which is a fatal flaw leading to its failure. An agency with unsound personnel and not led by experts cannot be expected to handle such a significant task, and the result is naturally failure. This is the second reason why the Rice Control Commission must be reorganized.

It is ideal for Chinese and Japanese personnel to work together in a business organization, especially when China needs experts and technical talent. However, in actual administration, joint execution by Chinese and Japanese personnel inevitably leads to obscurity and buck-passing. Why? First, if allied personnel do not deeply understand Chinese politics and people's customs, and the Chinese personnel working with them cannot frankly discuss the real situation, but only cater and prevaricate, all measures inevitably deviate from China's national and popular sentiments. Second, cunning and unscrupulous individuals, although knowing that the actions of the Japanese personnel they work with are wrong, only say yes and dare not argue for justice. On the other hand, they abuse their authority for personal gain and completely shift all the bad results and responsibilities onto the Japanese, or fabricate instructions from the Japanese authorities, causing the general public to have a bad impression of the Japanese. This is the biggest obstacle to Sino-Japanese cooperation. We recognize that the Japanese military and political authorities, whether in Tokyo or Shanghai, have ardent and far-sighted aspirations for the future of Sino-Japanese relations and even East Asia, hoping to strengthen the National Government's power, stabilize the lives of people in the peace zone, thereby promoting Sino-Japanese cooperation and achieving the ultimate goal of winning the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, the Japanese authorities most appreciate Chinese people telling the truth and have no intention of causing unnecessary suffering to the Chinese people, causing the Chinese people to have misconceptions about Japan.

Regarding the management of control work, especially rice control, I have always believed that it is more appropriate for it to be entirely the responsibility of the Chinese. However, the person in charge must be of the highest integrity, most able to understand the suffering of farmers, and most able to understand the important significance of Sino-Japanese cooperation and the Greater East Asia War. The National Government and the Rice Control Commission should be responsible for providing the required public rice for both China and Japan, delivering it on time and in full, while also ensuring the stability of people's food. In short, the most ideal way to manage food administration in the future, in my opinion, is not to hope that allied personnel participate or interfere more in administration, but to hope that the allies provide practical and maximum assistance in transportation and security, and provide technical guidance and assistance in agricultural production, so that the rice control work can achieve progress in accordance with the plan.

Furthermore, from practical observation, we went to the Hongqiao area last month to inspect the situation of rice being transported in. On the morning of the 10th, we again accompanied Mr. Xiang Kangwu and Mr. Chen Riping to inspect the Caohejing area. The last time was before the implementation of compulsory purchase, and this time was after the implementation. Last time, bicycle vendors selling rice were seen in droves, but this time they were gone. However, there were some people carrying loads of five dou or less, but their numbers were also small. This proves that the amount of rice transported into the suburbs of Shanghai has decreased after the implementation of compulsory purchase. I believe that compulsory purchase is justified in law, but in practice, at this time of year when the old grain is running out and the new grain is not yet available, even if the amount of compulsory purchase is very small, it will only stimulate rice prices to increase, which is harmful to the people's food and of no benefit to the public.

Now, there are only two months left until the new grain harvest. The authorities of the Rice Control Commission are only focusing on the trivial details of current compulsory purchase and have not yet heard of any better or more reasonable control and purchasing methods. Time flies like water, and the autumn harvest is approaching in the blink of an eye. What worries us most is that if the Rice Control Commission still has no innovative structure or ideal leadership figures before the new grain harvest, and reverses the failed methods of the past, the future will be dangerous and bleak, and we dare not imagine it. Recently, the price of rice has risen from three or four thousand yuan to eight or nine thousand yuan, and then to twelve or thirteen thousand yuan. Farmers not only do not benefit, but still sell at a loss at official prices. Most of the mobile rice is in the hands of hoarders. The only ones who profit from this rice price fluctuation are unscrupulous merchants and hoarders, who should be dealt with in the most ruthless and severe wartime laws. Lax enforcement is also a major reason why rice administration is not on track.

In short, the rice and food issue has reached its most serious and dangerous stage today. As Mayor Chen said, the more difficult it is, the more necessary it is to overcome it. I believe that the key to overcoming the difficulty lies in whether the government has the determination to take on the important responsibility of ensuring public rice supply and stabilizing people's food. Can the Rice Control Commission be reformed and reorganized? Can appropriate people be selected to host the program? Are there any methods suitable for the national and popular sentiments to be implemented when the new grain is harvested? If there is still no determination to make a quick decision, then the rice and food issue will have no prospects for improvement.

### Fierce Battles Gradually Intensifying Around Saipan Island; Enemy Aircraft Attacking Omiya and Other Islands Damaged and Retreat

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) — A certain Japanese base in the Central Pacific reports that the Japanese forces on the Saipan front have been fighting fiercely since July 4th, inflicting great losses on the enemy. Furthermore, on the 10th, near Mt. Tapochau north of Garapan, they engaged in desperate hand-to-hand combat with the enemy.

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) — A certain Japanese base in the Central Pacific reports that the enemy is gradually increasing its air power on Saipan Island. On the 10th, Aslito Airfield saw an addition of several large aircraft and fifty small aircraft. Simultaneously, there were more than twenty large flying boats in Saipan harbor. Furthermore, in the sea area near the northwest of Tinian Island, a powerful fleet consisting of two aircraft carriers as its core, along with cruisers, destroyers, and over thirty other vessels, was sighted. The enemy's attacks on the Japanese positions around Saipan Island are also gradually intensifying. For example, on the 10th, a total of about ninety enemy aircraft attacked Omiya Island, bombing the fortresses and coastal positions there. At the same time, enemy cruisers and destroyers also carried out artillery fire. In addition, Tinian and Rota Islands were also attacked by dozens of enemy aircraft.

A certain Japanese base, 11th (Central News Agency) — On the 9th, over seventy enemy aircraft attacked Omiya Island. Several dozens of them attacked the Japanese airfield, and the other dozens attacked the coastal fortresses and positions. At the same time, several enemy cruisers and destroyers fired shells at the island. After fierce fighting, they retreated with damage.

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) — A certain Japanese base in the Central Pacific reports that over twenty enemy large aircraft attacked Yap Island on the 10th. After fierce resistance by the Japanese garrison, six of them were shot down, and the remaining enemy aircraft were repelled. Furthermore, from the night of the 8th to dawn on the 9th, twenty-three large aircraft also attacked Truk Island, but were repelled after fierce resistance by the Japanese garrison.

### Continuous Heavy Rain in Northern Burma; Japanese Forces Continue Fierce Attacks; Sweeping Operations Conducted on the Nu River

Rangoon, 11th (Central News Agency) — A report from the Northern Burma front on the 11th states that the Japanese forces, amidst continuous heavy rain, are continuing to fiercely attack the U.S.-Chinese Allied forces attempting to recapture Myitkyina, a key point in Northern Burma. The enemy's airborne supplies have been completely blocked due to the rapid advance of the Japanese forces and the rain. In addition, the enemy's morale is significantly weakened due to the prevalence of epidemics. Since the 29th of last month, the main force of the enemy's 42nd Regiment and about 400 U.S. troops have been attacking the Japanese positions north of Myitkyina. The Japanese forces engaged them in a fierce hand-to-hand combat, and the enemy forces were on the verge of collapse. By the morning of the 2nd of this month, most of them had been annihilated. In this operation, the Japanese forces achieved the following results: 1,351 enemy bodies left behind, 74 captured, 3 light mortars seized, 80 heavy and light machine guns, 87 rifles, 2 wireless radio stations and 2 telephones, and over 21,020 rounds of various types of ammunition.

Japanese Front Line, 11th (Central News Agency) — The main force of the Japanese army attacking the enemy on the banks of the Nu River has further strengthened its offensive capabilities as of today, and is fiercely attacking the enemy forces everywhere in the mud, day and night. Since the first attack on the Nu River, the enemy has suffered more than 23,000 casualties. Dreaming of recapturing Northern Burma, they have dispatched rear troops to the area. Two days ago, the 228th Regiment of the enemy's 26th Division, using a location eight kilometers southeast of Longling as a base, attempted to hinder the traffic between Mangshi and Longling. To preempt the enemy, the Japanese army suddenly attacked behind the enemy on the 5th, and launched a strong attack on the enemy's main positions in the thick fog at dawn on the 6th. The enemy was unable to resist and collapsed to the east, west and north. In addition, the enemy forces near Mangshi, which were subjected to the control of the powerful Japanese forces, have long been attacked by Japanese commando units and have been breached by the accurate shelling of the Japanese army. There are many corpses abandoned everywhere. Since the morning of the 6th, the Japanese army has been continuing sweeping operations using the moonlight.

### Over 100 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down Attacking the Ogasawara Islands; Japanese Forces Fought Bravely on Niijima Island

A certain Japanese base, 11th (Central News Agency) — The Japanese garrison on the Ogasawara Islands intercepted enemy mobile units attacking on the 3rd and 4th, shooting down more than 74 enemy aircraft and causing them to flee. It was later clarified that 13 more enemy aircraft had been shot down and 15 had been destroyed. Based on this, over 103 enemy aircraft were shot down or destroyed in the Ogasawara Islands on the 3rd and 4th.

A certain Japanese base, 11th (Central News Agency) — Japanese forces in western New Guinea have been intercepting persistent enemy aircraft groups every day, fighting bravely and unyieldingly. On the 9th, they shot down five enemy aircraft in the Babo area. The Japanese side suffered minor damage.

Military Expert Explains Mariana Islands Situation

Central News Agency Report: Regarding the situation in the Mariana Islands, the U.S. side is making exaggerated propaganda, claiming great success. However, can the situation in the Pacific War be determined based on the success or failure of a local battlefield or a certain period? Citing the actual circumstances of this world war, focusing only on a certain large-scale battle is prone to making major mistakes. For this observation, a broad perspective must be used. Regarding this point, a certain military expert here provided an explanation, hoping that Shanghai intellectuals would make accurate observations of the Pacific War. He said that regardless of the final outcome of the Saipan Island battle, the Japanese forces, in the fierce battles launched on land, sea, and air over a month from June 11th, inflicted a major blow on the main force of the enemy's 58th Mobile Force, sinking or destroying more than 50 enemy warships, annihilating more than 15,000 enemy landing troops, and shooting down approximately 700 enemy aircraft. Therefore, the Japanese forces have achieved very effective results in the operational objective of destroying enemy forces. The closer the Gilbert Islands, Marshall Islands, and Mariana Islands are to the Japanese mainland, the greater the damage to the enemy, a fact that the enemy also acknowledges. Conversely, the Japanese army achieved strategic goals with less loss. Of course, in terms of geography, Saipan is close to the Japanese mainland, and is an important military point, but is nothing more than a small island in the Pacific Ocean, and the trend of the battle on the island has no impact on victory or defeat of war. The most elite and powerful military strength of Japan and the Greater East Asia countries is strictly deployed on the Japanese mainland and the main islands of the East Asian continent and the South Seas. If the enemy forces approach the Greater East Asia continent, their losses will be even greater. Finally, there is one more point. Looking back at Japan's war history, Japan has twice repelled invaders from great world empires in its coastal waters. When the Yuan Dynasty launched a large-scale invasion of the northern coast of Kyushu 650 years ago, Japan fought bravely with fewer troops and ultimately repelled the Yuan troops. In the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese fleet annihilated the Russian fleet and won a decisive victory. From these two historical events, it can be seen that Japan will be able to exert its greatest power when the enemy approaches its mainland. This is also Japan's traditional strategy.

### Japanese Forces Advance from Northern Guangdong, Attack Shaoguan; Japanese Air Force Conducts Night Raid on Guilin Airfield

A certain Japanese base, 11th (Central News Agency) — Japanese forces advancing north along the Guangdong-Hankou Railway have passed through the enemy positions in the mountainous area of Dacuiling north of Qingyuan and are continuing to advance towards the confluence of the Beijiang and Lianjiang Rivers on the forward line of Shaoguan. On the morning of the 9th, the enemy forces on the front line's main positions near Lidongxu were in a state of great chaos due to the Japanese advance. Nimitz's boast of ensuring the mainland and preventing the 7th War Zone Army from holding on to the Guangdong-Hankou Railway has been completely shattered. The Japanese army's grand plan to open up the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and divide the Chinese mainland is gradually approaching completion. The Japanese soldiers are fiercely advancing towards Shaoguan, the enemy's main stronghold.

A certain Japanese base in China, 11th (Central News Agency) — Japanese bomber squadrons have been strongly attacking the enemy bases in Chongqing for days and have achieved great results. On the night of the 9th, they launched a surprise attack on the Guilin airfield, a key air force stronghold in the southwestern region, braving the fierce attacks of enemy fighters and anti-aircraft fire, and bombed its aircraft parking area, causing seven large aircraft, five small aircraft, and two aircraft of unknown type to burn. Four large aircraft and ten small aircraft were destroyed. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.

Fire Starts After Bombing in Hengyang City; A certain Japanese base, 11th (Central News Agency) — A Japanese air force bombing squadron launched a fierce bombing raid on the Chongqing army in Hengyang City on the morning of the 11th. The Japanese aircraft dropped bombs accurately, and a fire broke out in one place in the city. The black smoke billowed and covered the entire city.

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) — According to a dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing military authorities issued the following statement regarding the situation in Hunan from the 6th to the 8th: Fierce battles continued in the Weiyang area. On the night of the 6th, the Japanese army dropped incendiary bombs on Hengyang City and repeatedly attacked the positions in the suburbs of the city. The Chongqing army's garrison counterattacked under the cover of artillery fire. Fierce battles continued until noon on the 7th. The fierce battles did not stop in the twenty-four hours from noon on the 7th to noon on the 8th. The Chongqing army's garrison is still stubbornly defending Weiyang and is engaged in intense street fighting in Yongfeng. The Chongqing air force squadrons are covering the ground troops in the Yongfeng area. The Japanese army is advancing south from Yongfeng, and the Chongqing army is intercepting them. Fierce battles are still ongoing near Qingyuan in Guangdong.

A certain Japanese front line, 11th (Central News Agency) — The Japanese army on the Hunan front captured Jinlansi (40 kilometers northwest of Hengyang) on the 9th and thoroughly annihilated the Chongqing army that was rushing to reinforce Hengyang. The Japanese army is still continuing to mop up the remnants of the defeated Chongqing army in the vicinity.

Japanese Forces Launch General Offensive West of Xiangxiang

A certain Japanese base on the front line, 11th (Central News Agency) — Elite Japanese troops attacked southwest from Xiangxiang on the night of the 30th. On the morning of the 2nd, the Chongqing army approached the west of Xiangxiang in an attempt to recapture Xiangxiang, but the Japanese troops kept a close watch and went around to the rear of the Chongqing army. A general offensive was launched before dawn on the 3rd, annihilating the main forces of the Chongqing army's 15th Division and 45th Division. The Chongqing army suffered an unexpected blow and was in extreme disarray. Each unit is retreating northward. In this battle, 300 soldiers of the Chongqing army were killed and 50 were captured. The Japanese army seized a mortar and a large quantity of machine gun ammunition.

### Air Raid on Wuhan Yesterday

Hankou, 11th (Central News Agency) — The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, using several B-25 aircraft, launched a total of five air raids on the Wuhan area, starting at 0:45 AM on the 11th. The attacks were met with Japanese anti-aircraft fire and failed to achieve their objectives. They only bombed the outskirts of Wuchang and immediately fled. The Japanese side suffered minimal losses.

### Enemy Pays Heavy Price for Occupying Caen

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) — According to German news reports, British troops broke into the city of Caen near St. Germain from the north. Before the British army resumed the frontal offensive against Caen on Sunday, they launched fierce air raids and heavy artillery bombardments on the central and southern parts of the city. The German army conducted tenacious defenses, but British troops advanced to the Caen highway west of the city. In view of the enemy's advance at Saint Germain, the German army withdrew from Carpiquet, which fell into the hands of Canadian troops. The city of Caen has changed hands four times. On Sunday, U.S. troops again entered the city. The German army established another center of resistance between Cheux and Cussy. The U.S. army attempted to advance south, and fierce battles were taking place, especially near Grainville. The German army repelled enemy advances twelve times in twenty-four hours.

Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) — According to frontline reports, British troops along the Odon River southwest of Caen launched a new offensive on the 10th in the middle reaches of the Odon River to the east.

### Fierce Street Battles for Vilnius

Stockholm, 11th (Central News Agency) — According to a German radio broadcast, Soviet forces have reached Utena, on the highway between Vilnius and Dvinsk. The 300 kilometer long front, starting from Lokno through Vilnius to Erlonim, is now almost a straight line. The area where the most fierce battles are unfolding is the Vilnius region. According to German frontline reports, the German garrison in the city is trapped in a Soviet encirclement and is holding on desperately with few troops, engaging in horrific street battles. The German army is continuously dispatching armored troops to try to break the encirclement of the city. Over 1,000 tanks from both sides are engaged in fierce battles in the marshy areas near the city.

### Observations from a Rice Train

What the Japanese residents are most concerned about right now is probably the issue of rice rations. Some people are spreading the rumor that rations will stop on July 20th, and many believe it to be true. A few days ago, I asked the Rice Control Association about this, and the answer was as follows:

"Everyone knows that the Rice Control Association's procurement performance is not good, but the rice for the 100,000 Allied nationals living here will certainly not stop being rationed. The Chinese are like the hosts, and the Japanese are the guests. According to the usual rules of friendship, when a family is so poor that neither the host nor the guest can eat their fill, the guest should always eat first. Not to mention July, the rationed rice for the Allied people for August is also prepared, so please do not worry."

This is a very grateful reply for the Japanese. Now is the lean season, and since preparations have already been made for July and August, it is unlikely that rations will be stopped in September. If the distribution has a model to stop, then I will not have face, and the Rice Control Association, which replied to the reporter like this, will also have no face. My face is naturally not the problem, but for the sake of the Rice Control Association's face, I hope they will not break their promise and continue to distribute rations.

The Japanese naturally only think about the Japanese side's rations first, which is human nature, but we hope that the rice problem will be successfully resolved for both the Chinese and Japanese people.

Procuring Forty Shi

On July 1st, Shanghai began procuring rice. The next day, in order to find out how much had been procured, I visited the Rice Control Association, which replied "about forty shi." This cannot be said to be too little. "This is not laughable, if you move in with a formal passport, you can procure a considerable quantity." Now is not the time to laugh, but the time to shed tears in order to solve the rice problem. Therefore, I collected various materials to examine and study the procurement policy.

I heard that the rice transported by trucks is repackaged into small five-dou bags when it is brought in, and laborers are hired to transport it in. If the target of the procurement is a large amount of rice with formal passports, then it is not a problem, but after the promulgation of the regulation "for more than five dou and less than ten shi," the procedure becomes very troublesome, and that regulation also becomes a mere formality. This phenomenon is also worrying for the prestige of the National Government.

The actions of the peddlers are entirely dominated by profit considerations. Rather than transporting one shi of rice and being procured for three dou at a low price, it is more profitable to transport five dou and avoid procurement. They will not transport one shi of rice to escape this procurement net, but will inevitably divide it into two and transport it in multiple times. I feel the contradiction between the regulations and reality here.

Rice Train

I, who came from Changzhou on a third-class train, was unable to contain my feelings upon hearing and seeing what was happening on the train. I did not expect the situation to be so bad. Many employees of the Central China Railway Company do not question the forgery of uniforms to impersonate China Railway employees and transport large amounts of rice. The price difference between rice in Shanghai and various places on the Hainan line has led people with fixed jobs to run around for rice. China Railway employees are just taking advantage of their convenient position. There is something that must be explained here to the China Railway authorities and the general public. That is, Chinese conductors and their accomplices, China Railway employees, openly demand fifty yuan per dou of rice from small vendors in front of passengers. Seeing this scene, one cannot help but bristle with anger. On the luggage racks and under the seats, they search for rice bags with bloodshot eyes. "Hey, three hundred yuan!" "Hey! Two hundred yuan!" They watch them put it in their pockets. If they slightly dislike the commission being too high and protest according to reason, it is gone. On a train, this kind of extortion of commissions continues all the way to Suzhou and beyond. It is said that this madness is happening every day, and the peddlers are not only being exploited on the train, so how can the price of rice in Shanghai not be high? At Songjiang Station, shortly after the tickets were sold, a "full" sign was hung out. Those who wanted to take the train tried every means, and the third class fare to Shanghai, which was originally three yuan, actually cost more than one hundred yuan.

I am not someone who likes to expose ugliness, but I cannot help but solemnly point out here that the China Railway authorities should crack down on these bad employees. Distribution of rice in kind is certainly a good thing, and only China Railway employees benefit from it, but cracking down on extra demands will extend the benefits widely.

Punishing Profiteers

Profiteers should absolutely be arrested and severely punished. We often hear, what is the Economic Security Bureau doing? Good people will never oppose conquering profiteers. The effectiveness of "what regulations" and "what laws" based on things that are actually unsuitable for the modern era is minimal. In this lean season, traitors who disrupt the rice trade should be paraded through the streets to announce their crimes to the five million citizens, completely destroy their face, and then execute them.

Those who believe in modern law may object to this approach, but this is an effective punishment method that is adapted to the current stage of Chinese society. The New China Newspaper's editorial office proposed this method, and the Chinese who hate profiteers also thought it was good when they heard it. Corrupt China Railway employees should also have their crimes announced in front of Shanghai Station and be publicly displayed in cangues for three days.

Rice countermeasures can no longer be solved by empty talk on paper. According to common sense, bold and sudden, humane, and multifaceted work should be adopted. This is just a small opinion on punishment, and many other tasks should also adopt the method of "uncommonness as the norm." (Communication from Takemoto, special correspondent for the Mainland New Daily, July 6)

### Municipal Advisory Committee Discusses Rice Issues Mayor Chen Expresses Acceptance of Various Recommendations

Mayor Chen hosted a tea party for all members of the Municipal Advisory Committee at the First District Office at 4:00 p.m. on the 10th, and also held the fourth plenary meeting. Mayor Chen and Secretary-General Wu arrived on time to host. In addition to Li Sihao and Yuan Ludeng, who were absent due to illness, all members of the Municipal Advisory Committee attended, including Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Shen Siliang, Wu Zhenxiu, Zhao Zhengping, and others, as well as the heads of various bureaus and departments under the municipal government, totaling more than 30 people.

Mayor Chen's Speech

Mayor Chen first gave a speech, saying: Since the establishment of the Municipal Advisory Committee, it has provided assistance to the municipal administration, so that there can be harmony between the top and bottom and mutual understanding, which is deeply appreciated. Since the unification of Shanghai's administration, there are thousands of things that should be reformed, but the rice problem is becoming more and more serious, and it can be said that it has reached its limit today. The Advisory Committee has carefully studied this and spared no effort, which is especially admirable. When I was in Nanjing, I received reports from the municipal government every day, which made me feel very anxious. Recently, when I came to Shanghai, I learned that the implementation of procurement by the Rice Control Association further stimulated the rise in rice prices. Originally, the procurement system can be dispensed with, and it is good to have completely free buying and selling. If it is necessary to enrich the rations, the government can directly buy a large amount, without the need for piecemeal procurement. To fundamentally solve this problem, it is necessary to have an open and honest discussion with relevant parties. This city has encountered various difficulties recently, which has caused you to worry and work hard. I am very uneasy. I hope that you will work together with the municipal government, assist each other, and express your opinions as much as possible, without any reservations, which is what I should be grateful for.

Lin Kanghou's Speech

Then, Committee Member Lin Kanghou reported on all the recommendations made to the municipal authorities after the third general meeting of the Advisory Committee. The most important ones, regarding rice, include requesting the Rice Control Association to abolish the Class C certificate for less than five dou, requesting the municipal government to find ways to increase the distribution of miscellaneous grains and handle price controls, quickly organizing patrol teams to crack down on extortion along the way, and continuing to maintain the household rice rationing system. Regarding the issue of purchasing rice during this year's autumn harvest, a committee member has been designated to study a concrete plan for recommendations, which is currently being drafted.

Education Issues

Committee Member Shen Siliang reported on the meeting of the Education Subcommittee, saying that education issues are also very serious now. If tuition fees are increased, the number of children dropping out of school will inevitably increase sharply. If tuition fees are low, teachers and staff will not be able to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, the consensus of the committee's discussion is that tuition fees in public schools can be lower, but efforts must be made to expand and accommodate as many students as possible. Private schools should be subsidized by the government, and teachers and staff in private schools should be given the same treatment as those in public schools, and given special rations, so that tuition fees can be reduced to the lowest possible level. If the municipal government's revenue in the second half of the year can be slightly better, more education funds must be allocated, which is the most desired.

Rice Issues

Subsequently, Secretary-General Wu and Director Feng successively gave brief reports on the recent efforts to address the rice issue, and listed facts to show that the municipal government has tried its best to handle the matter within the scope of its administrative capabilities. The distribution methods and relief of food for the poor were also mentioned in passing. Then, Chen Binsu, Xiang Kangyuan, Jin Xiongbai, Zhao Jinqing, Lin Kanghou and others successively expressed their opinions, and believed that two points were most important for the current rice problem: that the local governments, agencies, chambers of commerce, etc. in each rice-producing area should set the price publicly, and that competition among merchants should be stopped. However, the rice-collecting agencies have failed to implement these two points, which has led to the rise in rice prices. It is hoped that the Rice Control Association and the municipal government will cooperate closely and reorganize as soon as possible to seek sound personnel. It is also hoped that the central government will use its maximum power to dredge sources from all over. In addition, regarding the recent strict order from the police to all factories to organize special self-defense corps, the situation is serious, causing various difficulties in the factories, hindering production, and affecting it significantly. It is hoped that the authorities will pay special attention to this.

Important Recommendations

Finally, Chen Binsu made important recommendations: It is hoped that the municipal government will negotiate with the Rice Control Association again to cancel the separate procurement of less than ten shi and more than five dou no later than the end of July, and that the central government will issue a clear order to the Rice Control Association that in the future, if there are any new measures implemented regarding Shanghai, it must obtain close contact with the Shanghai Municipal Government in advance. Present to the central government to quickly set up a Shanghai Rice Public Warehouse. Special rations should also be given to teachers and staff in private schools. It is hoped that the price control of miscellaneous grains and other matters will be implemented in the near future, and it was passed by unanimous consent.

Finally, Mayor Chen explained the central government's handling of the rice issue and expressed his complete acceptance of the various recommendations made today. This meeting lasted for two hours, and the most detailed review was conducted on the rice issue, which shows that the municipal government and the Advisory Committee are trying their best to solve the people's food problem. The meeting ended at about 6 p.m.

### No Procurement of Rice Shipments Under Ten Shi Rice Control Association Announces Immediate Implementation

The Shanghai Municipal Government has requested the Rice Control Association to promptly revise Article 7 of the announced measures for transporting rice (i.e., procuring three dou per shi for shipments between five dou and ten shi) in order to stabilize rice prices.

### Huacheng Industrial Company to Automatically Liquidate Assets and Return Share Payments at Face Value

The stock market is sluggish and stock prices have fallen below the actual value of the assets of various companies. It is now heard that Huacheng Industrial Company, run by Zhang Shankun and others, will convene an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on July 31 to discuss automatic liquidation and sell the company's assets separately. It is estimated that each share can be redeemed at face value. When the company's stock price fell the most severely, each share was only worth three or four yuan. The news of this full refund will protect the interests of small shareholders and stabilize the social economy. However, there are more than a dozen new stocks that have fallen below par and are in the same dire situation as Huacheng. The leaders of these companies are all well-known figures in society and should follow Huacheng's example to establish future credibility.

Brief Commentary

### Sober in a Drunken World

Huacheng Company Liquidates and Returns Share Payments in Full

In recent months, stocks have changed sharply from a period of extreme prosperity to a period of extreme decline, which is an unreasonable and morbid state in the entire economy. Why do stocks rise and fall sharply? In addition to economic factors, the speculative actions of those who pursue quick profits naturally account for a large part, which we do not need to discuss in detail here.

Now there are many new stocks whose value has fallen below par, and there are also those that have not been listed but are transferred in the black market, which are only worth 20% to 30% of the face value, which is even more miserable. We know that in a period several months ago, stock prices rose steadily, and newly established companies attracted investors like bamboo shoots after rain. Most of the so-called investors were salaried workers, who were motivated by the temptation of small stocks making big profits. Therefore, they saved money on food and clothing, and even pawned their clothes and belongings, to raise cash to subscribe for new shares. Later, the stock market changed suddenly, and they all suffered heavy losses. On the other hand, prices rose daily, which was a very serious blow to salaried workers in general.

Now Huacheng Industrial Company has taken the step of liquidating assets and returning share payments at their actual face value, and its announcement shows that its intention is to take care of the interests of small shareholders. In the current atmosphere of speculation and quick profits, this step of being sober in a drunken world is enough to sober up society.

We hope that various new companies will consider their own reputation and may as well follow suit. Or partially reduce capital, and use the changed value of the property to repay part of it at face value first, in order to protect the rights of shareholders and establish a reputation for attracting investment in future productive enterprises. At the same time, non-productive companies should be completely liquidated and the share payments repaid. We also hope that the competent authorities and the various industry associations of the city's Chamber of Commerce will pay attention to this issue together and discuss a comprehensive remedy.
