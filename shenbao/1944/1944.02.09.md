### Cultural Movement and Cultural Figures

A cultural movement can be said to be the driving force behind all movements, especially in extraordinary times. There is a particular need for a cultural movement to shoulder the task of enlightenment and widespread publicity, so that the people may recognize the face of this extraordinary era. At present, Greater East Asia is in the decisive battle to defeat Britain and the United States, and China is in its second year of participating in the war, a time of cooperative warfare. All military, political, and economic measures require the assistance and advancement of a cultural movement to complete the mission of this extraordinary era.

Those engaged in cultural work are generally referred to as "cultural figures." Naturally, the effectiveness of the cultural movement depends on the actual efforts of these cultural figures. The field of cultural work is extremely broad, so the scope of cultural figures is also very large. Generally speaking, because cultural work is, objectively speaking, inclined towards being non-productive and non-profit-making, the lives of cultural figures are always impoverished and arduous.

As mentioned above, the current Nanjing National Government must strive to win the Greater East Asia War on the one hand, and carry out political reform on the other. It truly has a heavy responsibility and a long way to go. Therefore, the need for cultural figures to cooperate is extremely urgent. However, the stagnation and decline of cultural work in the peace zone is an undeniable fact. Tracing the reasons, it is not only the lack of cultural figures, but especially the poor living conditions and environment of cultural figures, making it impossible to improve their work spirit and efficiency, and to make the greatest effort for the cultural movement. Let us try to make an objective analysis. There are several reasons why cultural figures in the current peace zone feel uneasy:

Personal Living Difficulties: Cultural figures generally do not engage in production or are good at making profits. They rely on a pen and a mouth to earn a living. In recent years, prices have risen endlessly, but the income of cultural figures can never keep up with the increase in prices. They cannot shoulder the burden of supporting themselves and their families. As a result, some have become depressed, while others have engaged in other occupations.

Threats and Hostility from the Chongqing and Communist Parties: Special agents from Chongqing and the Communist Party threaten and show hostility towards cultural figures. They carry out various kinds of sabotage on the work undertaken by cultural figures.

Lack of Definite Protection from the National Government: Cultural figures are both threatened and hated by the Chongqing and Communist parties, and the Nanjing National Government does not provide definite protection, causing cultural figures to feel hesitant. On the one hand, they are further oppressed by life, and they become scattered and lonely, which is natural.

Among the past friends of cultural figures, there are not a few Chongqing and Communist party members. Therefore, they may encounter unexpected suspicion. They cannot avoid having many concerns about their own work, and they cannot feel at ease, which affects their effectiveness.

Because of these reasons, there are very few cultural talents in the peace zone. As a result, cultural work is scattered, and cultural standards are low. For example, publications have decreased significantly; readable articles and excellent creations are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns; the atmosphere of academic research is weak, and there are no scientific inventions.

In response to the above reasons, we hope that the government authorities will quickly find ways to improve the situation. At the same time, we hope that the Allied authorities will do their best to assist, so that the cultural movement can cooperate with the war and generate auxiliary power. Here, we offer several expectations:

The government should have a regular subsidy system for the lives of impoverished cultural figures and set up literary awards, academic awards, etc., to encourage research interests and improve cultural standards.

The government should give cultural figures as many publishing opportunities as possible for their writings, encourage creation, and strengthen the people's understanding of this extraordinary era.

The authorities should fully trust and provide definite protection to those cultural figures who work hard in their positions. If they are suspected at every turn and trust is not specialized, no one will be willing to serve, and they will either be perfunctory or feel uneasy in their positions.

If the reasons why cultural figures cannot be stable in the peace zone are not urgently addressed, then there is absolutely no way to talk about a cultural movement; and if political movements are not supported and assisted by a cultural movement, then they will absolutely not be easily successful. The government authorities should attach importance to the importance of the cultural movement, so that cultural figures can serve with peace of mind and fight for common goals!

During this period, the reason why we were able to achieve the expected goals of maintaining security and construction was due to the unlimited support of the Japanese army and the active cooperation of the awakened people. We are deeply grateful for this. Our army believes that our country is founded on agriculture, so in order to achieve the ideal of integrating soldiers and farmers, we have made our greatest efforts. In order to ensure the peace and prosperity of the people, we have devoted all our efforts to eliminating the Communist army. Now that the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage, the mission undertaken by our participating country is even more important. This year, we will resolutely implement the four major guidelines instructed by Chairman Wang and quickly seek to establish security in North China. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has indicated the path we should take, and the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty makes it impossible for us not to rise up.

Since January 6, the Japanese army has continued to clear out the remnants of the Chongqing army wandering in the mountains near Pingyou on the Yunnan-Myanmar border.

### Enemy Aircraft Blindly Bomb Japanese Hospital Ship, Large Number of Missionaries Killed

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific: The brutality and inhumanity of the American military can be proven by their repeated blind bombing of Japanese hospital ships. Moreover, they also inhumanely bombed the missionaries who were taking refuge under the protection of the Japanese army, further exposing their brutal nature. More than a hundred foreign missionaries living south of New Guinea Island recently suffered heavy losses due to the fierce blind bombing by the U.S. Air Force. Under the protection of the Japanese army, they moved to Mana Island. However, the U.S. Air Force also carried out blind bombing on this island. Therefore, the Japanese army transported these missionaries to蘭迪阿 by barge. On the 6th, the ship was sailing on the sea near Weivajian Island, when at 7:20 a.m. on that morning, 28 U.S. B25 aircraft suddenly flew over the barge and bombed it. The weather was clear that day, and the enemy aircraft flew at ultra-low altitude and repeatedly opened fire. Most of the refugees in the ship were women and children, and most of them were standing on the deck. Moreover, most of the women's clothing was missionary uniforms, but the U.S. Air Force flew from an altitude of 40 to 50 meters and exposed half of their bodies to shoot, thinking that they could recognize that the passengers in the ship were not combatants. Although the Japanese soldiers tried their best to protect the refugees, the enemy aircraft stubbornly opened fire, causing 58 people to be killed on the spot, 80 people to be seriously injured, and almost all others to be injured. The Japanese army immediately sent these injured people to nearby military medical facilities for proper care.

On the night of the 6th, the Japanese navy had the opportunity to discover an enemy transport convoy in the strait between New Britain and New Guinea Island, and bombed it, achieving great results. Furthermore, on 常夜, they attacked the Finschhafen enemy airfield, with all bombs hitting the target, causing fires in both locations. On the other hand, they also urgently attacked the enemy landing positions in the Cape Vogel area of New Britain and the Gros 角 area, launching a fierce attack and destroying them. Regarding the above attacks, except for one Japanese aircraft that did not return, there was no damage to the others.

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific, the Japanese army's attack on the enemy troops landing at Gongbi Cape in New Guinea is becoming increasingly fierce.

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - A message from a Japanese military base in the Southwest Pacific reported that 14 American aircraft attacked Anben on the night of the 4th. The Japanese garrison forces repelled them with fierce anti-aircraft fire, and the Japanese side suffered no damage.

### Japanese Army in Burma Launches Strong Counterattack, Has Occupied Dunbazaa, Anti-Axis Powers Acknowledge Difficulties in Combat

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from the Japanese front in Burma reported that the Japanese army in the India-Burma border area has launched an offensive in the south, attacking the enemy forces in the Mayu Mountain range between the Nyukua River and the Mayu River from three sides. The Japanese army某某 unit launched a fierce attack on the enemy near Nagai after dusk on the 6th. Before long, the enemy forces began to retreat westward. At the same time, the enemy forces 10 kilometers northwest of Buthidaung and on the high ground west of the area also retreated along the highway west of Nagaidekushi. The Japanese army pursued them immediately and achieved great results. The enemy forces in the Mayu River area also began to retreat after dusk on the 6th, and the Japanese army is currently pursuing them. Furthermore, the retreat route of the enemy forces retreating towards Maungdaw has been cut off by the Japanese army, so the enemy forces in that area have become rats in a sack.

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) - The British Southeast Asia Command announced the following battle situation on the Arakan front on the 7th: The Japanese army on the Arakan front launched a strong counterattack on the 5th. Their surprise attack unit attacked unprepared anti-Axis reconnaissance units. On the 5th, they occupied Dunbazaa. On the evening of the 5th, the two armies fell into chaos. On the 6th, the Japanese army continued to attack southwest of Dunbazaa.

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in Burma: The enemy forces on the entire line of the Burma-India border are panicking and losing their way under the cheers of the Indian National Army and the repeated blows of the Japanese army. The swaying of the British, Indian, American, and Chongqing forces has formed extreme unease. In northern Burma, since last year, the New 32nd Division under Zheng Dongguo's部部 of the Chongqing army had been active in the area along the highway from Hpakant to Hpungin, attempting to open the so-called "Road to Tokyo," but they were repeatedly attacked by the Japanese army, suffering heavy losses, abandoning 1,171 bodies, capturing 37 people, and losing 69,928 bullets. Since the beginning of January, the 7th Division and the 某某 Division under the British 14th Army in Maungdaw have also gradually advanced and clamored to retake places like Nikhe, but the Japanese troops suddenly occupied a certain location behind the front line of the 7th Division and launched a fierce advance. Recently, the commander of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, Stilwell, observed the front line and mentioned the difficulties of combat on the northern Burma border. On January 20, the enemy side broadcasted to cover up the famine situation in the state of Bengal and warned that if the Indian National Army reached India, it should immediately report to the British authorities. All of this is nothing more than a flustered expression of the British authorities, and the fact that tens of thousands of elite British troops are on the verge of annihilation in front of Nikhe will only increase the unease of the enemy troops on the front line.

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) - After the Anti-Axis powers' meeting in Quebec, the Southeast Asia Military Command was set up and狂狂 brayed to retake Burma, but more than three months have passed since the rainy season ended, and a large-scale action has not yet begun. Today, the Japanese army suddenly launched an offensive to制制 the enemy. Due to the clear indications of various facts, the Southeast Asia Military authorities also admitted that the counter-offensive operation in Burma cannot proceed according to the scheduled plan. Recently, according to the Daily Mail, the New Delhi authorities also admitted that the formal attack war in Burma would still take a considerable period of time, but the rainy season would arrive soon, so the recent local fighting could be carried out in the near-land area of the Thai晋 front. Furthermore, the British "One Week in the East" magazine discussed the delay in the counter-offensive operation in Burma on the 7th, saying that the people of the Anti-Axis countries must wait patiently for the launch of the counter-offensive operation in Burma. Without more equipment and军军 troops than at present, it is not possible to break through the Burma front on a large scale. Although there is sufficient manpower necessary for land battles, there is no space to use these troops. In the future, the Indian army must find ways to establish contact with the Chongqing army. Mountbatten must overcome the adverse geographical conditions. If large-scale naval power cannot be used in the Bay of Bengal, the activities of the British army on land will still be restricted.

### The Importance of the Battle of Mayu Mountain: Remarks by Japanese Military Expert

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to a military expert here, the significance of the ongoing operation on the Burmese-Indian border is as follows: The Japanese army on the Burmese-Indian border unexpectedly launched an offensive from the front of Buthidaung on the 4th of this month.  It is continuing its advance in the Mayu mountain range, which is densely forested, canyoned, and towering at an altitude of 10,000 feet, and is steadily reaping the expected war results. At the same time, the Free Indian National Army is also cooperating with the Japanese army to overcome all obstacles and advance towards Delhi. From a broad perspective, this war has a turning point importance in the current stage of the Greater East Asia War.  The significance is briefly described as follows: This operation was initiated by the Japanese army, so the command of the battle is in the hands of the Japanese army. This proves that even though the Japanese army is currently engaged in fierce battles with the US army in the Pacific, which are rare in war history, it still has the ability to launch offensives anytime and anywhere when necessary. British cunning is even worse than that of the United States. They planned to make Japan and the United States fight each other in the Pacific first, and then launch an offensive in Southeast Asia when the Atlantic war situation developed favorably. Judging from the recent Pacific war situation, Mountbatten believed that the time for the British and American forces to act had arrived, and he was preparing activities on the Burmese-Indian border, attempting to form a general counter-offensive against Japan with British and American pincer attacks. However, his attempt has suffered a major setback because the Japanese army launched a preemptive general offensive. The main goal of Mountbatten's counter-offensive was to recapture or destroy the southern resource areas where the Japanese army cultivated its combat power, but the rapid progress of the Japanese army's current operation has shattered the enemy's ambition and made the southern resource sphere more consolidated. A major reason for the enemy's attempt to counter-attack Burma was to open up the road from northern Burma to Chongqing, but after the Japanese army started a new operation, this attempt was again thwarted. The United States has the highest expectations for opening up the Burma-Chongqing road, and the United States hopes to use this route to enhance its aid to Chongqing, increase its strength in building a second front in China, and actively expand the US air force stationed in Chongqing, in an attempt to realize its ambition to carry out air raids on the Japanese mainland, so as to contain the Japanese army's Pacific front. Therefore, the United States has equipped the three divisions of troops stationed in India and Chongqing with American-style equipment and American instructors. Recently, it has even planned to統轄 Yunnan-Chongqing army. It is rumored that the United States and Chongqing are currently negotiating the transfer of command of the Chongqing army in that province. The United States' intention was originally to sacrifice the Chongqing army in order to open up the Burma-Chongqing road. Chongqing also believes that the only way to break out of the current predicament is to realize the northern Burma road, so as to obtain supplies from Britain and the United States. Therefore, without thinking carefully, it is willing to listen to the opinions of the United States, and intends to order the Chongqing army in Yunnan Province to launch a counter-offensive when the British and Indian armies counter-attack Burma, so as to cooperate with the US army. Since the new spring of this year, the Chongqing army in Yunnan Province and the Chongqing army stationed in India in the Hukawng Valley area have been coordinating with each other, attempting to launch a general counter-offensive. However, the Japanese army's attack on the Chongqing army in the southern border of Burma and India has revealed flaws in this attempt. The Japanese army's meticulous defense has left the Chongqing army with no room for stupidity. As a result, the United States' plan to open up the road from northern Burma to Chongqing to relieve Chongqing's plight and strengthen China's second front has become a pipe dream. In this operation, the Free Indian National Army and the Burmese National Army cooperated with the Japanese army and fought side by side, launching a joint attack, which is worthy of long-term attention. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo said in his policy speech on January 21 that Chandra Bose raised the flag of independence in a corner of India and rose up for the freedom of India. The Japanese government has decided to do its best to actively provide assistance in the future. This is Japan's strong declaration of its determination to assist in the liberation of India. Now, with the support of the Japanese army, the Indian National Army has begun a general offensive towards Delhi to realize its long-cherished wish to liberate its motherland. In addition, the Japanese army is also providing full cooperation to the national army of the new Burma in order to liberate East Asia from the shackles of Britain and the United States. At present, the Japanese, Burmese, and Indian armies are united into a system and are currently tightening the encirclement of the Mountbatten army. Therefore, the war in the Mayu mountain range is of great importance.

### Indian National Army Stationed in the Arakan Mountains; Basic Principles of Army Building Announced

Burma, 8th (Central News Agency) – After the Indian National Army moved to Burma on January 7, it waited for an opportunity to advance towards its motherland. Now that the time it has longed for has arrived, it has resolutely cooperated with the Japanese army to start a war for freedom. Therefore, the liberation of India has begun its initial stage. Now, the basic principles of the Indian National Army's army building are introduced as follows: The Indian National Army is an army of Indians themselves. The National Army belongs to the Indian Provisional Government, swears allegiance to the motherland, takes unity and trust as its creed, gathers all its strength to achieve the goal of overthrowing Britain, and carries out the independence of the motherland. Based on the elite soldier principle, only the best are organized. The commander-in-chief of the Indian National Army is Bose, and his staff is 列斯列. The total number of soldiers is unknown, but religious opposition and ethnic discrimination are not abandoned, and the goal of liberating the motherland is achieved together. Even the women's unit commanded by Minister Lakshmi Bai participates in the battle line. Indians throughout East Asia have now risen up, with the National Army as the core, and stationed in the Arakan Mountains. The future activities of the Indian people are highly anticipated.

### The Battle for the Fortress of Europe: Asahi Shimbun Roundtable Discussion

The Asahi Shimbun believes that if Britain and the United States truly regard this year as the decisive year, they must open up a second front that echoes the Eastern Front. In the joint statement issued by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union at the Tehran Conference at the end of November last year, "Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union were in complete agreement on the scale and timing of the simultaneous attacks on Germany from the east, west, and south." Therefore, the "attack from the west" that has not yet been implemented is about to take place. The question is, when and where will Britain and the United States start? This is the climax of the tense European war situation. What are the observations in various places regarding the timing and location of the second front, which Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are keeping extremely secret?

Special Correspondent in Moscow – Soviet newspapers and the Soviet people are urging Britain and the United States to open up a second front as soon as possible. However, the leadership of the second front lies with Britain and the United States, so Soviet newspapers and the people try to avoid making various predictions about the second front. Therefore, it is very difficult to predict the timing and location of the second front. However, it seems that people generally believe that when Britain and the United States invade Western Europe, the British and American forces will land simultaneously on the Atlantic coast of France, Belgium, Norway, etc. As for the timing, they will seize the opportunity to exert the greatest effect and implement organized coordinated operations.

Special Correspondent Taguchi (Zurich) – The timing of the anti-Axis forces' offensive in Europe will be after the anti-Axis forces have actively bombed the German transportation network, and will gradually be realized starting in mid-February. However, the key lies in two factors: the movement of the Eastern Front and the effect of the air strikes. For example, regarding the first factor, the Eastern Front, if a decisive change very favorable to the Red Army is seen, the offensive will also be rapidly promoted. The main battleground of the offensive is the western coast of Europe and the Balkans. Landings in southern France and Norway are likely to be of a diversionary nature.

Special Correspondent Watanabe (Stockholm) – Churchill and Roosevelt promised Stalin to open a second front at the Tehran Conference, but their words often don't count. British and American propaganda claims that there are now two million troops in the UK preparing to invade Western Europe. Newspapers say that the British army has fifty divisions in the UK, the American army has fifty to one hundred divisions, there are twenty to thirty British divisions in North Africa, ten divisions of the Tagore army, and thirty British divisions in Syria. The British and American forces' invasion of Western Europe has been prepared so that it can be started anytime and anywhere, and now they are just waiting for the opportunity to start.

There are various speculations about the location of the offensive. First, small-scale landings will be carried out simultaneously in various places in a diversionary sense. The question lies in where the main force of the invading army is. In northern Italy, there is the natural barrier of the Alps, and on the French Mediterranean coast, there is also the constraint of the Nonu River Valley between the Alps and the Central Mountains. As for using Norway as the main battlefield, it is too far away.

On the other hand, regarding the geographical conditions of the Balkans, it has been repeatedly rumored that the游擊隊 forces of 　特 and Mihailović, which cannot threaten the German domestic front, will be used to attack the Balkans. However, the游擊戰 currently being carried out in the Balkans cannot be regarded as a true military operation. The future Balkan operations will also become a "snail's pace" like the Italian operations. Therefore, the most likely offensive location currently considered is the English Channel area from the Netherlands, Belgium to northern France.

### Focus of Eastern Front Shifts to Nikopol; Fierce Battles Continue in Vitebsk

Berlin, entered on the same day (Central News Agency) – Since January, the focus of the war on the Eastern Front has shifted to the 洞爾赫夫 in Leningrad. The Soviet army's northern offensives, which started from that area, temporarily stopped on the Baltic border. Since the beginning of February, the focus has shifted again to the Nikopol bridgehead area in the lower reaches of the Dnieper River. Last October, due to the Soviet army's Dnieper River breakthrough operation in the Kryvyi Rih area, the German army abandoned the right bank of the middle reaches of the river and switched to defending the iron ore producing area of Kryvyi Rih and the manganese ore producing area of Nikopol. This time, the Soviet army encircled the Dnieper bend from three directions: the southern bank of the Dnieper River from the Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporozhye areas. The German authorities also acknowledged the gravity of the war situation and declared that they would defend the city of Nikopol to the death. The fate of the Dnieper bend depends entirely on whether the German army can hold Nikopol, so this war situation is worthy of attention.

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to the Haitsu News Agency: The Soviet army launched another fierce attack on Vitebsk yesterday, only achieving a local breakthrough, but suffering heavy casualties. In the evening, they launched another attack, but were still repelled. North of Nevel, the enemy attempted to expand the line they had broken through, but ultimately failed. Near the Narva isthmus and around Kryvyi Rih, the Soviet army launched small-scale offensives without success. The German army continued to advance south of the isthmus. The war situation in the northern sector of the Eastern Front has generally not changed. Soviet power has increased in the areas south of Pripyat and Nikopol. Yesterday, Soviet rapid units and cavalry advanced westward on the plains north of Kryvyi Rih, but were blocked by the German army, and fierce battles continued. The weather in the southern sector of the Eastern Front is warm, with temperatures around 0 to 16 degrees Celsius, and it rains frequently, so the ground is very muddy, making combat very difficult. The entire Dnieper bend is like a large quagmire.

### British and American Forces South of Rome Switch to Defensive; German Army Deploys Arc-Shaped Encirclement

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency) – The anti-Axis forces that landed in Nettuno, southern Italy, attempted to attack Rome, but suffered heavy setbacks due to the fierce attack of the German elite under Marshal Kesselring, and switched from offensive to defensive, attempting to maintain their acquired positions. The German army has now cut off the highway from Anzio to Albano with tank units in order to annihilate the British army protruding into Aprilia, and the anti-Axis forces' front line has fallen into chaos. The German army in that area is not only ensuring contact with Rome, but also continuously assembling elite troops to strengthen Ardea, Aprilia, Cisterna, and other places, forming an arc-shaped encirclement line around the Nettuno bridgehead. It is rumored that an elite German division has arrived in that area, and it is expected that Marshal Kesselring will launch a large-scale counter-offensive with mechanized units.

Fierce Battles Continue on Cassino Line

Also, on the Cassino front, the two armies are still continuing fierce battles around the city, and the German army has completely taken control of the city.

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – The German Führer's headquarters announced: The American army northwest of Cassino launched an attack with a large force throughout the day. The German army engaged them in a charge battle, inflicting heavy damage on them and repelling them.

### Britain and the United States Continuously Exert Pressure on Neutral Countries; Attempt to Interfere in Spanish Internal Affairs

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency learned last night: The London "Observer" launched another fierce attack on Spain, demanding not only international political guarantees from Spain, but also the reorganization of Spanish internal institutions. Commenting on this offensive, Berlin political circles regarded it as extremely serious, because the demands were made as an official announcement to Spain and contained the meaning of a reply to the Spanish government. The "Observer" has always been known for its moderate arguments, and its political articles have a great influence on the British Foreign Office. This attack has completely clarified the situation and revealed the cards being played by the British ambassador to Spain, Hall. This article proves that Britain and the United States' attacks on Spanish neutrality are just an excuse for Britain and the United States to interfere in Spanish internal affairs.

Angland, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Nalote newspaper commented on the British and American attacks on the neutral countries, saying that the pressure they have recently exerted on the neutral countries is only to implement the decisions of the Tehran Conference. Turkey was the first neutral country to be attacked, and Spain is its successor, but neither Turkey nor Spain will make concessions that are detrimental to the interests of the anti-Axis countries.

### Britain and the United States Prepare for Psychological Warfare Against the Axis Powers

Geneva, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to the German News Agency, Washington news: US War Information Bureau Director台雜斯 declared: The Bureau has sent歇　伍特 to London to make various arrangements for launching "psychological warfare" against the Axis powers. He also announced the resignation of three officials of the Bureau.

### Turkish Parliamentarians Warn Britain and the Soviet Union Not to Interfere in Balkan Affairs

Istanbul, 8th (Central News Agency) – Turkish parliamentarian亞爾頓, known for his pro-anti-Axis stance, wrote a warning to Britain and the Soviet Union, saying that they should no longer regard the Balkan countries as their spheres of influence and listen to the Balkan peoples to assert themselves. He also said that the anti-Axis countries should stop their cunning schemes of driving A to fight B.

### Finnish Capital Suffers Second Air Raid

Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) – After the Soviet Air Force bombed Helsinki on the evening of the 6th, it launched a second bombing of the city between midnight and 3:30 AM on the 7th.

### The Current Stage of Urban Air Defense – On the Issue of Urban Evacuation

Understanding Air Gaps

The air battle in the Southwest Pacific is becoming increasingly fierce. Not only in the Southwest Pacific, but also on the Chinese mainland and the northern front lines, the Japanese army is stepping up its defense against enemy aircraft attacks. Their brave and determined combat is truly commendable.

Fortunately, enemy aircraft have not yet invaded the Japanese mainland. The special circumstances of the American mainland are not discussed here. Among the major countries at war, Japan is the only country whose cities have not been bombed. However, is the Japanese territory really within the bombing safe zone? Enemy aircraft can fly from bases in mainland China and the northern Aleutians, or from aircraft carriers. Indeed, the Japanese mainland is in a dangerous state.

The air battle is not only unfolding in areas far from the mainland. The Japanese mainland will also become a fierce battlefield. We must be aware of what may happen at any time. The history of air defense has been more than ten years. It is well known that there has been great progress in air defense activities and facilities compared to ten years ago.

However, urban air defense remains the same, which is regrettable. Looking at the current stage of the war situation, one cannot help but shudder. Can we arrange the order of priority for air defense preparation based on the importance of urban conditions and facilities? Needless to say, we cannot limit air defense preparation work due to limited resources and limited budgets.

Air Defense Preparation and Assessment of Air Raids

To implement air defense preparation, the most important thing is to assess air raids. The assessment of air raids should be entrusted to experts. Ordinary people cannot make arbitrary judgments. However, we should take the opinions of ordinary people so as not to have unexpected results. This is especially important to pay attention to. At this current stage when air raids are bound to come, the four areas of Keihin, Hanshin, Chukyo, and North Kyushu need no discussion. The remaining key areas of the country should be aware that they cannot avoid repeated bombing by a considerable number of enemy aircraft. As the American counter-offensive intensifies, it is natural that they are no longer satisfied with the kind of surprise attack like the April 18th raid. This is quite obvious. Therefore, we should take the most comprehensive measures in advance for the worst-case scenario.

Looking at the current situation of urban air defense in famous European countries, such as Hamburg, Berlin, Milan, etc., and the bombing by the US and British air forces, or the air battles in the Solomon Islands in the South, future air raids will be carried out by aircraft groups of hundreds or two to three hundred aircraft. As for sea-based bombing by several or a dozen aircraft, it will no longer be considered an air raid. No, an air raid that does not achieve a considerable purpose cannot be called an air raid. Air raids and air defense are relative, so as air defense facilities become more and more prepared, air raids gradually become larger and more intense. However, even cities that have been declared undefended, such as Paris and Rome, cannot avoid air raids.

On Urban Evacuation

The main issue at the current stage of urban air defense is the issue of urban evacuation. Japan's biggest shortcoming in air defense is the formation of large, dense urban areas, and the concentration of various national institutions.

Urban areas, especially densely populated urban areas, must be evacuated. This is a fundamental issue. In particular, Tokyo should quickly disperse various overlapping functions, such as political, economic, cultural, and production institutions, and simplify their functions. This is an indispensable measure. Is it not because of the need to increase production, strengthen economic control, and the lack of materials and labor that the issue of urban evacuation has not been raised? Originally, air defense is passive and non-productive, but in order to protect the country, it is essential to strengthen urban air defense actively.

The issue of urban evacuation can not only be effective in air defense, but can also alleviate the disasters of large cities that have been talked about for many years. As for the non-productive problems that may arise temporarily due to the evacuation of large cities, they can be compensated from other aspects or at another time.

The scope of the issue of urban evacuation is extremely broad. It is also closely related to the issue of population evacuation. Here, we only talk about the evacuation of facilities and the decentralization of functions. If there is no facility evacuation, even population evacuation is just a plan on paper.

The so-called evacuation is to disperse the originally dense urban areas or the functions concentrated in the city, transform them into urban areas with many open spaces, or reduce the burden on the city. Therefore, the content of the issue involving urban institutions includes: 1. Moving homes or factories in densely populated urban areas to other places, transforming them into urban areas with more open spaces and sparse buildings. 2. Moving factories, schools, government offices, etc. to local areas, simplifying urban functions and reducing the burden on the city itself.

From the current situation in Japan, the evacuation of densely populated urban areas must be carried out comprehensively. We cannot say which area is better. We must start with areas where the air raid risk is relatively low, or where some damage is unavoidable, in order. From the perspective of the entire country, the cities in the so-called four major industrial areas, such as Keihin and Hanshin, should be the first to start. Above all, the industrial areas within the cities, including important factories, must be the first to start.

While rapidly preparing air defense, we must not only not relax the production of important wartime materials, but also use all means to protect them, so as to avoid air raids. Therefore, evacuating and reorganizing the densely populated areas around military factories is an urgent task. At the same time, we should think about exchanging housing, etc. In the event of an air raid, traffic will stop and factory production will inevitably be suspended, so preparations must be made. Some people say that if the surroundings of important factories are evacuated, they will be easily recognized as the targets of bombing. We should plan camouflage or other methods to protect them. Considering fire prevention, bulletproof and other issues, there is nothing better than building open spaces.

We will encounter a lack of materials and housing when demolishing houses or relocating. Although it seems to be a contradictory method, at this current stage when air raids are bound to come, it is better to relocate before the event occurs, which is a wiser strategy. As for the housing problem, if we consider the decentralization of urban functions, the reorganization of small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises, or the conversion of the uses of large residences and restaurants, then it should be largely resolved.

### Textbooks are Hoarded and Not Sold, Students Have Difficulty Purchasing Books

The various primary and secondary schools in this city have started one after another in recent days. According to a person in the education sector, students in various primary and secondary schools this semester are feeling extremely difficult to purchase textbooks. The reason is that various sales bookstores are unwilling to sell them. At present, the textbooks used in various primary and secondary schools are all those approved by the Ministry of Education. The selling prices of these books have also been strictly stipulated. All bookstores must sell them at the limited price and must not violate it. However, most bookstores are now hoarding large quantities of books for speculative purposes, which is no different from manipulating other commodities, and selling them privately at high black market prices, which directly affects education, which is very hateful. It is now learned that the education authorities in charge have begun to pay attention to this matter, and once the investigation is true, they will be severely punished.

### The Guangong Institute Handles Student Aid Funds

The Shanghai Guangdong Public Institute has been running schools for many years, creating many talents. In addition to increasing subsidies for Guangzhao Public School and Guangdong Women's School this spring, it has also expanded the number of Guangbei Righteous School students by more than 200 (those who are interested in applying must immediately register at the school at Lane 478, Shunheli, Datong Road, to take the entrance examination and enter the school for free). Recently, it has also been negotiating to recover its own houses for its own use, and before greatly expanding the school buildings, it specially allocated 20,500 yuan to entrust this newspaper to handle student aid funds for agriculture and engineering. It is learned that the institute, starting from this academic year, has many poor children from Guangdong who need assistance, and specially transferred more than 200,000 yuan to subsidize the Guangdong out-of-school youth who were unable to get help, referring to this newspaper's student aid fund method. As of the 4th of this month, a total of 85 qualified middle school students and 237 elementary school students have been selected, and the full amount of student aid funds has been sent to the schools where each student is studying. Students who have been selected should complete the enrollment procedures as soon as they receive the notice. If the deadline is exceeded, it will be considered as a waiver. The office of the Guangbi Public Institute is at No. 36, Jiangxi Road, 5th Floor, Shanghai Bank Building. If there are any errors in the mail, students who have applied for student aid funds should go to the Public Institute to see the list of topics selected for the eight selections. , you can understand. Yesterday, the person in charge of the Public Institute said to the reporter: Before the Public Institute recovers its own houses, it also intends to solicit suitable houses, so that it can make further expansions to the student aid righteous cause. The philanthropists and benefactors in Shanghai who are enthusiastic about education are so enthusiastic about donating money to be used as loan scholarships. Those who have land property and have thousands of buildings, it is no different from a drop in the bucket to waive the rent. If there is anyone willing to use a fair rent to be a palace, it will surely be twice the result with half the effort. This is also another way to promote loan scholarships. It's not a good idea for educators to think about the problem of finding a school building for the current school.

### Luo and Lu's Engagement Ceremony

Luo Guang, manager of the Central Tax School Management Office, is the younger brother of Mr. Luo Junqiang. Yesterday, at noon, he held an engagement ceremony with Miss Jing, the daughter of Lu Yifeng, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, at the International Hotel. About 300 guests came, including Yuan Shu and Xu Pu, which was very grand at the time.

### Shanghai Municipal Welfare Association Asks to Increase Righteous Schools

The Shanghai Southern Municipal Welfare Association has specially submitted a document to the Municipal Education Bureau requesting an increase in the number of compulsory schools and adding free places for poor children in various schools, so that poor children will not be out of school.

### Person in Charge of Commercial Integration Explains the Cotton Cloth Allocation Problem: Temporary Allocation is Rushing to Formulate Detailed Methods

Regarding the temporary allocation of cotton cloth, rumors have been circulating for a long time. Recently, there have been rumors that uninspected bulk cloth is designated for allocation purposes, and the allocation price obtained is collected by the owner of the goods. In order to understand the actual situation, the reporter made a special trip to visit the person in charge of the National Commercial Control Association and asked about everything. The following is a record of the questions and answers:

Q: I heard that your association has taken temporary allocation measures because people have not been able to buy cloth for a long time after the yarn and cloth were purchased. What is the actual situation?

A: The purchase of yarn and cloth is entrusted to our association by the government, and all methods are stipulated by the government. Therefore, a separate office is set up to handle it in order to clarify the authority. Now the purchase work has been completed, and the allocation should be implemented immediately, but because the centralized allocation plan is still waiting for various parties to report data, comprehensively study and formulate a basic plan, and submit it to the government for approval before it can be implemented. In order to take care of the suffering of merchants and the people, our association has obtained the government's approval for a special temporary allocation method. The principle has been approved by the government, and we are rushing to formulate detailed methods day and night, and are discussing back and forth with relevant agencies. It will be announced and implemented soon.

Q: I heard that uninspected bulk cloth is designated for allocation purposes, and the allocation price obtained is collected by the owner of the goods. Is this method equivalent to not buying it?

A: Our association purchases yarn and cloth on behalf of the government in accordance with the relevant regulations and rules promulgated by the government. This method is inconsistent with the regulations and rules, and our association is not convenient to advocate it. However, since our association is a commercial group, we are happy to do everything we can to ask the government for orders on behalf of merchants. Now that we hear that merchants are directly requesting the government, our association can only wait for the government's orders to handle it and is not convenient to express any opinions.

Q: Since the cloth is allocated, what about the yarn? The allocation of guest yarn is related to the new production process. As for the new production process, how should the processing notes be stipulated? Tai will have already notified the yarn and cloth industry associations to study it as soon as possible so that they can formulate a plan based on it and submit it to the government for approval. Because if the actual situation of the industry is not taken into account, and it is rashly formulated, once it is approved and announced, there will be many obstacles to implementation, and changes will be even more troublesome. Therefore, we sincerely hope that all interested parties will make suggestions as soon as possible and express their opinions as much as possible to avoid delays and self-inflicted mistakes, and there will be no regrets.

Q: I heard that the cloth allocated temporarily this time will follow the example of Nanjing City and only allow each household to purchase 1.5 feet. Is this true?

A: The idea of 1.5 feet per household has indeed been proposed, but the original plan submitted by our association to the government was 1.5 feet per person, and we have not received any other orders to change it.

Finally, the person in charge of the association said: "Recently, there have often been random remarks without asking the reason. I don't know that our association is a commercial collective that handles autonomous control. Since it is a collective organization of merchants, all issues related to the industry can be formally inquired by the industry associations of each industry to our association. The industry associations also often work hard for the happiness of the industry, take responsibility, and solve pain in the spirit of autonomous control. If you send a letter to the association to inquire, our association will answer in detail. If you do not follow this process and cause disturbances outside, it will still not help your own problems. This is what our association regrets very much."

### Jishan Cup Small Football: Supplementary Submission of Photos

The Jishan Cup Small Football Tournament was originally scheduled to open last week, but it could not be opened as scheduled due to the Shanghai Football Association's restrictions on Group A and B football players participating in other small ball games. According to the Cup, ten strong teams joining Group A, almost half of the players belong to the Shanghai Football Association. Therefore, the Jishan Cup authorities, in order to take care of the Kuailian Association's notice, urged the top ten teams of Jia New to change their list and submit supplementary photos within five days.

### Commentary: The Way Out for National Capital

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun published an editorial on the 7th titled "The Way Out for Chinese National Capital," pointing out the reasons for the speculative nature of Chinese national capital. It stated that Chinese national capital cannot develop from a primitive savings system but starts with high-interest loan capital like Piaohao (traditional Chinese banks) and Qianzhuang (money shops) and exchange capital. This prevents national capital from transforming into industrial capital, and bank capital cannot control the industrial sector, resulting in speculative capital that hinders all construction. Therefore, a suitable way out should be sought, which means eliminating all difficulties and cultivating healthy national industries. The main idea of the original article is as such, which can be said to be very pertinent.

Taking Shanghai, a place where a huge amount of national capital is concentrated, as an example, because capital has no outlet and cannot be transformed into industrial capital, it forms two of the most serious economic pathologies: one is the rampant speculation, and the other is the unlimited rise in prices. Regarding the former, for example, "Now all citizens of Shanghai, even salaried workers, teachers, shop assistants, maids, and laborers, are frantically engaged in bullish and bearish stock market activities." Regarding the latter, for example, "Towels that were sold for 22 yuan each two weeks ago now cost 65 yuan, and socks that were sold for 30 yuan a pair now cost more than 70 yuan." If this continues, Shanghai's economic condition is like that of a patient nearing death, because who in the world relies solely on gambling for a living? And who can withstand such a raging storm in their lives?

We said a year ago that the future of Shanghai's economy, whether for good or ill, is created by Shanghai's financiers and entrepreneurs themselves, and the responsibility for nurturing, protecting, developing, and growing it lies with the government. This statement seems ambiguous on the surface, but it is actually aimed at the problem of the way out for Chinese national capital. Because after the promulgation of the wartime economic policy guidelines, didn't we say that our financiers and entrepreneurs should work together to increase industrial production, to realize the planned production of the whole country, everyone should eliminate private interests, look far ahead, and earnestly recognize the important economic mission that they should bear at present?

### Price Limits for Most Goods Determined by Various Industries to Enforce Strictly; Prices Must Be Clearly Marked for Retail Sales

The various industry associations in this city previously formed an "Appraisal Committee for Goods" and formulated regulations, notifying all members to follow them. According to a reporter's investigation yesterday, the appraisal committees of the various industries, in view of the recent sharp rise in prices and the people's unrest, felt that it was their responsibility and could not bear to sit idly by. Therefore, they have been holding meetings in recent days to review whether the price limits of goods that have been evaluated in the past are in line with standardization. After discussion, it was decided that most price limits would remain unchanged, without any relaxation. All businesses in the same industry must mark the prices clearly at the prominent places when selling any goods in the stores, so that every customer can easily see and clearly distinguish them. However, for a few categories, due to cost reasons, they will be submitted to the authorities for changes.

### Banks and Money Shops Are Particularly Cautious in Lending

After the New Year holidays, all banks and money shops in this city have reopened for business. Due to the tight money supply and the fact that most of the indebted customers of the banks and money shops failed to settle their debts on time at the end of last year, the banks and money shops are particularly cautious in handling loan business since the beginning of this year. Some of the indebted customers who failed to settle their debts last year have been temporarily suspended from sending deposit books, and old accounts are being urged to be settled, resulting in no relaxation of the money supply after the New Year. It is reported that in order to regulate finance and support the development of legitimate industrial and commercial businesses, the banks and money shops, while urging the repayment of old debts, have resumed lending to customers who have already settled their accounts. However, in order to prevent industrial and commercial businesses from using funds for speculation and hoarding, they must carefully consider those who apply for loans, and refuse to lend to those who are not engaged in legitimate business or production, in order to comply with the government's laws and regulations to crack down on hoarding and suppress prices.

### Chinese Stocks Hovered Slightly Lower, Rebounding at the Evening Close

Chinese stocks hovered throughout yesterday, with the market falling. It rebounded slightly in the afternoon, but still closed lower than the previous day. People's hearts were soft and in a daze, because the investment target has shifted. The new department store company was particularly strong, while Wing On and other three companies fell by three to five yuan each; textile stocks, such as Meiya, silk, and Wing On Yarn Factory, were small, and some went against the trend and rose. Zhenfeng hit the 50 yuan mark, Rongfeng and Gong Sheng were outstanding, and Jingfu saw a new high price again; among cultural stocks, China Film and World Book Company both saw a low of one Luo (a unit of currency); among new pharmaceutical companies, Jiufu was slightly firm, while Sino-French and New Asia were weak; among chemical stocks, Baoan Glass rose, while Greater China, Tian Chai, and Nanyang Tobacco Company all fell close to the seven mark; utility stocks were flat, and real estate was particularly weak. Other industries, such as Jiu'an and other industrial companies, and New Asia Construction and other companies, all saw declines. Kangyuan Canning also rebounded slightly.

### Various Associations Planning to Establish Mediation Committees

Since the authorities launched a large-scale crackdown on hoarding and speculation, all merchants must abide by regular transactions. All transactions with speculative elements that were previously concluded between merchants had to be terminated, resulting in frequent disputes. In order to adapt to this situation, the various industry associations organized mediation committees to fairly mediate various disputes between colleagues based on the laws and regulations of the authorities, without charging any fees. In addition to the directors and supervisors of the association serving as ex-officio members of the committee, people who are familiar with commercial laws and regulations are also hired to serve as members. The evening closing table is now recorded below. New rules for the Flour and Wheat Special Committee Buy

### Flour and Wheat Special Committee New Rules Acquisition

The new purchasing work of the Flour and Wheat Special Committee has been preparing since the end of last year, and has recently raised several billion yuan. This purchasing work adopts a different style. Approximately ten units among the 53 commissioned merchants are responsible for purchasing matters. The purchasing areas are the Wuhu area in northern Jiangsu.

### Hopes for the Establishment of Public Libraries

— Nie Shi

Since the merger of the city's 18th and 2nd districts on February 1st, the general public has great hopes for the future of the municipality. Regarding popular cultural undertakings, it is still very difficult to have a complete public library in a city as big as Shanghai. Before the Incident, there were municipal public libraries in the city center and in the Wenmiao (Temple of Confucius) in the Nanshi (South City) area, and their contents were still somewhat satisfactory. After the Incident, although some libraries established by private individuals and organizations, such as the Customs, Hongying, and YMCA, continued to exist, they were either too specialized or restricted access, making them inaccessible to ordinary people. None of them can meet the purpose of being public and popular. Therefore, we have to place great expectations on the district public libraries currently located on Fuzhou Road.

After a period of observation, we feel that the district public libraries need to be improved in the following aspects:

The district public libraries inherited the tradition of the former Shanghai Municipal Council Library, and have a strong foreign influence. The collection is mainly in Western languages, and even the reading procedures and work style are quite foreign. It is quite suitable for Western readers, but it feels incompatible with Chinese people. Let's take one example: the library's reading regulations are printed in English, which inevitably reduces the reading interest of Chinese readers who do not understand English. We believe that since the concessions have been taken back and the first and second districts have been merged, the funding for the only district public library should not be a problem. In order to make it Chinese, the addition of a large number of Chinese books should not be delayed. In the future, the number of foreign books should be secondary. In terms of work, Chinese rules should be formulated for the convenience of Chinese readers, and borrowing procedures should be followed. When necessary, staff should be sent to guide readers, so as to achieve true popularity and localization.

In addition to the circulation section, the district public library also has a reading room, but this reading room is not satisfactory. As far as newspapers are concerned, there are only a few types, and most of them are English and Russian newspapers. As far as magazines and periodicals are concerned, there are only a few outdated publicity materials donated by the outside world. The reading room is very spacious, and the equipment of bookshelves and chairs is also sufficient, but the content is so mismatched, which is quite puzzling. We propose that the reading room should at least have various local newspapers and magazines, mainly in Chinese, whether specialized or general. Staff should also be assigned to manage the room to maintain order. As far as we can remember, before the Incident, the reading room upstairs in the Nanshi Municipal Wenmiao Library was crowded, with people rushing to read, but the order was orderly and methodical. Compared with the cold and desolate situation of today's empty room, it is as far as the sky.

The district public library is located in a corner on the fourth floor, which is difficult to attract attention, and readers feel like they are climbing to the sky. Although there is elevator equipment, it is restricted from use under the current conditions of saving electricity. In terms of area, the library's book collection limit is also not large. We earnestly hope that the municipal authorities can find another suitable location for the library, so that there will be room for development. However, the current library location is in the central area, which is quite appropriate, so it can be retained and enriched, and another public library can be established elsewhere. With a large city area like Shanghai, one library alone is not enough to satisfy the citizens' desire for knowledge. Establishing more public libraries in different districts is also an important part of municipal construction, and the authorities should pay close attention to it.

### Student Number Four (4) Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

While praying for the protection of the gods, he also sighed at the Navy Military Academy for being so cautious. There probably isn't a school that chooses so carefully anywhere else, is there? It's just like a careful family's shop. I couldn't help but think of my late father and mother, who, before installing the rice milling machine, used to save rice every day, turning from the rough sieve to the fine sieve. But the ones that remained in the last sieve were the strong young men from Etajima that the Imperial Navy needed. Thinking of this, Zhenren's two red cheeks became even more flushed.

Before he knew it, he saw someone. A street lined with photo studios and laundries, but no restaurants. Zhenren's feet sped up. He slipped into the low school gate and reported to the doorman. The non-commissioned officer who was waiting for the students assigned him to the pre-admission dormitory. When he got to the dormitory, he saw that it was an ordinary large farmhouse.

(V)

Although it was very different, the house was very spacious, the room was very tidy, and the toilet was very clean. Every year they have to be assigned to be dormitories, so the facilities are very complete. After Zhenren arrived first, his comrades also arrived one after another. Every time the regular steamer arrived, a batch of young men would be added to the dormitory. Among them were those who were sent by their mothers and brothers. The people who came with them seemed to live in another dormitory. The most gratifying thing was that in the last time, Xiongze from the military class also came.

Speaking of which, they were all young comrades, so they started to exchange greetings when they met. What surprised Zhenren the most was that he couldn't understand what people were saying. He had already decided that he must use standard language in the future. But even more difficult to understand than his words were the people from the Northeast. They also seemed to think that Zhenren's words were the most difficult to understand.

In any case, the words of those from Tokyo were all understandable. Moreover, the number of Tokyo people was so large that it surprised Zhenren. He had always thought that the weak young men in Tokyo were useless, but now he saw——

(The place where talents from all over the country gather, you can't slack off...) He remembered what his mother had said when he left.

The young men couldn't just sit idle in the dormitory. The guidance officer—the instructor came and went frequently, asking questions, so you couldn't be careless.

"Ichitani Jinren..." That instructor called his name. He had never met him before, how did he know his name? Zhenren was very surprised.

"Yes, Instructor!"

"In the Navy, you don't call your superiors 'Sir'!"

Zhenren bumped into a nail for the first time, and his face turned red.

"Tell me about your motivation for aspiring to the Navy!"

He poured out all the truth about this question.

"Okay. Next time it's Nakamura Saburo..." The instructor really knew the names of the prospective entrants very clearly. This was only known later, because the instructor compared the photos submitted and the opinion letters submitted by the school of origin, and before seeing the person, his impression of him was already clear.

On the 28th, there was another physical examination. This time it was in the school's infirmary. If he was examined with X-rays here, everything would be over, but Zhenren passed safely. Nakamura Saburo from Tokyo was examined for three days and finally failed. He received the round-trip fare from the school office and left the school dejectedly. It was really unbearable to look at. Even the military doctor who declared him unqualified couldn't help but turn his eyes to the side and his voice trembled. But the most fortunate thing was that only Nakamura failed this year.

### Don't Buy Fake Tickets

Last night, I invited a friend to see a play at the Grand Theater. Because it was the New Year, the seats were very popular, and we arrived late, so there were no good seats. Just as I was thinking, someone next to me suddenly offered to sell me tickets. He said: Because it was raining and his friend couldn't come, he planned to sell the tickets he had already bought. I took the tickets and looked at them. They were three seats in the middle of the first row, and I felt that the seats were good, so I paid the price and bought another ticket. Later, I accidentally looked at the front and back of the tickets, and suddenly saw something strange on the back. When I looked closer, I realized that the three tickets were for the daytime performance. Because the daytime and nighttime tickets of the theater were the same shape and color, except that the word "day" was marked on the back of the daytime tickets. I advise friends who buy black market tickets to be careful and not to buy fake tickets! (Shen Juncheng)
