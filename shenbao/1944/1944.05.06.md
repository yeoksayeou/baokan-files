### Mourning Marshal Koga

Yesterday, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced that Marshal Koga, Commander of the Combined Fleet, had died in action while directing frontline operations from his aircraft in March. The sad news has arrived, and we are deeply saddened.

Marshal Koga was a famous Japanese naval general. He succeeded Marshal Yamamoto as Commander of the Combined Fleet last May, not only inheriting the position but also inheriting the loyal and courageous will. He followed in Marshal Yamamoto's footsteps, dying a heroic death for his country. While this is unfortunate for his personal life, it fully demonstrates the spirit of "regarding death as returning home" in the loyal and courageous spirit of the Japanese Navy. Soldiers originally consider sacrificing themselves on the battlefield as a glory. Therefore, Marshal Koga has indeed "accomplished his mission and sacrificed his life, without shame whether looking up or down."

We recognize that decades of training have cultivated a traditional spirit of unity, loyalty, and courage for the country in the Japanese Navy. Marshal Koga's death in action will further arouse the spirit of shared hatred and determination to fight among all Japanese naval officers and soldiers, encouraging them to bravely annihilate the enemy in the Greater East Asia War.

After reading the statements from the Chief of the Press Section of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters and Colonel Matsushima, Chief of the Press Section of the China Fleet, we further understand that Marshal Koga's achievements and loyal and courageous spirit during his lifetime are a real and indelible light. In addition to expressing our deepest condolences, we hope that Marshal Koga's spirit will endure forever and serve as a model for soldiers in all countries of Greater East Asia.

### Rescuing the Coal Shortage

The current decline in industrial production in Shanghai is a phenomenon that we have repeatedly pointed out as being the most contradictory in the midst of calls for increased production. Examining the reasons for the decline in industrial production, the main factors are energy and raw materials. We will now elaborate on the issue of energy.

The source of energy is coal. Because Shanghai's coal reserves are not abundant and transportation is difficult, the electricity company authorities have repeatedly hoped that users would conserve electricity and limit the amount used. This is a passive measure. The active and immediate solution is to clear the source of coal and continuously transport it, so that electricity supply is not lacking anywhere.

Indeed, in this time of war, it is a matter of course to practice thrift, limit electricity consumption, and save coal for wartime needs. However, for electricity used in production that benefits the war effort and the people's livelihood, it is acceptable to make it as economical as possible and avoid waste. But it is absolutely unacceptable to reduce production capacity or make it impossible to produce. Therefore, when the electricity company reduces power supply due to coal shortages, its allocation should be considered fair and reasonable. What is meant by reasonable is to distinguish between consumptive and productive uses, to distinguish between the importance of benefits for the war effort and the people's livelihood, and to stipulate which should be reduced? Which should not be reduced? To what extent should each be reduced? If universal restrictions are imposed without following reasonable standards, the effectiveness of production enterprises will decline, and the interests of the war effort and the people's livelihood will be affected.

On the one hand, we hope that the electricity authorities will pay attention to the rationality of allocation. At the same time, we hope that they will actively consider clearing the transportation of coal. Moreover, coal shortages not only affect electricity supply, but also affect the fuel for people's livelihood. Therefore, clearing the transportation of coal is an urgent task to adjust wartime production and ensure fuel for the people's livelihood. However, we also know that there are two fundamental problems in clearing the transportation of coal: one is the problem of coal production, and the other is the problem of transportation capacity. These two problems are actually different from peacetime. Therefore, we propose:

Electricity for factories must first be carefully classified. For example, factories producing wartime military supplies or daily necessities should be fully supplied with electricity; factories producing non-essential or consumer goods should have their supply reduced to the minimum or stopped altogether. The determination of the above categories should be made by the competent authorities as soon as possible. Secondly, electricity for hospitals and cultural and public welfare organizations should be relaxed in consideration of actual needs. Electricity for civilians should be drastically reduced again, especially for those who play mahjong under electric lights at night, should be warned or have their supply stopped.

The importance of coal for people's livelihood is no less than that of food. Currently, coal balls are manufactured every month as a household ration, but in reality, it is far from sufficient. We hope that the authorities will allocate more coal, and at the same time strictly supervise the manufacturing quantity and prevent corruption, and completely eliminate black market prices.

As for the source of coal, some people advocate developing coal mines in Central China and reorganizing old mines. This is certainly a fundamental solution, but it takes a long time and cannot solve the immediate problem. We believe that the transportation of coal from Qingdao and Haizhou to the south is more convenient. There are two transportation routes: water and land. For waterways, a large number of wooden sailboats should be hired to transport coal south via the sea or the canal. For land transportation, trains should be scheduled to stop carrying passengers for one or two days a week, or reduce passenger capacity, and use the surplus vehicles to transport coal.

The lack of coal is an extremely serious problem in both industrial production and people's livelihood. We hope that insightful people in the industrial and commercial sectors will jointly discuss and organize a transportation organization, hire wooden boats, and assist the authorities in loading and transporting coal. At the same time, we hope that all relevant authorities will pay attention to this, contact each other, promptly discuss the entire concrete plan, and work together to rescue Shanghai's coal shortage, that is, to realize increased production and strengthen combat power.

### Statement by Director Kurihara

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – Colonel Kurihara Etsuzo, Director of the Naval Press Section of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, issued the following statement regarding the death of General Koga Mineichi, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet: The news of General Koga, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, who died in action while commanding frontline operations from his aircraft in March of this year, was announced by the Imperial Headquarters on the afternoon of the 5th. His Majesty the Emperor, in recognition of General Koga's distinguished achievements during his lifetime, has posthumously bestowed upon him the title of Marshal, admitted him to the Marshal's Office, awarded him the First Class Order of Merit, and conferred upon him the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun with Paulownia Flowers. Since Marshal Koga assumed the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet last April, he has not shied away from danger, personally venturing to the front lines to command the officers and soldiers of the Combined Fleet in battle, hence his death in action. During the Marshal's tenure, the war situation became increasingly fierce. Recently, recognizing the great responsibility of being the supreme commander, the Marshal worked day and night, exhausting all his efforts to promote the traditional spirit of the Japanese Imperial Navy and lead the entire army in battle. The current war situation is at a critical juncture for the nation's survival, and this unexpected event is deeply regrettable. The entire navy, with the new commander-in-chief General Toyoda as its core, will further raise its fighting spirit under the Emperor's authority, advance on the path of annihilating the enemy, inherit the spirit of Marshals Yamamoto and Koga, and continue to fight to repay the nation.

### One American Plane　Shot Down in Longxia

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from a certain Japanese army base in South China states that at 5:00 PM on the 1st, an American B-25 aircraft intruded into the skies over Xiamen, indiscriminately strafing with machine guns. The local Japanese anti-aircraft artillery immediately fired upon it and shot it down. The aircraft crashed into the mountains near Guanwei on Jinmen Island.

### Two Squadrons of Chongqing Troops　Sneak into Vietnam but Fail

The Vietnamese army in the area immediately repelled them, capturing about 30 Chongqing soldiers (including officers, the elderly, and the weak), and seizing four machine guns and forty-six rifles.

### Director Matsushima Praises　Marshal Koga's Achievements

Central News Agency, Shanghai – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters yesterday announced the news of the death in action of General Koga, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet. This is another significant sacrifice made by Japan to protect Greater East Asia, and it deeply shocks the hundred million people of East Asia. Colonel Matsushima, Chief of the Press Section of the Japanese Fleet in China, issued a statement on the 5th, praising Commander Koga's contributions and revealing the Japanese Navy's determination to bravely annihilate the enemy. The main points are as follows:

On May 5th, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced the news of the death in action of General Koga Mineichi, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet. Commander Koga, holding the great responsibility of the supreme commander of the Combined Fleet, died in action on the front lines from his aircraft, which is deeply regrettable. During Commander Koga's time in office over the past year, whenever Japan engaged in battle, Admiral Togo repeatedly declined requests from his staff to go to the command tower, stating each time: "I am old. For the sake of Japan's future, you should go to the command tower and do your best." He always stood on the bridge in the hail of bullets, never moving slightly. Now, both Marshal Yamamoto's death in battle and Commander Koga's death in action are a testament to the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy, which cannot be compared with the publicity surrounding General MacArthur's command from within a cruiser during the landing in New Guinea. The ancient East Asian strategist Sun Tzu once said, "Place them in a position of no escape, and they will then fight to the death." The Japanese admirals are truly practitioners of Sun Tzu's Art of War. Commander Koga pioneered a tactic previously unseen in military history, which the Allied side greatly feared and called the "Interception Tactic." Commander Koga's Interception Tactic has annihilated many Allied soldiers in the Pacific, or caused Allied soldiers to shed a great deal of blood in the jungles of various islands. This should be well known to Allied soldiers. Last May, the Yamazaki Unit on Attu Island annihilated 15,000 Allied soldiers. Also, on Makin and Tarawa Islands in the Gilbert Islands, about 30,000 American troops bled. In addition, the sacrifices of American troops on Guadalcanal, the Solomon Islands, Bougainville Island, New Britain Island, New Ireland Island, and in New Guinea have been historically significant. At sea, there have been battles such as the Battle of Runga Point, the Naval Battle of Kula Gulf, the Naval Battle of Kolombangara, and the five Bougainville air battles, the four Gilbert Islands air battles, and the Marshall Islands air battle. They have sunk four battleships, twenty aircraft carriers, twenty-six cruisers, twenty-nine destroyers, one special service ship, thirty submarines, fifteen torpedo boats, six unidentified types of boats, one battleship or cruiser, seven cruisers or large destroyers, two hundred boats, and one hundred and ninety transports. They have also destroyed four battleships, seven aircraft carriers, thirty cruisers, nineteen destroyers, seven torpedo boats, two unidentified types of ships, two battleships or cruisers, eight cruisers, eighty-two boats, and three submarine chasers. About 3,000 or more aircraft have been shot down, and about 200,000 enemy naval and air personnel have been killed in action. This proves the brilliant results of Commander Koga's Interception Tactic. The position of Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet has now been succeeded by Admiral Toyoda. The morale of the entire fleet is increasingly strong, and they are now waiting for an opportunity to destroy the American military forces deployed in the Pacific.

### Manchukuo Refreshes Police Administration

Xinjing, 5th (Central News Agency) – In order to revitalize its police administration, the Manchukuo government has formulated an outline for the refreshing and streamlining of police administration. The key points are as follows: Simplification of the organization; establishment of a hierarchical system with clearly defined duties and responsibilities. The focus of police personnel will be placed in key areas. Of particular note is the emphasis on improving the quality of police officers. The concrete measures to be taken will center on police officers as the main force in law enforcement, with a view to reorganizing the police system. Since the establishment of Manchukuo, the police system has focused on military force, but this revitalization aims to transform the military police into an intelligent police force. Therefore, its future activities are highly anticipated.

### Turkey Must Prepare　to Deal with the Crisis　Foreign Minister Issues Statement

Ankara, 5th (Central News Agency) – According to the German News Agency: Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu recently told reporters that we are currently living in dangerous times, and before the crisis is eliminated, it is imperative that our daily lives adapt to the environment and prepare constantly.

### Soviet Union Issues　Huge Public Bonds

Stockholm, Sweden, 5th (Central News Agency) – According to the German News Agency: According to a report from TASS, the Soviet government has decided to issue its third wartime public bonds, amounting to 25 billion rubles, and has issued a declaration calling on the public to cooperate.

### British Ambassador to Spain Returns Home

Madrid, 5th (Central News Agency) – According to Havas: British Ambassador Sir Samuel Hoare and his wife left by plane yesterday, via Lisbon, to return home for consultations.

### Fierce Battle for Imphal　British Troops on the Southern Front Gradually Retreating

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from the Indian front states that the battle between the Japanese and British forces for Imphal has become increasingly fierce recently. With the cooperation of the air force, the Japanese army is gradually advancing. The fall of Kohima is imminent, and the battle for Manipur is also nearing its final stage. The enemy forces between Imphal and Kohima are struggling to reverse the decline, and are reinforcing with large numbers of tanks, artillery, and air force, hoping to engage in a desperate defense. However, in any case, the enemy's base of Imphal has been controlled by the Japanese and Indian armies, so even if they want to reorganize, it will only be a last-ditch effort.

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) – Washington report: US Secretary of War Stimson told reporters on the 4th that the situation on the Burma front was as follows: The Japanese offensive has become more intense in the last two weeks, and fierce battles in various places have formed a major war front from the Indian Ocean to the Chinese border. According to a Reuters report from Candi, Ceylon, on the 4th, the fighting on the Burma-India front can be divided into three areas: the Kohima-Palel area, the Maungdaw-Buthidaung road area, and the battle of the airborne troops in northern Burma. The anti-Axis forces have suffered attacks from the Japanese army in various places. A communiqué from the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Command on the 4th also acknowledged the failure of the overall operation in Burma: The withdrawal from Akyab in southern Burma back to Bengal has failed, and they are now gradually retreating.

### Replacement of Chongqing Customs Commissioner

Central News Agency - According to reliable sources, Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance in Chongqing, recently issued an order to transfer the position of Inspector General of Customs, with an American named Liddell succeeding the Englishman Jones as Inspector General of Customs. It has been the practice for the position of Commissioner of Customs in Chongqing to be held by a British national, but this sudden change to an American shows that American influence in Chongqing is gradually expanding and overwhelming that of Britain. Furthermore, Britain and the United States announced last year that they would abolish unequal treaties, and mentioned changing the Inspector General of Customs, but the position is still being filled by an American, which shows that the so-called abolition of unequal treaties by Britain and the United States is nothing but deception.

### Goebbels Discusses Key to Success or Failure of Invasion of Europe; "An Army Moved by Righteousness Will Surely Win"

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels recently published an article in the magazine "Deutschland," entitled "Indeterminate Factors," discussing the key to success or failure in the invasion of Europe. The main idea is that the British and Americans will face countless difficulties in invading the European continent, and if they cannot accurately grasp the various factors that will determine the future development of the war, they will never be certain of the final success or failure of the war. In other words, if a decisive victory cannot be achieved in the air war, then the strength of the enemy is known, and the enemy also knows the strength of our side. Comparing the possibilities of victory for both sides, our hope for final victory is a well-founded conclusion. We have a clever plan in hand, and we will not show it to the enemy until the decisive moment. Moreover, an army moved by righteousness will surely win. The British and American soldiers are traveling across the ocean to invade other people's territories, merely to satisfy the greed of a few financial groups, while we are fighting for the survival of our motherland and the security of the continent. Therefore, as we look to the future, we have a heartfelt belief in final victory.

### Tension in London

Stockholm, Sweden, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch, Huitong News Agency): London's Daily Express reports that Americans in London are very excited about the invasion of Europe. The editorial departments of London's newspapers are constantly paying attention to news about the invasion of Europe. Churches across the country are waiting for the radio to send out the signal for the invasion of Europe, and will then ring bells to summon people to prayer. Colonel Johnson, head of the military transport bureau, has called on all private travel to be completely suspended when the invasion of Europe begins, as a large number of wounded soldiers must be transported back inland, and troops and supplies must be transported to the ports. Every carriage is urgently needed, and no consideration will be given to people traveling for pleasure.

### Aerial Offensive

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch, Huitong News Agency), Washington dispatch: Secretary of War Stimson said yesterday at the intelligence desk that the British and American air forces are bombing the German transportation network as a concentrated bombing raid on the eve of the invasion of Europe, with the aim of disrupting German transportation.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since March, the British and American air forces have intensified their bombing of Germany, which can be regarded as the prelude to the opening of the second front. For days, the anti-Axis forces have been using three to four thousand aircraft to bomb German military facilities, urban factories, transportation facilities, and other Axis countries. The bombs they drop are like torrential rain, averaging more than 500 bombs per hour, or 12,000 tons per day. The German military's measures and the extent of the damage are as follows: The methods used by enemy aircraft to bomb Berlin can be roughly divided into daytime and nighttime bombings. The purposes of the bombing can be roughly divided into pure military bombing, surprise bombing, production facility bombing, and transportation route bombing. Regarding nighttime bombing, each time the British and Americans participate with about 500 to 800 medium-sized aircraft, but each time they often fail to achieve their purpose due to the German air force's interception, so they inevitably fall into blind bombing, resulting in four or five tenths of the residential areas in the suburbs of Berlin being reduced to rubble. As for daytime bombing, the number is less than nighttime bombing. Most of the aircraft are American large bombers, about 300 to 800 aircraft each time, with the aim of destroying factory transportation facilities, but because the loss of aircraft is too great, it is difficult to achieve the intended purpose.

### US Army Casualties Now Exceed 150,000

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch, Huitong News Agency), Washington dispatch: Secretary of War Stimson announced yesterday that the US Army has lost a total of 159,302 people on all battlefields as of April 30.

### Chan Nant Transferred to Ambassador to Soviet Union

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch, Huitong News Agency), Washington dispatch: Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday that Chan Nant, the current US Ambassador to Britain, has been transferred to be the Ambassador to the Soviet Union. The post of Ambassador to Britain will be succeeded by the Governor of New Jersey, Du.

### Eastern Front Air Force Active; Germany and Soviet Union Prepare for Great War; Fierce Fighting in Middle Reaches of Seret River

Stockholm, Sweden, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Soviet forces are still continuing their offensive in the Tagu-Frumos to Botusani area in the middle reaches of the Seret River in eastern Romania, which is acknowledged by the German side. According to German reconnaissance aircraft reports, Soviet forces are working hard to reorganize their infantry and improve their rear base work in preparation for a major offensive, so they are only using the air force as their main activity. The main objective of the German and Soviet air forces is to destroy the enemy's base and position work. According to the Soviet authorities, the Soviet Air Force attacked the vicinity of the old Polish cities of Lviv and Stanislavov, as well as German airfields and railways near Iasi in eastern Romania, on the 3rd. On the evenings of the 3rd and 4th, they bombed Sevastopol. Also, about 150 German aircraft bombed the Soviet base at Tiraspol, Lower Yishu River, on the 3rd. Another team attacked the Soviet airfield at Ternopol and a Soviet base on the Crimean Peninsula.

### Developing Aluminum Industry in North China to Enrich Resources for Aviation Industry; Speech by Vice Minister Yamamoto of Greater East Asia Ministry After Inspection

A delegation led by Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Greater East Asia Ministry, composed of dozens of people related to the Army, Navy, Ministry of Munitions, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Transportation, departed from Tokyo on the 6th of last month. After arriving in Qingdao on the 7th, they divided into four groups: General Affairs, Iron Manufacturing, Coal, and Light Metals, to conduct on-site inspections for ten days. They departed on the 23rd and returned to Japan. The bottleneck in the increased production and transportation of strategic materials such as iron, coal, and light metals in the Japanese mainland has been opened up by this inspection. This move has greatly helped to strengthen Japan's war power.

After the inspection, Vice Minister Yamamoto, who returned to Beijing, said at the Beijing Hotel on the 21st:

I have personally visited Qingdao, Tangshan, Tianjin, Jinan, Zhangdian, Zhangjiakou, Datong, Taiyuan, and other places. The development of strategic resources in various places is mostly carried out independently by the Chinese side, but Japan has high expectations for North China, so this inspection is very meaningful.

In North China, the initial eagerness to build resulted in a bottleneck because production could not keep up. After a thorough review, it is expected that the results of enhancing production, contributing to Japan, and stabilizing the local people's livelihood will be achieved due to the abundant harvest of crops in this inspection.

In China, it is impossible to succeed by proceeding as rapidly as in Japan. This point has been newly recognized not only by the Ministry of Greater East Asia but also by those related to various ministries through this inspection. However, there seems to be a lack of training and research on the Chinese people in various places, and I hope that they will adapt to the situation in Japan and work harder.

### Utilizing Local Resources

In terms of technology, we must make full use of the materials that can be obtained locally, rather than relying entirely on supplies from Japan. Those directly in charge locally must change their thinking at this time and become practitioners of the new policy toward China. In terms of labor relations, we must also enlist the cooperation of the Chinese people in development and provide good guidance.

The development of North China did not reach the planned amount in the 18th year. However, better results than last year can be expected in the 19th year. Especially in the light metals sector, there is a kind of soil that can be called the best in the world. Starting this year, it will be refined into aluminum and become one of the basic materials for the Japanese aviation industry.

We will continue to inspect in the future, hoping to find something that can be used to enhance our war power.

Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Greater East Asia Ministry flew from Qingdao to Fukuoka Airfield in the afternoon of the 23rd. After a short rest, he took a plane back to Tokyo. He said at Yanchao Airfield:

Our trip was to open up the bottleneck in various production sectors to enhance our war power. The food situation in North China this year has greatly increased compared to last year due to favorable rainfall. The development of underground resources such as iron and coal is now on track.

### "Specially Established Protection Corps" Should Strengthen Organization; Air Defense Headquarters Hopes All Sectors Complete Preparations

According to the Shanghai Special Municipal Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters: It has been found that the "Specially Established Protection Corps" in various parts of the city has been roughly established with the cooperation of the citizens, but all preparations for dealing with emergencies are still not perfect. Once enemy planes attack, various agencies, companies, buildings, factories, and tall buildings are likely to become targets for bombing. Therefore, ordinary protection corps and specially established protection corps must maintain close contact and work together to ensure that the citizens' air defense organization is complete. However, in the current situation, the organization of specially established protection corps is truly lagging behind. At a time when the war situation is becoming increasingly fierce, the air defense authorities deeply hope that all agencies, companies, factories, etc. will quickly devote their full efforts to strengthen the organization of "specially established protection corps" and make them healthier. As for the owners and managers of large buildings, they should also share the difficulties of the times and organize strong "specially established protection corps."

### High-Rise Buildings to Have Simulated Bombs Dropped

It is reported that on the Air Defense Day of this month, the 9th, the local Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Authorities and the Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters have stipulated that, in addition to ordinary training, simulated bombs and incendiary bombs will be dropped on high-rise buildings. It is hoped that citizens will quickly complete preparations to ensure safety.

According to the Times reporter who obtained information from news sources, the Shanghai Port Water Air Defense Organization, which covers 21 miles along the Huangpu River, has a total of more than two thousand units in its various corps and is scheduled to hold a large-scale air defense drill next week (May 9). It is reported that the key personnel of the Water Air Defense Headquarters are selected by the Japanese Navy and the Chinese Customs. At that time, they will supervise drills such as throwing grenades and extinguishing fires.

### Captain Shiota Analyzes Recent War Situation, British and American Strategy Often Fails

Captain Shiota of the Japanese Fleet Press Department gave a talk at the United Press Association yesterday, analyzing the British and American attempts to use the Chinese mainland to attack Japan, and made the following remarks:

The British and Americans, in view of the defeat in the Pacific War and the difficulty of engaging in close combat with Japan, have recently attempted to attack Japan by way of the Philippines to the Chinese mainland, intending to use the Chinese mainland as a base and use aircraft to attack Japan for a final battle with Japan. However, we have long been aware of this war trend and will certainly not let it succeed. Furthermore, MacArthur and Nimitz have recently separated from the US Asian Fleet and are operating independently, intending to advance towards the Philippines from the Marshall Islands and New Guinea. However, because MacArthur and Nimitz are dragging out the battle line, they have not been able to proceed smoothly, and strategically, they are not taking a steady and solid approach, often continuing to attack before they have a firm foothold. Therefore, they often fail and suffer heavy losses, fully revealing the American national character.

In Australia, they are also suffering heavy losses and are crying out in pain. Prime Minister Curtin, due to insufficient human resources, has requested supplies from the British and Americans. At the same time, New Zealand's Prime Minister Fraser also feels a shortage of manpower and has appealed for aid from the British and Americans. However, the British and Americans themselves also feel a shortage of human resources, so they are attempting to use China's vast human resources to attack Japan in order to reduce their own sacrifices. However, the Chinese people under the Chongqing regime are now gradually understanding the intentions of the British and Americans and are demanding respect for sovereignty. Moreover, the British and American troops are not only arbitrarily harassing the people in Chongqing, Guilin, Kunming, and other places, causing them unbearable suffering, but the same situation is occurring with the American troops stationed in the UK, who are being insulted as if they were a defeated nation. Therefore, Britain is particularly expanding its propaganda about the importance of the East Asian war situation in order to get the United States to shift its focus and advance into East Asia. Secondly, regarding the issue of loans, Britain lent 50 million pounds to the Chongqing side at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, but it was of no avail. Now, lending to the Chongqing side again is nothing more than a formality and will not help.

### Household Oil Rations in the City to Be Generally Sold Starting Today

Since the City Food Bureau implemented the system of oil rations based on population in various districts within the lock line, in order to prevent retailers from adulterating the oil, it has ordered various shops to store oil samples in sealed bottles and display them in store counters. If citizens find that the oil they purchase does not match the sealed oil sample, they can report it to the bureau, so that they can be punished and the situation can be rectified. As for the second phase of oil distribution in each district, except for the first district, it has now been decided to start general sales from today (6th) to the 15th. Citizens in each district can purchase oil from designated edible oil retailers with the second-phase oil purchase certificates issued by the Food Bureau. Each certificate can purchase four ounces of oil, costing 13.8 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Retail donations are exempt from inspection. There will be no supplementary sales after the deadline.

### Special Oil Allocation Suspended

Since the Shanghai Edible Oil Unified Allocation Office was authorized by the authorities to handle edible oil allocation, in addition to allocating household edible oil to citizens in phases, it also handles special food allocations for various industries. Recently, the office has suspended supply for special allocations from today because the amount of household allocations cannot be fully met.

### Central Naval Academy to Hold Graduation Ceremony Today

The grand occasion is expected to be unprecedented.

### This City's Youth League Held Second General Review Yesterday, with More Than Six Thousand Members Participating

Yesterday was the 5/5 Youth Day holiday. This city's Youth League held its second general review ceremony. It was held at 3:00 pm at the central square of the racecourse. Commander Chen Jian was unable to attend due to official business and specially appointed Deputy Supervisor Liu Yangshan to attend, preside over the review, and deliver a speech. The second Youth League general review ceremony was simple, solemn, and detailed as follows:

Review Situation

In addition to Deputy Supervisor Liu, who represented Commander Chen, those who attended the review included Deputy Commanders Lin Jiongan and Xi Peiwen, members of the New Movement Branch, Wu Songbei, head of the First District Public Office, Bureau Chief Su Chengde, Bureau Chief Ye Xuesong, Chief Ding Chao, Chief Cheng Deyuan representing Chen Zhenwu, Chief Wang Zuoxiang, and Wang Yiyi and Ling Dating from the First District. Representatives of allied authorities were also invited to watch the review. A total of 6,550 members from 100 school corps and seven district corps, the most outstanding youth corps in the city, participated in the review. Led by the commander Zhu Zhu, they marched in an orderly manner past the review stand with agile movements and uniform steps. Afterwards, everyone stood solemnly and wished the leader good health from afar. Then, Reviewing Officer Liu delivered a speech with many words of encouragement. Finally, everyone shouted national slogans, and the ceremony ended at 4:30 pm. The various teams then returned to their respective units one after another.

### Information Director Matsudaira Discusses British Loan to Chongqing; Chongqing Regime Drinks Poison to Quench Thirst

The Allied Press Association in Shanghai held a meeting with reporters from various newspapers in the city at the Huizhong Hotel on the fifth floor yesterday (5th) at 3:00 pm. First, Information Director Matsudaira of the Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office gave a speech on the British loan to Chongqing, adding the following: Regarding the loan issue between Chongqing and Britain, the British government had already advertised it two years ago. However, due to the harsh conditions of the British side, negotiations could not proceed smoothly, resulting in repeated delays. It was not until this (May) 2nd that the British government announced a loan of 50 million pounds to the Chongqing side. It is rumored that the conditions for the establishment of this loan between Britain and Chongqing involve a huge loss of sovereignty for the Chongqing side. In addition to ceding resource development rights to Britain, it also allows Britain to build railways in its territory. Since the incident, the Chongqing regime has borrowed money from foreign countries many times, including 100 million pounds in British gold, 100 million US dollars, 120 billion old yuan, and 31.5 million francs. In addition to the 50 million pounds loaned by the British government this time, the total amount, according to the local black market exchange rate, is about 5 trillion old yuan or more. The Chongqing side has a high debt burden, and the people are bearing a heavier and heavier burden. From this, it can be seen that the Chongqing regime is relying on borrowing money to use the people of East Asia to kill each other, which is truly drinking poison to quench thirst.

### City Government Orders Ban on Obscene Dramas

The First Police Bureau of this city recently received instructions from the city government to ban the performance of dramas such as "The Spider Cave", "Spinning Cotton", "Butterfly Dream", and "Drama Relay", which are harmful to public morals and contain obscene content. The bureau's review section has issued written notices to all ten theaters in the city to comply with the order and has warned the actors in each theater not to have obscene performances when performing other dramas.

### Temporary Cotton Cloth Allocation to Levy Special Consumption Tax

The Cloth Association of this city had previously written to the Unified Association to ask whether cotton cloth, as a special consumption tax, could be exempted in accordance with the daily necessities tax exemption regulations. The Unified Association has sent letters to the municipal government and the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance for reply. According to reporters, the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance has replied to the association, stating that although cotton cloth is a daily necessity, its nature is different from that of grain and firewood, and it should still be taxed according to regulations. The Unified Association has forwarded a letter to the Cloth Association, notifying all members to check and add the words "Retail donation to be calculated separately" under the previously issued price list so that it can be collected during allocation.

### Readers' Support for Education News

Huafeng Bank will open tomorrow. The bank, in the spirit of thrift, has declared that if various sectors send congratulatory gifts, they should be converted into cash and entrusted to this newspaper and the Xinwen Daily to collect on their behalf and use the funds for educational assistance. Since this news was released, funds have been brought to the office one after another. This trend is extremely meaningful and we hope that all sectors will respond in unison.

Longevity Celebration for Educational Assistance: Mr. Zhang Dongming of Yitaixiang Ivory Shop writes: "To whom it may concern, May 2nd is my 66th birthday. I have lived a mediocre life and am ashamed of having no accomplishments. I have been graciously showered with gifts totaling 15,000 yuan by relatives and friends, which I cannot decline politely but am uneasy about accepting. Therefore, I have made up the total to 20,000 yuan and will donate it to your newspaper's educational assistance fund. The amount is small, but it is a small blessing for my relatives and friends."

Pension for Educational Assistance: Ms. Hu Wang Jingyi writes: "To whom it may concern, my late husband, Mr. Zhan, worked at the General Manager's Office of the Continental Bank during his lifetime. He was frugal in his personal life, treated people with kindness and sincerity, and was happy to cultivate poor students. Unfortunately, he passed away from illness last year.

### My Opinion on Improving the Treatment of Staff in a District Office

— Siming

The recent method for improving staff treatment determined by the First District Office roughly divides staff into two categories: 1. Married individuals. 2. Unmarried individuals. The salaries, allowances, and material rations of the former are superior to those of the latter. Indeed, there is a legitimate reason for this; married individuals have the burden of a family, while unmarried individuals are only single and their daily expenses are necessarily less than those of the former. However, in our country, families have the custom of "raising children to prevent old age," and the expenses of the entire family are entirely dependent on the producer. It is not a matter of each person governing themselves and earning and spending for themselves. If someone has elderly parents at home who cannot produce, and younger siblings who can only consume, then even if they are unmarried, is their burden lighter than that of married individuals?

Based on the above information, therefore, I believe that the principle should be to consider the weight of their economic burden. To understand the weight of their economic burden, it is necessary to first investigate clearly the economic situation of each family; how many producers? What is the total monthly income? How many consumers? What is the minimum amount of monthly consumption, and how much can be discussed? If such expenses can also prevent waste, would it not be fair?

Mencius said: "Respect the elderly in my family and extend that respect to the elderly in other families; love the young in my family and extend that love to the young in other families." Today, if a person's monthly income is difficult to maintain their personal life, then what remaining strength do they have to respect the elderly and love the young? Therefore, they can only show their elders and children that they are helpless and lack the power to do so. This inability to respect the elderly and love the young, is it their fault? As the saying goes, "Everyone loves their wives and children." I don't believe it.

### Why Are University Students Excluded From Rationed Running Shoes?

— Liu Song

It was recently reported that primary and secondary school students in this city are being rationed running shoes, and rationing certificates have already been issued, so they will be able to collect shoes soon. This act of concern for students is of course to be thanked to the authorities in charge, but the fact that university students are excluded is puzzling. It should be known that "university students" and "primary and secondary school students" are both non-producing consumers who equally need parental support and are cultivated by the state. Why doesn't the rationing authority consider the parents of university students and find a way for university students? Moreover, the burdens of university students' parents are only heavier than those of "primary and secondary school students' parents." When the price of everything is soaring, I don't know how many university students' parents are anxious about their children's clothing. Moreover, shoes are worn by everyone, just like rice and oil are used by every household. There should be equal treatment, and all students should be rationed. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities in charge will expand the scope of rationing and include university students in the scope of rationing. Or, it is hoped that after the rationing procedures for primary and secondary school students are cleared, another round of running shoe rationing will be organized for university students in this city, so that many university students and their parents in this city will be equally grateful.

(Go to Tokyo and become a painter!)

The decision on this plan was made when the mountain wind was already approaching Sulfur Valley in the rustling autumn.

Long before, Longfu had excellent talent. Not only were his paintings superior, but he also liked painting equipment very much. However, the thought of making painting a lifelong career had never occurred to him. He had never felt that painting possessed great admiration.

However, now, he could not help but force himself to like it. He could not help but fulfill his painter's aspirations.

This was because he thought that painting was the profession that was most unrelated to the "navy." This was because he thought it was a suitable job that was the most opposite to the navy.

(If I work hard, someone like me will never fail to become a painter...)

His purpose was only to become a painter. As long as he became what society generally calls a painter, he would be satisfied. He believed that this was revenge against fate. Therefore, there was no room for thinking about anything else.

In this state of madness, he forgot his parents completely. It was not that he had not thought about how worried his parents would be if he disappeared. Even if they forgave him, they would never approve of giving up middle school with only four or five months left until graduation.

But, he finally did not have the courage to continue studying at the Second Middle School. Even just thinking about meeting his military comrades again made him almost go crazy immediately.

(Please give me three years. I will definitely become a famous painter and return home in glory.)

He pleaded to his parents in his heart. In fact, at that time in Tokyo, if he concentrated on his studies for three years, he would definitely become a famous painter, which everyone believed.

Another thing was to reduce his parents' worries. This was his younger sister, Miss Zhi. He secretly told only Miss Zhi about his secret of leaving. This was when she went to Sulfur Valley to play during her sixth menstrual period, and he could not help but tell her the entire prepared plan. However, she was not surprised. At the same time, she also greatly encouraged her brother to leave.

"Brother is also a real man. How can he be content to live in Lu Jian Island all his life? If you leave, I can take on the responsibility of taking care of our parents for two people. Please don't worry and go to Tokyo with peace of mind!"

At the same time, the brother and sister had secretly agreed long ago that if Longfu encountered great difficulties in Tokyo, he would notify her. This was the condition for leaving.

### Appropriate Silong Tablets Held a Charity Sale

To whom it may concern, I appreciate your organization's charity sale of Appropriate Silong Tablets, demonstrating your enthusiasm for public welfare and benefiting people. I am hereby sending 500 bottles of medicine (20 tablets per bottle).

Half of the proceeds will be donated to the medical assistance fund, and the other half will be used to replenish the factory's cost needs. Muer Chemical Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Co., Ltd.

Appropriate Silong Tablets mainly treat Staphylococcus aureus, Pneumococcus, Gonococcus, Streptococcus, and all other bacterial infectious diseases. Now, the Muer Chemical Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Co., Ltd. is willing to donate half of the proceeds to the medical assistance fund. This act of caring and charity is worthy of social advocacy.

### Ren'aihui Andang Hospital is Financially Strained, Sincerely Requests Donations from All Sectors

Ren'aihui Andang Hospital, the main hospital on Lingbao Road (old Luban Road) Ximen Road, was founded by French nuns and has been around for 56 years. The hospital buildings are grand, and the gardens are spacious. All the equipment is quite complete. Internally, medicine is combined with treatment, accommodating over 200 impoverished patients who are hospitalized. The outpatient clinic sees as many as 700 to 800 people daily, completely free of charge, so medical services are particularly developed. The hospital's funding has always been maintained by donations from abroad. Recently, due to the European war, transportation has been hindered, and the source has long been cut off. Especially in recent years, the price of medicine has been high, and fundraising is difficult. Previously, patients were given one bowl of porridge and two meals a day, but now it has been reduced to three simple meals. If this continues, it will become more and more unclear. We sincerely request enthusiastic philanthropists from all sectors to donate according to their ability. It is best to commit to monthly donations, otherwise cash or necessities such as rice, flour, coal balls, and medicinal cotton cloth are all welcome. Doing good brings pleasure. Do not forget your kindness in rebuilding. Receiving addresses: this hospital and this newspaper's social service department. All donor titles will be collected and announced to show great faith.
