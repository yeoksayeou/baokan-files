### The Core of the Price Issue

The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, in its editorial of February 25th titled "The Core of China's Price Problem" (translated and published in today's edition of this newspaper), makes key points that are quite similar to what we have been advocating. We are deeply impressed by the Allied nations' concern for China's price problem, their profound observations, and insightful understanding.

The Asahi Shimbun states: "The price problem has developed into a profound political issue and cannot be resolved as an economic problem." It also states: "The focus of the problem has shifted to politics, and it is hoped that the National Government will first reform politics as a prerequisite for strengthening its political power." This view has indeed grasped the core of China's price problem. We have previously stated regarding the price issue: "Economic measures alone are insufficient to save the crisis; political reform must come first, so that political power and economic measures can work together." It can be said that our views are the same.

The Asahi Shimbun also states: "Although meetings are convened repeatedly without tiring of the details, if there is no determination to implement the resolutions, they will be of no use in solving the problem. Therefore, some people cannot help but criticize the National Government for lacking enthusiasm for strong price control measures." In our editorial of February 22nd, we specifically pointed out that "in the past, the work of suppressing prices has been universally valued by both the government and the public. The institutions managing prices and the methods of adjusting prices cannot be said to be incomplete or not thorough. However, the facts show that they have failed to achieve the expected results, and the crux of the problem lies in 'ineffective implementation' and 'inappropriate implementation'." "Ineffective implementation" and "inappropriate implementation" mean "not being determined to implement the resolutions of the meetings." Of course, this is of no use in solving the price problem. However, "political reform is not something that can be done overnight; a determination must be made to establish a government of good people." As for the most urgent measures to suppress prices at present, we have always believed that the following two points must be implemented to be effective:

First, daily necessities must be provided with a minimum level of supply. In particular, rice and coal, which are essential for daily life, are the most important. Whether based on theory or past practical experience, each drastic price fluctuation is always led by rice or coal. The reason why rice and coal have become serious problems is not objectively due to a lack of supply. As far as Shanghai is concerned, there have been no reports of people starving to death due to a lack of rice or coal. Moreover, Shanghai is a city that does not produce rice or coal, yet it is not lacking. So, if there is no actual shortage, what is the reason for the continuous price surge? It is because of the black market and smuggling. Therefore, we advocate eliminating the black market and replacing it with public prices, and cracking down on smuggling and replacing it with public transportation. However, if coercive methods are used to eliminate the black market, it will not only be ineffective but will also lead to more hoarding. Only by increasing the amount of rationing and maintaining the minimum needs, so that people do not have to seek help from the black market, will the black market disappear on its own. For example, the current rationing of rice per household is six *sheng* per person per month, while the minimum need is an average of one *dou* and five *sheng* per person per month. The difference of nine *sheng*, in addition to being made up by household flour, is sought from the black market. The black market will then naturally exist, and since it is called the black market, it is very likely to fluctuate irregularly.

Second, most daily necessities other than rice and coal are industrial products. If we want to ensure an uninterrupted supply, continuous production is the only condition. To demand continuous production, industrial raw materials and power are essential. If raw materials are difficult to obtain and power is restricted, it is already difficult to maintain the status quo, let alone increase production.

Third, the management or control agencies directly or indirectly related to prices must be unified in terms of system and authority, and overlapping structures must be absolutely avoided. Too many branches not only waste public funds but also hinder operations. As a result, things become more chaotic, and nothing is accomplished.

Our conclusion is that the core of the price problem lies in reforming politics, exerting political power, and coordinating economic measures in order to thoroughly save the crisis. The most urgent measure to treat the symptoms is to increase the rationing of rice and coal, gradually approaching the minimum needs. For daily necessities that are industrial products, at least raw materials and power should be supplied to maintain the original level of production. At the same time, the authority of the management agencies must be unified in order to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. All three are indispensable, and lacking one is enough to affect the overall situation.

### National Uprising Rally Held in Tokyo; Declaration and Resolutions Read by Ogawa

Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 8th: The National Uprising Rally, aimed at promoting the determination of the entire Japanese nation to rise up and strike down Britain and America, was held on the afternoon of the 7th at 1:30 PM at the Hibiya Public Hall.

### Japanese Forces Launch Strong Attack on British Positions West of the Mayu Mountains; Two Enemy Planes Shot Down Near Rangoon

Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 8th: A dispatch from a Japanese military base in Burma: The Japanese Air Force in Burma, in cooperation with ground forces, intercepted three enemy aircraft that infiltrated the airspace near Rangoon at noon on the 6th. As a result, they shot down two of them, and the remaining one escaped. The Japanese forces suffered no damage.

Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 8th: According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the Southeast Asia Command announced a battle report on the 7th stating that Japanese forces had launched two forceful attacks on British positions on the main front west of the Mayu Mountains.

Interview with a Lieutenant of the British 7th Division

Central News Agency dispatch from Rangoon, 8th: When the Japanese forces in the Indo-Burmese border annihilated the British 7th Division in the Sinzweya Basin, they captured a large number of British soldiers. According to a captured lieutenant of the British 7th Division, the British 7th Division, after completing operations in North Africa, was transferred to India and reorganized with elite troops who were undergoing jungle warfare training at Chilang, 40 kilometers west of Calcutta. In terms of ethnicity, British and Gurkha soldiers each accounted for 23%, and Sikh and Punjabi soldiers accounted for a total of 50%. The commander was initially Lieutenant General Copert, but after the reorganization, it was Major General Mirabi. From 1934 to 1940, the Major General served as a brigade commander in the Near East and also served in the Indian Army Headquarters. He was truly a fierce general. Under his guidance, the 7th Division and the 4th Division were the most elite forces in India. In early October of the previous year, the 7th Division and the 26th Division alternated in moving to the front lines. When the Na Keidok Highway was opened, they began to gather east of Sinzweya in mid-October, preparing for battle. Commander Mountbatten attached great importance to the battle situation in that area. On December 7th of last year, he visited Na Keidok with the commander of the 14th Army and the commander of the 15th Army to inspect the defense and encourage the soldiers. On January 8th of this year, he visited the commander of the 15th Army on the front lines to give instructions. At that time, the morale of the entire army was quite good. The division commander had submitted his opinion to the higher authorities, stating that it would be most appropriate to start the offensive around mid-January, but the commander of the 16th Army did not agree, and it was planned to start the offensive around mid-February. Unexpectedly, the Japanese forces preemptively launched an attack first, and the Japanese forces' courage in combat was truly unexpected. Now the Japanese forces have cut off our supply route. This was my first time fighting against the Japanese forces, and I deeply felt that the Japanese forces were disciplined and had excellent combat strength. The Japanese forces' courage in combat had caused the supposedly most elite 7th Division to collapse. The division commander abandoned his troops and fled in advance due to the unfavorable battle situation. The division headquarters has been ravaged by the Japanese forces, and the morale of the entire army has been completely lost. Moreover, the Indian National Army is fighting alongside the Japanese forces, which has a great impact on the Indian soldiers. The Indian soldiers may waver, and although the British Indian Army authorities are trying their best to prevent this, I believe that the Indian soldiers will withdraw from the front lines sooner or later.

### Major Victory for Japanese Forces in North China

Central News Agency dispatch from Tianjin, 8th: Since February 22nd of this year, Japanese forces in North China have been engaged in suppressing Communist forces in the Jin District. As of February 29th, the comprehensive battle results are as follows: 59 bodies of Communist soldiers recovered, 95 captured, 51 underground trenches and 1 arsenal destroyed, 75 rifles, 1,072 rounds of ammunition, 147 rounds of pistol ammunition, 60 foreign cannons, 157 hand grenades, and a large number of other military supplies seized.

Central News Agency dispatch from Qingdao, 8th: In February, Japanese forces in Shandong Province cleared out the Communist forces in eastern and southern Shandong. The comprehensive battle results are as follows: 52 engagements, 8,089 Communist soldiers engaged, 462 Communist soldiers' bodies recovered by the Japanese forces, 109 captured, 2 Communist facilities destroyed, 197 rifles, 1,621 rounds of rifle ammunition, 10 pistols, 62 hand grenades, and a large number of other miscellaneous items and rations seized.

### Indian People Demand Release of Political Prisoners and Granting of Authority to Organize a Federation

Central News Agency dispatch from Rangoon, 8th: The Indian people's movement to demand the release of political prisoners, which was triggered by the death of Gandhi's wife in prison, has intensified, causing the Indian Governor-General's office to feel extremely helpless. According to a broadcast on the 4th, the majority of the delegates attending the joint conference of the Indian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry held in New Delhi have submitted a resolution to the government demanding the immediate release of political prisoners and that they be granted the authority to organize a federation, and that this be strongly advocated as a peaceful solution desired by India. Therefore, the movement to release political prisoners is becoming more and more intense.

Translation and Commentary

### The Core of China's Price Problem

Since the implementation of the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in August of last year, prices in China had been calm for a while, but since around November, they have risen sharply again. The prices of major daily necessities such as food, clothing, and fuel have skyrocketed, far exceeding those at that time, and there seems to be no end to the increase. For example, cotton yarn and cloth had already risen by about two times compared to the time of purchase by the end of last year. The price problem can be said to have developed into a profound political problem and cannot be resolved as an economic problem.

Suppressing rising prices, ensuring the livelihood of the people, and overcoming the obstacles to increased production are among the greatest political tasks that the National Government should undertake at present. If the National Government lacks decisiveness in carrying out these responsibilities or resorts to perfunctory measures, it cannot be said that it is abandoning its own mission.

The phenomenon of wartime inflation is, needless to say, caused by increased production and the imbalance of materials. However, the recent rise in prices in China is mostly due to the enemy's instigation, the influence of pessimistic psychology regarding the recovery of the Chinese economy, and speculative hoarding. The trend of speculative hoarding has now become widespread throughout the country and has become a popular trend. Huge amounts of floating capital are used to purchase materials, thereby promoting the endless rise in prices.

The Price Liaison Conference of the five provinces and one city in Central China, which was held in Shanghai on the 22nd, decided that those who engage in speculative hoarding and violate economic regulations will be severely punished, given the recent rise in prices, which is not due to a shortage of materials. Solving the price problem hinges on cracking down on speculative hoarding. This is common knowledge, even before the decision of the conference. On January 22nd, the Ministry of Industry also pointed out the fact that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, companies and real estate companies have been engaging in speculation like mushrooms after the rain. It stated that the creation of such new companies was prohibited, but it has not taken active measures to investigate and punish existing companies. Although meetings are convened repeatedly without tiring of the details, if there is no determination to implement the resolutions, they will be of no use in solving the problem. Therefore, some people cannot help but criticize the National Government for lacking enthusiasm for strong price control measures.

In August of last year, the National Government decided to purchase cotton yarn and cotton cloth, but before long, prices rose even more rapidly and sharply than at that time. To suppress this situation, a comprehensive price control measure must be decisively implemented with several times the determination and thorough preparation of purchasing cotton yarn and cotton cloth. This is the reason why the price problem has become a profound political problem and cannot be solved simply as an economic problem. The solution to the problem lies only in the National Government unleashing strong political power. We also believe that the focus of the problem has shifted to politics, and we hope that the National Government will first reform politics as a prerequisite for strengthening its political power.

### Heavy Losses for Australian Troops in Eastern New Guinea; Difficulties in Supplies and Weakening of Actions

Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 8th: According to a dispatch from a Japanese military base in New Guinea, in eastern New Guinea, the Australian 7th Division is mainly moving north along the Ramu River valley, attempting to attack the Japanese base in Madang, eastern New Guinea. The Japanese forces in that area are using superhuman jungle warfare tactics to strike and reduce the enemy forces everywhere. Since the start of the Abit operation in September of last year, this unit has inflicted great damage on the enemy, killing more than 2,800 enemy soldiers. The enemy suffered about 500 deaths in Abit, more than 500 deaths in December, more than 1,200 deaths in the battles of Joy Ridge and Screen Mountain, and 200 deaths in the Battle of Madero. In addition, the Japanese forces have launched ambush and guerrilla warfare everywhere, killing more than 500 enemy soldiers. Furthermore, the Ramu River valley area is a high-temperature and high-humidity zone, and enemy soldiers are suffering from malaria and scabies, with injuries and illnesses occurring one after another. Almost all of the lower halves of the bodies of the enemy prisoners of war are covered in sores. Therefore, in just three months, the average number of soldiers has decreased by about 20-30%. On the contrary, the Japanese forces occupy many highlands, and the environment is much better than the enemy's occupied areas. The combat strength is extremely strong, and the enemy's supply base is far in the rear, relying on air transport for supplies, which is quite difficult. Therefore, the enemy's actions have weakened significantly since February. Furthermore, according to an Australian prisoner of war obtained in that area, the supplies for the Australian 7th Division are extremely poor compared to the air force and the American forces, and they are often sent to areas where the Japanese forces are strongly resisting. Therefore, the Australian forces have long harbored resentment.

### Bombing of Gabien

Central News Agency dispatch from Rabaul: Twenty-three Type 24 aircraft and four Type 38 aircraft attacked Gabien on New Ireland Island on the afternoon of the 6th. After being intercepted by the local Japanese forces, they fled. The Japanese side suffered no losses in this battle.

### Thailand Plans to Purchase Mining Machinery from Japan

Central News Agency dispatch from Bangkok, 8th: The tin and other extractive industries in Thailand declined somewhat after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Recently, with the active revitalization by the government, they are rapidly recovering their former state. Sanintan, the director of the Mining Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, recently stated: In order to revitalize the mining industry, the Thai government established the Thailand Tin Rubber Company in January of the previous year to purchase various mineral products and seek to guide mining methods. Therefore, the results are gradually improving. Now, the various mines lack various equipment for mining and are negotiating purchases with Japan. It is expected that this issue will be resolved soon.

### Japanese Military Doctor Discovers Radiation Therapy

Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 7th: According to a telephone call from Osaka, the method of treating malaria researched by British and American doctors has failed. Recently, the Japanese military medical scholar, Colonel Takezo Kikawa, the chief of the medical department of the Osaka Division, finally succeeded in his research and obtained a doctorate in medicine. In the past, in order to thoroughly treat malaria, quinine hydrochloride and other drugs were injected to bring the pathogens lurking in the human body into the blood to eliminate them. To induce the pathogens, most countries in the world use the method of injecting protein and adrenaline (stimulants). Colonel Kikawa has now proved that although this method can induce the pathogens parasitizing in the blood cells, it is not very effective for those parasitizing inside the human body and in the liver and bone marrow. Therefore, it is ineffective for latent and chronic malaria. He also discovered a new treatment method using X-ray radiation, ultraviolet rays, and infrared rays. This great discovery was actually made in May of the 14th year of Showa (1939). For the next four years, he devoted all his efforts to research the place and time to use radiation, and finally obtained a safe and effective treatment method, establishing a great achievement in the diagnosis and treatment of malaria.

### Greater East Asia War Intensifying; Enemy Situation Increasingly Unfavorable; Statement Released Yesterday by Japanese Military Authorities in North China

Central News Agency dispatch from Beijing, 8th: The Japanese military authorities in North China, with March 10th marking the 39th Japanese Army Memorial Day, released a statement at 3 PM on the 8th, expressing their determination to strive for victory. The general idea was that the Greater East Asia War is intensifying, and fierce decisive battles are currently underway in the vast war zone of the Pacific. At this time, the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia are exerting all their efforts and fighting together to crush the ambitions of Britain and America, which is truly commendable. Due to the prolongation of the war, the enemy's internal and external situations are becoming increasingly unfavorable. In their anxiety, they have repeatedly launched counterattacks and engaged in great propaganda. The various activities of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have also become active due to the strategies and propaganda of Britain and America, or to spread rumors about the trends in the war situation, disrupt public order, and launch terrorist tactics. The Japanese army, in addition to thoroughly crushing their actions, also sincerely hopes that people from all walks of life will not be swayed by their behavior. As the 39th Army Memorial Day is about to arrive, we must adhere to our belief in victory, and under the close cooperation between China and Japan, strive to achieve the liberation of Greater East Asia.

### Ambassador Tani Returns to Beijing After Inspecting North China; Talks with Reporters in Peiping

Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, 8th: The Information Department of the Japanese Embassy released a statement at 3 PM on the 8th, stating that Ambassador Tani, after inspecting Guangdong and Hankou a few days ago, departed from Beijing on the 1st of this month and went to inspect Zhangjiakou, Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, and other places. He also convened meetings with senior Chinese and Japanese military and civilian officials in various places. Now that the mission has been completed, he returned to Beijing on the 8th.

Central News Agency dispatch from Peiping, 8th: Japanese Ambassador to China Masayuki Tani, in order to inspect the general situation in the Zhangjiakou, Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Jinan areas, arrived here on the 1st. After completing the inspection in the valley, he flew back to the blind capital from Jinan by plane on the morning of the 8th. Ambassador Tani held a press conference here on the 2nd and stated that since the implementation of Japan's new policy toward China, various parties have praised its achievements. Since Japan is determined to help China strive for autonomy and independence, its new policy toward China will remain unchanged. The National Government's implementation of clean government and streamlining of personnel is in response to Japan's new policy toward China. We must know that Japan's new policy toward China is the core of the construction of Greater East Asia, which is why Japan is striving to achieve it. As for the price problem, the National Government has gradually established a controlled economy and is actively cracking down on hoarding. With the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, Shanghai's economic power has been promoted. Coal in North China has a profound impact on prices in Central China. It is now being smoothly transported to various parts of Central China, so the price prospects can be optimistic. The most pleasant thing about this trip north is that Chairman Wang has penetrated political power in the construction work. Moreover, the increased production of important wartime resources in North China has yielded great results and is now being implemented with all its strength, and the construction work in North China is being promoted.

### Proclamation of War by the National Government

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th two years ago, the National Government, in the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with friendly nation Japan. Since then, it has launched the New National Movement, engaged in safeguarding public order, and improving people's livelihoods, with the aim of enhancing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, Britain, the United States, and other countries continue to use their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and have intensified their efforts, even colluding with the Chongqing faction to participate in the so-called Anglo-American front, sending troops to Burma and India, causing East Asians to kill each other. Recently, their forces have been successively defeated by the armies, navies, and air forces of friendly nation Japan, and their bases for aggression in East Asia have also been lost. Therefore, they are increasingly resorting to cunning schemes and are jealous of the peaceful development of the National Government's controlled areas. They daily instigate the Chongqing faction to continuously invade, in order to obstruct the progress of various construction projects, and even use their own aircraft, using the Chongqing faction as a base, to carry out bombings in Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places in our country, harming civilians. The Chongqing faction, willing to be used by Britain and the United States, acting as traitors to East Asia, is certainly despicable. However, Britain and the United States, harboring malicious intentions towards East Asia, have exhausted their ability to sow discord, in order to achieve their ultimate desire for annexation, which is something that the East Asian nations should collectively oppose. The National Government hereby declares that from today onwards, it is at war with Britain and the United States. It will devote all its efforts to cooperate with friendly nation Japan, to sweep away the brutality of Britain and the United States, in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. Manchuria, Thailand, and the Nanjing government, are steadfastly friendly, and are particularly of one mind regarding the co-prosperity of East Asia. In the future, they will further promote cooperation, in order to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. Our friendly nations Germany and Italy, have been contending with the forces of Britain and the United States in the West for many years, and have repeatedly achieved glorious victories. Our country now joins the Greater East Asia War, and will echo each other, in order to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All our citizens should know that this is the only opportunity to realize the Great Asianism of the Founding Father of the nation. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the achievement of peace and good faith for the entire world, depend on this. Let us be of one heart and one mind, exerting our efforts from beginning to end, to carry out this great mission of a great era!

### Mengjiang Government Formulates Measures to Restrict Commodity Prices and Promulgates Public Security Protection Law

Zhangjiakou, 8th (Central News Agency) In order to suppress commodity prices, ensure wartime resources, and stabilize people's livelihoods, the Mengjiang government has formulated the key points of the commodity price control policy to supplement the second Mengjiang commodity price countermeasures formulated in May last year, with the aim of strictly implementing them and actively promoting economic construction. The main points of the commodity price restriction outlined this time will focus on the following aspects compared with the second commodity price countermeasure, with the aim of actively promoting implementation. It is expected that this commodity price policy will achieve great results: 1) Thoroughly implement the self-sufficiency system; 2) Thoroughly rectify and expand light industry; 3) Rectify import agencies; 4) Expand official fixed price materials; 5) Strengthen the control of transportation costs; 6) Strengthen labor management; 7) Strengthen the organizational strength of the Wartime Materials Adjustment Committee; 8) Promulgate the Public Security Protection Law; 9) Rectify and crack down on laws and regulations.

Zhangjiakou, 8th (Central News Agency) In order to establish public security, the Mengjiang government has recently formulated the Public Security Protection Law. Severe punishments will be imposed for major offenses such as attempting to disrupt order and disturb public security. The main purpose of the law is to suppress the activities of the Communist Party. The full text consists of twelve articles, and the provisions are extremely severe.

Zhangjiakou, 8th (Central News Agency) In order to plan for the improvement of the legal system and establish public security, the Mengjiang authorities have specially stipulated the Public Security Protection Law, which was promulgated on the 8th.

### Abundant Production of Liquid Fuel in Guangdong

Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) Zhang, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Construction Department, met with reporters yesterday and answered reporters' questions regarding the establishment of the provincial alcohol factory and the increase in liquid fuel production in the province as follows: During this tense wartime period, it is necessary to make every effort to increase the production of all materials related to the war. Liquid fuel is especially a necessary material in wartime. Recently, the source of gasoline has been dwindling, and in order to maintain transportation in the province and for military purposes, we should find ways to obtain this resource. Since our province has no mining, we can only take a step back and use alcohol instead. Therefore, the establishment of the alcohol factory will not only provide a new source for the supply of liquid fuel in the province, but also make a major contribution to military use. Currently, the factory's monthly production is about 13,000 gallons of pure alcohol, with excellent concentration, and there is a sufficient supply of sulfuric acid.

### Tank Battle Unfolds in Southern Section of the Eastern Front Contending for the Railway Hub Ternopil

Stockholm, Sweden, (Central News Agency) Since Marshal Zhukov's Soviet troops on the Eastern Front began operations near the old Soviet border in western Ukraine, their offensive has intensified day by day, and the defensive posture of the German troops under Marshal von Manstein has also been strengthened. Moscow telegrams also stated that German troops were launching fierce counterattacks with large numbers of tanks and infantry in most areas. Zhukov's troops are currently launching an offensive on the 165-mile front from the Jampol area southwest of Shepetovka to the area north of Proskurov, with the goal of capturing the area from Odessa to and the area north of Proskurov. Tank battles continue day and night on the muddy ground. According to German reports, the Soviet army continues to send new armored artillery units to advance. Zhukov's offensive is more intense than any previous battle on the Eastern Front. It is also reported that the Soviet army, echoing the offensive in the area south of Shepetovka, is launching an offensive in the area south of Zhivenigorodka northwest of Kirovograd, and is conducting attacks with a strong assault force group under the cover of three tank brigades.

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) According to the German military authorities, on the 6th, German troops destroyed 158 Soviet tanks and 54 aircraft on the Eastern Front.

### Soviet Military Delegation Arrives in Yugoslavia

Ankara, 8th (Central News Agency) According to the Soviet News Agency, a new Soviet military delegation has arrived at the headquarters of Tito, the leader of the Yugoslavian separatists. The first Soviet military delegation arrived in the country a few weeks before the Moscow Conference last summer. At that time, Britain was also forced to send people there. Soon after, Britain abandoned General Mihailovic and appointed Tito. This time, the Soviet delegation is led by a lieutenant general, which shows its significance.

### Serbian Prime Minister Assassinated

Belgrade, 8th (Central News Agency) According to an announcement by the Belgrade police chief: Serbian Interior Minister Colonel Marlovic was assassinated on his way to his office on Wednesday morning. The matter is currently under thorough investigation.

### Laval Government's Position Stable

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) Regarding whether there will be further changes in the French government, a glimpse can be obtained from the words of the German Foreign Ministry spokesperson.

### Development of West Asian Oil Issues Causes Diplomatic Disputes Between the United States and Britain

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from Washington: The opposition between the United States and Britain, centered on the development of West Asian oil resources, is becoming increasingly serious, leading to difficult diplomatic problems. U.S. Under Secretary of State Stettinius met with reporters on the 7th and announced that the United States and Britain will convene an oil meeting. It is said that the U.S. and British governments have decided to hold preparatory talks on oil issues before holding formal talks.

Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) In the US government's West Asian oil resources development plan, there is a proposal to build an oil pipeline from the Persian Gulf area to the Mediterranean coast, which has caused diplomatic disputes between the United States and Britain. Recently, the U.S. Congress and various parties have also fiercely opposed it. The U.S. Petroleum Industry Wartime Council specifically issued a white paper on the 6th, attacking the government's plan, saying: "During this wartime, which country can be expected to cooperate with the United States in the next war? Which country can be expected to actively participate in the collective security system? Does the United States intend to exercise its police power anywhere in the world? To exercise this kind of police power, is it necessary for the United States to ensure military bases and supply bases all over the world?" According to the Petroleum Industry Wartime Council, it is a consulting body for Ickes' Wartime Petroleum Adjustment Bureau. Since the consulting body has issued such a dissenting opinion, Ickes' position has become increasingly difficult.

### Soviet Diplomats to Go to Malta Participating in the Transfer of Italian Warships

Madrid, 8th (Central News Agency) Reuter's report: The representative of the Soviet Commission in Algiers, Bogomolov, said: "We will jointly be responsible for protecting the Mediterranean. The sailors who will receive the Italian warships have departed for Malta in the Mediterranean, which will be the place of transfer. Soviet diplomats will also fly to participate in this event. Part of the warships will be stationed in the ports of Algiers, and the rest will sail to other ports in North Africa."

Bern, 8th (Central News Agency) The Swiss National Newspaper, under the headline "The Soviet Union as a Naval Power," discussed that after the Second World War, the Soviet Union could eliminate its disadvantages against Britain and the United States in the peace conference, that is, obtain naval bases for its fleet and merchant ships to dock and obtain contact with the outer ocean, and no longer be cut off. In the future, it will learn that occupying and seizing the port in northern Norway has already suffered this crisis. It is determined to obtain the port in Persia after the war, so that its sea access problem can be completely solved. And the Soviet Union will not be satisfied with partially solving this problem. She said that the region is also controlled by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, just like the Arctic Ocean and Persia. The Soviet Union's development from a land power into a sea and land power seems to be an unstoppable trend. This development is even more evident in the transfer of one-third of the Italian ships to the Soviet Union.

### Iranian Cabinet Resigns En Masse

Ankara, 8th (Central News Agency) According to a report from Beirut Broadcasting by the German New Press Agency: The Iranian cabinet led by Prime Minister Sohaili has recently resigned en masse.

### Situation of Indian and Chongqing Troops on the Burma-India Frontline

The Burma-India front, the largest land front for the British and Americans, is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. The following is a brief description of the situation on the front line to show a glimpse of the chaotic situation:

Enemy Troops Trapped by Transportation

Due to inconvenient transportation and difficulties in shipping supplies in the Burma-India border area, the enemy is now urgently catching up, building roads to maintain contact. Several trails have now been opened up that run through jungles and intricate waterways.

One starts from Assam, passes through the eastern end of the Patkai Mountains, and exits the Hukawng Valley. The second is the route through the Ledo Road. The third is the Wilcox-Tanner exploration route that utilizes the Brahmaputra River and the Irrawaddy River. The fourth is the land route through Manipur. There are also three roads planned around 1920 to connect Burma and India, namely the northern route (Myitkyina-Ledo), the central route (Imphal), and the coastal route (from Chittagong through Maungdaw).

The Chongqing troops currently attacking in the Hukawng area cross the treacherous Patkai Mountains over 2,500 meters above sea level along the Ledo Road and reach the lowlands of Hukawng, which are about 200 meters above sea level. Once the rainy season arrives, it becomes a completely flooded wetland, so it is quite difficult to maintain a supply station in the jungle lowlands and rely on air transport. The main force of the British 7th Division and the British 5th Division, which were encircled by the Japanese army this time, also invaded along this planned coastal route. However, their retreat has now been completely cut off by the Japanese army.

Indian Soldiers as Cannon Fodder

In eastern India, there are operational troops, defense troops, etc., under the command of Patton and Lake, totaling about 200,000 troops in action. Among them are British soldiers (including Scottish soldiers), 50,000 Indian soldiers, 100,000 black soldiers and other indigenous soldiers, and 10,000 American soldiers and 50,000 Chongqing troops (American-style Chongqing troops). In the British 5th Division and the Indian 7th Division, which are attacking on the Arakan front, some Indian junior officers are used, but even if they are in a higher rank, they are absolutely prohibited from commanding the British. According to an enemy soldier who surrendered to the National Army on the Arakan front:

"The British and Americans receive more than twice the salary of the Indian soldiers, and food and clothing are not supplied to the Indian soldiers at all if they feel slightly lacking. They only rely on requisition."

Their brutality is exposed here. The enemy, who finally realized that we are not their enemies, is now forcibly training Indian soldiers in jungle warfare training camps, teaching them crash course tactics such as ambush warfare and night warfare, making them cannon fodder.

American-Style Chongqing Troops

Recently, enemy reports openly refer to the Chongqing troops in the Hukawng area as "American-style Chongqing troops" (A.T.C.T.). The Chongqing troops stationed in India, who accept this pitiful name and are willing to be their pawns, are now composed of the New First Army (Commander Zheng Tongguo), the 22nd Division, and the 38th Division under the command of Stilwell, the commander of the Hukawng area, and Buna, the chief of staff. Two years ago, when they were fighting in Burma under the command of Luo Zhuoying, calling for a scorched earth tactic, they were called the British-Chongqing Allied Forces, and they had "a self-esteem that we are stronger than the British army," and often expressed dissatisfaction with the appointment of American General Stilwell as the commander-in-chief, so the authorities only made Stilwell the commander and military adviser.

However, now each of their companies must have two or three American commanders, and about half of the company officers are Americans. Under their command, they are called American-style fallen troops, gnawing on banana stems, washing away blood and sweat, and engaging in the construction work of new roads.

However, the facts that American officers live in luxury, commit atrocities against women and children while drunk, extort money from residents, and that British and American air forces blindly bomb the Zhujiang and the Chongqing troops on the other side of the Nu River, have caused deep dissatisfaction among the Chongqing troops, resulting in attacks on American officers and a surge in the number of junior officers surrendering.

### Fierce Air Battles in Northwestern Germany Rome Suffers Another Terrorist Air Raid

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) German News Agency report, military news: A large formation of American bombers, protected by fighter planes, flew over western Germany at 12:30 pm today, and fierce air battles began over northwestern Germany after 1:00 pm, especially north and west of Hanover. Today's weather is similar to that of the 6th.

Another report. According to the official German war report: American aircraft attacked Rome and other cities in central Italy again yesterday, and several areas of Rome suffered considerable losses.

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) A telegram from Rome stated that on the 7th, the reactionary air force blindly bombed Rome twice continuously from 11:00 am, dropping a large number of incendiary bombs and high-performance bombs. The Church of Saint Quirin was completely destroyed.

### 140 American Aircraft Lost in Attacks on Berlin

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) A press release from the German Supreme Headquarters at noon on the 7th stated: American aircraft formations attacked Berlin at noon on the 6th. The German air defense forces achieved great results. Only a residential area in the city suffered slight damage. The German army shot down 118 of its four-engine bombers and a total of 140 aircraft.

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) The American air raids on Berlin have been carried out daily since the 4th. In addition to dropping bombs, a large number of leaflets were also distributed. When American aircraft attacked on the 6th, a large number of propaganda materials were also distributed, stating that Germany could only be saved by peace, and adding various defenses, but the Germans ignored them all. The Germans generally believe that the United States promoted peace to the Italians six months ago when the Italian fascist regime broke its promises. Now they are treating the Germans with the same means, which is really shameless. How can the Germans fall for their tricks again?

### Only Artillery Battles at the Anzio Beachhead Allied Troop Movements Continue

Berlin, (Central News Agency) The German authorities claimed on the 7th regarding the war situation as follows: There were no large-scale operations at the Anzio beachhead. Only the artillery teams of the two armies launched active attacks. The German heavy mortar team shelled two American mechanized artillery positions east of the Anzio-Aprilia highway, destroying several British heavy tank guns and mortars, and an ammunition depot. The anti-Axis forces are actively moving troops behind the Chen terrain. It seems that the American army is preparing to launch an offensive.

### Egypt Protests Jewish Statehood in Palestine US Submits Reply

Adana, 8th (Central News Agency) A Beirut dispatch announced today; Senator Wagner's response to the Iraqi protest regarding the Palestine issue states that the U.S. Congress can take any steps it wishes without regard to the intentions of foreign countries. Our plan is based on our friendship with the Jews. This plan is in line with the Atlantic Charter, and the hopes of the Jews have been clearly stated and cannot be discussed again. Ankara, 8th (Central News Agency) According to a report from Cairo: Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas met with British Ambassador Kerr yesterday, and the U.S. ambassador submitted the U.S. government's reply to the Egyptian government's memorandum, which was submitted to the U.S. government at the end of February, protesting the U.S. government's plan to establish a Jewish state in Palestine. The content of the U.S. reply is unknown.

Ankara, 8th (Central News Agency) According to news from Cairo: South African Prime Minister Smuts made a statement on March 3, promising Palestine as the homeland of the Jews. Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas has protested to the South African government because of this.

### Soviet Aircraft Bomb Key Finnish Ports Finland Evacuates Children

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from Helsinki: The Finnish military authorities released a war bulletin on the 7th, stating that a Soviet bomber squadron bombed the key port of Kotka on the Finnish coast twice on the 6th.

Helsinki, 8th (Central News Agency) A total of 17,500 Finnish children have gone to Sweden, of which 5,000 were recently sent to Sweden by the Finnish authorities for evacuation.

### British Miners' Strike Spreads Coal Industry in Major Crisis

Stockholm, Sweden, 8th (Central News Agency) After a coal mine dispute occurred in Durham, South Wales and Monmouthshire coal mines also began to strike on the 6th, so the British coal industry has fallen into a major crisis. Eight thousand miners in Monmouthshire and the miners in Neath and Glamorgan began to strike on the 6th because their demand for wage revision was not met. According to a telegram from London, 1,000 miners in four coal mines in Aberdeen also joined the strike on the 7th. The total number of strikers in South Wales and other coal mines is about 25,000, and the total number of coal mines closed is 45. As early as January this year, the situation of the British coal industry had become serious. The British Fuel Ministry increased the minimum wage of miners from four pounds and fifteen shillings (weekly wage) to five pounds, but did not accept the miners' request for subsidies based on work performance. The miners in Durham and other places unanimously launched a new tactic of going slow, which made the British Fuel Ministry feel very tricky. A special correspondent in London for a Swedish newspaper commented on the crisis in the British coal industry on the 6th, saying that the miners' dissatisfaction has been the most important problem in the British military industry in the past few years. The recent situation has deteriorated even further. The biggest reason is the limitation of daily wages. In fact, the mine owners have not paid less than the minimum wage, so the miners have no choice but to adopt the so-called go-slow tactic, because if they go on strike, they will be punished by the authorities, so they gradually work in the mine, which reduces the output of coal, making the authorities feel very tricky. It seems that the British government is unwilling to resolve the current situation through negotiations. The Minister of Labor has issued an ultimatum to the striking workers, stating that if the miners do not stop going slow immediately, they will be transferred elsewhere. The Times reported that the coal output in the Eaton area has dropped sharply from 15,000 tons per week to 6,500 tons. According to the British Fuel Ministry, the coal output in the United Kingdom has decreased by about 40,000 to 50,000 tons per week.

### Women's Groups Commemorate Women's Day Yesterday Afternoon Held Symposium

Central News Agency: The Shanghai Special Municipality Women's Association, in order to commemorate the "March 8th" International Women's Day, jointly with the Young Women's Christian Association, the Women's Welfare Association, the Midwifery Association, and women from all walks of life, held a grand commemoration ceremony at the Ningbo Fellow Association Hall on Xizang Road at 10:00 yesterday morning. Government officials who attended and delivered speeches included Minister Zhang Yipeng, Mayor Chen's representative Lin Jiongying, Secretary-General Zhao of the Municipal Government's representative Cui Jingyu, Director Chen Dongbai, Director Liang's representative Secretary Pan, representatives from the German and Japanese women's circles, and more than a thousand representatives of all members of the association, gathered together, and the situation was enthusiastic.

Grand Occasion of the Meeting

The meeting was chaired by Qu Zhonglun (Municipal Women's Association), Pang Jiacan (Women's Welfare Association), Yuan Huiyu (Midwifery Association), Yu Ming (Academic Circles), and Lin Meishu (Education Circles). After singing the "March 8th" Women's Commemoration Song, the chairman of the Women's Association, Qu Zhonglun, delivered an opening speech, elaborating on the history of the women's movement and the efforts that women's circles should make in the future. Then, Minister Zhang Yipeng was invited to deliver a speech. After the speech, Director Lin of the Municipal Government was invited to deliver a speech on behalf of Mayor Chen. Subsequently, women representatives from all walks of life, such as Lin Meishu and Yuan Huiyu, delivered speeches in succession, and then the ceremony was declared completed in the melodious sound of music. At 3:00 in the afternoon, the association held a symposium at the News United Association, chaired by Qu Zhonglun, to discuss the fundraising for the Midwifery Fund and the establishment of social service centers, etc., and the atmosphere was very pleasant, and the meeting adjourned at 5:00.

Minister Zhang's Speech

Minister of Judicial Administration Zhang Yipeng delivered a speech at the "March 8th" Commemoration Meeting held by the Municipal Women's Association, saying: "The development of a cause depends entirely on the cause itself. A sound performance can achieve the ideal goal day by day. If it cannot be fully sound, then the things it expresses will not have good results. This is true of everything, and the cause of women, who account for more than half of the entire nation, is even greater and more important. However, in order to demand the soundness of women's circles themselves, I have a few opinions: "Preparing organizational ability" is not only for women's circles, but also for other circles. We should prepare organizational ability so that the whole can be united and move in one direction. Regarding the preparation of organizational ability for women's circles, I offer the following suggestions:

Regardless of men or women, one cannot be without independent living, but Chinese women have never paid attention to independent living and specialize in relying on others. Those who specialize in relying on others will not have organizational ability. To cultivate women's independent living, one must pay attention to women's occupations. If women's occupations can flourish, women's organizational ability can develop.

To make women's organizations sound and strengthen their ability, one must first eliminate superstition. Not to mention chanting scriptures and worshipping Buddha, even superstitious religions are unnecessary. As long as you adhere to your own aspirations, human ability is greater than anything else. If you have superstition, you will spend your time on superstition. If you do not seek women's circles to spend time on superstition, how can you be sound?

Saving. Women's extravagance is sometimes greater than that of men, such as spending on gorgeous clothing. If you cannot save, organizational ability will be hindered. Not only should you save on materials, but you should also pay attention to saving on time. "You should understand legal knowledge." Women's circles in our country generally lack legal knowledge. If you can understand legal knowledge, such as marriage issues, you will not make mistakes due to ignorance of the law. Therefore, it is said that women should have legal knowledge. "You should study educational principles." Women should study educational principles. Now, men and women in our country have equal education, but I believe that the authority of education is in the hands of women, not in the hands of men. Housewives should help their husbands who are working hard and serving society outside to educate their children, so that their children will not grow up and affect society due to lack of family education. Unmarried women can also educate their younger siblings at home, and at the same time, they can also educate homeless and out-of-school children and women, so that they can become useful materials for society.

### The Municipal Air Defense Headquarters Announces Another Air Defense Uniform Style

According to the Shanghai Special Municipality Civil Air Defense Headquarters: Regarding the style of women's air defense clothing, the headquarters has already taken photos and sent them to various newspapers for publication yesterday (8th).

The above air defense clothing is displayed in the windows of the respective companies, and citizens are encouraged to visit and see.

Report on the Sale of Air Defense Badges The Shanghai Special Municipality Civil Air Defense Headquarters designated January 9th of this year, the first anniversary of China's participation in the war, as the first Air Defense Day.

### Driving Privately Owned Cars to Entertainment Venues

Police Station Dispatches Personnel for Secret Investigation

The authorities in this city are extremely strict in reviewing and issuing various automobile licenses, and they must verify that the applicant truly has a legitimate need for business purposes before issuing them. Therefore, those who have their own cars must be mindful of the authorities' intention to conserve material resources and use them properly. Recently, it has been learned that privately owned cars are often parked in front of dance halls and brothels, which is obviously contrary to the authorities' intention to carefully review and issue licenses. The police station has recently dispatched personnel for secret investigation in order to take appropriate disciplinary action.

### Food Adjustment Committee Holds Meeting Yesterday

Discusses Readjustment of Rationing Issues

The Shanghai Food Rationing Adjustment Committee held a meeting at 3:00 yesterday afternoon in the conference room of the First District Office, attended by more than ten members including the chairman of the committee, Ji Hua, to discuss the issue of adjusting food rationing in the city in the future. They discussed it for a long time, which is extremely stable for the food supply for the citizens of Shanghai.

### Detoxification Association Declares to Complete Mission

Central News Agency: Since the Shanghai Youth Detoxification Movement Committee was hastily established, in addition to promoting publicity and guidance to promote public awareness, it has also repeatedly submitted opinions and contributed to the authorities, asking for adoption. The municipal authorities have ordered all gambling dens in this city to be closed on the 29th of this month. However, it has recently been rumored that the gambling dens are still conspiring to linger on. In order to be determined to assist the government in completing the detoxification mission, the association has issued another statement.

### Local Lockdown in Meningitis Area in Nanshi

Central News Agency: Since the outbreak of epidemic meningitis in the entire Nanshi area, although patients have been sent to hospitals for diagnosis and treatment, eight or nine out of ten have died. The spread of the disease is extremely rampant. The Nanshi Health Office is working closely with the Third Police Branch of Nanshi to do its utmost to eradicate the disease. Areas where meningitis has already occurred are now being locked down separately and subjected to local disinfection in order to reduce the scope of the epidemic's spread. However, if the accumulated filth in Nanshi is not cleared up for a day, the source of the epidemic will be difficult to eradicate for a day. It is hoped that the municipal authorities will quickly take measures to protect the public health of the citizens of the area.

### The Seventh District Prepares to Ration Soap, Firewood, and Coal Balls

The Economic Bureau of this city is handling the rationing of matches, soap, and coal balls in the seventh district and other areas on a per capita basis. The first phase has ended, and the second phase of rationing is currently being actively prepared. It is expected to begin in the middle of this month. Regarding the households that were rationed in the first phase, if some have not received the rationing certificate, or have received the rationing certificate but have not received the rationed goods, they can report directly to the Changning Road Economic Bureau of this city for investigation.

### Japanese Army Memorial Day Grand Memorial Ceremony Held

Economic Circles Commentary

### Do Not Harm the Herd

Banks and money shops are clearly public bedrooms for adjusting social finance, and companies and firms are clearly private enterprises that promote social production, both of which are indispensable links in the social financial circle. The only thing to fear is that those who open banks and money shops or operate companies and firms are not bewitched by the idea of ​​windfall profits, leave their posts, abandon their missions, and participate in investment and hoarding, eventually turning their banks and money shops or companies and firms into the source of material hoarding and securities speculation. Once the financial market changes, they will inevitably be swept into the vortex, even like fallen leaves encountering autumn phoenixes, with no ability to resist, and the entire financial market will suffer its influence. This is what is meant by harming the herd, which is most undesirable in our economic circles.

Last year, some banks went bankrupt due to the government's purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, and this year, some small banks have been brought to the brink of collapse due to the stock market crash. Banks of this kind that collapse with a single touch or cannot stand with a single blow absorb other people's money on the one hand and use it for their own speculative operations, and on the other hand, they use the money inside to gamble on high-interest loans. When the financial market fluctuates, they come up with a "no-end" solution, harming the public and leaving the stage. What is more harmful to the herd than this?

We have spoken about rigorously implementing self-discipline and merging small banks countless times before, but we always feel that the speaker is sincere, and the listener is dismissive. Even in the most recent issue of this newspaper's monthly magazine (Resumption Volume 2, Issue 2), it was said in the discussion on "The Abnormal State of China's Wartime Economy": "Banks and money shops in a state of financial waste are the source of usury and a fatal wound to production. This abnormal state of the economy already existed before the incident, and it has become more severe after the incident. If this state is not changed, there will be no way to fundamentally improve China's production."

### To Maintain Financial Stability, the Central Reserve Bank Provides Short-Term Loans Discretionally

Limit Speculative Firms to Clear Hoarded Goods

In order to assist the government in stabilizing prices, the Central Reserve Bank recently temporarily suspended interbank lending and restricted the loan business of various financial institutions, and the lowering of prices has achieved the greatest effect. In order to repay loans, hoarders have flocked to clear their stocks, and black market prices have fallen across the board, which has hit speculators hard. In particular, the heads of firms that indiscriminately engage in speculation and pledge national goods feel even more that their short-term funds are not flexible.

The Central Reserve Bank recently learned that the so-called short-term funds of each of the firms are that they used funds to hoard goods in the past. They cannot be sold off for a while. At this time, lending is tightened, so the turnover of short-term funds is difficult and there is no problem with business losses. In order to maintain the stability of the entire financial system, it has provided short-term loans to each of the firms to support their business at its discretion. At the same time, all hoarded loans will be sold off to compensate for the loss. In the future, such firms will be banned and no short-term loans will be provided.

### Deadline for Registration of Major Commodities

Only 30% of Firewood and Soap Registered

The general registration of major commodities handled by the Economic Bureau of this city was originally intended to count the stored quantities of major commodities in this city in order to adjust them and prevent hoarding and speculation. It is learned that the registration will close on the 15th of this month. Those who fail to register after the deadline will be punished according to law. It is hoped that the trade associations of major commodities in this city will instruct their members to quickly register and not wait and see, lest they be punished.

In addition, regarding the registration of matches, soap, and firewood, which the Materials Investigation Committee has adopted for the implementation of fair rationing, it has repeatedly ordered each store to register and report its inventory, and has repeatedly extended the deadline to the 9th of this month. As of today, the investigation and registration of production plants is basically complete, but only about 30% of the 6,000 retail stores in Shanghai have registered and reported their inventories, and 70% have not yet reported. It is heard that the Materials Investigation Committee will implement the measures decided by the plenary committee meeting on the 25th of last month for unregistered inventories, that is, matches, candles, and soap that have not been registered will be sealed and confiscated.

Short Comment

### Points to Note for Long-Term Air Defense

Since the 3rd of this month, this city has implemented long-term blackouts. Based on our observation over the past week, we offer the following points that should be noted:

This blackout may be more relaxed in terms of implementation and execution compared to temporary controls in the past because it is a long-term air defense measure. However, because it is slightly relaxed, many places did not pay attention and revealed lights when walking on every road around 8:00 in the evening. If this situation is not corrected, it is likely that the air defense rules will become a dead letter over time.

These few days—the middle of each lunar month—are just the time when the moonlight is bright. The faint light of the street lights on the road is as if there is none under the moonlight, which is a waste of electricity. We believe that street lights should be exempted during the bright moonlight period, and the electricity used for street lights should be used to supplement the lack of electricity for production.

After the blackout, petty criminals take the opportunity to engage in activities, and comprehensive plans should be made to prevent security problems. How can the police liaise with the Baojia self-defense groups? How should patrols be conducted? Good methods should be devised quickly.

There are quite a few small business people who make a living on the streets, and they should be allowed to continue to do business. From a proactive perspective, guide them to abide by air defense rules so that they can still make a living without going against air defense.

The above is a jumble of opinions. I hope that the relevant authorities will consider and deal with them.

### Additional Fees Levied on Parcels Sent to Japan

The Shanghai Postal Management Bureau has issued a notice to collect special surcharges for parcels sent to Japan. Starting from March 1 of this year, all parcels sent to Japan and its territories, regardless of the amount of electricity, will be subject to a special surcharge of 4 yuan and 50 cents per piece. The total amount of the current parcel rate and the special surcharge is as follows:

Not exceeding one kilogram: 7 yuan (i.e., 2 yuan and 50 cents plus 4 yuan and 50 cents). Exceeding one kilogram but not exceeding two kilograms: 7 yuan and 90 cents (i.e., 3 yuan and 40 cents plus 4 yuan and 50 cents). Exceeding two kilograms but not exceeding four kilograms: 9 yuan and 50 cents (i.e., 5 yuan plus 4 yuan and 50 cents). Exceeding four kilograms but not exceeding six kilograms: 11 yuan and 20 cents (i.e., 6 yuan and 70 cents plus 4 yuan and 50 cents), temporarily suspended for posting. Exceeding six kilograms but not exceeding eight kilograms: 12 yuan and 90 cents (i.e., 8 yuan and 40 cents plus 4 yuan and 50 cents), temporarily posting. Exceeding eight kilograms but not exceeding ten kilograms: 14 yuan and 50 cents (i.e., 10 yuan plus 4 yuan and 50 cents), temporarily suspended for posting. Sports

### Today's Public Basketball Games: China United vs. Union
### Yesterday's Games: Central North vs. East China

The All-Shanghai Public Basketball Tournament continues tonight at 6:00 PM at the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Gymnasium with four matches. In the Group B division, Robust will face Linglong, and China Storage will battle the Blue Team. In Group A, the doubleheader begins at 7:30 PM with China United versus Union, a battle between rivals. China United is the Group A champion of the Western Youth League, boasting five tigers: Kong Guangyi, Qu Xilin, Zhang Liangxiong, Zhang Jinye, and Wu Chengzhang. Although Union has fierce generals like Xu Jusheng, it will be difficult to blunt the edge of their elder brother. The other Group A match features Monocle against Chen You. Although Chen You is a local powerhouse at the Youth Gymnasium, their chances of victory are slim. In yesterday evening's opening Group A match, Central North faced Real China, and the game was full of highlights. In the first half, East China trailed by twelve to twenty-eight. Ultimately, Central North won with a score of fifty-six to twenty-nine. In the final match, Ren Yu played against Union Friends. Although Zhang Shaoxiang and Zhang Jiakui of Ren Yu did not play, their skills were still a cut above, easily defeating Union Friends with a score of twenty-nine to eleven.

Yesterday's results: French Business defeated China Film B (B4) 21-18, Three United defeated Chengfu (B1) 24-20, Central North defeated East China (A1) 56-29, Ren Yu defeated Union Friends (A2) 29-11.

Today's schedule: Robust vs. Linglong (B2) at 6:00 PM, China Storage vs. Blue Team (B3) at 6:45 PM, China United vs. Union (Group A) at 7:30 PM, Monocle vs. Chen You (Group A) at 8:30 PM.

### Sino-Western Small Soccer Match: White Lions Defeat Allied Forces

2-1 Tense Situation

The White Lions small soccer team, recently organized and established, was originally scheduled to go to Wuxian, but the local organizers in Suzhou were not prepared in time, so it was temporarily canceled. To hone their skills, the team played against the Sino-Western Allied Forces yesterday at the Tongle Stadium. The audience numbered over four thousand, creating a lively atmosphere. After a twenty-minute stalemate, Feng Dunxiang took a free kick, delivering a powerful shot. Fei Chunhua was perfectly positioned and broke the deadlock. The White Lions led 1-0 in the first half. After the break, the Allied Forces tried to retaliate, but the White Lions' defense was solid, making it difficult to advance. Fei Chunhua returned, scoring a second goal. With the Allied Forces losing two goals in a row, the game became more intense. White Lion Feng Dunxiang, eager to save the ball, crashed into Bao Jie in the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick. Jin Lusheng of the Allied Forces took the penalty and scored. In the end, the White Lions defeated the Sino-Western Allied Forces 2-1, achieving a successful start.

White Lions: Zhou Jiangchao, Zhi Xuwenkui, Feng Dunxiang, Qu Yongfu, Gao Baozheng, Fei Chunhua

### Another Failed Operation in Burma: British and Americans Unable to Counterattack

Statement by the Japanese Army Press Department Spokesman

The spokesman for the Japanese Army Press Department in Shanghai announced the latest situation in Burma and the future development of the Burmese campaign, as well as an analysis of the anti-Axis counteroffensive capabilities, at the routine press conference yesterday (8th). Details are as follows: The Burmese Campaign is Divided into Three Areas

The Burmese campaign area is divided into three sections: Arakan, Kaladan, and the Hukawng Valley. In the Arakan sector, the anti-Axis forces, the British-Indian 7th and 5th Divisions, were subjected to fierce attacks by the Japanese army. The British-Indian 7th Division has been completely annihilated, and two-thirds of the 5th Division has been eliminated. The results of this battle include 7,000 enemy corpses left behind, of which 3,000 were British soldiers, 600 prisoners, and captured war trophies including 92 artillery pieces, 600 tanks and trucks, and 62 aircraft shot down. The strength of a British-Indian division is estimated at 22,000, so judging from the enemy's manpower losses, it is clear that the enemy has suffered considerable damage. Not only in terms of manpower, but also in terms of material resources, the enemy is about to be completely eliminated. Therefore, in the Arakan campaign, the enemy's failure is evident, and the Japanese army has achieved absolute victory. The Kaladan battle situation: a brigade of indigenous West African troops advanced southward along the riverbank. The Japanese army gave them a head-on blow. The Hukawng Valley area of northern Burma: the Japanese army is facing the Nationalist Expeditionary Force in Burma across the Tarong River. Recently, the Nationalist army, fearing the Japanese advance, has built solid defensive positions in the Cangjiang area within India, attempting to transfer the main Nationalist forces to the north bank of the Tarong River. In the Myitkyina area north of Lashio in Yunnan-Burma, the Japanese army is preparing to launch an annihilation battle against the enemy there, and has adopted an active offensive. Battle is imminent. In the above-mentioned three areas of operation, the enemy's forces were all isolated battles, without any connection, and the situation is already unfavorable.

British Troops Fearful, Criticized by Americans and Nationalists

The Japanese spokesman continued to analyze the extent of the development of the Burmese campaign, first citing the contents of recent foreign telegrams, saying: "In the second Arakan campaign, British Prime Minister Churchill sent a telegram of congratulations to Lord Mountbatten, the person in charge of Southeast Asia Command." The spokesman then analyzed this situation, saying that the enemy, suffering annihilation, feared shaking public morale. For the sake of stability and cover-up, this kind of pretense to East Asia and Japan is not only not surprising, but also no different from the situation at Dunkirk. Therefore, this tactic of covering up the facts has caused dissatisfaction from both the Americans and the Nationalists. Furthermore, according to a Washington dispatch on the 5th, well-informed American sources believe that the current India-Burma war is nothing more than a defensive war, and its intention is to coldly dismiss Churchill's congratulatory telegram, considering it a joke. Furthermore, according to a dispatch from the United Press correspondent in Chongqing, Nationalist newspapers pointed out that the failure of the India-Burma campaign was due to the conflicting operational opinions of Stilwell and Mountbatten. Furthermore, according to a Western newspaper published in Chongqing on the 6th, it was actually the British who feared the Japanese army, and Mountbatten insisted on waiting for the arrival of assistance from the fleet before launching operations, so the Americans expressed deep dissatisfaction.

Counterattack Against Japan Difficult to Achieve

The Japanese spokesman also said that recently, Nationalist Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, in his report on the military situation at the Nationalist Executive Yuan meeting, boasted that a major offensive would be launched against Japan on the Yunnan-Burma border in early March. We believe that this is absolutely impossible, because the rainy season will soon arrive in Burma, and it will be difficult for the Nationalists to counterattack this year. Also, regarding the proposal by Nimitz, MacArthur, and Sinor to use the Nationalist mainland as a base for attacking Japan, although recent observations show that they have a tendency to prepare for action, it is still difficult to become a reality. In short, in order to use the Nationalist mainland as a base for a counterattack against Japan, Burma must first be recaptured. At the same time, Nimitz and MacArthur's other proposal to first break through the central Pacific and then use the Nationalist mainland as a base is nothing short of a pie in the sky, and if it is to be implemented, it will take a long time. Looking back at the Russo-Japanese War and the Baltic Sea campaign, and based on the current situation, an anti-Axis counterattack is practically impossible. The Japanese spokesman then pointed to an interesting story published by Warren Atherton, the commander of the American soldiers who participated in the first European War, saying that based on the current ratio, if the American army were to attack Japan, it would have to prepare 3 million troops. Secondly, he referred to the recent statement by British Aircraft Production Minister Stafford Cripps, saying that the attack on Japan was a very distant goal, and that in order to push back the Japanese army, which currently occupies a large territory, even more effort must be made. From this, it is clear that the anti-Axis powers cannot launch a counterattack against Japan, and the opinions of the British and Americans themselves are also different.

Nationalist-Communist Conflicts Cannot Be Resolved

According to British newspapers, at the last Cairo Conference, Chiang Kai-shek of the Nationalist government recounted many of the difficulties faced by the Nationalist side, including the need to resolve the Communist issue within the Nationalist government before the Nationalist mainland could be used as a base for a counterattack against Japan. The opinions of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang were unanimous. At the same time, Chiang explained the strength of the Nationalist Communist Party, saying that the Nationalist Communist Party had 400,000 members entrenched, who ostensibly claimed to be conducting guerrilla warfare, but in reality provided no assistance to the Nationalist government and disrupted the rear on the periphery. Chiang also said that if the Communist forces still exist after the end of the European and Asian wars, China will suffer even greater danger. The Japanese spokesman then explained that, from this point of view, it is undoubtedly difficult to use the Nationalist mainland as a base for attacking Japan. Furthermore, Chiang's resolution of the Communist issue is useless. Recent reports of the breakdown of Nationalist-Communist negotiations, even if there is a possibility of further negotiations, may be difficult to resolve. Moreover, the Nationalist and Communist forces recently engaged in fierce fighting in eastern Zhejiang Province.

### In this Festive Season, Set Aside Gambling Money to Help Students: Mr. Huang Yuzhai First to Propose

Mr. Huang Yuzhai sent a letter yesterday stating: "In recent years, gambling has been rampant in Shanghai. During New Year celebrations and weekends, the sound of mahjong tiles can be heard in many households. Some even sink into gambling dens, lingering and forgetting to return home, resulting in empty pockets and heavy debts, and even losing their homes. At a time when war is raging and disasters are looming, it is disheartening to see such a decline in morals and such a failure to wake up. I have never been involved in gambling myself. Although many guests gather during the New Year, after tea and wine, we only engage in pleasant conversations. If friends invite me to play a game, I politely decline. I once suggested to friends that they set aside some of their gambling money during this festive season, treating it as if they had already lost it, and use it to help with relief efforts and student loans. The recipients would be grateful forever, and the donors would not have wasted their money, and could find solace in their hearts at night. Therefore, without considering my own insignificance, I am the first to propose this. I have raised a total of 50,000 yuan in national currency. In addition to donating 10,000 yuan each to the Renji Hospital, the Zheshao Hospital, the Shaoxing Middle School, and the Xinpu Yutang, I am now sending a bank draft from the head office of the Bank of China for 10,000 yuan in national currency, to be donated to your newspaper's student loan fund. I sincerely hope that people in society will take my humble suggestion and try to emulate it, helping students and nurturing talent. This will benefit the country and society, and I will be forever grateful."

### Mr. Yu Gongzi Wuyu: Funeral Donations Help Charity

Mr. Yu Zhongnan's son, Runfu, was a top student at St. John's University. He was a young man who loved learning and excelled in his studies. However, due to excessive studying, his health declined, and he died of a heart attack at the age of only twenty-three. Today (the 9th) is the day of Wuyu (fifth seven days after death). St. John's classmates gathered at Mr. Yu's residence at 12 Molly Avenue to express their condolences. They requested that all donations be converted into cash so that they could be donated to a charitable fund in his memory.

### Ding Fubao Donates Funds to the Pure Karma Society

Mr. Ding Fubao of Wuxi is over seventy years old and has been a vegetarian Buddhist for more than forty years. In addition to his medical skills, he has written extensively. He has donated all of the 10,000 yuan in savings certificates he received from the New Shen Daily News cultural award to the Wuxi Pure Karma Society's life release fund, and plans to gradually expand it to prevent harm to cattle, sheep, pigs, and chickens, using the principles of mutual aid and mutual love to destroy the fallacies of the survival of the fittest. It is hoped that all sectors of society will respond to this initiative and create more good karma.

### Pushan Villa: Regular Broadcasts to Raise Funds

Pushan Villa was founded in the second year of the Republic of China by Mr. Wang Junsheng and his colleagues, who raised funds to establish it. It specializes in collecting unclaimed coffins of travelers and abandoned corpses of children. For those who died without being buried, it also provides coffins. Later, houses were built on Shanshan Road in Zhabei, and in the ninth year of the Republic, Pushan Hospital was established to provide medical care and medicine to the poor. Subsequently, a head office was established on Beihai Road, and branch offices were established in the Pudong districts of the South City. Since its establishment, it has collected 771,379 large and small corpses, and distributed 267,014 large and small coffins. Currently, materials and labor costs are unusually expensive, especially the wood required for coffins. Before the war, it was only five or six yuan, but now it has increased more than 200 times. The villa has no dedicated funds and has to ask artists from the entertainment industry to perform on the radio to raise funds. It will be held at the French radio station on March 15th and 16th, starting at 2:00 PM. The fundraising target is 500,000 yuan. It is hoped that philanthropists from all walks of life will donate generously and support this cause.

### Lost and Found

A valuable wristwatch has been found, with the back cover falling off. The owner is requested to come to this office in person within one week with a guarantor to claim it. After the deadline, it will be sold to raise money for student loans. The Union National Grand Theater recently found a large sum of cash in the theater. The owner should go to the theater's office to report the amount and the date and time of the loss, and bring a guarantor to claim it, with a deadline of one week. After the deadline, the money will be donated to charity.

### Commemorating Women's Day: Launching the Women's Light Society to Promote Women's Welfare

The social service department of this newspaper convened female doctors, teachers, artists, and others, including Zhou Shuliang, Liu Baizhi, Zheng Xufan, Li Qinglian, Huang Guifang, Ye Taihua, Hu Weiqing, Fang Jinying, and Yu Xiangmei, yesterday, March 8th, Women's Day, to discuss the issue of women's responsibility. They believe that women should serve the people together with men and enhance the strength of the people. The mobilization of women during wartime is a temporary phenomenon, but it is obvious that it is no longer sufficient for women to only seek to be good wives and mothers. Due to the experience of today's war, whether for the country or for the family, it is inevitable that women must step out of the kitchen or at least not remain permanently confined within the family in the future. Before marriage and after their children have grown up, women have considerable time to serve society. The country will suddenly increase such human resources, which will also increase wealth. This is most needed in China, which has long suffered from poverty. Since women are members of the nation, they can naturally exert the power of their one member and fulfill the responsibility of their one member. The Women's Light Society was launched on the spot, with the aim of promoting women's welfare, starting with assistance to out-of-school girls, vocational guidance, production education, domestic research, relief for the poor and sick, and legal protection.

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang

Wind and Waves (5)

Naval academy vacations are famously short, and soon Masato had to prepare to return to school.

Although this short vacation felt like it had loosened all the muscles in his body, he actually hoped to return to Etajima sooner. Also, his mother was healthier than he had imagined, and thanks to Shikogoro's hard work, the store was doing well. His older brother was in Tokyo, and his second brother, Shin'ichiro, was working in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, strengthening the foundation of the family. Therefore, Masato did not need to worry about his hometown.

The only thing he couldn't let go of was the matter of his good friend, Takao.

Afterwards, he visited the Mukota family several times, but never met Takao. With tears in her eyes, his mother told him: "He's been acting like he's gone mad. He doesn't talk to anyone in the family. He doesn't eat much either— It's really too pessimistic." But Masato had no words of comfort to offer.

Honestly, when we think of the pain in Takao's heart, there's no reason why Takao wouldn't go mad. Since elementary school, he had dreamed of the "Navy" like that. And after failing last year, he hadn't abandoned his dream of the military branch, still relying on this ray of hope in the business branch. But even this last hope was cut off, so it's no wonder he's gone mad. Why is fate so cruel to Takao alone? Takao was the first to aspire to the Navy. He, who was originally going to be a banker, became a naval student, while Takao, who so longed for the "Navy," was plunged into the abyss of despair——

(Fate is a terrible thing!) When Masato was alone, thinking of Takao's situation, he wiped away tears with his own hand.

The day before returning to school, on the way back from visiting the Tōgō cemetery and the Nanzhou Shrine, he visited the personnel section chief's office at the city hall, seeking Takao's father. Because he couldn't see Takao, he had no choice but to see his father.

"Oh! —Thank goodness, he seems to be a little calmer."

Hearing these words, Masato was overjoyed. According to his father, Takao had asked his father to go to the Kirishima hot springs to recuperate his broken body and mind.

"If he can rest for a month, he should be able to recover from this shock."

Masato knew that the wounds suffered by friends and family could not be easily healed, but he could only pray that the air of the quiet Kirishima mountains would give Takao a starting point for reflection and hope. The fact that he himself had proposed this condition also proved that his despair had exceeded its extreme.

"The pneumonia he had as a child, I never thought it would still be bothering him now,"

Takao's father said as he saw Masato out.

(6)

Masato got off the train at Miyajima Station, gathered at the place designated by the school, and returned to school with many classmates on the school's motorboat.

At the moment he saw Mount Furataka, the mooring training ship, and the appearance of the student hall, he felt tension in his body, and the worries or joys of the so-called "secular world" had flown away to who knows where.

From the next day, that spirited and disciplined life began again. In mid-September, it was still the summer curriculum, but the calm sea of Etajima was becoming increasingly deep blue, and the cold water bath in the early morning sometimes felt chilling to the heart. However, the scenery on the excessively beautiful island, although autumn was about to arrive, was not outwardly visible.

Masato and the others had already completed one semester, so they were no longer new fourth-year students. The salutes to the instructors and upperclassmen were also done almost reflexively. Terms such as "you" and "I" were also used very naturally. And hearing that an excursion to Mount Misen and Haramura would be held during the autumn semester particularly aroused their interest.

Starting from the new semester, Masato especially worked hard on his judo studies. Because he had been most proficient in judo since middle school, he hoped to achieve something in the future, at least to obtain the first dan before graduation. The dojo at the naval academy was very large, both in judo and swordsmanship, so the students boasted that it was "the best in the world." The intensity of the training there was probably also the best in the world. It was not something that could be imagined by terms such as doing homework, but had a spirit of dying for it. Among them, Masato's seriousness was special. The judo instructor at the time, Usabuchi, a seventh dan who had been hired from Kodokan, still remembered the situation at the time. It is said that Masato always chose opponents who were better than himself, and his attitude towards teaching was also very active.
