### The Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announced Yesterday the War Results of the Kamikaze Attack Squad: Sunk and Destroyed 27 Enemy Aircraft Carriers, Battleships, Cruisers, Etc.

Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on October 31st: (1) Since October 25th, the Kamikaze Special Attack Squadron has continuously and fiercely attacked the enemy mobile units and transport convoys in the eastern waters of the Philippines (including Leyte Gulf). The confirmed war results of the squadron are as follows: Sunk 3 enemy aircraft carriers, 1 cruiser, 1 transport ship; Destroyed 6 enemy aircraft carriers, 2 battleships, 2 cruisers, 1 transport ship, and 3 ships of unknown type. (2) According to subsequent reports, the war results previously announced (the naval battle in the Philippine Sea) should be supplemented as follows: Sunk 1 enemy cruiser, 2 destroyers; Destroyed 2 enemy aircraft carriers, 3 cruisers or destroyers.

Philippine Base, 31st (Central News Agency) – At noon on the 29th, the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Squadron attacked a powerful enemy mobile unit consisting of 4 aircraft carriers (3 of which were large ships), 2 to 4 battleships, and more than 10 other ships in the eastern waters of Lamon Bay. It was confirmed that a large enemy aircraft carrier was hit and caught fire in the rear and ran aground. Subsequent Kamikaze aircraft dropped bombs, also hitting 2 ships of unknown type and 1 cruiser, all of which caught fire.

Japanese Base in the Philippines, 31st (Central News Agency) – At around 6:00 PM on the 27th, the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Squadron fiercely attacked Leyte Gulf, launching a heroic collision attack on the docked enemy ships. The first aircraft hit the rear of an enemy battleship, causing heavy damage. The second aircraft hit an enemy cruiser, causing heavy damage. The third aircraft was unfortunately hit by enemy fire during the attack, but it continued undeterred and crashed into the stern of a large enemy transport ship.

Central News Agency Dispatch – Allied Japanese naval military experts in Shanghai stated in a talk yesterday: "We are deeply encouraged by the brave and decisive war results of the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Squadron announced by the Imperial Headquarters at 4:30 PM on the 31st. The war results achieved by the Kamikaze Special Attack Squadron this time include sinking 9 enemy aircraft carriers and 19 other battleships, etc. President Roosevelt devised various means to achieve his presidential election, but the results were just the opposite. His warships were all sunk. There are still a few enemy small boats in Leyte Gulf, but these enemy boats will soon be annihilated by Japan. In particular, we must understand that the average age of the members of the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Squadron is between 20 and 23. They joined the air force before graduating from middle school and underwent many intense trainings. Their thoughts and beliefs are solely focused on destroying the enemy British and Americans. In the past, many people said that if these young people could participate in frontline operations, the war situation would definitely change. This has now been realized in the Greater East Asia War. These young people have a very bright and innocent life in peacetime. They only know how to move forward towards their goals, but they also often miss their parents at home. This is what is called young people who are both loyal and filial. In the past, we could imagine that the Special Attack Squadron must have very excellent machinery, because it is really difficult to sink everything of the enemy with one aircraft, no matter how brave one is. From this, we can imagine that the Special Attack Squadron must have good opportunities. We are now waiting for the enemy's general counter-attack and decisive battle. We have 500,000 brave young people every year. Even if the enemy launches all small aircraft and boats, we must have the final preparation, so the enemy's post-war management strategies have been completely defeated by us."

### Japanese Torpedo Attack Squadron Heavily Damaged Enemy Convoy; Fierce Fighting Continues on Peleliu Island

Japanese Base in the Central Pacific, 31st (Central News Agency) – More than ten torpedo boats belonging to a certain Japanese torpedo boat squadron, led by Navy Captain Akira Hirai, took advantage of a rainy and dark night to launch a surprise attack on the enemy transport convoy in the eastern waters of Peleliu Island from Palau Island.

Editorial

### The Nantong Maru Tragedy

It has only been ten months since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Huatai Wheel was wrecked in the Xin'gang River on December 9th of last year, and now, on the 23rd of last month, the company's Nantong Maru suffered a tragedy near Hupu. According to what this newspaper has revealed, the severity of this incident is equal to the Huatai Wheel incident last time. As for the cause of the accident, it is probably still nothing more than the "single gangs" crowding and overloading the ship, the situation before and after being exactly the same. The Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau is investigating the truth of the accident (see this newspaper's local news column on the 28th of last month) and has not yet announced anything. However, the vice president of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company stated to a Central News Agency reporter (see this newspaper's local news column on the 27th of last month) that "The loss of the Nantong Wheel is not only a loss to the company but also a loss to both China and Japan... The company dispatched A-class reserve officer Tomi Daiyuki on the evening of the 26th, along with rescued crew members, to the scene of the accident to investigate and salvage." Before the truth investigated by the Navigation Administration Bureau and the report investigated by the company are disclosed, we would like to make a general statement first.

(1) Since the implementation of material control, distribution has never been on track, and prices have never been suppressed. As a result, the deformed "single gang" class is also becoming increasingly prevalent. Regardless of its impact on the economy, just looking at the disruption of order in the transportation sector, there are already significant phenomena in railways and ships. The two tragedies that have occurred at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are mainly due to the crowding of "single gangs." Therefore, to restore transportation order, we must first facilitate the exchange of materials, and then seek reasonable distribution and stable prices. Then, the "single gangs" will naturally disappear. Therefore, the material control authorities should bear indirect responsibility for the current abnormality in traffic volume and the continuous occurrence of tragedies.

(2) The navigation administration agencies were originally established to supervise navigation, ensure safety, and promote shipping. The inspection of the structure and machinery of each ship, as well as the restriction of cargo weight, are all the responsibilities of the Navigation Administration Bureau. After the Huatai Wheel accident, it still did not know how to reflect and repent, strengthen the exercise of its own powers, and in less than a year, disasters occurred repeatedly. Therefore, the personnel in charge of navigation administration ignored the lives of the people and abandoned their duties, and there is no way to shirk their deserved guilt.

(3) The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is the agency that directly manages the ships. After the Huatai Wheel accident, it should have been vigilant and strengthened rectification to prevent similar incidents from happening continuously. Not only did it not plan for this, but it did not plan for rainy days. It was only on the third day after the Nantong Maru tragedy that it sent personnel to investigate and salvage. It can be seen that the company usually has no safe measures, and it has no ability to save in an emergency. The vice president of the company said that this is not only a loss to the company but also a loss to both China and Japan, which can be called "generous words"! The China Railway Corporation cannot give people a good review, and China Merchants Steam Navigation is so negligent. We cannot help but feel sorry for the public utilities jointly run by China and Japan.

(4) After an unfortunate incident has occurred, there is no way to regret it. However, we must thoroughly investigate the responsibility, rather kill one to warn a hundred to prevent future disasters, and we must never perfunctorily and indulge the atmosphere of negligence. After the Huatai Wheel accident, the issue of responsibility was not clarified, so soon after, the Nantong Maru tragedy followed. We deeply hope that the so-called "investigation of the truth of the accident" by the Navigation Administration Bureau and the so-called "dispatch of personnel to the scene of the accident for investigation" by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will soon have details announced, and decisive measures will be implemented based on the facts. If they still deceive each other up and down and act perfunctorily, then the Nantong Maru is a continuation of the Huatai, and we do not know when and where who will be the continuation of the Nantong Maru!

When the moon is encircled by a halo, there will be wind; when the plinth is damp, there will be rain. If the government abandons its duties and the agencies do not take responsibility, then the unfortunate events of ships are also the inevitable result of things. We hope that the relevant parties will know the warning of treading on frost and ice, and be careful!

### The First Anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Treaty; Chairman Wang's Address; Hope is in Sight, Strive Forward

The Cornerstone of Sino-Japanese Peace

The significance of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was clearly pointed out at the time of its conclusion last year today. At that time, I once said: "China and Japan have had national and ethnic relations for more than two thousand years, but this is the first time that a treaty that completely based on the spirit of Eastern morality has been used to stipulate friendly relations between the two countries." (Omission) I also said, "The decision to revise the treaty was proposed by the Japanese government, and even the draft of the alliance treaty and the attached exchange of notes was proposed by the Japanese government, which abandoned the privileges obtained by the Japanese side during the last treaty and did not retain them at all. At the same time, all the points that China was worried about were thoroughly eliminated." This was entirely out of the good intentions of the Japanese government and people, for the sake of the permanent friendship between China and Japan, for the sake of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, based on the spirit of morality and the feelings of compatriots, to put forward such a bright and upright proposition, to give China the strength of resurrection assistance, to lay the cornerstone of permanent friendship between China and Japan, and to open up a road to peace that conforms to justice for East Asia.

The Security of the Two Countries is Interrelated

In short, after decades of disputes, China and Japan finally staged an unfortunate incident. It was also in the bloody lessons of the unfortunate incident that China and Japan came to know and understand each other. In the past, because the causes of these disputes could not be recognized and understood, resentment became increasingly deep. It was only the war in recent years that made China know that it could never defeat Japan, nor should it abandon Japan, and think that it could survive on its own. Japan also realized that it could never destroy China, nor should it ignore China, and think that it could flourish alone. Moreover, both China and Japan know that these disputes are the result of the manipulation of British and American imperialists, and at the same time, they are the gaps provoked by British and American imperialists. This is exactly in line with the late Father's legacy in the question of China's survival, "The relationship between Japan and China is related to the survival and security of the two countries. Without Japan, there is no China; without China, there is no Japan. In order to seek the peace of the two countries for a hundred years, there must be no discord between them." Looking back now, the late Father's foresight had already seen the situation between China and Japan.

After the National Government returned to its capital, it first concluded the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty as the first bridgehead for Sino-Japanese peace. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, China resolutely joined the war, sharing the heavy responsibility of defending East Asia with the determination to live and die together. The understanding and understanding between China and Japan has therefore become increasingly clear and thorough. As for Japan, with its greatest sincerity and cooperation, supporting China's recovery of concessions, abolition of extraterritoriality, and following this to the re-alliance and treaty signing last year today, that is, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, all the misunderstandings and estrangements that were the cause of past disputes were destroyed and cleared, and no longer exist. (Omission)

Seize the Opportunity to Temper and Strive

In the current total war, China's survival, and even East Asia's survival, is the responsibility on our shoulders. We should know that the conclusion of the Alliance Treaty is not easy to come by, and the complete realization of the Alliance Treaty is not accidental. It took countless efforts in the past, and it still takes sincere and practical efforts now. The late Father said, "Fulfill the obligations that civilized countries should fulfill in order to enjoy the rights that civilized countries should enjoy." The conclusion of the Alliance Treaty is that the allies treat us as a civilized country, and we should also treat ourselves as a civilized country. Moreover, we should fulfill the obligations that civilized countries should fulfill. Today, we can only base on the Alliance Treaty, on the one hand, strive to share the obligations of the allied war, and on the other hand, strive to promote the realization of peaceful unification. This (Omission)

Since the conclusion of the Alliance Treaty, I personally fell ill soon after, and I have not been able to make further efforts for the development after the conclusion of the Alliance Treaty. I have not been able to make a more active contribution to the completion of the Greater East Asia War, and I feel deeply guilty. However, I am convinced that the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty is the cornerstone of permanent friendship between China and Japan, and the completion of the Greater East Asia War is the only condition for the self-preservation and co-existence of all countries and nations in East Asia. I can only pray that all compatriots in the country seize the opportunity, temper and strive together. The allies are united in their hearts and minds, vowing to fight to the death, and are also looking forward to our cooperation. We must take out our enthusiasm and strength to fight together with our allies who share life and death. Compatriots, the light is right in front of us, let us advance! Advance! (To be continued)

In the future, in addition to ordering the distribution agencies to distribute and sell on time, they will also further consider the abundance of the distribution quantity. As for the price of rice and grain distribution, it has to be slightly increased due to the sharp increase in cost, but it should be maintained in the future and not increased again. (3) "Crackdown on Hoarding": First, investigate the inventory of each warehouse, which is being actively carried out in Shanghai. In addition, regarding the transportation problem, improvement measures have also been planned with the parties concerned this time, and they will be implemented soon.

### The Japanese Army Fought Bravely on the Front Lines in the Philippines, Inflicting Heavy Damage on the Enemy; Enemy Aircraft Remaining at the Base Were Almost Completely Destroyed

Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) – The land battle on Leyte Island is still fierce and not optimistic. The number of American transport ships in Leyte Gulf has increased to about 50 on the 28th, with a dozen cruisers and destroyers. On the 26th, the American army has begun to use the airfields in Tacloban and Dulag to transport many aircraft to cover the operation. On the 27th, the enemy's base force landed with another division in the southern area of Tacloban. Therefore, the enemy army in the area has two divisions. Counting the two divisions in Dulag, it has reached four divisions, launching a fierce counter-attack. The Japanese garrison fought bravely against the superior enemy forces, preventing their advance. At the same time, the Japanese air force was active all night, continuously attacking enemy airfields, shattering the enemy's attempt to use the airfields. On the night of the 28th, they raided the Dulag airfield, burned down two of its facilities, and destroyed the runway. They also attacked the Tacloban airfield, destroying its various facilities. On the 29th, they attacked the Dulag airfield again, destroying its runway. Another team of Japanese aircraft bombed two facilities near the Tacloban airfield, which were hit and caught fire. Regarding the situation of American aircraft attacking, although it was drastically reduced on the 24th and 25th, it increased again after the 27th. There were fewer on the 28th, and on the 29th, a total of 250 to 260 carrier-based aircraft attacked Manila and Clark three times. After being intercepted by the Japanese army, 27 of them were shot down. In the interception battle, some Japanese aircraft also did not return, but the land can be said to be undamaged. Overall, the decisive battle on Leyte Island has become increasingly fierce. In the future, the Japanese-American air decisive battle on Leyte Island and Leyte Gulf will determine the war situation of the two armies. Therefore, its trend depends on how the Japanese air force's power is replenished.

Manila, 31st (Central News Agency) – The enemy forces and their naval air carrier forces on Leyte Island have been severely attacked by the Japanese army and their numbers have been drastically reduced. In order to strengthen the strength of the area, the enemy sent many aircraft from New Guinea and Hawaii to the Philippines, and was eager to use the air bases on Leyte Island. On the 25th, they began to use the two airfields of Tacloban and Dulag. On the 26th, they concentrated about 70 aircraft, but they were attacked by the Japanese air force and almost completely destroyed. They are now engaged in replenishment work. According to reports from Japanese reconnaissance aircraft, in the afternoon of the 28th, there were dozens of aircraft parked at the Dulag airfield, and there were seven aircraft patrolling in the sky. However, at 9:00 AM on the 29th, there were only ten aircraft parked and one patrolling, which was much less than before, all of which were destroyed by Japanese aircraft bombing. In addition, the enemy is repairing the Sambaburo airfield, but it cannot be fully utilized due to the Japanese air attacks.

Manila, 31st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army air squadron launched three fierce attacks on enemy ships in Leyte Gulf on the 23rd, and achieved great results. In this attack, in addition to the war results announced a few days ago, it has been further confirmed that one seaplane tender was sunk.

Manila, 31st (Central News Agency) – The enemy forces landing on Leyte Island have blockaded Leyte Island from the sea in an attempt to prevent reinforcements from the Japanese army. At night, they made fast boats active in Leyte Gulf, the Camotes Sea west of Leyte Island, and the San Juanico Strait connecting Samar Island.

The Japanese army that entered the southern boundary of the West River has all crossed the Yu River and continued to take a fan-shaped attack to inflict a major blow on a part of the 64th Army of the Chongqing side on the front line.

Japanese Army Base on the Front Line in South China, 31st (Central News Agency) – It is rumored that the Chongqing military authorities have now transferred a part of the tank team belonging to the Fifth Army Group stationed in Kunming to the Guangxi front line and deployed it in the southern areas of Liuzhou and Guilin for defense.

### Various Groups Are Preparing to Celebrate; Joint Declaration Commemorates; Expanded Publicity Will Be Held Continuously for Several Days

The anniversary of the Greater East Asia Declaration falls on the 6th of this month. All sectors of the city will have grand celebrations to commemorate it. This important event in East Asian history. It is recently learned that the Shanghai Special City Corps of Chinese Youth and Teenagers and the Fourth Detachment of the Chinese Youth Model Corps will, since the 8th of this month is the anniversary of the Defense of East Asia and the 9th is the anniversary of Participation in the War, jointly organize the City Party Headquarters, the New Movement Branch, the Chinese Youth Branch School, and the Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League, etc., to hold continuous expanded publicity for these several days.

### Well Water Must Be Boiled Before Drinking; Landlords Prevent Epidemics to Protect Health

Recently, due to the lack of fuel, the city's tap water company had no choice but to reduce the water pressure and limit its usage, which caused inconvenience to the general public, and they dug wells to draw water. The most appropriate method is to open a "deep well" and use a motor to pump up the water from hundreds of feet deep underground for application, but due to material and electricity relations, they generally use soil wells to make up for it. However, the depth of soil wells varies from ten feet to twenty feet, which is the underground water closest to the topsoil. That is, the moisture that gradually decreases from the well surface, so it contains solid impurities. This solid is heavier than water and is suspended by vibrations in the water. When the water is still, after a considerable time, the solid settles, and gradually clears. This is the phenomenon of turbidity and clarity that we see when we draw water. It is common to use alum or soda ash as a coagulant to make it precipitate, but the water after the impurities have settled looks clean, but in fact it contains a lot of E. coli and other microorganisms. If citizens use this well water as drinking water, then the danger is really avoidable. The city's health bureau protects the health of citizens and prevents the occurrence of epidemics. It once initially banned it, but had to temporarily allow it in order to take care of the environment, but do not use this water as drinking water. If you have to, you must thoroughly boil it. It is about personal health, and I hope citizens pay attention.

### Traffic Safety Campaign, Last Day Today

The Municipal Police Department's "Traffic Safety Week" organized by the Municipal Police Department is today the last day. The past results are fairly satisfactory. Director Lü Qi of the Administrative Office, accompanied by the Deputy Director and the Chief of the Traffic Section, inspected various locations the day before yesterday. Deficiencies at locations such as the intersection of Great Shanghai Road and Tibet Road have been rectified since yesterday. Today, attention will be paid to the general knowledge of drivers. The main points are as follows: (1) A moment's negligence can lead to immense disaster. (2) Instead of impatiently using the horn, it is better to drive humbly and slowly. (3) Do not smoke or chat with others while driving. (4) After an air raid alarm is issued, immediately turn off the lights and park the vehicle on the side of the road. (5) Regularly inspect the mechanical parts to ensure the brakes are in good condition. At night, check the vehicle lights' air defense equipment to ensure they meet the standards. Letting others pass is the greatest public service for a driver, while boasting is the only cause of accidents. (7) Remember "green light go, red light stop". Although the matter is simple, all accidents arise from carelessness and neglect. (8) Drivers must be agile in limbs, calm in mind, and have keen eyesight and hearing.

### Municipal Advisory Council, Planning Winter Relief

### Today's Tianjin

--Wu Gong

Tianjin is the leading international city in North China. Previously, there were concessions of many countries: such as Japan, Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Austria, Russia, and Belgium. However, since the takeover of the Italian concession this year, these different concessions have been completely eliminated. This good phenomenon of municipal unity is the one impression I have after coming to Tianjin this time.

A Fresh Start After the Concession Takeover

According to Mayor Zhang, except for the concessions of Russia, Austria, Germany, and Belgium, which were returned to our country before the incident, others, such as the British concession, were decisively taken over militarily by the troops of Commander-in-Chief Yamaoka when the Greater East Asia War broke out. Therefore, it was initially called the Special District. Later, in order to respect our country's sovereignty, the Allied Powers officially transferred it to our country on February 18, 1942, and established a special administrative region. When the Japanese concession was returned following our country's declaration of war against Britain and the United States on January 9 last year, it became the Xingya First District and Second District together with the above-mentioned special administrative region. Later, the French concession was also successively returned, and the Yaxia Third District was set up. Before and after the return of the Italian concession, another special management district was set up. This division of administrative regions was originally a temporary expedient. Including the original twelve districts, Tianjin City was divided into sixteen districts. It was not until April 1 this year that the urban area was re-divided, and today it is only distinguished into eight districts. The original road names have been completely changed. Generally, the former French concession is called Zhongjing, Zhongwei, and Xikai Roads; the former Italian concession is called Hedong Roads; the former Austrian concession is called Jintang Roads; and the former British concession is called Nanjing or Nanwei Roads. As for the police stations, they are divided into twelve sub-bureaus. Except for the first, sixth, eighth, and seventh districts, which have two sub-bureaus each, the remaining districts have one sub-bureau each. In addition, the Public Works Bureau, the Tax Collection Office, and the Health Office all have branch offices set up according to each district.

The Unification of Municipal Administration

Tianjin's municipal administration has thus embarked on a path of unification, which of course cannot but be attributed to the assistance of the Allied Powers. Especially after the return of the various concessions, except for the original personnel of the French concession who remained in office due to treaty relations, all others left their posts. Therefore, today's Tianjin City can be said to be a completely independent and autonomous city of our country, and we have high expectations for it. In particular, this situation is very worthy of reference for people from Shanghai, because in today's Tianjin Municipal Government or Police Bureau, there is simply not a single foreign official. The Allied Powers, except for one advisor and four assistant advisors in the Municipal Government (one stationed in the Police Bureau, one in the Finance Bureau, and the other two stationed in other bureaus), and one to two commissioners in each bureau, simply do not interfere in our country's municipal administration. The so-called commissioners are only liaison officers, and the advisors do indeed only have a consultative role!

The Tianjin Municipal Government organization has two offices under the mayor: the Secretariat and the Propaganda Office, and six bureaus: Social Affairs, Finance, Police, Education, Health, and Economy. As for each district, there is one district chief and two assistants, divided into four groups: General Affairs, Publicity and Guidance, Compilation and Training, and Rationing. The so-called compilation and training refers to the compilation and training of police defense groups (bao jia). According to Mayor Zhang, the general public rationing in Tianjin today can ideally be 20 catties of wheat flour or mixed grains per person per month. Major materials such as wheat are absolutely prohibited from being bought and sold privately during the annual purchase period, and can be freely bought and sold after the purchase period has passed.

Lagging Education and Rising Living Costs

In terms of education, Tianjin is clearly not as developed as Beijing. Today, they still only have 104 municipal elementary schools, while there are 153 private schools. There are three municipal middle schools for boys and two for girls, two municipal vocational schools, one municipal normal school, 22 private middle schools, three private vocational schools, and 22 private middle schools. There is only one university, the Catholic-run Business and Industry College. Of course, in Tianjin's population of 1.8 million, this number is extremely small. According to Mayor Zhang, they are currently negotiating with the central government to establish a university.

Affected by the widespread rise in prices, Tianjin's cost of living index is also rising monthly, and may be even more expensive than Beijing. However, it is cheaper to take a rickshaw or handcart here than in Beijing, and you don't have to bargain. You can pay whatever you want when you arrive at your destination, and the driver will never argue with you, which is a relatively pleasant thing. But the lives of the civil servants here are still extremely pitiful. The average salary is only about 2,000 yuan, which is indeed suffering in this era!
