### Japanese Kamikaze Units Destroy Two Enemy Cruisers; "Danshin" and Other Units Also Conduct Certain-Hit Attacks

Philippine Front, Japanese Forces, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Unit attacked enemy ships in the Mindanao Sea on the evening of the 13th, destroying two large cruisers and setting them on fire.

Philippine Base, Japanese Forces, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Following attacks by Japanese air units on enemy transport convoys moving south in the waters off Leyte and Bapao, on the dawn of the 12th, special attack units including one "Danshin" unit, one "Hakko" unit, and two "Sekicho" units, along with escort fighter and fighter plane units, departed from various bases. Upon reaching the airspace above the enemy convoy, they overcame the resistance of five P38-type patrol aircraft, 30 "Giant" fighters, and dozens of bombers, bravely carrying out certain-hit attacks. They sank two medium-sized enemy transport ships and one destroyer. One medium-sized transport ship and one destroyer were hit and caught fire. They also engaged enemy aircraft, shooting down one. In these engagements, six Japanese planes self-detonated, and three did not return (the special attack units are not included in this count). All of these were sacrifices made in the course of impact. The above results are only confirmed. Considering the fact that all Japanese planes visually confirmed hits and all planes not returning carried out impact attacks, the enemy's losses must be even greater.

Philippine Island Base, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the night of the 11th, Japanese naval air units destroyed five enemy destroyers navigating in the Camotes Sea. On the night of the 12th, they attacked the area near the enemy airfield in Tacloban, Leyte Island, destroying enemy facilities in many places, including one place where a large explosion occurred. On the afternoon of the 13th, they repeatedly attacked enemy forces near Bapao on the west coast of Leyte Island.

### "Moonlight" Fighter Planes Active Day and Night in Various Locations; Ten Enemy Planes Attacking the Japanese Mainland Shot Down or Damaged

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The new Japanese naval fighter "Moonlight" type aircraft is a twin-engine, high-performance fighter. These "Moonlight" type aircraft are actively engaged day and night on various fronts. At dawn on the 12th, Japanese Lieutenant Senior Grade Yukio Endo used a "Moonlight" type aircraft over Chiba Prefecture to intercept enemy B29 type aircraft, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Currently, the "Moonlight" type aircraft are also actively engaged in the skies over Kyushu and on various fronts.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Approximately eighty B29 type aircraft from enemy bases in the Mariana Islands attacked Aichi and Shizuoka Prefectures separately on the afternoon of the 13th. After being bravely intercepted by Japanese air defense units, it has been confirmed that two were shot down, and another eight sustained heavy damage. The Japanese air defense units suffered no damage in this engagement.

### A Certain Japanese Lieutenant General Discusses Enemy US Military Losses

Leyte Base, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A division of enemy troops that landed in Albuera, Leyte Island, on the 7th as reinforcements suffered extremely heavy personnel losses after a fierce attack by Japanese air units. In that operation, a certain Japanese lieutenant general, on a liaison mission, took advantage of the darkness to pass through enemy warships on a sailboat and landed near the enemy landing site. He later described the situation of the US military losses he witnessed at the time as follows: Because it was a rainy night, it was difficult to clearly see the enemy's situation. However, it was known that there were several enemy ships in Ormoc Bay, similar to supply ships, but most of these ships had been destroyed by Japanese air attacks and were unable to return. Furthermore, in the shallower areas of the bay, the stench of corpses from the enemy forces in the landing zone could be smelled, indicating that the enemy suffered significant personnel losses. The reason why the enemy is desperately sending reinforcements, regardless of the heavy sacrifices, is nothing more than an attempt to reverse the unfavorable war situation on the eastern side of Leyte.

The Skillful Operation of a Japanese Paratrooper Suicide Squad

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese army's airborne paratrooper unit, which made a sudden attack on various airfields on Leyte Island, achieved tremendous results. At the same time, they formed a suicide squad regardless of life, and their brave posture was enough to frighten the enemy. The United Press dispatch on the 11th described the situation of the Japanese paratrooper unit occupying Babapo, as told by a US officer who escaped the danger: When the Japanese paratrooper unit landed in Babapo, there were 34 US soldiers and Filipinos at the base. Only 12 people escaped by taking advantage of the situation, including seven pilots, one signalman, and seventeen other soldiers, all of whom are missing. The Japanese transport planes attacking the base totaled [unclear] planes. It was on the evening of the 6th. Due to visibility issues, the paratroopers' landing situation was not very clear. The Japanese army's landing operation was extremely skillful, silent and unnoticed. They landed in the wooded area around the airfield. The Japanese army began its attack at about 6:30 on the morning of the 7th. We were having breakfast in the dining hall when we suddenly saw Japanese troops crossing the rice fields and rushing forward. We immediately responded with automatic rifles, fighting and eating. The Japanese army occupied the dining hall. Afterwards, a chaotic battle broke out everywhere. I desperately wanted to escape and hide in the grass. After a while, I retreated from the grass and gradually escaped the dense forest area.

### US Announces War Results; Exaggerated and Absurd

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The enemy US side covering up its own huge losses and exaggerating the damage inflicted on the Japanese side in the Pacific War has been common since the beginning of the war. The Indian government's political news report criticized the United States for releasing false information and demanded the release of the true war results. The details are as follows: According to the Washington announcement on November 12, the comparison of Japanese and US losses in the Pacific War is as follows: The US lost 227 ships, and the Japanese side lost 7,480 ships, including 22 aircraft carriers and 118 battleships and cruisers. However, according to the Standard Naval Yearbook, Japan only had 15 aircraft carriers, 14 battleships, and 42 cruisers before the war. If the US announcement is to be believed, there is a strange phenomenon between Japan's holdings and losses. Furthermore, if the US announcement is to be believed, the majority of the Japanese navy has been lost, but it is impossible to explain how it can resist the overwhelming attack of the Allied forces today. The US side's absurd and exaggerated announcements have been repeatedly criticized by the Japanese side. From the above announcement, it can be seen that the American people are also unable to obtain true news.

### Japanese Major General Sanada Appointed Director of the Military Affairs Bureau

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese Army Ministry announced on the 14th: Army Major General Jyoichiro Sanada is appointed Director of the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau and concurrently Chief Secretary of the Board of Field Marshals and Fleet Admirals.

### Ambassador Cai Pei Returns to Post

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Chinese Ambassador to Japan Mr. Cai Pei visited Prime Minister Koiso at 10:30 a.m. on the 14th for a courtesy call after returning to his post.

### Powerful Japanese Forces Enter Qinzhou County, Guangdong Province; Crushing Enemy Attempts to Approach the Mainland

South China Front Base, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – After capturing Nanning, the Japanese army closely monitored the movements of the Chongqing army and used a portion of its forces to launch a final attack on the Chongqing army in the mountainous area northwest of Nanning, crushing the Chongqing army's attempt to recapture Nanning. One unit of the Japanese army advanced westward in one breath from the southern bank of the Lishui River and completed the meeting with the Japanese Annam Dispatch Army in Suilu on the 10th, thus completing the great undertaking of traversing the continent. Another powerful unit of the Japanese army continued to advance south along the Qinning Highway, eliminating the weak resistance of the Chongqing army everywhere, and finally entered Qinzhou County, Guangdong Province, at 0:30 p.m. on the 12th, completely occupying it. The Japanese army's capture of Qinzhou this time is because the US military is attempting to advance west through the Philippines to approach the mainland. The Japanese army's preemptive action to prevent this can further consolidate its defense posture, so it is of great significance.

Editorial

### Opening Up the Continental North-South Line

The Allied Vietnamese forces, which began advancing north from Liangshan Zhennanguan on November 28, successively captured the Guizhou Province border areas of Pingxiang, Mingjiang, Sile, and Longzhou. They met with the Allied Guangxi forces, which came down from Nanning on November 24, in Suilu, 70 kilometers southwest of Nanning on December 10. The continental north-south line, which has been planned for a long time and has always been feared by Chongqing, the US, and Britain, has finally been gradually opened up.

The significance and role of this continental north-south line's opening up for the Greater East Asia War and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in terms of politics, economy, and even culture are extremely significant. In addition to naval warfare, the Greater East Asia War's continental warfare has always been divided into two theaters: the Chinese mainland and the Southeast Asian landmass. Now that these two theaters have been merged into one, the Greater East Asia War will gain great convenience in terms of strategic deployment, troop deployment, and military supply management, regardless. In particular, because of this, continental warfare and naval warfare can be integrated into one, and the strategic significance is even greater.

Chongqing, the US, and Britain originally had the grand dream of cutting off the connection between the Allied forces in the Southeast Asian region and the Chinese mainland forces. They once attempted to defeat Japan simultaneously in the Pacific and on the Chinese mainland, and to isolate the Southeast Asian Allied forces in areas including India, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaya. The US naval and air force's fierce offensive in the Pacific and the US's increased efforts to support the Chongqing army in the Chinese mainland since the Battle of Hengyang were for this purpose.

However, the development of the situation was the opposite. The US military repeatedly suffered setbacks in the Pacific, and the Chongqing army on the Chinese mainland not only could not withstand the Allied forces' sharp offensive but also retreated steadily. Ultimately, it was unable to prevent the meeting of the northern and southern Allied forces.

The meeting of the northern and southern Allied forces and the opening of the continental north-south line increases the strategically advantageous position for the Allied forces and strikes a heavy blow to the enemy. First of all, the Allied forces' restraint in mainland China is weakened, and the US military's offensive in the Pacific will inevitably become more difficult. Moreover, because the northern and southern Allied forces have established contact and mutual support, the position of the British army on the India-Burma border is even more unfavorable. At the same time, as the Chinese mainland is divided into eastern and western parts by the Allied forces, the eastern Chongqing army is completely isolated, and the air bases used by the United States in the southeast as bases for air raids on Japan will also greatly lose their function. Furthermore, with the Allied forces' westward advance, Guiyang is in imminent danger, Kunming is in a difficult situation, and the supply line from India to Chongqing through Lingnan is also within the Allied forces' area of threat, so Chongqing cannot but become more isolated.

The military significance of the opening of the continental north-south line is as such. In addition, with the convenience of transportation, the exchange of materials between the north and south will inevitably expand in scope and increase in speed, which will greatly benefit the economic war in the Greater East Asia War and the economic construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. After the completion of the continental north-south railway line, which is in the planning stage and will soon be concretely implemented, transportation will inevitably become smoother, and the economic significance will be even greater.

In addition, with the connection of the north-south routes and the shortening of distances, the political and cultural integration of the countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will inevitably become closer, so this also has great political and cultural significance.

### North China National Army Actively Suppressing Communists

Beiping, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – China's North China National Defense Army has been constantly fighting alongside the Japanese North China Expeditionary Army, demonstrating the spirit of sharing life and death, and achieving brilliant results every day.

Furthermore, to suppress the Shandong bandit gang under Chen Guang, there is General Wu Huawen's Third Route Army, a former Northeast system general, and General Rong Ziheng's Tenth Army. Furthermore, General Zhang Lanfeng's Second Army Corps, which assisted the Japanese army in forming a special engineering team in the Henan Great Battle and established more great achievements, is engaged in mopping-up operations in the new battlefield in Henan and northern Anhui Province. Other units such as Lieutenant General Wen Li's Second Commando Column, Lieutenant General Li Yongnian's Coastal Special Guerrilla Force, and the Shandong Communist Suppression Army are also working together to encircle and repeatedly engage in decisive battles against the 129th Division under Liu Bocheng and the 115th Division under He Long, bandit groups under the Yan'an army.

### Germany Will Continue to Fight to Overcome Difficulties; Goebbels' Speech Encourages Workers

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Haitong News Agency: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels stated in a speech to workers in western Germany that the most important issue in Germany is the air war. It is expected that Germany will be able to overcome this problem, just like overcoming other problems during the war. This summer and autumn are the most difficult periods for Germany in this war. Although the enemy has used manpower and material resources on a large scale and intensified air raids on Germany, they have not been able to overcome German resistance. The loss of a large amount of land in recent months is truly heartbreaking, but the results are also beneficial to Germany, such as shortening transportation lines and making frontline supplies easier. In addition to hating Germany, the enemy's war aims are extremely divergent. Germany's war aims are extremely clear and simple. Germans all know that their lives are threatened, so we must now resolve to continue fighting and not have any thoughts of surrender.

War Situation on Various European Fronts

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The war situation on various European fronts is as follows: (1) On the Western Front, the outposts of the US Seventh Army are reported to have crossed the Rhine River. The center of the Western Front war situation is still in the Duren area east of Aachen and the Saar area in the upper reaches of the Rhine River. The US First Army east of Aachen, although encountering fierce resistance from the German army on the west bank of the Ruhr River, is still starting to advance and carrying out breakthrough operations on a 30-kilometer front on both sides of Duren. Although the US military suffered losses, it still wants to achieve decisive results, so it is constantly launching fierce battles. Eisenhower announced that if the First Army succeeds in crossing the Ruhr River, the Ninth Army will prepare to attack the Cologne Plain. On the other hand, in the upper reaches of the Rhine River, the US Third and Seventh Armies are crossing the Saar River and attempting to break into the Saar area. (2) On the Eastern Front, the battle for Budapest is becoming more intense. According to Soviet sources, powerful Soviet troops have occupied Duoro, a railway hub 10 kilometers northeast of Budapest, and launched a general attack on Budapest. On the other hand, the German army defending the city is connecting nearby villages as defensive strongholds and continuing to carry out a heroic defensive battle. The war situation near Budapest is unfavorable to the German army, but considering the German army's fierce counterattacks, the situation has not changed. (3) There are no major changes on the Italian Front.

German Troops in the Balkans Moving North

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Haitong News Agency: The great battle being waged in southern Hungary has been affected by the vanguard of German troops coming from the Balkans. German troops have appeared in the mountainous area south of the Drava River, and the southern flank of the Soviet army is under threat. Military reactions have been evident in the past 24 hours. A Soviet tank force from Lake Velence attempted to cross the river and establish a bridgehead on the south side, but was defeated by the German army. At the same time, the German army has also become more active southwest of Lake Balaton and between the Drava River, and the Soviet army's left wing offensive on Hungary has no fixed direction. The Soviet army's offensive between the northeast corner of Lake Balaton and the Danube River has stalled and is only carrying out local invasions. Other Soviet troops attacking Hungary are increasing pressure on Godollo northeast of Hungary, but their progress has been contained by the German army. The fighting in the eastern and southern regions of Slovakia is still continuing. The Soviet army has made very little progress in its invasions, and the defending army is putting up strong resistance.

### Naval Battle off the Philippines

— Junzhi

The U.S. task force's northbound incursion to harass Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands was in fact the prelude to the battle for the Philippine Islands. Although they suffered a major defeat due to fierce counterattacks by the Japanese navy and air force, their pre-determined plan does not seem to have changed as a result. Therefore, the large transport convoy under the command of MacArthur, escorted by another powerful fleet, approached the Philippines and suddenly invaded Leyte Gulf between Luzon and Mindanao on the 17th. After the afternoon of the 18th, they bombarded the coast along the gulf, and their transport ships successively sailed into the gulf under the cover of heavy artillery and aircraft. By the 20th, their army troops had begun a forceful landing centered on Tacloban and Treleg on Leyte Island.

Air Force Mobilization

Meanwhile, the Japanese air force caught a unit of the U.S. fleet in the southern Philippine waters on the 20th, destroying one medium-sized aircraft carrier and one small aircraft carrier, while fiercely attacking the transport convoy in Leyte Gulf. By the 24th, the weather was good, and the Japanese army and navy air forces mobilized on a large scale in the early morning, fiercely attacking the U.S. task force in the eastern Philippine waters, destroying three large aircraft carriers and severely damaging two cruisers. At 3:30 p.m. on the same day, they destroyed one large aircraft carrier, the Hornet. Around 5:30 p.m., they sank another aircraft carrier.

At the same time, Japanese submarines also echoed the fierce aerial attacks, and from the night of the 24th to the 25th, they continuously attacked the enemy transport convoy sailing in the eastern Philippine waters.

At 6:53 a.m. on the 25th, the Japanese fleet discovered a U.S. task force with several aircraft carriers on the ocean more than 100 nautical miles east of Samar Island in the central Philippines, and immediately approached. At 7:18 a.m., they began to bombard the U.S. fleet, which was attempting to flee. Within two minutes, they sank one large cruiser. After more than ten minutes of engagement, the U.S. fleet was overwhelmed and retreated to the southeast. The Japanese army immediately pursued and sank two aircraft carriers at 7:36 a.m. By 8:03 a.m., a full-scale attack was launched. At this time, the U.S. flagship switched to clear code telegrams and issued desperate calls for help, fleeing in a panic. Subsequently, they sank two more large aircraft carriers and one large cruiser and one destroyer. At this time, the formation of the U.S. fleet was in great disarray, on the verge of collapse, and had to release smoke screens to cover their retreat. Fortunately, there was also a rain shower at sea, so they were able to escape.

Pursuit of Retreating U.S. Fleet

At noon on the same day, the Japanese air force attacked the defeated U.S. fleet in the waters east of Surigao, sinking one aircraft carrier and one cruiser, and destroying two aircraft carriers. At about 1:00 p.m., they destroyed one battleship in the waters northeast of Siargao Island. On the same night, Japanese submarines again encountered U.S. aircraft carrier groups in the eastern Philippine waters, sinking one aircraft carrier and one destroyer. By the 26th, Japanese aircraft discovered a U.S. fleet in action in the waters east of Samar Island and immediately launched a fierce attack, resulting in the sinking and destruction of one aircraft carrier each.

Overall Results of the Japanese Operation

This battle is called the Naval Battle off the Philippines. According to the announcement by the Japanese headquarters on the afternoon of October 27, from October 24 to 26, the total damage suffered by the U.S. fleet in the naval battle off the Philippines was the sinking of eight aircraft carriers, three cruisers, two destroyers, and more than four transport ships, the destruction of seven aircraft carriers, one battleship, and two cruisers, and the loss of about 500 aircraft.

### Liaison Reports During Air Raids; Police Department Revises Measures; Actions to Be Taken When Communication Liaison Facilities Are Damaged

The Shanghai Municipal Police Department, having investigated the matter of reporting measures during air raids, implemented regulations on September 9 of this year. In view of the actual situation of the current air raids, when communication liaison facilities are damaged, the ability to obtain information is easily lost. Therefore, the concept of relying on such facilities in the past is not appropriate. When air raid alarms are issued, the dispatching of liaison personnel according to the regulations should be revised as follows: "(1) Each sub-bureau listed in the first section shall, after the air raid alarm is issued, immediately dispatch a pre-assigned full-time Japanese staff member or a Chinese police officer of the rank of police sergeant or above to the General Affairs Office to await the command of the Director of General Affairs. (2) Each sub-bureau listed in the second section shall, upon the issuance of an air raid alarm, promptly dispatch personnel directly to the first section sub-bureaus to stand by, in order to engage in communication liaison work, but they must be subject to the command and supervision of the bureau chief of the sub-bureau they are staying at. (3) Each sub-bureau listed in the third section shall, upon the issuance of an air raid alarm, immediately dispatch personnel to the second section sub-bureaus to stand by, in order to engage in communication liaison reporting work, but the command and supervision during standby shall be the same as described in the previous item. (4) The Director of General Affairs may, when necessary, order the first section sub-bureaus to dispatch additional assistant personnel for deployment. (5) Each section sub-bureau shall assist each other in liaison communication reporting matters. (6) Each sub-bureau shall report the job titles and names of the selected liaison personnel to both the General Affairs and Police Defense Departments, and notify each level of sub-bureau within the system. At the same time, in order to carry out reporting and the inherent duties of the police, complete preparations must be made for the important communication liaisons required. Each sub-bureau must first select reliable personnel from those not directly engaged in police defense work to be solely responsible for dispatching liaison, in order to achieve the mission of this case."

### Anti-Air Defense Headquarters to Exhibit Downed Enemy Aircraft Starting Today; Exhibition at the Racecourse for Six Days

The Shanghai Special Municipality Civil Air Defense Headquarters, in view of the recent frequent incursions by enemy U.S. air forces into various parts of Central China, wantonly disrupting and being shot down a B29 type aircraft, in order to make the citizens understand, after obtaining the support of the Allied Army Reporting Department, has scheduled to exhibit the aircraft at the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse from the 15th to the 20th of this month. And on the afternoon of the 15th, they will invite Japanese dignitaries in Shanghai, and on the afternoon of the 16th, they will invite celebrities from all walks of life in the city to visit.

### Central China Water and Electricity Company Adjusts Water Prices

The Shanghai Branch of the Central China Water and Electricity Company, with the permission of the supervisory authority, has revised its water fee prices from November as follows: For domestic use, the minimum usage is 2,400 gallons, at 45 yuan and 45 cents per 1,000 gallons; for business use (non-domestic use), the minimum usage is 6,200 gallons, at 45 yuan and 45 cents per 1,000 gallons. However, since the November bills have already been issued, the difference between the old and new prices will be added at half the rate to the December bills. As for future water fee amounts, if they are less than one yuan, they will be rounded off.

### Market Vegetables Must Be Marked with Price Limits

The Price Evaluation Committee of the Economic Bureau recently evaluated and set the price limits for vegetables in the city from the 12th to the 17th of this month. This price limit is based on the evaluation of the central market, plus commissions, cartage, shop costs, and profit margins. The evaluated prices for various vegetables are as follows: Chinese cabbage and green vegetables are 21 yuan and 60 cents per catty, spinach is 66 yuan and 60 cents per catty, cabbage is 44 yuan and 50 cents per catty, radish is 42 yuan and 80 cents per catty, and potatoes are 47 yuan and 80 cents per catty. However, it has been found that market prices in vegetable markets exceed the official evaluation by a huge margin of one time. In order to completely eliminate this malpractice, the Economic Bureau has specially ordered the city's vegetable stall trade association to instruct its members to clearly mark the prices of various vegetables and sell them in accordance with the price limits when selling vegetables at the market every day. At the same time, in order to strictly enforce this, it has also consulted the Economic Security Department to send personnel to thoroughly investigate at any time, in order to prevent illegal transactions.

### City Propaganda Department Sets Up Script Review Committee

Since the regulations on drama inspection in the city were promulgated by the municipal government, the City Propaganda Department has been responsible for handling it for more than half a year. Now, in order to ensure the thoroughness of script review and to strengthen the inspection force, the City Propaganda Department has specially obtained the approval of the municipal government to establish a Script Review Committee, which was officially established on the first day of this month, and the Police Department has assigned the original drama review personnel from the Inspection Section to assist in the handling. In the future, all theater venues should send their scripts directly to the Propaganda Department for review. However, after each play has been reviewed and approved and a performance permit has been obtained, in accordance with the provisions of Article 17 of the Drama Inspection Regulations, "The script with a performance permit should, before being staged, present the permit to the local police agency for inspection and verification, and it should be posted in a conspicuous position at the entrance of the theater for identification." Therefore, in the future, all theater venues should, in accordance with the aforementioned regulations, after obtaining a performance permit, attach a detailed report stating the name of the theater, the location of the performance, the name of the play, and the person in charge, and submit it to the Inspection Section on the sixth floor of the Fuzhou Road Construction Building for verification, in order to show solemnity and facilitate inspection.

### Yesterday's Third Charity Football Match; Xiaohualian Defeated; Shanghai Police Win 6-1

The third charity football match, raising funds for air defense construction, was held at the Racecourse at 3:30 p.m. yesterday, with Xiaohualian fighting the Shanghai Police. Due to the weather, the audience was sparse. Xiaohualian's lineup was scattered, and communication was ineffective. In a one-sided situation, they suffered a crushing defeat to the Shanghai Police by a score of 1-6. The referee was Chen Jixiang. After Sun Lifu, Secretary-General of the Air Defense Headquarters, performed the opening kick-off ceremony, the two sides began to engage. In the tenth minute, the Shanghai Police launched a sweeping attack, and Carro Li District crossed the barrier and cut down the general, and Mai Qidang raised a foot and broke the net for the first score. In less than two minutes, Mai Qidang showed his power again, making it 2-0. Xiaohualian pulled back a city by Lei Shu, which was the golden age of Xiaohualian. Good times did not last long, and the Shanghai Police made a comeback. Roberts Stoff passed to Zhuo Lunzifu, and Zhuo calmly shot in, and the Shanghai Police led 3-1 in the first half. In the sound of the restart of the battle, although Hualian made a major adjustment to its personnel, it still suffered a crushing defeat. In addition, its energy and strength were inferior to others, and it became the world of the Shanghai Police. Mai Qidang, with the help of Saven, fell into one city. The generals of Xiaohualian were overwhelmed, and they became even more unsustainable. The momentum of the Shanghai Police was immense. Mai Qidang was like breaking bamboo, scoring twice. Time was up, and the Shanghai Police defeated Xiaohualian 6-1.

### Re-examining the Policy of Gradually Increasing Prices

— Meng Zhou

Some days ago, I drafted an article titled "Suppressing and Stabilizing Prices and Managing Supplies," advocating a policy of gradually increasing prices. After it was published in this newspaper, my original intention was to elicit valuable opinions. Fortunately, Mr. Jing Xian was generous with his insightful commentary, which fills me with excitement. I hereby express my deep gratitude. At the same time, I still have several points of view that I would like to share with the world through the remaining space in this newspaper, as an aid to mutual discussion.

(1) A low-price policy takes the principle of keeping prices fixed as its basis. All interest, storage fees, natural depreciation, etc., during the storage period cannot be added to the price of goods. This inevitably burdens the owners of goods alone. If the government or controlling organization cannot spend huge sums to buy up and store all the supplies needed by the people, and cannot subsidize the losses of the goods owners in storage, then the low-price policy cannot be implemented. Under the current wartime system, prices cannot be allowed to move freely, and management is certainly needed. But can price management be done without any policy? The policy of gradually increasing prices is indeed sufficient to remedy the shortcomings of the low-price policy. Regardless of whether the base price and the monthly percentage increase that I advocate are appropriate, this policy should always be adopted instead of the low-price policy!

(2) The base price in the policy of gradually increasing prices that I advocate is determined according to the normal market price of a certain period. The so-called normal market price cannot of course be divorced from cost calculation, but the currency value is now falling too fast. Simply calculating the cost by the amount of currency makes it impossible to reproduce. Therefore, the normal market price I advocate should include the price increase of raw materials needed for reproduction. It refers to the cost calculation of possible reproduction. In short, suppressing and stabilizing prices is for the benefit of the consuming public, and the normal market price should be calculated according to the situation of possible reproduction. It is better to slightly raise the purchase price of agricultural products and the factory price of manufactured goods, so that the interests of the consuming public are slightly sacrificed, in order to increase production. It is absolutely unacceptable to unreasonably lower the purchase price and factory price in the name of protecting the interests of the consuming public, causing production to shrink day by day. This is what I want to solemnly explain.

(3) Some may say that raising prices by a fixed percentage every month is too mechanical and instead rewards merchants' hoarding. I really dare not agree with this theory. The publicly set price limit was originally set to correct the evils of the market price, and of course it cannot fluctuate with the market price. If it is believed that the publicly set price limit should fluctuate with the market price, then there is no need to set another publicly set price limit. Now, the price that I advocate rising at a fixed rate every month refers to the publicly set price limit. It is precisely because the current market price is letting the law of supply and demand run wild, and what is causing trouble from it is often a sharp rise and a small decline. Therefore, in order to make the publicly set price limit rise slowly and regularly every month, to save the evils of the market price's sharp rise and small return, it is really beneficial to the consuming public. How can it reward merchants' hoarding instead? If merchants store goods and sell them according to the gently rising publicly set price limit, without seeking exorbitant profits, this should be encouraged. What we want to ban is hoarding and speculation for exorbitant profits. It does not mean that merchants should not store goods at all. This must not be misunderstood.

(4) The percentage of monthly price increases that I advocate should be equivalent to the market discount interest rate at that time. The market discount interest rate is determined according to the urgency of the need for short-term borrowing of currency at that time. In peacetime, the market discount interest rate is determined by the thickness of the profit of general commerce (factory operation requires long-term loans, which has nothing to do with the market discount interest rate). But under the current special circumstances, it is actually determined by comparing the amount of profit from general hoarding. Therefore, although the market discount interest rate is nominally subject to restrictions, hoarding must actually be banned in order to lower it. If hoarding can be banned, then general prices will rise slowly and regularly, and naturally the market discount interest rate can also be lowered proportionally. The market discount interest rate that I am talking about refers to the actual market discount interest rate. The nominal market discount interest rate alone cannot be used as a benchmark for price increases. In short, the publicly set price limit was originally said to correct the evils of the sharp rise in market prices. Now, let's talk about the relationship between market price fluctuations and market discounts, which can be divided into three types of goods. The gently rising publicly set price limit that I advocate can of course be applied to the first type of goods where the market price and market discount rise and fall in unison. It should be applied even more to the second type of goods where the market price rises faster, in order to save the evils of the sharp rise in market prices. As for the third type of goods where the market price rises more slowly, they are generally not daily necessities and originally do not need to be subject to a publicly set price limit. Even if there is a publicly set price limit, and the market price of the goods rises more slowly, then this publicly set price limit cannot be reached, which is equivalent to being set up in vain and will not cause much harm, so there is no need to worry too much.

(5) This year, the market price of cooking oil in Shanghai, from February to mid-August, was 95 yuan per catty. Not only did it not rise in the middle, but it sometimes fell. This situation seems to indicate that the gently rising publicly set price limit that I advocate is not suitable for application. However, the reason why the market price of cooking oil in Shanghai did not rise between February and August this year was actually due to sharp rises and small declines, the eagerness of goods arriving, and the rainy season, etc., which were purely temporary phenomena. Try to compare it with the current situation where the market price of cooking oil in Shanghai has almost risen to 400 yuan per catty, and you will know that if you let it go naturally without a gently rising publicly set price limit to restrict it, the price of oil can rise more than four times in just over three months. If we can follow my suggestion and use 95 yuan per catty in February as the base price, and increase the price by 8% per month, then the publicly set price limit for cooking oil, although it rises to more than 148 yuan per catty in August, according to this calculation, the price of oil in December now would only be more than 200 yuan per catty. Compared to the current oil price skyrocketing four times, which is more beneficial to people's livelihood, I think it is not difficult to judge.

(6) Banning hoarding may require strong political power as a prerequisite, but if you want to suppress and stabilize prices, you should always ban hoarding. You must not expect it to be not very easy and adopt a laissez-faire policy, allowing prices to skyrocket. Moreover, if the measures to ban hoarding are complete and proper, and are sufficient to make the owners of goods believe that they will definitely not suffer losses due to the ban this time, and can obtain considerable benefits, they will naturally not be suspicious and fearful, and resistance can be reduced. Then, even if the backing political power is not very strong, it can have a real effect on banning hoarding. The reason why I advocate that the publicly set price limit should rise at a fixed rate every month is not only to avoid monthly evaluation and prevent various abuses from arising, but also to reassure the owners of goods, so as to eliminate the resistance of opposing forces. Taking the previous examples of banning hoarding repeatedly, the laws and regulations were too strict, or the methods were not perfect, so that the owners of goods who declared their inventory in accordance with the laws and regulations all lost their capital, and even the goods were bought but the price was not paid for a long time. Only the owners of goods with flexible skills could escape the law and sit back and reap huge profits. Therefore, in order to effectively ban hoarding now, it is necessary to give preferential treatment to the owners of goods and protect their interests in obtaining gently rising prices and market discount equivalence, so that declarations can be expected to be enthusiastic and resistance will be reduced. How can we rashly conclude that hoarding is difficult to effectively ban just because it is not very easy? I believe that there is no need to hope that prices that have already risen will fall, but the hope that prices will no longer skyrocket in the future is enough to stabilize people's livelihood. Therefore, the policy of gradually increasing prices is really the right medicine for the disease.

The above is inevitably lengthy, but the skyrocketing of prices is really a major problem for people's livelihood at present. If we do not urgently seek remedies, the entire society will collapse. Therefore, I will not avoid being verbose about this and still want to talk repeatedly. I only hope that wise people in the government and the public will give criticism, in order to obtain reasonable countermeasures, which can achieve the goal of suppressing and stabilizing prices.
