### A Chat on Local Administration

— Chen Binhe

Attending the Symposium of the Local Administration Society

Since 1937, due to the war, local administration has long been absent from public view and unnoticed by the public. Many county magistrates come from special connections and cannot be talked about in terms of "administration," so the suffering of the people deepens day by day. However, practically speaking, the success of politics in the peace zone and the strengthening of the national government's position should all start with local administration. Some local administrators in this city, in conjunction with outstanding experts, publish a local administration monthly, whose task is to conduct research, criticism, or introduction to the principles, theories, and systems of local administration; to propose plans and schemes for local administration; to record administrative experiences; and to investigate communication and statistical materials. It is a relatively specialized publication in the peace zone and is much needed. Yesterday, at the symposium held by the society to entertain the standing members of the consultation committee, I was asked to express my views, so I offered the following:

We have said that central politics is a point, provincial politics is money, and county politics is a surface. The weakest link in the peace zone is the surface. The Minister of Interior, Mei Shiping, came to Shanghai last time, and I made a special trip to visit him on the morning of the 12th to discuss local administration. Mr. Mei is an expert with rich experience in local administration, having served as the model county magistrate of Jiangning for many years. I brought up old matters again and demanded that local administration be improved, hoping that important counties in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces would be selected to establish model local administrations. Mr. Mei replied that he was considering this issue in the suburbs of Nanjing and starting preparations. Although there would be no name of model counties, the reality of model county administration would be promoted. This is a very gratifying thing, and I hope it will become a reality soon.

We have long awaited Shanghai to become a national model political zone. I believe that Mayor Chen and Secretary-General Wu share this belief. Especially since the takeover of the concessions on August 1 last year, this belief has been strengthened. How can it be gradually realized? What are the manifestations? First, can a sound administrative system be established? Second, can personnel be improved to be refreshing? If the system can be improved, but the personnel cannot be improved, it is just a change of soup without changing the ingredients, and the above belief cannot be realized. The biggest difficulty in Chinese politics is the personnel issue. As for the establishment of government agencies, it is just to support officials and private individuals. Then, administrative agencies inevitably become bureaucratic agencies, just going around in circles with official documents and becoming document administration. Whoever as a superior official has the courage to break through the personnel difficulties will succeed. We firmly believe that Mayor Chen is very frank and sincere, does not use private individuals, and is inclusive of talents from all aspects. In order for Shanghai to become a model zone, we especially hope that before the merger of municipal organs on August 1 this year, a strict screening of the original personnel will be conducted to refresh the scene. This is the key to whether Shanghai's local administration can establish a model. We believe that most of the bureau and division chiefs of the municipal organs have ambitions to assist the mayor in building a new Shanghai. However, it is undeniable that there are still a few who cannot fulfill their duties, especially those who cannot fulfill their duties among the cadres of various bureaus and divisions. We hope to take this opportunity to give them a fair assessment. Of course, outstanding talents and excellent systems should be retained on the one hand.

Finally, my conclusion on the opinions at the symposium: First, I hope that the seven counties within the scope of Shanghai will all become model counties, and the county magistrates of each county are experts. This is the only way to change the bad environment in the suburbs of Shanghai and protect the security of Shanghai. I will prepare to make a suggestion at the next consultation meeting. At the same time, I hope that the experts of the Local Administration Society will participate in the work of building local administration. Second, although "Local Administration" is a monthly magazine, it is a good garden for absorbing and promoting people with aspirations for local administration. I hope it will gradually grow up and promote its opinions to be effective, so that model local administrations can be established everywhere.

### Japanese Troops Fiercely Attack Yingde, Break into Kowloon City, and Attack and Shoot Down Ten Planes Attacking Guangdong and Chongqing

Guangzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) - Japanese elite troops are carrying out an encirclement and annihilation war against the Chongqing army in the mountainous areas of northern Guangdong Province, causing the Chongqing 7th War Zone army, which is stubbornly defending, to fall into chaos. The Japanese army crossed the Lianjiang River again, fiercely attacking the first two lines of defense of the Chongqing army in western Yingde along the mountain roads. On the 19th, they broke into Kowloon City and shelled the remaining Chongqing army in the mountainous area. The Chongqing 154th Division and the Independent 9th Brigade, which were stubbornly defending the area, have suffered heavy casualties. It is said that Yu Hanmou, commander of the Chongqing 7th War Zone, has sent reinforcements from Shaoguan to personally supervise the battle and do his best to defend Yingde.

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Tojo cabinet resigned en masse on the 18th. The Japanese Situation Reporting Bureau has just announced the reasons for the resignation en masse of the Tojo cabinet as follows: Since the outbreak of the war, the government has closely cooperated with the General Headquarters and made various efforts to complete the war. At this critical decisive battle, the entire country is advancing to complete the war. The cabinet will resign en masse and believes that it should be handed over to a more powerful cabinet.

### Japanese Senior Statesmen Hold a Meeting to Recommend the Most Suitable Candidate; Generals Koiso and Tojo Hold Important Talks

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - In order to cope with the current major war situation, refresh the people's hearts, and mobilize the total strength of the country to establish a foundation for completing the war, Prime Minister Tojo entered the palace at 11:40 AM on the same day and presented the resignation letters of the cabinet members to the Emperor. After Emperor of Japan inquired about the candidates for the succeeding cabinet from Minister Kido, he sought the opinions of various senior statesmen. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, a meeting of senior statesmen was held in the palace, gathering former prime ministers Baron Wakatsuki Reijiro, Admiral Okada Keisuke, Hirota Koki, Duke Konoe Fumimaro, Baron Hiranuma Kiichiro, General of the Army Abe Nobuyuki, Admiral of the Navy Yonai Mitsumasa, and former presidents of the Privy Council. They frankly expressed their opinions on the issue of organizing a succeeding cabinet under the current major situation. As a result of the discussion, it was considered that General of the Army Koiso Kuniaki, the governor-general of Korea, and Admiral of the Navy Yonai Mitsumasa were the most suitable candidates. They were granted an audience and presented three recommendations for General of the Army Koiso and Admiral of the Navy Yonai to succeed in organizing the cabinet. Therefore, the great order to be responsible for organizing the succeeding cabinet was bestowed upon General of the Army Koiso, the governor-general of Korea, and Admiral Yonai. Governor-General Koiso departed from Keijo at 11:15 AM on the 20th and arrived at Haneda Airport in Tokyo at 2:50 PM by plane. He and Admiral Yonai entered the palace to pay respects to the Emperor of Japan around 3:50 PM. They were granted an audience, and the two were ordered to organize the cabinet. Governor-General Koiso left after 5:50 PM and immediately went to the Prime Minister's official residence to visit Prime Minister Tojo and have important talks. He left at 6:45 PM. Admiral Yonai also left after reconvening the meeting of senior statesmen at 4:00 PM. The two cooperated, and in view of the severe progress of the war, they did not dare to delay and began the work of organizing a fresh and powerful cabinet as quickly as possible.

### The Japanese People Expect a Powerful New Cabinet

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Tojo's cabinet has been in power for two years and nine months. It was not until the 18th that he resigned en masse. The Greater East Asia War broke out in February of Prime Minister Tojo's cabinet. At that time, the Tojo cabinet worked hard to destroy the United Kingdom and the United States and build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere under the alliance between Japan, China, and Manchuria and the strong alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy. After receiving the declaration of war on December 8, Showa 16, in the spirit of Hakkō ichiu, in order to establish a foundation for permanent world peace, he destroyed the British and American bases of aggression in East Asia at lightning speed. Until today, he has always closely linked with the General Headquarters, pooling his wisdom and efforts, and advancing to establish a winning system. However, at that time, due to the pressure of the British and American ambition to dominate the world, he did not have enough time to fully prepare the domestic war system, and was involved in the vortex of the Greater East Asia War. This point was the most concerned by the Tojo cabinet. Therefore, after forming the cabinet, he quickly completed the system of all-out war in the country, hoping to exert all his strength and contribute to the holy war, so that he could establish today's wartime system. This kind of great achievement should not be ignored. However, recently, the Pacific war situation has reached a decisive stage, and the situation is more serious than before. At this time, the people of Japan are expecting more clear political measures, so Tojo and the cabinet members proposed resignation en masse. Although the resignation en masse of the Tojo cabinet was unexpected by the Japanese people, because the Japanese national polity is different from other countries in the world, this move will not cause a strong stimulus to the Japanese people. What the people of the whole country expect is the emergence of a more powerful and fresh cabinet.

### "The Tiger of Korea" General Koiso Ordered to Form a New Cabinet Lieutenant General Ushijima Specially Issued a Statement

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - After General of the Army Koiso was ordered to come out and form a cabinet, Lieutenant General Sadao Ushijima, his classmate in the Army Military Academy, issued a statement on the matter as follows: I and Mr. Koiso were classmates in the Army Military Academy and the Army University. When I was a major, I served in the General Staff Headquarters with Mr. Koiso. Later, when I was an instructor at the Army University, Mr. Koiso was the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Army. Therefore, I can be said to have been a lifelong friend with Mr. Koiso for half of my life. Although Mr. Koiso has a face that is frightening at first sight, on the other hand, he has a very careful personality. He has close consideration for everything. Therefore, among colleagues, he often holds more noble views than others. At the same time, he also holds the spirit of forceful action. In the future, he will serve as the prime minister of a country, and I believe that he will be the same as usual. He will boldly break through the raging waves and advance gradually in this major war situation. According to Mr. Koiso, when he was the commander of the Korean Army, he was called "The Tiger of Korea." What the world expects today is how this tiger will behave out of the cage. Mr. Koiso served as Vice Minister of the Army when he was an active soldier, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Commander of the Korean Army, and when he was a reservist, he served as Minister of Colonial Affairs twice. Therefore, Mr. Koiso is indeed a general of forceful action.

### The Normandy Campaign The Evolution is Worth Watching The German Army Has Withdrawn from the Ruins of San Luo

Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Central News Agency) - The German army on the Normandy front has announced that the German army has withdrawn from San Luo, and the anti-axis authorities have also stated that the British army has broken through the German positions in Caen, and the American army has cut off the highway between San Luo and Periye. As a result, the German army abandoned San Luo. This time, the word "breakthrough" was also used in Meng Gaomao Lai, which is still a pioneer. It can be seen that this operation is by no means limited to local operations. The air preparation attack is also more intense than in the past. In particular, the British Air Force bombers have begun to participate in daytime bombing. All of this is a manifestation of the anti-axis military's determination, so the evolution of future events is quite worthy of attention.

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency News: The German army has withdrawn from the ruins of San Luo and is now defending new positions in the south of the city, repelling all attacks by the American army. General Dempsey's British Second Army has not slackened its attacks on the Divi River and the area south of Caen from the east bank of the Orne River, but the German army has taken effective countermeasures. The situation southwest of Caen has not changed. The enemy's attempts in the areas of Belles and Troon were repelled on Wednesday. The German army in the southwest of the area has recovered several places and advanced forward.

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency News: At noon on Tuesday, the British army, with an unprecedented tense cover of artillery fire and more than 1,000 aircraft in preparation, launched an offensive eastward and southward from the bridgehead east of the Orne River. The purpose was obviously to reach the banks of the Div River in the east and advance several kilometers southward in order to turn west and reach the Orne River north of Caen. On Tuesday evening and night, several small villages southeast of Caen were repeatedly gained and lost, and repeatedly changed hands. On Wednesday morning, both sides added fresh troops to the battle, and the war became more intense. The situation southwest of Caen was relatively calm, probably because the British army had shifted its focus to the east bank of the Ona River, but at the same time, there was a fierce war in the Knoll Vantes area. In the end, the German army retreated one kilometer southward.

### The German Army in Northern Italy Withdrew from Livorno

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - The German authorities claimed: After the enemy of Italian cultivated land was severely wounded in fierce fighting, they invaded the completely destroyed docks in the south of Livorno (on the west coast in northern Italy), causing a fierce uproar. The German army withdrew to positions north of the city in the evening.

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency News: On Wednesday, the war on the Ligurian Sea coast of Italy expanded to the downstream area of the Arno River, all the way to Livorno. The American army advanced along the coast with tank vehicles and two infantry battalions and rushed to the German defensive positions in the east. After several hours of fierce fighting, the German army retreated to the foreign port, and fierce street fighting broke out in the southern part of the port in the evening. The German front line along the Adriatic Sea also retreated northward after fierce fighting, and there was also fighting late at night. The results have not yet been obtained.

### Situation on the Eastern Front

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - The German authorities announced the situation on the Eastern Front as follows: The fighting on the eastern front from Garya to Lake Setz is extremely fierce. The center of the war is the Wolf area. The Soviet army crossed the Bug River with powerful troops and broke into the depths of the German positions. The Soviet army is using all means and is trying to penetrate to the Lvov area. The Soviet army is putting heavy pressure on the German detachment operation between Opociojaga and Poku, and wants to break through the new German positions, but the sovereignty of the operation is still in the hands of the German army. The German army in the middle of Kuloturno and the Kemmon River has counterattacked many times and has been successful. The defensive power of the German army in the Dvinard district is gradually increasing, which is quite worthy of attention.

### Gort Transferred to New Position

As for any disputes between issuing offices in this district and citizens, please send a letter directly to Office No. 702 of this office for investigation.

### Letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce

To the Editor of Shen Bao:

Regarding the short commentary "Where Did the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Get a Large Batch of Rice?" in your newspaper on July 20th, we hereby reply as follows: Rong Huiren and other staff members of the Rice Control Committee requested this association to temporarily store 130 bags of Henglin rice transported to Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 17th of this month. At that time, because Mr. Rong was originally a staff member of this association and had been transferred to the Rice Control Committee, and the rice was verified to be from staff members who had followed procedures and obtained a temporary rice transport permit, it seemed inappropriate to refuse the temporary storage for a day or two. The entire amount was taken away at 3:00 PM on the 19th. This is the actual situation. We are sending this letter specifically to inform you, and we hope you will take note of it. Sincerely, Secretariat of the Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce. July 20th.

### The Sea of the New Era and the China of the New Era – Broadcast Speech by Principal Jiang Xiyuan

Jiang Xiyuan, Rear Admiral and Principal of the Central Naval Academy, gave a broadcast speech at 9:10 PM on the 20th, titled "The Sea of the New Era and the China of the New Era." The original text is recorded below:

The Maritime Spirit

"Today is the fourth 'Sea Day' celebration of our ally Japan. This 'Sea Day' does not have any special significance in the minds of the general public in our country. But if we think carefully about it, the reason why our ally Japan has been able to achieve world leaps and even take on the important task of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere today is precisely because the spirited people with a maritime spirit have been stimulated, vigorously promoted, and have seized the opportunity to catch up with all the standards of the world. In just a few decades, they quickly succeeded in becoming the most advanced and prosperous country. Looking back at our country's people, they have always adhered to the conservative customs of the continent, simplifying everything in a rudimentary way, being content with temporary ease, and arrogantly considering themselves superior, taking pride in their culture, which ultimately led to backwardness in everything. The main reason for this can be said to be the lack of adjustment to the continental nature, which, over time, has had a poisoning effect. Therefore, in the future, we must use the properties of the ocean to create a great spirit to replace the stubbornness of the nation for thousands of years, so as to develop the future of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, from this point of view, the Greater East Asia War will benefit our country as immeasurably as the sea.

Speaking of it, in ancient times, the great thinkers of our country praised the concept of the sea to the utmost. All vast and boundless things are represented by the sea. However, this concept of admiration inevitably leads to fear of the vastness and boundlessness, as well as the dangerous storms of the sea. There is a sense of sighing at the ocean, and the world and the nation are ultimately limited within the four seas. As for what lies beyond the four seas, it is only preserved without discussion.

The Power of Maritime Transport

The evolution of science has made maritime transport more convenient than land transport. The capacity of maritime transport far exceeds that of land transport. The power of the navy reaches far across the oceans. Culture, economy, and even wars in the world are all closely related through the commonality of the ocean. China, which has been trapped on the continent for a long time, is naturally no exception to this. However, the national inertia of thousands of years makes it very difficult to have any drastic changes all at once. Now, during the Greater East Asia War, the common future of the East Asian nations is threatened by the West coming across the sea. We cannot continue to dream of surviving comfortably on the continent, nor can we continue to engage in fraternal infighting. The ocean makes China realize that it can only survive under the unity of Greater East Asia. In the past, the sea was only an abstract greatness to China. The sea of the new era is a living element for people to get rid of the old and take in the new, but China needs it even more deeply.

Maritime affairs maintain most of human life. The execution of maritime tasks is the responsibility of the navy and maritime transport. In peacetime, the navy maintains maritime security to ensure the safety of maritime transport. In wartime, maritime transport is responsible for the transportation of materials and the supply of naval needs. These two tasks are like the two wheels of a car, complementing each other and indispensable. The Allied navy in this Pacific War is admired by the world for its heroism and invincibility, but the activity of its maritime transport sector is by no means inferior. The spirit of the transport sailors is no different from the traditional spirit of the naval officers and soldiers. Their arduous, unparalleled, and effective achievements in killing the enemy are also no different. We express our same gratitude and respect to them for their contributions to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Building the Navy

Our new navy has been under construction for five years. The people of the country probably already know about it, so I won't introduce it in detail here. Our maritime transport construction has not been heard of for a long time, but since the first class of students from the Central Advanced Merchant Marine School and the sixth class of students from the Central Naval Academy entered the school at the same time recently, and ordinary sailors are being trained at the Central Sailor Training Center at the same time, our country's maritime transport sector can be said to be just beginning. Such a two-pronged approach of the navy and maritime transport really contains the great significance of the new era. The people who have been trapped in the thinking habits of the continent for a long time should be enlightened by this, and hope that they will give this new model of maritime military industry a new understanding and practical assistance. In the future, the "sea" of the new era will no longer be ignored by the people of the country. In addition to government facilities such as national construction, military construction, navy, and maritime transport, what should be paid attention to in general is that aspects such as academic thought, customs, habits, and interests must have maritime characteristics incorporated into them. Painters should depict surging waves, blue seas, and clear skies, or handsome warships and magnificent merchant ships. Musicians should sing the magnificent and boundless spirit of the ocean. Writers should have eloquent and magnificent words, phrases, and verses, or maritime descriptions. Travelers should not be proud of returning from the Five Sacred Mountains but should call on each other after having experienced the vastness of the sea. Academics should have the excitement of searching for treasures overseas. If this is done, the maritime spirit will be promoted and deeply integrated into the national life and habits. This will directly and indirectly greatly benefit the construction of the navy and maritime transport, the revival of China, and the victory of East Asia. The new era might as well be called the era of the sea. Only with the role of the sea can there be a foothold for the era, especially China, which has embarked on the path of the Greater East Asia War and has a very long coastline."

### The Enemy Changes Course

— The Recluse of Jiangnan

Today, the Japanese Cabinet Information Bureau announced that Prime Minister Tojo "in order to refresh people's hearts, so that the whole country can advance towards the completion of the war," decided on the 18th to have the entire cabinet resign en masse and immediately submitted the resignation letters of all cabinet members. The 18th was the day that the loss of Saipan Island was announced, that Umezu, Commander of the Kwantung Army, was transferred to the position of Chief of the General Staff, and that Admiral Nomura Naokuni assumed the post of Minister of the Navy on the following day. Seeing these events occurring one after another, will the propaganda agencies of the United States and Britain exaggerate that Japan has fallen into "a difficult situation" and boast of the success of their military and political efforts? They had already declared that the resignation of Admiral Shimada as Minister of the Navy and General Tojo as Chief of the General Staff were related to the loss of Saipan Island and were making every effort to propagate this as the most acute expression of the so-called "desperate state of Japan." Therefore, when they learn of the news of the resignation of the entire Tojo cabinet, they will surely be overjoyed and even more unrestrained in their poisonous remarks. Of course, such events would not occur if Japan were advancing on a clear path to victory. However, as General Tojo said when Saipan Island fell, Japan is now "in a momentous situation in history," and the entire nation, adhering to the belief in certain victory, will seize the "excellent opportunity to destroy the enemy and win" from this momentous situation and further tighten the collective strength. In the midst of this process, in order to refresh people's hearts, so that the whole country can advance towards the completion of the war, the Tojo cabinet, which has already completed its temporary mission, has announced its resignation. From this, it can be seen that this political change in Japan has a very great positive significance for the completion of the war. This has the same significance as the "enemy changing course" during the famous Battle of Tsushima in naval history, the so-called Togo Turn. At that time, it was only with this bold "enemy changing course" that it was possible to seize the opportunity for a resounding victory. Implementing such a bold measure in front of the enemy is originally a great adventure. If one possesses an overwhelming war power against the enemy and can leisurely advance towards the goal, this kind of self-risk would be unnecessary. However, this change is something that Japan is preparing to deal with the historically great situation and is resolutely implementing. From the wishful thinking of the United States and Britain, it is certainly recognized as the most acute expression of the dangerous situation in which Japan finds itself, but this is purely one side of the shield. The United States and Britain, secretly fearing Japan's final blow, are deliberately obscuring the other side. This kind of fact is repeatedly revealed, even in their most clever propaganda, and there are innumerable examples.

Secondly, it is within expectation that the United States and Britain are making great propaganda about the resignation of the entire Tojo cabinet as the collapse of the Japanese war system. However, this kind of propaganda only serves to expose their utter ignorance of the Japanese national system and political system. They witness the various political phenomena in Japan and distort Japan into a fascist political system, recognizing General Tojo as its leader and dictator. The absurdity of this view is immediately apparent to all Japanese citizens and those who truly understand Japan. Japan's political system is fundamentally different from that of Germany and Italy, so it is inappropriate to compare General Tojo to Hitler or Mussolini. Moreover, the American and British view that the resignation of the Tojo Cabinet is the collapse of Japan's war situation is nothing more than a self-consoling thought. Regarding the Japanese national system and political system, there will be an opportunity to provide a detailed explanation at a later date, but for the sake of analyzing the truth of the loquacious American and British propaganda agencies, it is specifically pointed out here. In short, the Japanese people's fighting spirit, which is becoming increasingly high due to this bold "enemy changing course," will make them painfully aware of the illusion of their self-consolation.

### First Police Bureau Resolves to Crack Down on Illegal Pawnbroking in the District - The Public Can Report to the Authorities

The Administrative Office of the First Police Bureau of this city has determined that interest rates that pawnshops should take are clearly defined by law, but currently, some pawnshops in this city do not follow the regulations, or even increase interest rates and shorten the pawn period without authorization. At the same time, there are also those who operate pawnbroking and pawn ticket businesses privately under the names of commercial firms, and others who lend at high interest rates, the so-called "usury," exploiting people with heavy interest, which is illegal and easily causes disputes. The office, with the task of administrative police and the mission of safeguarding the interests of the people, should conduct strict investigations and effectively crack down on the above matters in order to alleviate the people's difficulties. Therefore, it has ordered the administrative sections of each branch bureau to conduct thorough investigations and submit reports on the operating situation of pawnshops in their respective jurisdictions for investigation and handling.

Penalty Measures

As for the penalty measures, according to reporters, if pawnbrokers do not follow the prescribed interest rates or shorten the normal period, or if commercial firms operate pawnbroking or pawn ticket businesses privately, or if someone lends at high interest rates and exploits the common people, the public can report to the authorities for investigation and handling. For pawnshops with business licenses that operate in violation of regulations, the first offense will be punished as illegal operation, and the portion of the illegal operation will be ordered to be suspended. Repeated offenses will result in the revocation of the license and transfer to the District Prosecutor's Office for legal action. Commercial firms that operate pawnbroking businesses privately, and whose interest rates do not exceed the regulations, will be punished for operating without a license and ordered to stop the pawnbroking portion of their business. If their interest rates or pawn periods are illegal, they will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for legal action. Other individuals who exploit others with high interest rates will be dealt with according to the severity of their circumstances in accordance with the law.

Secondhand Goods Shops

In addition, the office has determined that the number of general secondhand goods shops, commercial firms, and other similar business establishments in this city is increasing daily. Their business is the buying and selling of secondhand goods, and they are places for selling stolen goods and fostering the habit of theft and crime. In the past, the concessions did not have regulations for these kinds of shops to obtain licenses and did not manage them, which was tantamount to letting them operate freely. In order to prevent the occurrence of the above-mentioned situations, a request has been submitted to the First District Office to handle these business licenses and to strictly manage them. Secondhand goods shops must submit a report on their daily business operations for investigation to prevent theft and the sale of stolen goods and to maintain public order.

### Laiwu and Jining Post Offices Resume Receiving and Sending Parcels

Parcel Notice No. 611 from the Parcel Business Section of the Shanghai Postal Administration states: It has been previously notified in Parcel Notices No. 554 and 609 that the sending of commercial parcels and large and small parcel mail to Laiwu Post Office and Jining Post Office in Shandong Province, as well as those transiting through them, should be temporarily suspended. It has now been determined that the sending of commercial parcels and large and small parcel mail to Laiwu and Jining Post Offices can be resumed as normal. However, those transiting through Jining Post Office should still be temporarily suspended. Furthermore, the weight of each parcel sent to Laiwu Post Office must not exceed 15 kilograms. The acceptance of parcels with collect on delivery to Huimin Post Office in Shandong Province, as well as the sending of commercial parcels and large and small parcel mail to Hanzhuang Post Office in the same province, should now be temporarily suspended. In addition, the sending of all types of parcels and large and small parcel mail to Bin County, Putai, and Linyi Post Offices in Shandong Province, as well as the sending of all types of parcels to Boxing, Huantai, and Chongxingzhen Post Offices, should be temporarily suspended.

### Central Bank to Accept Production Industry Loans as Much as Possible to Avoid Impact from Tight Credit

The Shanghai money market has recently become increasingly tight, and the interest rates for interbank lending have been listed, with the amount of short-term borrowing decreasing day by day. According to a Central News Agency reporter's inquiry into the money market, this phenomenon of tight credit will have no impact on legitimate business operations and can prevent general speculative hoarding activities. The reason is that the Central Reserve Bank is tightening interbank lending even more strictly. Except for legitimate and reliable firms engaged in legitimate business, the bank is granting loans related to production industries as much as possible, but strictly refusing all other non-essential borrowing. It is also urging general commercial banks to carefully handle interbank borrowing, resulting in a shortage of funds for each firm. Since the beginning of this year, various financial institutions in this city, in response to the government's advocacy of increasing agricultural production and assisting in regulating the rural economy, have actively participated in handling the collection of production goods, such as cotton purchase loans, wheat purchase loans, rice purchase loans, and spring silk purchase loans, amounting to hundreds of millions of yuan. In addition, the Bank of Communications, China Xingye Bank, and other banks related to the interior have actively handled agricultural loans. As a result, speculative funds used to speculate in the past are gradually flowing into rural areas for investment and increasing production industries.

### Wine and Vegetable Industry Workers' Union Organizes Welfare Activities

Since its reorganization and establishment, Chen Guosheng, the chairman of the Shanghai Wine and Vegetable Restaurant Industry Workers' Union, has made unremitting efforts to plan welfare activities for the members. In addition to allocating 50,000 yuan to provide student loans for members' children, which has already achieved considerable results, recently, in order to help poor and sick members, Liu Jizhi, a former contracted doctor of the Commercial Press, has been specially hired as a medical consultant to provide medical services at No. 4 Jiale Road every day from 9:00 AM. Union members and their family members can apply for free medical treatment when needed.

### Screening Test for Students to Study in Japan

The Ministry of Greater East Asia subsidized and dispatched students to study in Japan. Yesterday (20th) at 8:00 AM, a screening test was held at the Municipal He'an Elementary School on Xinzha Road. More than 50 people participated, and Director Lin of the Education Bureau personally supervised the examination at the school, and the situation was very strict. It is scheduled to continue today (21st) with physical examinations. It is reported that the quota for admission this time is six for this city.

### Real Estate Association Holds Members' Meeting Yesterday

The Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association held a general meeting of members at the association's meeting hall at No. 93 Guangdong Road the day before yesterday (19th). Representatives from the Economic Bureau, the association's supervisor Wang Jing, and more than 100 member representatives attended. The meeting was chaired by Zhu Boquan, the chairman of the association, to discuss agenda items such as the previous session's final accounts, the next session's budget, and amendments to the association's constitution. The election of the current directors and supervisors was also held, and as a result, Zhu Boquan and 16 others were elected as directors, and Hao Boyang and eight others were elected as supervisors.

National Forum

### Careful Use of Town and Village Chiefs

— Pan Yangchou

Town and village chiefs are also members assisting the local government. Their duties involve earnestly conveying and implementing policies from higher authorities, sincerely suggesting improvements to alleviate the people's hardships. They also hold the primary responsibility for managing security, population movement, and the collection and distribution of food supplies for the people's livelihood. Therefore, although the position may seem minor, the responsibility is significant, and it is truly not something that those without political knowledge, administrative experience, and a deep understanding of righteousness can handle.

Currently, among the town and village chiefs, there are those who are wise and capable. However, most are ignorant and incompetent, or those who have climbed their way up through connections and bribery. Such individuals not only fail to assist the government but also abuse their power, exploiting the people, engaging in embezzlement and fraud, leaving no means untried. Such town and village chiefs can indeed be described as locusts among the people.

Therefore, I wish to condemn them in writing, urging the government to pay attention and fundamentally reform politics by first carefully selecting town and village chiefs. At the same time, I hope that those incompetent town and village chiefs will recognize the times and quickly retire. I am not making a reckless threat. Consider the report in various small newspapers on July 5, exposing a corner of the Pudong South District where town and village chiefs accused each other of embezzlement and fraud, leading to a public prosecution by the prosecutor. The content may contain inaccuracies, but it is unlikely to be entirely fabricated. It is said that the case was further investigated by the Shanghai Local Court on July 18. Regardless of which laws the three town and village chiefs involved will be subject to, the stain on the city has already been revealed to society. The government authorities should not ignore it and must consider improvements.

Such stains are everywhere, and some are hidden in darkness, making them difficult to detect. In short, improper appointment of town and village chiefs not only harms the people but also causes losses to the government. Conversely, wise and capable town and village chiefs can indeed assist in promoting government policies and alleviating the people's hardships. Therefore, carefully selecting town and village chiefs is as important as appointing civil officials, and it should be listed as a fundamental element of political reform without question. As for the current town and village chiefs, they must be carefully screened, and those who are unqualified should either be trained or dismissed. Once appointed, they should receive the same treatment as salaried civil officials, so that they can serve the government and the local community with peace of mind.

### Ocean Youth Corps in the Decisive Battle Period

— Navy Admiral Takeshita Isamu

Special Edition for Ocean Memorial Day

I

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan's understanding of the ocean has indeed completely changed.

Our Japan Ocean Youth Corps has already gone through twenty years of history since its founding. Before and after the September 18th Incident, the development of the corps was far from reaching its peak. If we ask ourselves in the stillness of the night, Japan is a maritime nation, and if we want to develop vigorously, we must reflect carefully.

However, from the January 28th Incident to the July 7th Incident, the oppression of the Japanese Empire by Britain and the United States intensified. As a result, the determination and awakening of the Japanese people towards the ocean also gradually deepened. In short, the strong maritime defense concept of "enemies coming from the sea must be defended at sea" naturally emerged. Therefore, the scale of the corps suddenly advanced significantly.

It was during this period that the Greater East Asia War broke out. In the initial stages of the war, our Japanese Navy occupied most of the Pacific with skillful blitzkrieg tactics, and unprecedented war results were continuously announced. As a result, millions of citizens burned with a feeling of gratitude towards the Navy. Due to the flourishing of this enthusiasm, the driving force for the development of the Youth Corps was naturally created. The study of the ocean spirit was eagerly noticed in all aspects, which can also be said to be the foundation of Japan's inevitable victory. Therefore, a trend formed in Japan, and people joined the ocean continuously.

Below, we will describe it in outline.

II

From last May to this year, I have toured Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, Korea, and other parts of Japan. I also spoke individually with members of the corps in various places and personally witnessed their brave and hopeful attitude. However, as the war situation became increasingly difficult, they ran one by one to the ocean and the sky to fight desperately against the enemy. In my heart, I vaguely [blank space] continue the Aoki of Admiral Yamamoto. This admirable and moving attitude is truly exciting [blank space] minutes.

The heads of cities and villages personally commanded and trained under the guidance of the prefectural Ocean Youth Corps heads. Recently, due to the enhanced construction of the ocean spirit, they are actively fighting. In addition, the unit heads, elementary school principals, and other officers who directly undertake the guidance, work day and night, desperately training ocean warriors. This is truly admirable.

This is not only the case in mainland Japan, but also in other places. Not to mention Lushun and Dalian, even the Youth Corps are said to be training desperately. Recently, this Ocean Youth Corps movement has become popular in Manchukuo, and even in the poor and ruined Mudanjiang City, an Ocean Youth Corps organization has been established.

In addition, in Shanghai, Consul General Mu Bao took the lead in serving as the branch chief and formed the Ocean Youth Corps, conducting general training under the guidance of the Naval Special Landing Force and the Yangtze River Naval Force.

What needs to be emphasized and written about is the Korean Ocean Youth Corps. Korea had the Busan and Zhenhai Ocean Youth Corps a long time ago, but the members were mainly composed of Japanese children.

However, due to changes in the situation, when the Ocean Youth Corps was formed in Banya last year, it was organized by Koreans.

Because this achieved very good results, it is hoped that the Governor-General's Office, Zhenhai Guard Prefecture, Naval Attache's Office, etc. will do their best to help, and organize an Ocean Youth Corps for all Koreans.

III

The Youth Corps produced in various parts of Korea merged into one, forming a national organization of the Korean Ocean Youth Corps. The founding ceremony was held in Gyeongseong in a grand and military manner on May 27, Naval Memorial Day. This founding ceremony gave Koreans a great feeling of gratitude and also gave a very good impact to the naval volunteers being recruited, and participants were very enthusiastic. In addition, the impact occurred not only on children, but also on parents, so the mothers who participated in the Youth Corps also united to jointly move towards the broad road of building Greater East Asia.

This Korean Ocean Youth Corps has a Japanese Ocean Youth Corps Korean Headquarters established in the Governor-General's Office, with the Director-General of Political Affairs as the head, and branches established in each province, with the governor as the branch chief. It designated more than 100 important cities throughout Korea to establish Ocean Youth Corps, finally completing this great goal on Ocean Memorial Day, July 20.

In addition, instructor training fires have been convened in Zhenhai, Wonsan, and other places. The number of members in all of Korea has already broken the record of more than 80.

IV

Niigata, Toyama, and other prefectures that use the Sea of Japan as a training ground recently had the Nagaoka Ocean Youth Corps in Nagaoka, the hometown of the Marshal, all burning with the fire of inheriting the Marshal's legacy.

In addition, the Mikuni Ocean Youth Corps, with the group flag of Admiral Togo's bold strokes, and Fukui, Tsuruga, Kanazawa, Komatsu, and other cities, compete with each other, all under the guidance of ocean warriors and predecessors from their hometowns.

There is also Maebashi City, the hometown of the war god Iwasa, and the nearby Utsunomiya City, Hitachi City, and [blank space] City, all competing with each other and busy with ocean training before the games.

His Highness often visits, and the Yokohama City Ocean Youth Corps, which has such supreme glory, has gradually increased in number and has also increased the ocean training institute.

In addition, Aichi, Mie, Gifu, and other five prefectures centered on Nagoya have developed year by year due to their long history. Today, even Takayama is about to produce an Ocean Youth Corps. From this, we can see how unconquerable the power of the Japanese nation, the descendants of Emperor Jinmu, will be in the Greater East Asia War.

V

The Osaka and Kyoto groups are all busy training in Osaka and Kun [blank space] Lake under the great assistance and guidance of the naval authorities. In addition, do not ignore the excellent and outstanding training of the Himeji City Ocean Youth Corps.

The development of the Ocean Youth Corps in Tottori, Shimane, Okayama, and Hiroshima is also very outstanding. The island [blank space], which has an ancient history of ocean development, is about to establish a prefectural Youth Corps centered on the Shinji Lake Ocean Training Institute. Okayama Prefecture is also determined not to show weakness and strives to train and organize the prefectural Ocean Youth Corps centered on Okayama City.

Looking at the four prefectures of Shikoku, the Ocean Youth Corps, with Kagawa Prefecture as the ocean training institute, has been universally established. The ocean youth warriors of the entire prefecture are actively training with this as the center. In particular, the Awashima Ocean Youth Corps, inheriting the fathers and brothers who have long developed overseas, rush to the seven seas and are determined to live and die at sea.

VI

Then there is Kyushu. In terms of quantity and enthusiasm, the Ocean Youth Corps can be considered the strongest in Kyushu. In particular, Fukuoka Prefecture has the highest number of people in the country. Nagasaki, under the direct leadership of the Zhenshufu, all male and female students from schools in the city have completely joined. Kumamoto and Kagoshima are all striving to practice without falling behind.

What comes to mind here is the National Congress of the Japan Ocean Youth Corps held in Kagoshima City in commemoration of the 2,600th anniversary of the Imperial Era. This Youth Corps Congress, which developed from Mount Takachiho, the center of the hidden history of national founding, to Kagoshima Bay, is indeed of far-reaching significance, but judging from Fushi, the development of the Corps today can be said to be unprecedented.

In Taiwan, the main ones are Keelung and Kaohsiung, and powerful Ocean Youth Corps have emerged one after another.

Since the Greater East Asia War, Taiwan has become a supply base in the south and now stands in a crucial position. Since everything is like this, of course the development of the Youth Corps will naturally develop forward.

VII

The Ocean Youth Corps, as mentioned above, has spread widely throughout Japan. There are now more than 3,000 groups with more than 530,000 members, and the number is increasing day by day.

However, if we think about the fate of a maritime nation, we should not be satisfied with this. To be honest, Ocean Youth Corps must be established throughout the country, even in poor and remote areas. Of course, there is no need to explain now, because the Japan Ocean Youth Corps is an organization that trains Japanese youth to become complete citizens of the maritime nation of Japan. As the war situation becomes increasingly difficult, when thinking about the future of the Greater East Asia War, which is bound to become a long-term war, it is urgent to hope that national leaders, parents, brothers, and the youth themselves must understand and rise up. (Translated by An from the Ocean Youth on the 11th)

### Words from the Marine Laboratory

— Takatsuki Shun

What does the Marine Laboratory research? It researches the various aspects of the ocean, hence its alternative name, the Ocean Research Institute. However, the scope of the ocean is extremely broad, so even knowing its general outline is difficult.

For example, there is ocean physics, which studies the growth of the sea and the ebb and flow of tides; marine meteorology, which studies the relationship between seawater and weather; marine chemistry, which studies the composition of seawater; marine geology, which studies changes in the coastline and the properties of the seabed; and marine biology, which studies the various organisms that inhabit the ocean. At first glance, there are various types of learning.

The original intention of the Marine Laboratory is to study all these aspects of learning. However, not all of them are studied due to the convenience of researchers and the laboratory. What is generally handled is mostly in the field of marine biology. In addition, there are many places that study physics, chemistry, and meteorology together. However, places that specifically study Qi Meng are called marine meteorological observatories, and those that focus on aquatic products are called aquatic product test [blank space], which everyone already knows.

First, I will introduce the marine laboratories of various countries.

Germany's famous marine laboratory is located on the isolated island of Helgoland in the North Sea. It was founded 50 years ago. After the First World War, even when Germany was exhausted, it decided to rebuild the laboratory and equip it with modern facilities. This shows how enthusiastic they are about learning.

In Italy, the picturesque Naples has a marine laboratory. It has large facilities and a long history, but the equipment has not yet been modernized. However, what has been studied here so far has made great contributions to the academic world. This is all mainly based on the study of marine biology.

Speaking of marine research, one must think of Morocco on the Mediterranean coast. Two things are famous in the world about Morocco: casinos and oceanography. Why is oceanography popular in this small country? Because the former emperor was particularly interested in naval studies and built good exploration ships. Buildings such as museums and research institutes displaying collections are all beautifully equipped. However, now that the emperor has passed away, the research institute seems to be following suit.

England's marine laboratory is located in the naval port of Plymouth. What is studied here is marine biology and the marine physics of their lifeline, the English Channel.

The United States has marine laboratories and product laboratories on the island of Woods Hole on the Atlantic coast.

As for Japan's marine laboratories, they are generally affiliated with various imperial universities. Tohoku Imperial University has Asamushi in Aomori Prefecture and Onagawa in Miyagi Prefecture, Tokyo University has Misaki in Kanagawa Prefecture, Kyoto Imperial University has Seto in Wakayama Prefecture, Kyushu University has Tomioka in Kumamoto Prefecture, Nagoya Imperial University has Sugashima in Mie Prefecture, and Tokyo Fatherly University has Mukojima in Hiroshima Prefecture. In addition, there is the Mitsui Ocean Research Institute in Shizuoka Prefecture.

The research of these laboratories has its own characteristics. Taking the laboratory of Tokyo University of Science as an example, I will introduce its research situation.

The Shimoda Marine Laboratory of Tokyo University of Science is located in Nabeta Bay, outside Shimoda Town, Izu. What distinguishes this laboratory from others is that it studies geophysics and marine geography in addition to marine biology. In addition to various research rooms, there is a public aquarium, a collection specimen display room, and a ship for collecting and observing, which is indispensable for marine research.

The first thing that the laboratory's research should handle is the characteristics of the nearby sea. At the Shimoda Laboratory, twice a month, the date is determined, and a fixed location in the nearby sea is selected to investigate the physical and chemical properties of the seawater. This is usually called naval survey or ocean observation. What do these surveys and observations study? Because it involves many aspects, it is not possible to describe them in detail. As an example, the amount of water temperature and salinity.

The water temperature near the Shimoda Laboratory is greatly affected by the Kuroshio Current from the south, but this also has a major change with the nearby air temperature. As for the amount of salt in seawater, there are no large rivers near the laboratory, and there is almost no inflow of fresh water, so the amount of salt will not drop first. However, the amount of rain may be thinner along the coast. However, as long as it is slightly mixed together, it will not be affected, and only the Kuroshio will be affected.

Currently, the research at the Shimoda Laboratory focuses on biology. Some people even say that the origin of life is the ocean, but there are many creatures breathing in the sea. These creatures are naturally studied from various aspects, but first of all, it is the study of floating organisms. As everyone knows, plankton are tiny organisms floating in seawater and there are many kinds. Collected using special nets. This is an extremely important creature for knowing the characteristics of the sea. For example, when a sea current collides with a shallow beach, the things that were originally in the upper layer become the middle layer or the lower layer. However, each layer has its own unique plankton, and after getting close, you can know the changes in the flow of seawater. Also, plankton also changes due to water temperature, etc. Moreover, this is the seafood of fish, and it also fulfills important tasks in aquaculture.

In addition to plankton, the laboratory also uses bottom trawls to capture various organisms and study the biotope of the nearby sea. Moreover, not only the taxonomy of these organisms, but also detailed experimental observations of the characteristics of the living body. For example, take part of the planarian worm collected in seaweed and study the condition of the newly born part. Or cut off a part of the living body and transplant it to another individual to study its development.

Furthermore, speaking of physiology and biochemistry, the digestive organs and the properties of digestive juices of only kinds and [blank space] etc. are studied. Some of these have the same properties as us humans, and some are different. In short, the research in the laboratory cannot be described one by one, and I will talk about it again when there is an opportunity next time.

From the above, Fuka wants to know what the Marine Laboratory studies? Finally, I would like to say what is the meaning of the research of the Marine Laboratory? In other words, why is a Marine Laboratory necessary?

From an academic point of view, as mentioned above, on the one hand, the physical and chemical properties of the sea are studied, and on the other hand, the details of the living organisms living on the sea are studied. However, as everyone knows, the so-called learning is definitely not limited to this. It is to control the air or use the sea. If you want to use the sea, you must first thoroughly understand the conditions of the sea. Otherwise, it is impossible to know how to use the sea. Therefore, learning is necessary.

If our country is a marine country surrounded by the sea on all sides, we cannot help but further promote marine research. The Greater East Asia Sea, which was laid by the hard work of the loyal soldiers, should be studied in every corner, and in natural science, we must also seize new rights. This is our task. (The author is the director of the Shita Marine Laboratory) (Translated by Sho)

### Ocean Training of Japanese Youths — A Day with the Fukura Youth Group of Kanagawa Prefecture —

The roar of crashing waves vibrates through the morning air. In the faint light, huge rocks resemble black cattle on the surging sea. In the east, the morning clouds glow with a reddish hue. Fishing lights twinkle, now bright, now dim. The darkness of night slowly fades away.

Inside the white tents, dozens of group members are still fast asleep in the fresh air of early morning.

At four o'clock in the morning, the wake-up call echoes across the still earth, reaching far out to sea. In an instant, a group of robust young boys, like small silver fish, pour out of their tents.

After the squad leader calls the roll, everyone, naked, silently walks towards the sea, still not fully bright, without a single word spoken. The air is solemn. Above, the stars twinkle brightly. These young boys together chant prayers to heaven and earth for a great victory in the Greater East Asia War. Afterwards, they begin their day's work.

"Learn from the sea, know the sea, use the sea as our stage..." They loudly sing their mission together, silently contemplating why they must accomplish the great task of Greater East Asia, and training their minds and bodies.

"Rowing practice! From boat number one, assemble at the harbor! Head south!"

After cleansing their minds and bodies of impurities, engaging in strenuous activity is truly a supreme pleasure! Boats bearing squad flags successively float onto the water. On the horizon, a distant island can be vaguely seen.

"Ten minutes at full speed! Direction free. Begin!" At the command, shouts arise, and everyone rows with all their might. On the calm sea, the bow of each boat kicks up white waves, and the sound of oars echoes. The future maritime warriors exert all their strength in their toes, waists, hips, and arms, rowing with all their might, as if on a battlefield, single-mindedly speeding across the dawn sea.

"Training stop!"

They can't help but shout several times. Both hands are covered in sweat. The members, fully appreciating the invigorating taste of the sea at dawn, each seek their way back. En route, each dangles a fishing line, trying to catch mullet. In every small boat, silver mullet can be seen jumping.

Breakfast is probably ready back at the camp. Everyone's stomachs feel empty, so they quickly row back, devouring their food with gusto. Some even use the mullet they just caught as a side dish.

Knowledge of the Sea

From seven o'clock in the morning, the lesson is academic. They can hear about various aspects of the sea. Today's lesson is about specimens of southern fish, which the teacher enthusiastically explains. Ah, how endearing is the word "South"! The South is not far, it is within our reach.

At 8:30 a.m., practice begins. The practice varies from time to time, sometimes it is fishing, sometimes it is construction, sometimes it is navigation... There are many varieties, too numerous to mention. Today's practice is measuring water temperature. On land, they listen to commands, and the route and measurements are explained on a nautical chart. Compasses are actively used on the chart. Afterwards, they each carry their instruments and run to the boats.

"Target: the tip of Cape Manazuru!"

"Water temperature measurement at point number two."

"Prepare to measure!"

The commands echo on the sea.

The members each record the items they have measured and create tables. White jellyfish float in the azure sea. But when they think of how their ancestors' blood once stained this sea red, everyone's faces become tense.

Their bronzed bodies are impervious to the summer sun's cruelty. As for sweating, what does it matter? A piece of seaweed clings to the bottom of the instruments they bring up. How heart-stirring this is!

"Point three, 28 meters, water temperature 22.5 degrees." The voice of the report gradually fades away.

At 10:30 a.m., they receive a communication from headquarters that training is over, and they return to port in droves. As everyone sorts their equipment, selects a landing point, and finishes their tasks, the boats reach the shore.

"Prepare to disembark!"

"Begin cleaning!"

All the members scrub the boats they unloaded ashore. They carefully wipe and meticulously repair them, striving to make them even better than the classroom. Not even a single plank is overlooked.

Under the shade of the trees, they open the nautical charts and tables, filling in the measured depths and temperatures. They not only record the temperatures of the upper, middle, and lower layers, but also note the currents and the state of the seawater. Things that were once just tales take on a special meaning. While writing down the results they obtained on a large chart, it is already lunchtime.

Lunch is eaten standing up. This is because at sea there are many times when one must work and eat at the same time, so they are trained to be able to eat freely anytime, anywhere. At first, this seems difficult, but soon they can eat freely.

After lunch, there is a two-hour break. Each person takes a blanket and chooses a suitable shady spot to take a nap. The Pacific sea breeze blows over their bodies, and with their eyes closed quietly, the intense training of the morning feels like something from a dream.

In the shade of the trees, they sing softly, the reflection of the sea sparkling. Their limbs stretch out freely, and their bodies seem to grow larger. How interesting this feeling is!

Swimming Training

At two o'clock in the afternoon, the trumpet sounds again, and swimming training begins immediately. Individual swimming styles are not taught in the youth group, what is taught now is only "group swimming" and underwater operations. Each squad forms a team, with the squad leader swimming in front. Moreover, in this training, they must endure hardship, not only are they not allowed to cry, but they are not allowed to shout for help.

"One-hour long-distance swimming, begin!"

Each team jumps into the sea together, swimming in silence. Squinting, stroking with hands and feet. Swimming and swimming, they gradually become exhausted and their arms sore. Sometimes, flying fish leap out of the sea, which looks really interesting. The tents on the shore become smaller, and the words on the roof cannot be seen clearly. After swimming like this for about an hour, they finally return to port. Everyone sings "I am a child of the sea" with vigor, and treads the path home. Whether it is in Guadalcanal or the Solomon Islands, it is this kind of strength and this kind of spirit that is manifested! Above the island of fire, a large patch of strangely shaped clouds floats.

At 3:30, a critique of the swimming training begins. Everyone gathers on the rocks, gazing at the waterway they just swam through, quietly listening to various explanations. What the tide is like, what the wind is like. Under the teacher's instruction, when they reflect on their own actions, some can't help but laugh wryly. Hearing that some were greatly surprised by seeing the sea breeze, they can't help but burst into laughter.

Evening Work

From four o'clock in the afternoon, the whole group is engaged in preparing dinner. Each squad researches how to cook food from the sea. The group processing seaweed, the group cooking small fish, the group roasting conch shells, all work hard, cooking various foods with unskilled hands. There is a great deal of edible food in the sea, and those who intend to dedicate themselves to the sea must strive to utilize it anytime, anywhere. The expanse of Greater East Asia is extremely vast, and they should receive all kinds of training.

After the meal, they listen to a critique of dinner. Someone hears others criticizing that the things he cooked are not tasty, and he says unconvinced, "My mom cooks it like this too!"

In short, their cooking is indeed of varying quality, but their efforts for the country are always admirable and praiseworthy.

At night, they either practice Morse code signals, or go night fishing, or conduct surveys of aquatic animals. Some are inside the tents, helping the squad leader with nautical chart calculations, or studying how to identify directions by the stars.

In this way, at eight o'clock in the evening, the sound of the end of training rings out, and everyone prepares to sleep. In every tent, sunburned faces can be seen. This face, this body, is the power of Japan. The coast gradually fades into the black curtain of night, in the sound of waves lapping the shore, mixed with the chirping of some unknown insects.

Knowing the sea and living on the sea, the future is far-reaching. Only through such orderly, unified, and rigorous training can one correctly know the sea and be active on the sea. The defense and industry of the sea, helping each other, can achieve excellent results, so we must work hard like this. (Kukawa Hiroaki) Translated from Ocean Youth, No. 553)

### Lessons of Naval Battles

From the Casablanca Conference to the present day, our enemy in the Pacific, the United States, will never neglect the Pacific front due to its domestic situation and its desires regarding Chongqing, Australia, and other Pacific-related countries. Therefore, it has long been within our expectations that the Pacific front will respond to the European Second Front and take some kind of active counter-offensive action recently. As expected, the United States is attempting to knock on the door of our Inner South Seas head-on, Saipan Island in the Mariana Islands, and has air-raided the northern Kyushu industrial zone of Japan.

Needless to say, this kind of restless operation by the anti-Axis side is nothing more than the bravery of impetuousness, relying on the amount of their supplies. However, we must face up to the fact that the world war situation has therefore entered a decisive phase. At this critical juncture, 100 million people should not panic, but should advance towards the battlefield with firm determination. If we can do this, the enemy's collapse is imminent.

### Moth

— Yi Xuan

Every time I visit Qin, she always asks me to stay for dinner, and tonight is no exception. We sit by the window, enjoying the slight breeze of early summer, and a black lampshade hangs over the lamp. Except for the center of the table, which is illuminated, the surroundings are dark.

Qin fills small, jade-like cups with clear rosé wine, raises her cup to me, and says, "Drink! This cup is to wish you eternal youth!" I take a deep sip. To my ears, these words seem full of sadness. Who can hold back the fleeting years?

It has only been two years since I left middle school, but the changes in people and affairs are simply unimaginable. The joys of the past have become sighs of today. Especially after this wine, it is easier to evoke memories of old friends. As these memories arise, we ask each other, as if by agreement, "I wonder how Mei is doing?"

"People may not see each other for life, like the stars Shen and Shang," Qin says with emotion, and after a long sigh, I sink into silent memories.

Mei, that short, plump, cheerful girl, has a pleasingly round face. She was admitted to university and majored in economics. Initially, at the monthly gatherings, her cheeks, like hot apples, still glowed with innocent smiles, and her speech was still as playful and straightforward. But she changed somewhat during the summer vacation of the following year, before the start of the school term. She often broke appointments, and when we questioned her, she often blushed, muttering incoherent reasons. Soon, we changed from questioning to teasing. "Mei has a lover!" The news spread faster than lightning.

Now that the secret was out, she often talked about him to Qin and me, who were closer to her. Whenever she mentioned Hong, her round face became even sweeter and more lovely!

In our eyes, Hong was just an ordinary person. He was short, had unremarkable looks, and a face full of acne, but he was very articulate. Therefore, Mei, who was inexperienced in the world, actually fell deeply in love with him.

Gradually, her cheerful and charming demeanor became very dull. The sweet smile disappeared from her face, and her eyes seemed to hide worries. We asked her with concern, but she just smiled bitterly and said nothing.

Last winter, on the evening of my birthday, after drinking heartily, she finally revealed her misfortune: it turned out that Hong was already married, with two children. Mei had even met his wife, who was a virtuous woman.

We all felt that this matter was easy to resolve, and we advised her to pull back from the brink and cut off the threads of love. Who would have thought that she would say painfully, "It is not easy to destroy a love that has already grown."

"Then can't you love each other as friends?" I said casually. "That's what I intend to do," she whispered.

Qin was a little older and understood human nature more thoroughly than we did. At this time, she said very seriously:

"Mei, it's better for you to distance yourself from him. You are still young, and you don't have the strength to control your emotions. Besides, you already have feelings that go beyond friendship. Stepping into a love affair is like sinking your foot into the mud, the deeper you step, the deeper you sink. And it is difficult to maintain a pure friendship between two heterosexual young people, especially like you. There are only two paths ahead of you, one is to distance yourself, and the other is to become more intimate. Mei! Be cautious, you should choose the first path, you can't continue to contact him, otherwise it will only cause you pain."

I thought carefully and also felt that this was very true. Therefore, we both advised her, explaining the advantages and disadvantages to her in detail. After spending the whole night talking, she was moved by us. From then on, she was indeed very cold towards him, but her heart was also extremely depressed. We each went to see her to cheer her up, but we couldn't invigorate her disheartened countenance.

When the winter vacation started, Hong came to invite her out from time to time, but she painfully refused. He also wrote letters filled with sweet words, which Mei read with tears every time. Finally, after the school term started, their old feelings rekindled, and they were even closer than before. For the sake of a moment's passion, she willingly plunged herself into eternal destruction.

Qin warned her several times: "Mei, don't gamble with your fate!" But she actually said, "You don't understand love, you don't understand me."

"True love will never arise from the impulses of lust." I believe Qin's words, but Mei hated us. Therefore, she no longer saw us, and we couldn't bear to watch her play the role of a tragic heroine.

"Wine enters the intestines and turns into tears of longing." Who says that wine can dispel sorrow? Yet again, "a cup can eliminate ten thousand ages of sorrow"?

After finishing dinner, I said goodbye and left. It was drizzling, and I firmly rejected Qin's offer to stay, walking slowly home in the rain with a drunken feeling. I could not be at peace. The singing of street performers came from the street, as gentle as the lament of a forsaken woman, which made me feel even more melancholy.

Suddenly, there was a knocking sound on the door: "Tap tap..." Who is it? I opened the door and looked down. "It's me." Ah! Mei is here! I hurriedly went down to open the door and welcomed her into the room. Under the light, her face was very haggard, and her wet hair hung messily on her forehead. In this early summer weather, she was still wearing a long coat, but it couldn't hide her slightly bulging abdomen.

She looked slightly shy, looked down at the ground and asked, "Can I stay for one night?" "Yes," I hesitated for a moment, "Did you have a conflict with your family?"

"No, I left home long ago." "Then..." I didn't know how to say what I wanted to say in my heart.

"Things have come to this point, I can't care about your ridicule, one wrong step leads to eternal regret, I have made a big mistake!" She finally sobbed, "We have been living together for several months. At first, he promised to divorce his wife, but then he repeatedly delayed it. Tonight, he actually said a lot of irresponsible words. I was extremely annoyed, had an argument with him, and ran out. In this late night, I have nowhere to go, so I have to come to you."

"Then what are you going to do in the future?"

"I have reached a dead end. He is not willing to divorce his wife, and I am not willing to be a concubine. Now that I have destroyed my own happiness, I might as well destroy my life too!" "No! No! Mei! You can't do that." I really hoped that Qin was here to help me comfort her and encourage her. I am too clumsy with words.

She silently wiped away her tears, the room was deathly silent. A moth was fluttering around the lamp. I hated its disturbance and waved my hand to drive it out, but in an instant, it came back in again. I looked at it carefully and couldn't help but say silently, "Blindly pursuing worthless love is just like this moth flying into the fire. Maybe it can get a temporary feeling of being close to the light, but it will lose its life because of this, and with it, the opportunity to enjoy real light."

The night passed so silently. Although she has now accepted Qin's instructions to rest assured and wait for childbirth before seeking a good plan, we are still worried about her all the time, afraid that her fragile heart will not be able to withstand the blow and will make another mistake.

A message to Mei: Bury the past mistakes forever. The sea of suffering is boundless; turn your head and you will see the shore. You have already made a sacrifice for love. Don't make Hong's wife and children also innocently sacrifice for your mistakes. Don't take love as your permanent home. It is only a small part of your entire life history!

### Ah Gen and Mr. Zhao

— Nakazaki

For the sake of courtesy, people buy things as gifts.

The year before last, my father bought a gift to give. It was very precious! Maybe it wasn't quite precious enough, but to my father, it was already very impressive. Perhaps Mr. Zhao was displeased, thinking that such a worthless thing was actually counted as one of the gifts he received. Perhaps he would even throw it on the ground to vent his anger.

My father lay on the bed all day, depressed and without a smile.

In the afternoon, the craftsman Ah Gen came to find my father to borrow money. I watched Ah Gen's smiling face and humble demeanor as he negotiated for a long time. I couldn't see the exact amount, but I was sure it wasn't much. He feigned a smile, bowed his body, and gave a bow. My father waved a fan at him as if shooing away a fly.

I watched him cross the threshold. I watched him counting the banknotes outside the door. Looking at his shadow, I felt an inexplicable sense of emotion rising up. Seized by a momentary impulse, I called out to him.

"Ah Gen!" He turned around in a hurry.

"Oh! Shao Yi! What? What is it?" he asked with a fake smile again.

"Dad told me to give you these too!"

"Oh! Oh! Young master! …This, …Oh! Thank you! …Thank you! Thank you! Thank you, young master! Thank you!"

"Dad said to give you these as capital. When you make money, you should pay it back. If you can't pay it back, then forget about it."

"Ah! Ah! …Ah! Ah! …Yes! Yes… Thank you, old master! …Thank you, old master! …The old master is so! …Truly!…" His sincere gratitude gave me boundless comfort, comforting me even though my enjoyment of the whole year would disappear from then on, no more ball games or movies. But I tried my best to make myself happy. I could play chess with my classmates, and I could read world masterpieces. How grateful that honest and reliable Ah Gen must be! Later, when he met me, he often asked about my father's health. I replied that my father was healthy.

"Thank God! Thank God!" he would say. During the summer vacation, my father bought a pair of cute little rabbits. They were tortoiseshell-colored little things, with interesting noses, playful ears, and constantly moving noses and mouths. Every movement and jump was adorable. We fed them green vegetables and carrots, and they grew quickly.

We all loved them, cared for them, and hoped that they would have baby rabbits.

The rabbit's belly grew bigger. The first to discover it was my little brother. He shouted:

"Mom! Brother! The rabbit's belly is big! The rabbit's belly is big!"

Because of this, the two younger brothers argued about "whether she is really going to have baby rabbits or not?" Later, her belly swelled day by day, and she finally gave birth to four baby rabbits.

After giving birth to the baby rabbits, the mother rabbit shed some fur. We cared for her even more. Every day after I came back from school, I would first come to see her and stroke her. If I had a free period, I would come back to see her once.

During that day's free period, I ran back again and saw Ah Gen squatting in front of the rabbit cage in surprise and joy, feeding her. "They're very fun, aren't they, Ah Gen!" I said.

"Oh! Young master! Yes,… Young master! You got out of school so early? …This, young master! Do you use a pen? …This,… young master?…" He gave me a red Guan Le Ming fountain pen.

"Ah Gen! Are you giving this to me? Don't do that! Ah Gen! What are you doing? Don't buy these next time!"

"Oh! Oh! Young master! Yes, yes..." He put on a smiling face again, "...Has the old master not come back yet?…"

"Not yet!… Ah Gen! Take it back!… Hmm! Leave it here, don't do it again next time!…"

"Next time, no! Next time, no!"

From then on, Ah Gen often came in to tease the little rabbits whenever he was free.

On Sunday, I was sick and had a very bad headache. My father was holding a banquet, and the people who came were all people like Mr. Zhao, along with their concubines. Of course, the banquet started very late. During the banquet, they elegantly discussed calligraphy and painting, and the women laughed quietly. I didn't know anything else.

After Sunday passed, there was nothing left of the banquet, but the rabbits had given birth to four more.

Soon, the rabbit cage seemed too small. The rabbits climbed all over the cage, bumping, squeezing, and the stench of urine and feces was very unpleasant. My mother suggested giving some away, leaving only two adult rabbits and two baby rabbits, and giving away the rest.

We discussed who to give them to!

"Two to the Zhao family! Two to the Qian family! Then what about the other two?"

"I think," said my father, "let's give them to the Zhao family too! Mrs. Zhao will definitely be very happy, wasn't she that day?"

So the rabbits were given away.

The next day, Ah Gen came.

"Eh! Young master! Why are there only these few rabbits left?"

"They've all been given away!" I said.

"Given away?" he said regretfully. But he added, "That's good!"

"Ha! Ha! What's good about it? You liked them very much too, didn't you? Next time I'll tell them to leave a pair for you too! Haha!…"

"Haha… Young master! Thank you! Thank you!… Has the old master not come back yet?… Hmmm!…"

Despite the opposition of the whole family, I insisted on giving a pair to Ah Gen. Finally, Ah Gen got a pair—the least beautiful ones. And they were both male. He carefully carried them away with his clothes.

Later, I learned that the Zhao family's rabbits died from being played with the day after they were sent. Most of the others died too. My family's two pairs died because my father lost his job and had no mind to take care of them. Only Ah Gen's pair are still lively and clean, and adorable. And only Ah Gen still asks about my father's health from time to time. Tragically, Mr. Zhao selected my father when he was laying off employees.

Although this was three years ago, I still remember it clearly, and I will always remember it!

### Night Sounds

— Kaji

The bread seller has passed through the street and finished the alley; a high-pitched, delicate voice shouts: "Hot bread for sale!"

The setting sun has just fallen, and the children have already gathered in groups to call their brothers and friends to buy bread. The shouts of vendors have risen on the yellow-tiled streets, continuing until late at night.

Inside the hazy yellow circle of light, you can vaguely see short, staggering figures following behind night travelers, one after another. The basket of bread is simply too heavy, and the children have to put down the basket from time to time. They breathe heavily but still try their best to shout. Although their bodies are very tired and their stomachs feel hungry, they can only swallow a mouthful of clear water at the sight of the bread in the basket, pick up the basket, and move on.

They dare not shout in quiet alleys, and in lively places the supply exceeds the demand. The children also dare not sell too far away from home; they wander, wander, just wandering around nearby.

At the end of the lane, the end of the alley, stepping on the fragmented shadows of the moon, a sharp shout from a small throat knocks on the windows of every household. Occasionally one or two families open the door and stick their heads out:

"Is the bread hot?"

"The bread is hot! How many do you want?" They answer as usual.

After completing a transaction, they carefully put away the money and once again stare with small eyes that contain three parts fear and four parts worry. They pick up the basket and look around in all directions for customers again.

It is life that has crushed the innocent hearts of children. Now, they are no longer carefree like spirits of the night. For the sake of survival, they have taken on the heavy burden of life.

The bread seller has passed through the street and finished the alley; a high-pitched, delicate voice shouts: "Hot bread for sale!"

### The Contradiction of Circulation - A Confession of a Woman -

— Ji Xun

... "Jiao, don't you find it strange?" She tilted her head and casually exhaled a puff of smoke, as if mocking herself, and also mocking this stubborn world.

"To be honest, it's really shameful. Although I'm not from a secluded background, I still studied for several years. I can't say how good I am, but I graduated from high school. My family can also be said to be well-off, yet I became a dancer. You can say it's a failure of Chinese education, or my own willingness to be vulgar and unambitious, but this is a fact, a miserable fact!" ...

... "If you want to know how I came out of my family and became a dancer, you must really want to know the details, right? Because it's filled with the air of a *mambo*!"

"In the year I graduated from high school, my father used the topic of 'a daughter should marry when she grows up' to arrange my marriage. Originally, getting married is a good thing, and I appreciate my dad's good intentions in finding me a very rich man, but how old is he? He's old enough to be my father."

"Of course, I couldn't marry such a person, so I opposed it. Daughters opposing their fathers' arranged marriages is very common in Shanghai, but it doesn't happen in our hometown. Under high pressure, the result is predictable. I only had two paths to take: either suicide or leaving my family. But how could I die! Because for life, everyone wants to hold on to it. As the saying goes, 'Even ants cherish life.' So I chose the second path." ...

... "Yes, you are nodding in approval. My serious attitude towards love must be touching!"

"However, what happens after leaving the family? I naively thought that as a high school graduate, it wouldn't be difficult to find a job in society. But after living in Shanghai for two months, the money I brought with me was almost used up. But nothing was achieved. Education taught me the meaning of life, but it didn't give me the ability to make a living. Even being a maid required a guarantor, so I didn't even qualify to be a maid. "I was really at a dead end. Is there a solution? Oh! If it were really a dead end, I wouldn't be talking to you so much here today. Fortunately, 'Heaven never seals off all exits.' Just when I was wandering on the edge of starvation and cold, someone gave me an opportunity, an opportunity to get out of my own situation in the most primitive way, which was to sell my looks and become a dancer." ...

... "When I was at the end of my rope, I naturally accepted this opportunity. Why wouldn't I? Some people advised me not to go, and I appreciate their kindness, but they don't even know what hunger is!"

"Because I have a pretty good appearance, and after a little study of men's psychology, I feel that men are very easy to manipulate."

"............" I couldn't help but smile slightly.

"You don't need to deny it, including you. In short, relying on my skillful methods and beautiful appearance, I'm doing very well. I have clothes to wear and food to eat, and I'm no longer afraid of cold and hunger. Not only that, but I've also become popular. I have supreme enjoyment in life. Although some people criticize my frivolous life and dissolute lifestyle, I don't deny it, because that's exactly what I'm like. I've learned to squander and spend my life in advance, seeking as much enjoyment as possible...."

"Because the dance floor is only a five-year world! Have you ever seen a middle-aged popular dancer! I often think that dancers are like flowers in spring, and when they wither, no one wants them anymore."

"Therefore, for several months, I have been thinking about a question that I had never thought about before, which is the question of my own destiny."

"You can be considered the only friend I've met in the world of pleasure. I'm naturally telling you the truth. I've met many dance partners over the years. If I were to marry someone young, there would naturally be many, but I can only talk about love with them, but I can't marry them, because most of them don't have any money."

"The environment is terrible, isn't it? You know, the more money you have, the more you feel like it's not enough! Now there is an elderly person pursuing me, oh! Not pursuing, but developing an interest in me. He has a lot of money. I really don't know how he accumulated so much money."

"He is interested in me like a commodity, and I opened the asking price as if it were a rare treasure." ...

"Don't be dissatisfied. Money is omnipotent. I think if I'm already selling my looks piecemeal now, why can't I sell myself entirely to him if he can give me financial satisfaction, even though there is an age difference of thirty years."

"Life is inherently full of cyclical contradictions! Imagine, if I really marry an old man for money now, why did I have to leave my family in the first place!" ...

"I have suffered in society in vain, experiencing more hardships, but also overturning my previous view of life. Society is a big dyeing vat; life is inherently a cyclical, contradictory, and organic entity!" And me? Still silent.

### Survival of the Fittest is the Natural Law; The Volleyball League Reveals Strengths and Weaknesses; A Suggestion Regarding Referees

Since the start of the volleyball league, it has only been two weeks. However, the number of teams in the men's and women's groups is relatively small, and with the withdrawal of the Soviet team, the strengths and weaknesses are now clear, the clues are already there, and the situation is set. Following the previous issue, I will describe the battle situation of each game in order, and then talk about the situation of the men's and women's teams.

Zhiqian Shows its Power; Huayan Retreats

Last Friday (the 14th) there was one women's game (the Soviet team withdrew from Group A, so the game against Russian Overseas Chinese A was canceled). Zhiqian first met Huayan, the latter being a very promising team. However, this game seemed unfamiliar to the prostitutes, and both Zhu Wenpei and Zhang Xieyue, who scored in the attack, made more mistakes than successes. Therefore, the Zhiqian team was able to do whatever it wanted, winning with a score of two to zero. Watching Zhiqian's performance, it is indeed much more progressive than the Huabian era, especially the old and strong Zhang Jiasui and Zhu Shifang, and the young and promising Weng Lanqing and Xu Wei, who have the most significant performances. Therefore, the singing of triumph is also dependent on the efforts of these four generals.

Yuehua Improves; Easily Takes Russian B

This election only had one game (the women's Soviet team withdrew, so the game with the Green Team could not be held). Yuehua made its second appearance, and its performance was much improved compared to the game against Huaying. And Mai Bingyao's presence on the field, in terms of attack, has a centralized provider, who can attack as usual, which is the key to winning. And the repeated rescue of dangerous balls by the three rows of Huang Yaohua, Yu Xun and Zheng Shichang won a lot of applause. Russian Overseas Chinese B once defeated the White team, and the ball skills are quite impressive. Ivanov's spike is extremely fierce. It is a pity that the whole team panicked when facing a strong enemy, so they could not avoid a disastrous defeat. Yuehua remained cautious throughout and won with a straight three.

Zhiqian Wins West Qinghong; Russian Overseas Chinese A Defeats Huaying

Wednesday (the 19th) had one game each for women's and men's groups. In the first women's game, Zhiqian fought West Qinghong. The former used all its strength and overwhelmed the foreign women with two to zero, and the revenge of Da Hua against the West Qing League was avenged. The reason is that West Qinghong is really not used to the eating points of the Far East rules, and there are occasional pushing and fighting between each other. The Zhiqian team has been in a good state recently, and there is a famous teacher to guide them. Every day at sunset, they are buried in hard training at the Shanghai Girls' High School stadium. It is no coincidence that they have achieved this result.

The men's group of Russian Overseas Chinese A played with seven people, and actually killed the Huaying team without leaving a piece of armor. In the second game, Russian A won with a huge difference of twenty-one to one, which was beyond our expectations. The Huaying team's talents are not balanced, and they practice less, so how can they not be defeated. In this battle, Tan Yongzhan not only lacked martial arts, but also made many mistakes, which was also a big abnormality. Although Russian A had seven people, the seven people were able to have fierce serves, vicious chops and slams, and winning seemed very easy.

Looking at the current situation, in Group A, only Russian A and Yuehua are competing, while in the women's group, there is a three-legged situation between the Green Team, Zhiqian, and the Three Provinces. The fierce battles and the winning of the championship in the future will be nothing more than these few teams.

Two Strongholds Compete for Hegemony in the Group A Situation

The undefeated players in Group A are the two strongholds of Russian Overseas Chinese A, and these two teams are also the most powerful in terms of strength. Judging from the current situation, Russian Overseas Chinese A is likely to win the championship. The team's powerful serve is enough to make the enemy team feel cold. Especially Lotchiev's rapid ball like a cannonball. Victory against the Huaying team is also very possible. If the Russian four are able to make use of their broadsword skills and Yuehua can use both softness and strength, if they can use more wisdom than strength when they meet, the blue-eyed children may not be able to show their talents. What do you think about ordering the team to do so?

The Women's Group Has Become a Triangular Confrontation

In the women's group, Huayan West Qinghong have all suffered defeats, but the three strong teams of the Hua team have maintained a winning record, and it was expected before the game that this triangular confrontation would be formed. According to the three teams, they are all fighting each other and hiring teachers. The Three Provinces have Liu Hesheng, Zhi Qian has Mr. Zhu and Tan, and the Green Team has Xu Cang. According to the reporter's inspection, the Three Provinces attack better than defense, Zhiqian's attack skills are more novel and varied, and the Green Team's offense and defense are not outstanding, but very balanced. Therefore, it is difficult to make predictions and comments on future gains and losses. Moreover, the performance of women is quite changeable, and the success or failure is uncertain. When encountering strong enemies, there are even more significant psychological changes. The success or failure based on this is certainly not inferior to its own skills. In a word, the Three Provinces have been working hard for more than a year, and they should get what they deserve. The Zhiqian team has put a lot of effort into all aspects and should not be disappointed. The Pa Green Team's volleyball team was hastily formed in this session, and there was no ambition to win.

The Rules Do Not Have Explicit Limits on How Referees Restrict

Finally, the reporter couldn't help but have some thoughts on the referee's strict restriction on jumping during the serve.

According to volleyball competition, the server has to use fierce arm strength to make the ball pass the net, and it is very easy to jump. However, the referee restricts it. The reporter has praised the volleyball rules, and there is no such stipulation. I don't know who proposed this restriction and passed it on to this day. The following is the second rule on serving in the competition rules of the volleyball rules.

"At the start of the game, the first person in the serving order of the serving team should serve the ball with one hand (open or clenched) from the net into the opponent's zone. When serving, the player's feet should stand behind the end line (that is, the place farther from the end line than the net) and between the extended lines of both sides. From the time of preparing to serve until the ball is hit, the line of the feet must not cross the end line."

The rules are only like this, and you can only cross the end line, and jumping does not necessarily cross the end line. Therefore, the current referees do not know what the basis is. Or is it a mistake? The reporter sincerely hopes that the referee's mistake, if it belongs to the latter, then I hope to correct it immediately, and there will be no such restriction in future games. Furthermore, iron sports are inseparable from a jumping movement. For example, blocking and spiking must have a high jump to be successful. Why limit jumping only when serving? I hope the refereeing committee will give me a reply, or adopt my opinion, it would be fortunate!

### All Shanghai Softball League

— (Shan Miao)

Pandas Overwhelm Portuguese Merchants

The All Shanghai Softball League has been going on for three weeks. The Chinese powerhouse Pandas team (Pandas) lost to the Jewish team by a score of seven to two in their first game. The team was originally scheduled to play against the defending champion "Lusitano" Red team last Sunday, but was postponed due to rain. Many spectators went to watch the game because they learned about the strength of the Chinese team from our newspaper. Later, they were all disappointed and returned due to the postponement. Last Sunday, the team met the Portuguese Green team at Jiaozhou Park again, and thousands of Chinese spectators attended. On this day, the Pandas team won again, and the Portuguese Merchants team was completely defeated. The score was twelve to two.

Nine People in the Battle

The Pandas team only fought with nine people during the game (a softball team has ten people). According to team leader Dr. Eason and coach, the team's famous Japanese shortstop Wen Ruixiong was unable to attend due to an accident, and catcher Huang Yingrui suffered a hand injury during practice. Huang Yingrui insisted on playing despite the pain, because the team's other catcher Wang Xiushan and substitute Liang Youwen were unable to play due to illness, so they could only play with nine people. Before the game, spectators on the field, both Chinese and Western, believed that the Portuguese Merchants would definitely win, because the team has the famous football players Fu En and the Petersen brothers, whose dexterity and ball skills are not inferior to their feet, and they hit the ball better than the Pandas team. The reporter was also worried about the Chinese team. It is well known that the Pandas team worked hard to attack, causing the Portuguese Merchants team to be flustered and slaughtered by the Chinese team, leaving no armor behind. The Chinese people on the field cheered and clapped their hands enthusiastically.

Tense Battle

The game was extremely tense. In the first inning, the Pandas attacked first, and second baseman Lu Zhaosen hit a single, followed by catcher Huang Yingrui and first baseman Wang Nianzu, who also cleverly hit the ball and made a full base (Fallbase). At this time, the Portuguese team tried to calm down and defend under this dangerous situation. The fourth batter was the famous Japanese player Liang Yousheng. At this time, the audience all hoped for a home run (Home run) so that all three people on the base could return to the base. Mr. Liang lived up to expectations and made a desperate sound, and the ball flew straight to the outside. Lu Zhaosen and Huang Yingrui both returned to the base and scored two points, and Mr. Liang had already stolen to second base. At this time, no one in the Chinese team was killed (Down). Then, third baseman Wen Tianhua attacked, and with a wonderful bat swing, Liang Yousheng and Wang Nianzu also returned to the base and scored two more points. Tang Weiye and Li Qi were both out on high balls. At this time, the Chinese team had a last chance and lost to left fielder Lao Quansen. The Chinese team scored six points in the first inning. When the Portuguese team attacked, under the strict defense of the Chinese team, three people went up and three people went down, and no one got on base and returned empty-handed. In the second inning, both sides gained nothing. In the third inning, Wang Nianzu scored one point for the Pandas. The pitcher Li Qisheng sacrificed himself and used a short bat to lure the enemy to throw to first base, and Zhong Baoluo stole back to the base to score one point, which was even more commendable. The Portuguese team still did not achieve anything in this inning, and the Chinese team already had an 8-0 lead. In the fourth inning, Lu Zhaosen scored one point in a desperate sneak attack, while the Portuguese team was still depressed under strict defense. By the fifth inning, although the Chinese team had attacked, they were all caught by the Portuguese team's outfield. At this time, the Portuguese team had gradually shown its edge. When attacking, it was Camelov's turn, and he hit a high ball that flew straight to the center field. Zhong Baoluo of the Chinese team quickly jumped up and caught it tightly. Mr. Zhong's posture was beautiful and won a lot of applause. Then Laolkin of the Portuguese team attacked, and with a posture like a splitting axe, the ball was like a missile flying straight through the left outfield. Who knew that Lao Shusen was unwilling to fall behind and caught the ball with a somersault. The Portuguese team really complained about the loss of these two balls. Because if the Chinese team missed one, there would be a hope of a home run and two points. Later, Handerson of the Portuguese team attacked, and due to the mistake of the Panda catcher, he got a double. When the football star Petersen attacked, Handerson returned to the base and broke the egg and scored one point due to Lu Zhaosen's slow throw. In the sixth inning, Lu Zhaosen made another contribution, and the Portuguese team stole back to the base again due to Wang Nianzu's slow throw and scored another point. In the last inning, the Portuguese team was generally defeated, and they still defended desperately, but Tang Weiye and Zhong Baoluo scored two more points, and the Portuguese team had to fight hard to attack, but they achieved nothing under the tight iron wall of the Chinese team.

Overall, the Pandas team's ball skills are indeed excellent, but the team's defense is actually better than its offense. In this battle, every ball of the Portuguese team's attack reached the bat, and they were all outfield balls. If the Chinese team's outfield was slightly worse, they would have been defeated. The reason why the Pandas won is actually because the Portuguese team's shortstop and pitcher are incompetent on the one hand, and because the Chinese team's defense is better on the other hand. Try to observe that in the first, second, third, fourth and seventh innings, the Portuguese team all went up and down three times, and even if there was a single, they could not escape the second base kill. The contributions of this game should be rewarded with Lu Zhaosen's agility in hitting the ball. Zhong Baoluo's locomotive-style stealing of bases made the Portuguese team and the ball being shoveled to the ground. The connection between shortstop Liang Yousheng and third baseman Wen Tianwei made it difficult for the Portuguese team to escape the law. Other players such as catcher Huang Yingrui and first baseman Wang Nianzu all catch the ball steadily. What is particularly worth mentioning is that the Chinese team's pitcher Li Qisheng's pitching is steep and has a curve, and the softness and hardness are measured, which makes the Portuguese team swing empty bats.

In short, if the Pandas team work hard, they will win the championship in the future, I dare to say. However, the team should train more on hitting the ball, because the hitting skills of each member are not balanced, and they are not good at hitting home runs, so they should practice more. Otherwise, if the pitching of Tom butler of the "Lusitano" Red team is lowered, I am afraid they will not be able to resist it. The following is the Pandas team's schedule:

Pandas Schedule

July 23: vs Viking August 20: vs F.M.U, (Philippine Overseas Chinese) September 3: vs Pirates September 10: vs Y.oubs West Qing Team) September 17:: "Lusitano" (Red Team) (Lusitano red)

Each game starts at 9 am in Jiaozhou Park. No admission fee

### Anecdotes from the Football Scene

Pei Cheng Telegraphs: Our Director Zheng Peimin is extremely enthusiastic about sports. Now he is specially organizing the "Fengfeng Cup" ship ball league. The location has been tentatively set at the Huaying Ball Field. The restrictions on joining the team are extremely strict. Zheng Jun is striving to improve the level, so the men's and women's teams may use the invitation method.

Mr. Liu Zhemin of Lianhua Bank is reviewing the details of holding a "One-One Bank Basketball Tournament". Only pure bank employees can participate to promote leisure and exercise. It will definitely be supported by various banks.

Since the Shanghai Sports Association members held an invitation performance last weekend for mesh ball games, the various rafts have gradually become excited again. It is heard that someone intends to organize a senior and junior singles and doubles championship, but I hope it will be realized as soon as possible, so that we can see this seasonal sports competition.

Since the opening of the Hongkou Swimming Pool, it has been crowded with people every day. Being among them, it is believed that it is only the flavor of immersing in the water, so only the skills can be displayed. I sincerely hope that the authorities can find a way to close a few more places so that good swimmers can get what they want.

Football referee Deng Fangliang has been performing refereeing duties for many years, with rich experience and a very sincere person. Unfortunately, Mr. Deng was recently seriously injured by a team in a small football match and is now recovering. This news is an obstacle to rectifying sports ethics, and it is heard that the authorities have serious measures to deal with it.
