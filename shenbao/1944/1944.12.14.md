### Japanese Special Attack and Air Force War Results in the Bapa Sea: Seven Enemy Destroyers and Transport Ships Sunk and Destroyed

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:10 PM on the 13th: Sections of the Japanese Special Attack Units Ishicho, Hachiko, and Danshin Flight Squadrons, along with other flight squadrons, attacked the enemy transport convoy in the Bapa Sea off the west coast of Leyte on December 12th, achieving the following results: two transport ships and three destroyers were bombed and sunk; one transport ship and one destroyer were bombed, destroyed, and set ablaze.

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - Since the enemy landed near Alvera on Leyte Island, Japanese special attack units and the air force have been launching daily attacks, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy's transport convoys, which are urgently trying to strengthen supplies. A section of the Japanese Special Attack Units Ishicho, Hachiko, and Danshin Squadrons also searched for and attacked a powerful enemy convoy off the west coast of Leyte on the 12th, breaking into its center. All of their aircraft successfully struck the enemy convoy, achieving great results and causing the enemy to tremble. In the above battles, some Japanese special attack units and other aircraft did not return after self-detonation. However, it seems that the Japanese aircraft that did not return this time also rammed enemy ships at the same time as the special attack units, perishing together. Being on the front line, whether or not they are special attack units, they should carry out ramming operations with the spirit of special attack units, so that the enemy's material strength can be completely destroyed. As for the names of the Ichiu, Hachiko, Yasukuni, Ishicho, and Danshin air squadrons and the results they achieved, they have also been explained separately in the Japanese Imperial Headquarters' announcement on the 13th. The Ichiu Squadron attacked Ormoc Bay on the 7th, sinking two enemy ships of unknown type. The Hachiko and Yasukuni Squadrons carried out ramming attacks on enemy ships. From this, it can be seen that the results of the Japanese air force's shelling and destruction of three large enemy transport ships and the sinking of ten enemy landing craft must include the results of the Yasukuni and Hachiko Squadrons. In addition, the Ishicho Squadron also bombed enemy convoys in Ormoc Bay and Camotes Sea on the 8th. Japanese escort fighters also encountered enemy aircraft, leading to fierce air battles, but the results have not yet been confirmed. However, at a minimum, they have hit enemy ships and inflicted some damage. The results achieved by the six aircraft of the Danshin Squadron were also considerable, including the sinking of two large enemy transport ships, one cruiser or large destroyer, and two large landing craft; and the destruction of one large enemy transport ship and one cruiser or large destroyer, totaling seven ships.

A certain Japanese military base on the Philippine front, 13th (Central News Agency) - Japanese air force bombed the west coast of Biliran Island, north of Leyte, on the afternoon of the 10th, destroying two enemy sailboats.

### Aichi and Shizuoka Raids Yesterday, Investigation of Interception War Results Underway. Enemy Aircraft Also Invade Tokyo and Shikoku Areas

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 7:00 PM on the 13th: (1) About eighty enemy B29-type aircraft from the Mariana Islands attacked the vicinity of Tokyo and the Shikoku region in small formations on the afternoon of the 13th, and mainly targeted the Aichi and Shizuoka prefectures. The results of the interception are currently under investigation. (2) Although the Aichi and Shizuoka prefectures suffered some damage, other areas had no losses.

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - Enemy B29-type aircraft from the Mariana base have recently launched sporadic raids on the vicinity of Tokyo with small squadrons, while a few aircraft scouted the Hokkaido region. On the 13th, about eighty enemy aircraft attacked, bombing the factory areas of Aichi and Shizuoka prefectures, dropping both bombs and incendiary bombs. On the same day, one enemy aircraft flew from the southwest end of Izu Peninsula towards the Shikoku region, and three others circled near Tokyo to carry out containment operations. The main force attacked and bombed Aichi and Shizuoka prefectures. The Japanese air control units, along with military officers and civilians, fought hard to defend, and the damage was minimal. The enemy aircraft that attacked Tokyo and the Shikoku region did not drop a single bomb and immediately retreated, so there was no damage.

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - At 1:30 PM on the 13th, about forty enemy B29-type aircraft, each in formations of several, attacked the central region of Japan, namely the Nagoya and Hamamatsu areas, dropping several bombs in various locations. The Japanese military immediately launched an interception, and it seems that great results have been achieved. A detailed investigation is currently underway, but the damage suffered is extremely minor. At the same time, one or two enemy aircraft also invaded western Korea and the Gyeongseong-Hansong area. However, because the Japanese interception system in various places was unusually strict, the enemy aircraft fled in a panic.

### Japanese Army Assault War Results in Morotai Island

Southern Front Base, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army assault team on Morotai Island, responding to the air force's attack on the enemy airport and surrounding defense forces, landed on October 16th. From that night until December 6th, they killed or wounded 295 enemy soldiers (including 40 pilots), destroyed ten tents and one machine gun. The Japanese side suffered no damage.

### Burmese Japanese Aircraft Squadrons Sink Enemy Boats

Burmese Front, 13th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese fighter squadron air-raided the enemy military positions at the Kaleva border of the Jaundi Wan front line at noon on the 12th, sinking two boats sailing. All Japanese aircraft returned.

### Han Japanese Military Authorities Relieve Disaster-stricken People

Hankou, 13th (Central News Agency) - Hankou City suffered indiscriminate bombing by Yu-Mei enemy aircraft a few days ago, resulting in innocent civilians suffering unexpected disasters and a tragic situation. Allied military authorities stationed in Hankou. To express the spirit of mutual assistance and shared hardship between China and Japan, they allocated eleven tons of Xian rice, eighteen tons of miscellaneous grains, and twelve tons of wheat, which were delivered to the Hankou Citizens Temporary Relief Committee for distribution to the disaster-stricken people.

### Fraser in Australia Discussing Operational Matters

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Canberra: Admiral Fraser, Commander-in-Chief of the British Pacific Fleet, arrived here yesterday from San Francisco and met with Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for the Army Forde, Minister for the Navy and Minister for Munitions Makin, to discuss operational matters. Although Britain has promoted that the new Pacific Fleet will realize the agreement of joint British-American operations, the United States does not seem to have much expectation for this. According to a recent Associated Press report from New York, the newly established British Pacific Fleet is merely a rebranding of the Eastern Fleet, and it will be difficult to realize the cooperation between the British and American navies in the Pacific theater.

### Japanese House of Representatives Held Yesterday's Member Conference, 86th Regular Diet Meeting

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - The 86th Japanese Diet will convene on the 24th. The House of Representatives held a member conference at 11:00 AM on the 13th, attended by Vice-Speakers Okada and Uchisaki, Secretary-General Obayashi, and various members such as Mr. Eizo Miyoshi. They discussed various matters to ensure victory in the war and fulfill the responsibility of cooperation. The deliberations of the plenary sessions and committees should be carried out in such a way as to provide flexibility in the event of an emergency. After deciding on this fundamental policy on the same day, it was also decided to hold concrete discussions before the session. The meeting adjourned at noon.

### Chongqing Authorities Crack Down on Anti-War Books

Guangdong, 13th (Central News Agency) - Due to the changes in the war situation, the Chongqing authorities have exhausted various methods to prevent public sentiment from wavering and to promote the will to fight since this spring. According to a cultural figure who recently returned from the anti-Japanese war area, the pressure on cultural figures in Chongqing has become increasingly severe since this spring, and special attention is paid to publications. The Southwest Executive Department of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee has established the Southwest Publications Review Committee to review all publications. According to recent statistics, among the thousands of domestic and foreign books on politics, economics, society, and culture, about 60% promote communist ideology. The Chongqing authorities believe that such leftist books are a manifestation of anti-war thought and have begun to ban them. Among the main books in this category are Gorky's "French Revolution and Class Struggle," as well as political and economic commentaries on various countries, and the works of first-class writers such as Lu Xun, Hu Shi, Guo Moruo, and Tian Han, most of which are prohibited.

### Saving and Storing Materials

For four years, this newspaper has been receiving enthusiastic support and generous donations from readers to help students. The number of students subsidized in each session has increased from 1,005 to 4,658, and the amount of aid disbursed has increased from over 30,000 yuan to over 14 million yuan. The average aid received per person has increased from 33 yuan to 3,047 yuan. These figures not only demonstrate the spirit of philanthropy, mutual assistance, and cooperation among readers, but also prove that the belief in saving the country through education has deeply rooted itself in people's hearts. In this extraordinary period, everyone especially feels that the level of the people must be raised, various talents must be cultivated, and the studies of young people must not be allowed to be suspended or interrupted!

Now, the fundraising campaign for the eighth session of aid is underway. Due to the rapid increase in commodity prices, tuition fees for each school next semester will probably be at least double what they were this semester. We estimate that we need to raise at least 30 million yuan in aid to barely maintain the studies of the original 4,000-plus students receiving aid. If the increase in tuition fees exceeds double, and if we plan to expand the scope of subsidies and recruit new students in addition to the original students receiving aid, this amount will certainly not be enough.

At first glance, 30 million yuan is a large number. Currently, the aid deposit is less than 10 million yuan, so we need to raise more than 20 million yuan in the shortest possible time, which does not seem easy. However, based on past experience, we believe that this goal is not difficult to achieve, and it is not difficult to exceed. The aid issued in the first session was only over 30,000 yuan, the second session increased to over 50,000 yuan, the third session increased to 140,000 yuan, the fourth session increased to 230,000 yuan, the fifth session increased to 1.38 million yuan, the sixth session increased to 3.25 million yuan, and the seventh session increased to 14.19 million yuan. Since it was possible to increase by more than 400 times from the first session to the seventh session, it can be said that it will inevitably increase by another two or three times from the seventh session to the eighth session.

Now, prices are soaring and life is difficult. This situation, on the one hand, certainly makes it impossible for many parents to afford their children's tuition fees, but on the other hand, it may not necessarily reduce the public's enthusiasm for helping students. Because the interest rates on all investments have been generous recently, although there are many poor people, the overall wealth of society may not be low. On the contrary, we believe that there are now more people who can donate 100,000 or 80,000 than there were people who could donate 100 or 200 before the war. For those who have the ability, donating tens of thousands of yuan now is easier than donating dozens of yuan before the war.

Dear readers, think about it: How many places in the whole country—the whole world—can still be as comfortable and free to live in as Shanghai? How many families are not displaced, with their families broken and dead? How many people are not struggling, destitute, and hungry? When you think of these situations, how can you not feel that being able to live in peace and have enough to eat is already extremely fortunate? How can you have the heart to waste unnecessary money and exchange it for excessive material enjoyment? How can you have the heart not to work hard to save money, contribute to good deeds, and create happiness for your children and grandchildren and for the benefit of the people?

Now, as long as you have the intention to save money, you can save a considerable amount anytime, anywhere. Reducing one banquet, eating one less snack, watching one less show, or even taking one less rickshaw or pedicab ride is a way to help poor students avoid dropping out of school. Those who have the ability can save more and donate more, which is of course the best. Those who have less ability may as well save less and donate less. Accumulating small amounts into large amounts is also the same way to benefit society and benefit the people!

Saving and storing materials is the most meaningful work and also the most urgent work. This newspaper respectfully asks readers to do their best!

### Political Training Offices Established in Provinces and Cities, Directors Appointed by Military Affairs Commission

Tokyo Special Correspondent's Report

### Reminiscences of the Naval Air Battle off the Eastern Coast of Taiwan

— Shunji

This time, the enemy American forces, boasting of their most outstanding mobile units, attempted to realize their counter-offensive operation plan in the Pacific. Since the beginning of October, it can be divided into three battle phases: first, the naval air battle off the eastern coast of Taiwan; second, the naval battle off the eastern coast of the Philippines; and third, the defense of Leyte Island. In the Taiwan-Philippines naval battles, the enemy American mobile units lost most of their strength, and the landing forces on Leyte Island are also being encircled and annihilated.

Regarding the course of the Taiwan-Philippines battles, news reports have already been made. Now, I will summarize the news from Tokyo and trace the events in order to clarify the general situation of the war:

The Target is Aircraft Carriers

Since the beginning of October, the signs of the enemy mobile units' movements in the Mariana Islands area had already been detected by the Japanese side, and it was also expected that they would invade the Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan as a prelude to the capture of the Philippines. Then, on the morning of the 10th, the enemy mobile units did appear in the Ryukyu Islands, launching air raids on Okinawa with carrier-based aircraft. At that time, the Japanese Navy, for the sake of caution, waited quietly, waiting for the enemy aircraft that had returned to base at dusk. According to the reports of the reconnaissance personnel, no enemy shadows had been found in their patrol area. At this time, other search planes were still continuing their search. At 3:00 AM on the 11th, the Japanese search planes finally captured the American mobile units on the dark ocean with radio wave weapons, slowly approaching them. Judging from their actions, the American mobile units clearly had the intention of leaving the Ryukyu Islands and heading south. After dawn on the 11th, the vigilance in the patrol areas became even stricter, and the American mobile units' intention to head south became even more certain. Therefore, the Japanese army had no choice but to immediately launch an offensive and begin the pursuit. Preparations for the attack were quickly completed.

At 3:00 AM on the 12th, a search plane detected that the American mobile units, divided into four groups, were operating in the east of Taiwan. On the same morning, Taiwan issued an air raid alert.

Was this mobile unit the one that invaded the Ryukyu Islands on the 10th and then reappeared in Taiwan? Or was it another one? Let's not worry about that for now. What matters is that they intended to temporarily settle in Taiwan and carry out a large-scale air raid on Taiwan, which was undoubtedly true. The long-awaited opportunity finally came, and a detailed attack plan was immediately drawn up. At this time, air raid alerts were issued in the Ryukyu Islands area, including Miyakojima, Ishigakijima, and Amami Oshima.

The base, which had been waiting for a long time, suddenly became tense. On the airfield, various elite aircraft were ready to take off, and a short and capable commander gave instructions to his subordinates, who were determined to die to repay the country:

"The target is aircraft carriers, especially fire-type aircraft carriers. As long as we thoroughly strike the aircraft carriers, I believe that Japan will definitely win. I hope everyone will fight to the end in order to destroy the enemy army, and I wish you all success."

Discovering the Wheel Formation of Aircraft Carriers

After the attack squadrons departed, in the dim electric light of the combat command post, Commander Colonel Hisano and all the staff maintained their silence, waiting quietly for the good news from the front. Before long, the routine report from the search planes that had captured the enemy mobile units arrived. Everyone's foreheads lit up. The search planes had already discovered three of the four groups of enemy mobile units and were concentrating on discovering the remaining group. Then, reports of the attack squadrons making contact with the enemy also arrived. The battle had begun! After that, good news kept pouring in, and the first attack was successful.

The night of the 12th was a moonless black night. Near the battlefield, affected by the seasonal winds, thick clouds gathered and rain began to fall at night. The weather was extremely bad, and visibility was extremely poor. This was not suitable for a night attack, but the Japanese air force, which had undergone rigorous training, took advantage of this weather to capture the wheel formation of the American fleet, which possessed large aircraft carriers, on the dark ocean. Among the attack teams that night was Petty Officer T from Yamaguchi Prefecture, who had participated in the naval battle off the coast of Malaya and sunk the British battleship Repulse.

At this time, the rain had stopped and the sky had cleared. Petty Officer I, using the faint starlight, reduced altitude and carefully searched for traces of the enemy. Before long, he made contact with the outer perimeter of the wheel formation. The enemy's defensive fire was very intense. At the same time, six night fighters flew to challenge him. Petty Officer I, while dealing with the intercepting enemy aircraft, changed course and charged forward. However, because he discovered that the target was not an aircraft carrier, but a battleship or cruiser, he changed the torpedo attack course again and finally found a large aircraft carrier, immediately dropping a torpedo. Before long, with a loud bang, a high column of water rose from the sea, and the enemy ship spewed out a raging tongue of fire. The torpedo hit the ship's hull one-third of the way from the bow. Several minutes later, this aircraft carrier sank to the bottom of the sea. At this time, a certain captain also fired a torpedo at an enemy ship. Unfortunately, the plane he was piloting was hit in the fuel tank by enemy fire. He then turned his fiery plane around and crashed into the enemy aircraft carrier.

In this way, in the night attack on the 12th, a total of four aircraft carriers were sunk, one aircraft carrier was destroyed, and the type of eleven ships was unknown. Some Japanese aircraft also did not return. Some of them, like a certain captain, bravely self-detonated, while others could not return to base due to mechanical failure and fuel exhaustion.

Incomparably Brave Kamikaze

By the 13th, the situation was slightly different. From the night of the 12th to 00:00 on the 13th, according to the reconnaissance of the search planes, the American mobile units were divided into several groups and continued to move restlessly in the east of Taiwan. Their intention was, of course, to attempt to raid Taiwan again. After receiving considerable blows on the night of the 12th, they had transferred more than twenty aircraft carriers converted from merchant ships from the rear, intending to rely on quantity to reverse the downward trend.

The attack on this day, like the previous day, also concentrated its efforts on attacking aircraft carriers. Search planes and attack planes departed in turn. Near the battlefield, the situation was the same as on the 12th, with the clouds divided into upper and lower layers, and heavy rain was falling below. This situation was very favorable for the attacking side. Passing through the dark clouds, the enemy fleet could be faintly seen lined up in a single column. They had probably learned from the misfortune of the previous day and changed from a scattered formation to a dense formation. The commander's plane, piloted by Navy Lieutenant Commander Nagai, first charged towards a large aircraft carrier, dropping a sure-hit giant bomb, and crashed into it heroically, person and plane together. Subsequently, the other planes, seeing the captain's courageous behavior, were even more excited and rushed madly towards their respective targets. As a result, three aircraft carriers and one cruiser or destroyer were sunk. In addition, one aircraft carrier, one battleship, and one cruiser were destroyed.

The Enemy Fleet Couldn't Withstand the Pressure and Collapsed

On the morning of the 14th, summarizing the information from various sources, the American fleet, which was originally divided into four groups, had been fatally struck on the 12th and 13th and had reorganized its remnants, shrinking to two groups. Moreover, it was no longer as high-spirited as before, and many of them were injured. Early on this day, enemy carrier-based aircraft again launched air raids on various parts of Taiwan, but the number of aircraft had been reduced significantly. The American mobile units were clearly covering their retreat, so the Japanese army's pursuit battle immediately began. At this time, the army's torpedo bomber squadron also participated in the pursuit, as well as other units. On this day, after the daytime raid, in the evening, the army and navy units cooperated even more closely and launched a night attack. As a result, three aircraft carriers, two battleships, and three cruisers were bombed and sunk, and two aircraft carriers and two cruisers were destroyed. In addition, one destroyer was heavily damaged, and the type of two ships was unknown. Moreover, five enemy ships were hit and caught fire.

In this way, the American mobile units suffered great damage due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese army in three days, and fled south in a hurry, in a miserable state. (Sent from Kyoto)

### Tokyo-Singapore Railway to be Fully Open Within a Year; Material Exchange Will Be Smoother

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - The North and South Japanese armies in the Guangxi Province finally joined forces at Suilu, about 70 kilometers southwest of Nanning, on the 10th of this month. Therefore, the continental longitudinal road has been opened, and the (Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere Express) train from Tokyo to Singapore or Yangon will probably be realized soon. Naturally, those from Singapore, Yangon, or other places to Tokyo will also be realized at the same time. This main line of the continental longitudinal railway will also be realized at the same time. This main line of the continental longitudinal railway starts from Tokyo, passes through Busan, Fengtian, Beijing, and then goes to Hankou via the Beijing-Hankou Railway, turns to the Yuehan Railway and passes through Chongyang, Liuzhou, Nanning, Zhennanguan, enters Vietnam, and passes through Hanoi, Tana Pu, and Bangkok to Singapore. If going to Yangon, a special train can be taken from Bangkok. It is estimated that it is 10,878 li from Tokyo to Singapore, and it can be reached in 9 days and 11 hours. In addition, another route is from Tokyo to Nagasaki, by sea to Shanghai, passing through Hangzhou, Jinhua, Nanchang, and Zhuzhou, and then connecting with the previous route. This route is 5,500 kilometers from Shanghai to Singapore, and it only takes 4 days and 23 hours from Tokyo to Singapore. The distance of the unfinished parts of the route is only 840 kilometers in total, and if construction is carried out, it can be completed in just one year. If Tokyo and Singapore operate once a day, 40 to 50 million tons of materials and 150,000 passengers can be transported in one year. In addition, after the entire line is open, the development of coal and iron newly produced in China, tin fluorite produced in Malaya, etc. can be started. The agricultural products of various places can also be greatly increased. At the same time, good results can be obtained in the exchange of materials, as well as in military, political, and economic terms.

South China Front, 13th (Central News Agency) - Nanning is the last stronghold of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Guangxi Province. After the Japanese army occupied the area, they continued to attack the 65th, 56th, and 159th armies, which fled from Guilin and Liuzhou to the mountainous area northwest of Nanning, attempting to recapture Nanning. The Japanese army advanced fiercely, seeking to easily establish contact with the Japanese Annam Expeditionary Force attacking Guangxi from Annam. This unit occupied Lixu (80 kilometers northwest of Nanning) and Pozhaoxu (90 kilometers northwest of Nanning) on November 29, and Guode (100 kilometers northwest of Nanning) on the 30th. At the same time, a unit of the Japanese army advanced rapidly southwest from the south bank of Lishui. On the 10th of this month, it finally succeeded in contacting the expeditionary force, that is, the Japanese Annam Expeditionary Force. At the same time, the great cause of the continental longitudinal road was also completely successful.

Singapore, 13th (Nanjing Central News Agency) - The Japanese army in South China and the Japanese army in Vietnam joined forces at Suilu on the 10th, and the longitudinal route between Tokyo and Singapore was thus opened. In view of the good news, Mr. Naito, the Special Mayor of Singapore, made the following statement on the 12th: This great undertaking makes it possible to realize direct railway connection between Tokyo and Singapore, which has a great impact on Singapore. At present, there are only 840 kilometers of railway that have not been opened, and the project is said to be completed within one year. Therefore, Tokyo, the center of Greater East Asia, and Singapore, the center of the southern region, can be directly connected. In addition, telecommunications and telephones between Tokyo and Singapore can be connected by using existing electric wires. Now the Japanese military strength has been greatly strengthened, and the day of completing the victory of the war is coming soon. On the one hand, the opening of the longitudinal route will enable closer contact between Japan, Manchuria, the Republic of China, Vietnam, Thailand, Burma, the Provisional Government of Free India, and Malaya. Greater East Asia will be closer, and the concept of Asian unity has been concretely manifested. Therefore, Singapore's mission is even greater.

### He Yingqin Commands the Guiyang Frontline Battles

### Great Naval Battle in the Taiwan-Philippines Waters; Japanese Army Occupies Absolute Advantage; Summary of Minister Matsushima's Speech

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Naval Association held a ceremony on the 12th to commemorate the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. Minister Matsushima said in his speech: Now that the Greater East Asia War has entered its fourth year, China and Japan should work together more closely to prevent the British and Americans from invading China, so as to destroy the enemy's ambition. Japan is now launching a major decisive battle with the enemy, with the Philippines as the center. I will briefly describe the recent battle situation to you.

As the enemy's US leaders have repeatedly said in the past, the enemy's ambition is to retake the Philippine Islands and land on the Chinese coast to launch a final decisive battle with Japan. Due to the difficulties of the European war situation and the domestic situation in the United States, the United States is increasingly deeply concerned about this move. According to enemy propaganda, the 200,000 troops led by MacArthur advanced from New Guinea, and were supported by the full strength of the Pacific Fleet led by Nimitz. It is a large unit based on at least a dozen battleships and about 60 aircraft carriers. The United States divided this into

North and South armies. The North Army was led by Halsey, commander of the Third Fleet, and the South Army was led by Spruance, commander of the Fifth Fleet. They began attacking the Palau and Monete Islands on September 15, opening the prelude to the war. The enemy army achieved slight gains on Monete Island, but suffered great damage in Palau due to the fierce fighting of the Japanese army and navy, and was in a dilemma. Anxious, the enemy army decided to land on the Philippine Islands in one fell swoop, and used Halsey's Third Fleet to bomb Okinawa and Taiwan from October 10 in an attempt to cut off the supply line between mainland Japan and the Philippine Islands. Thus, the decisive battle began, and the long-awaited Japanese Combined Fleet resolutely rose up. The enemy had more than 1,000 aircraft attacking the entire island of Taiwan around October 11. That midnight, the Japanese Combined Fleet Air Force and the Army Air Force cooperated to intercept the enemy aircraft on the sea east of Taiwan. By the 14th, the Third Fleet had been annihilated. The United States is extremely secretive about its damage and does not disclose it. However, the extent of the damage to the United States is

easy to imagine. In November, Mitscher, commander of the 58th Mobile Task Force, the elite of the U.S. Third Fleet, said after escaping back to San Diego military port that it was impossible to achieve results quickly today, when the U.S. supply line has been extended. This prompted the U.S. Fifth Fleet to move north quickly to take in friendly forces retreating from the north, and the elite of the Japanese Naval and Air Force aviation units in the Philippines, which constantly bombarded the Philippines in the Luzon area, continued to be active in this new battlefield, braving the bad weather. However, taking advantage of this gap, the enemy used three divisions of troops to land on Leyte Island from October 19 to 20. The main purpose was to cut off the connection between Luzon and Mindanao, and then to the South China Sea. The surface fleet of the Japanese Combined Fleet resolutely rose up at this moment. The Japanese elite fleet suddenly appeared on the sea east of Samar Island on the morning of October 25, first attacking the enemy's powerful mobile unit and inflicting heavy damage on it. On the 26th, part of the Japanese fleet broke into the enemy transport fleet and battleships anchored in Leyte Gulf, and heavily damaged the enemy ships. Since the

Taiwan waters. Since the naval battle, the total losses of the enemy fleet have been sunk or destroyed. Up to more than 40 battleships, more than 50 aircraft carriers, and more than 200 other large and small ships, as well as more than 1,000 aircraft. This naval battle may be one of the largest naval battles in the Greater East Asia War. We can gain five impressions from this: (1) The strength of the Japanese Navy has occupied an absolute advantage. (2) The defensive power of the U.S. fleet is extremely weak. (3) Japan's strategy and tactics were unexpected to the enemy and the United States, and it took advantage of the situation. The "rush-in tactics" in Leyte Gulf were especially ingenious. (4) The close cooperation between the Japanese army and navy, and the loyal and brave actions of the generals and soldiers, have established an invincible posture. (5) The longer the enemy's supply line, the more difficulties it has. In addition, the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps and the Army Special Attack Corps bravely crashed into enemy ships, and achieved sure-hit and sure-win results. This kind of act of martyrdom is a unique tactic of Japan, which is difficult for the enemy and the United States to imitate, and is especially admired by the world. Because of this practice of sacrificing one's life for righteousness, the enemy took the opportunity to send a transport fleet to invade from the south in order to resupply Leyte Island, and reorganized the defeated ships into

mobile units. From the beginning of November to the middle of the month, it began to operate on the sea east of Luzon in an attempt to reverse the defeat. However, each time it was attacked by the Japanese air force and submarine fleet, and suffered great damage. As for the Japanese army units on land on Leyte Island, they continued to attack the enemy fiercely in bad weather, and gradually gained the support of powerful rear units. As announced by the Japanese General Headquarters the other day, the Japanese parachute troops and airborne troops have resolutely landed at enemy airports, and are still suppressing the enemy with "rush-in tactics". Now the enemy has repeatedly broadcast the difficulties of the Leyte Island battle. On or around December 5, the enemy sent a transport fleet consisting of 78 ships to invade Camotes Bay through the Surigao Strait south of Leyte. The Japanese air force, with the assistance of the special attack teams of the army and navy, bravely intercepted and inflicted heavy damage. However, part of the enemy's forces seems to have landed on a corner of the southwest coast of Leyte Island. Observing the enemy's goal, it is the key point of Ormoc on the west coast. However, the Japanese army and navy have seized the good opportunity to annihilate the enemy and are now working hard. The enemy's landing on Leyte Island has actually launched a major decisive battle between Japan and the United States. After repeated defeats, the enemy is trying to use long-range bombing B29 aircraft to bomb Japanese mainland Manchuria and North China industrial areas as the only means to attack Japanese industries. However, the important industries of Japan have not been damaged at all. The war has now entered its fourth year. China and Japan should implement the true meaning of sharing life and death to save the entire destiny of Greater East Asia. It is also at this time that the United States' tyranny against Chongqing has reached its extreme, such as the recent change of the top leadership of the Chongqing government due to Roosevelt's recall of Stilwell. In addition, the Nelson faction is planning to manage China after the war and trample on Greater East Asia in the name of saving the war situation. The enemy is dispatching enemy aircraft to carry out major activities in order to open up the Ledo Road and try to reverse the decline, but the Japanese army's ambitious operations have crushed the enemy's attempt and attacked and occupied Liuzhou, Guilin, Nanning, and other places, and gradually blocked the activities of the enemy's air force. To this day, the Pacific and the Chinese mainland have become the decisive battlefields for destroying the British and Americans. What we should devote our greatest efforts to is to prevent the British and American armies from invading China. The enemy has suffered great difficulties in resources and manpower, and is mobilizing all its forces to invade China in an attempt to make the entire Chinese territory

fall into the battlefield. We know the fate of Italy today. If the entire Chinese territory falls into the battlefield, it will not only be the misfortune of the Chinese people, but also the misfortune of the entire Greater East Asia. Therefore, we should endure any sacrifices and strive to prevent this from happening. The decisive battle in the Philippine Islands can also be said to be a war to defend China. Secondly, in Europe, although Germany is surrounded by enemies on all sides, it is still fighting hard. Since entering December, the enemy's offensive has become more fierce. It is believed that after the completion of Germany's national mobilization, the German army's morale will be able to inflict a major blow on the enemy. The enemy has repeatedly proclaimed that after the European war situation has made progress, the British and Americans will be able to move their army, navy, and air force from Europe to the Pacific. Now it seems that they want to move part of their forces, but due to the complexity of the British-American relations, it is feared that the movement of their forces will not be as ideal as they want. Also, the movements of the British fleet in India and Ceylon are now being taken very seriously, but the Japanese army has prepared everything and is determined to destroy them. Now the whole world has entered a whirlpool. How to develop the fate of Greater East Asia is an important task that the people of China and Japan will shoulder in the future. I am one of the representatives of Japan. I am fully aware of the past history of China and Japan and the shortcomings between each other, but today is not the time to talk about such historical facts.

The realization of comprehensive peace between China and Japan and the expulsion of British and American forces are the most important issues at present. Therefore, we should inherit Mr. Wang's will and complete Mr. Sun's great nation-building cause. Recently, I visited Mrs. Umeya in Shanghai. The Umeya family had taken care of Mr. Chiang in many ways. When I talked with Mrs. Umeya about the past and saw photos of Mr. Sun, Mr. Chiang, and the current Chongqing generals studying in Japan, I was deeply moved. The soldier I respect the most is Mr. He Yingqin. Mr. He's heroic posture is still in my commemorative album. Also, I saw the wedding photo of Mr. Chiang and Soong Mei-ling at Mrs. Umeya's house. China and Japan were full of such human feelings in the past. Why is there today's conflict? I deeply hope that the dear gentlemen in Chongqing will compare the recent policies of the United States with Japan's new policies.

Please consider carefully. Japan today already has an invincible war result posture and is fighting against the British and Americans. In the fourth year of the war, Japan's only hope is to expand the results of the war and complete the foundation of the great cause. Chinese youths have the heavy responsibility of solving China's destiny and building Greater East Asia in the current great transformation of the world. Today, it is not difficult for China to exist independently from the international situation. China must complete the great cause of nation-building in the international situation and become the center of Greater East Asia. Mr. Wang and Mr. Touyama Mitsuru, who died before and after, were Japanese elders who realized Sino-Japanese friendship. I am willing to inherit Mr. Touyama Mitsuru's will and work with you to complete the great cause with Asia. Finally, I hope that Chinese youths will overcome any difficulties and bravely move forward towards a bright future.

### Electricity to be Supplied to Military, Civilian, and Industrial Factories in Advance; Economic Bureau Agrees with Central China Water and Electricity

It has been found that the amount of electricity used for production by various factories in the city was previously determined by the Municipal Economic Bureau, which issued a notice to all manufacturers, ordering them to register with the bureau before the end of October, so as to conduct a joint investigation with the Public Utility Bureau and Central China Water and Electricity Company, and to adjust the electricity supply according to the nature of the products, the amount of production, and the degree of urgency. Now that the deadline has passed for a month, the bureau has submitted its opinions on the findings of the investigation and has reached an agreement with Central China Water and Electricity and relevant authorities that electricity will be supplied in advance or the original amount of electricity will be restored to manufacturers of military and civilian daily necessities, so as to concentrate production. This measure will soon be seen in fact. Therefore, manufacturers who have not yet registered but are indeed related to military and civilian needs should register with the fourth section of the bureau immediately, otherwise the line will be cut off.

### Economic Authorities Determined to Suppress and Stabilize Prices with Full Force; Allied Nations Willing to Assist

After the city's economic police conducted a comprehensive inspection of various commodity prices, most immediately fell, and the rest remained stable. Recently, a group of cunning merchants, who had been lying dormant for a long time, began to spread rumors again in an attempt to revive their manipulative schemes, leading to a new wave of price increases for various goods. The city's Bureau of Economic Affairs, in order to implement its fundamental goal of suppressing and stabilizing prices, is currently paying close attention and has decided to continue taking strict measures with full force, without shying away from any difficulties, to achieve the purpose of balancing prices and ensuring the people's livelihood. It is also reported that the heads of various Allied agencies have expressed great concern about this and have indicated to the city government their willingness to provide full assistance. Furthermore, the Economic Security Office, facing a shortage of manpower due to the intensity of its work, is increasing the number of investigators in order to expand the scope of investigations, strengthen the organization, and severely crack down on those who hoard, manipulate, and arbitrarily raise prices.

It is also reported that the soaring prices of goods have seriously threatened the lives of ordinary citizens, who earnestly hope that the Bureau of Economic Affairs will keep its word and take effective and thorough measures to avoid repeating the past pattern of inconsistent enforcement, which would only drive the people's livelihood into a more desperate situation.

### Nanshi Reorganizes Baojia System, Adopts Lianbao System

The candidates for the Zonglian Baozhang, Lianbaozhang, and Baozhang positions within the district have all been internally determined, and a list has been prepared. Yesterday, Gu Jiwu, the director of the Baojia Office, made a special trip to Nanshi to provide guidance on Baojia matters and established close cooperation with the Nanshi police sub-bureau. Once the final decision is made, the list of candidates for Lianbaozhang in the district will be officially announced.

### Youth League Dedicates Scrap Metal

The Shanghai Special City Practice Committee of the China Youth Practice and Asia-Wide Struggle Movement has issued a notice to all schools in the city to promote the youth's scrap metal donation campaign.

### Please Mobilize Collective Donations from All Banks and Money Shops

Yesterday, we published a request for all sectors of society to sponsor the "Special Solicitation" with the power of "collective" contributions. We are very pleased that the Zhengwei Pharmacy colleagues were the first to respond and pledge to donate a team, which is truly commendable. Judging from the situation of team pledges and donations over the past fourteen days, it is truly disappointing! Our newspaper's budget estimates an average daily intake of 700,000 National Currency units, with a monthly intake of 20 million National Currency units. However, the current shortfall is significant, causing us great anxiety! In fact, we are not anxious for ourselves, but for the more than 4,000 impoverished students who are eagerly hoping for enthusiastic donations from all sectors of society, but the reality is not so, and it seems that people are adopting a "hands-off" attitude.

Today, we are making an urgent appeal to the banking and money industry, hoping that colleagues in the money shops will follow the method we set yesterday, mobilize the power of "collective" contributions, and implement team pledges. There are a total of five to six hundred banks and money shops in Shanghai, with at least two hundred having a long history and outstanding reputation. We only hope that these two hundred shops will come forward to support us first, with each shop forming a team of both labor and management, then there is a possibility of success for three to four hundred teams. The money shop industry is the mother of all industries, leading the financial sector and the guiding force of industry and commerce, and we trust they will express their sympathy.

Zhengwei Colleagues Collectively Sponsor

A letter from colleagues at Zhengwei Pharmacy on Jiujiang Road reads: "We, the undersigned, have friends who wish to celebrate Mr. Yu's 50th birthday. We are transferring the sum of 20,000 National Currency units originally intended for his birthday celebration to your newspaper's eighth National Reader Assistance Fund special solicitation team, as a response to the 'collective sponsorship.' Please list it under the name 'Celebrating Yu's Birthday Team' and issue a receipt."

Eighth Shenbao Reader Assistance Fund Special Solicitation Team

Twenty-Seventh Team: Wang Xianjun Team, donated 20,000 National Currency units. Twenty-Eighth Team: Ren Maoting Team, donated 20,000 National Currency units. Twenty-Ninth Team: Celebrating Yu's Birthday Team, donated 20,000 National Currency units. Total received: 60,000 National Currency units. Remaining balance: 1,440,000 National Currency units.

We are deeply grateful to Mr. Wang Xianjun, Mr. Ren Maoting, and colleagues at Zhengwei Pharmacy for forming teams with the congratulatory gifts for Mr. Yu's birthday. If expenses on celebrations can be slightly reduced and transferred to student aid, it would benefit relatives and friends and have profound significance.

### Fresh Meat Supply Gradually Increases, Market Prices Fall

Recently, the market price of fresh meat in the city has soared. After repeated control by powerful authorities, the source of pigs has become very smooth, and purchasing merchants are also actively operating directly. Therefore, since yesterday, the price of fresh meat on the market has fallen from more than 400 National Currency units per city catty to 380 National Currency units. According to business people, there is a possibility of a further decline in the near future.

### Viewing Mr. and Mrs. Lang Jingshan's Charity Exhibition

— Le Tian

Mr. Lang Jingshan's photographic art is not only famous throughout the country, but also internationally renowned, so it needs no introduction. In recent days, at the invitation of the Xinwenbao and this newspaper, he has presented masterpieces and paintings by his wife, Lei 　Zhi, and daughter, Lang Yuxian, totaling 200 pieces, on display at the Daxin Painting Gallery. Among them, the ten most valuable pieces have been completely donated to the two newspapers to fund student loans, specifically to aid students specializing in agriculture and engineering. Mr. and Mrs. Lang's enthusiasm for helping students is truly admirable.

Yesterday, this reporter appreciated his works at the exhibition for two hours, which can be described as a feast for the eyes, with no regrets. Unfortunately, I have no in-depth study of photography, nor the skill to describe it in detail. According to my investigation, 60% of the displayed photographs have participated in international photography exhibitions. In particular, "Huanghai Qifeng" has been exhibited in international exhibitions more than 50 times, and was voted the most popular by the audience at an exhibition in India. "Fishing and Returning Without 　Boat" won a gold medal in Chicago. These two pieces have been included in the world's masterpieces.

The ten pieces that Lang donated to the Xinwenbao and this newspaper to fund student loans are titled "Qinglan Qingxiao," "Hongshu Qingshan Hao Fangchuan," "Qifeng Jiashu," "Yun Zheng Richu," "Fishing and Returning Without 　Boat," "Tijing Lan Yu," "Shancun Chu Jia," "Chicha Fengyun," "Puxian Statue," and "Haowai Yi." These ten pieces are priced at 50,000 yuan for competitive bidding. Enthusiastic 　-eyed individuals who purchase them will not only enjoy the fame of helping students, but also obtain masterpieces by famous artists, truly a rare and joyous event in life.

According to my amateur opinion, Lang's photographic techniques, in addition to composition, lighting, and layout, which are all superb, the most unique is the technique of "combination printing," which is difficult for ordinary photographers. What is "combination printing"? It is the method of using truncation and supplementation to add several good images to this unattractive image. Sometimes, an ordinary photograph is made into an extremely beautiful photograph through three or four "combination printing" methods. For example, in the piece "Dream," he initially photographed a lion, and the picture turned into three lions, with a naked beauty sleeping next to them. People who do not understand the "combination printing" method will be suspicious, thinking how can a beauty sleep naked next to three lions? This is all the use of "combination printing" techniques. According to Lang: "According to international practice, photography is not colored. This time, in order to express Eastern colors and cater to the tastes of the general public, most of them are colored, and I am grateful for the assistance of Mr. Chen Bingqin." "Combination printing" works are mostly unique and not reproduced. This time, Chen Yong 　, Ye Yuhu, Xia Jingguan, Wu Hufan, Qian Ya, Ma Gongyu, Huang Benxuan, and Chu 　 have inscribed poems, adding a lot of color. Today is the fifth day of the charity exhibition, which will close on the 20th. Gentlemen from all walks of life who wish to broaden their horizons, why not come!

### Travelogue of Wuhan (III)

— Yoshida Toyu

The next day, I went to Wuchang in the morning to keep an appointment. On the return trip by boat, everyone was discussing the tragic bombing of the night before. Inadvertently, I began to listen carefully to the passengers' conversations. The great fire caused by the incendiary bombs last night was in the refugee area of Hankou. This area had never been bombed before. Therefore, as soon as the bombing of Hankou became intense, the residents of the former French Concession and the British Concession ran to the refugee area to take refuge. I had inspected the refugee area once two or three days ago. It was a place with narrow roads, dilapidated houses, and a dense population. Even if you wanted to dig air-raid shelters, there was no place to dig. Moreover, what the American planes 　did last night was to indiscriminately drop incendiary bombs without distinguishing military facilities. The houses of people who thought they were sitting pretty became mountains of flames in the blink of an eye. In a panic, they wanted to escape outwards, but they were squeezed back by people carrying things to escape, and they could only desperately roll into their vortex, rushing left and right.

Burnt wall fragments and collapsed bricks and tiles kept falling on their heads. There may still be living people under the collapsed houses, but no one has the strength to care about other people's lives. In an instant, the flames above, like raging waves overturning mountains and seas, swallowed up the people running for their lives, and the people were immediately burned like roasted pigs.

As soon as the ship I was on arrived at the shore, I immediately ran to the place where the fire was. There were still embers there, but some people had already returned home to sort out the remaining items in their homes, and some were helping to prop up the collapsed walls. There were also children looking for their father's body, and mothers who were crying because their babies had been burned to death. "Liu Kaibang," a fish restaurant famous for its pufferfish dishes in Hankou, was also burned to the ground, with not a single tile remaining. The king of braised fish, Liu Kaibang himself, was also burned to death in his own house. A famous tailor surnamed Zhou was left alone, and his whole family became burned ghosts. He himself had gone mad and was shouting everywhere in the city, "It's over, it's over." A famous lawyer 　 in Hankou was the opposite of Zhou the tailor. He died alone, while his family of eight was spared because they lived in the French Concession. When the family returned, the house was gone, and the family head they relied on was also gone. In one night, they became homeless wanderers. Countless tragedies of this kind were constantly being spread by people surrounding this piece of rubble and scorched earth. Coffins of poor quality were piled up everywhere. Among them, of course, were the "military facilities" that had been completely destroyed last night. There must still be many corpses buried in the still smoking rubble. The nearby area was filled with the stench of burnt flesh. At this moment, I suddenly saw many people gathered together in a circle. I looked and saw that they were carrying a new corpse into a coffin. The lid was still open. Inside was a completely black lump of meat. Both legs had been cut off, and the white thighbones could be seen at the cut. It was really hard to recognize that it was a human corpse. This lump of meat may have stood on the Yellow Crane Tower yesterday and sighed at the long history, or may have carried the autumn moon on the Yangtze River and been in sweet love. If it does not rain in Hankou tomorrow night, there will definitely be an unknown number of corpses appearing in the sky again, just like last night. Perhaps those who are now gazing at the corpses in a trance will become the same lump of meat tomorrow and be gazed at by others. But these people are not afraid, but just stare at this burnt lump of meat. As I looked at it, it seemed that these people were carefully observing their own inevitable future fate.

Yangtze River

An old friend bids farewell to the Yellow Crane Tower in the west, and descends to Yangzhou in the misty, flowery March. A lone sail, a distant shadow, vanishes into the blue sky, and only the Yangtze River flows to the horizon.

Only by standing on the Yellow Crane Tower can you truly appreciate the greatness of the Yangtze River, which is sung in Li Bai's poem. Although Du Zimei once chanted "The river comes from Guan Kou," the Yangtze River does not originate from Guan Kou in Sichuan Province, but from the Tanggula Mountains on the Tibetan Plateau and the western Kunlun Mountains. The snow accumulated in the Kunlun Mountains melts into water and flows into the Jinsha River in Sichuan, Xikang, and Yunnan provinces, a rushing torrent that flows through cliffs and gorges, and cannot be used for boating until it reaches Yibin (Xuzhou) in Sichuan Province. Even at Baidicheng in Fengjie County, at the eastern end of Sichuan Province, the current is still very rapid, and the boats are like arrows, and the wonderful scene of "The monkeys' cries on both banks cannot be stopped, and the light boat has passed ten thousand mountains" continues. But when it flows near Yichang, the Yangtze River calms down. And the river becomes wider. When it flows under the Yellow Crane Tower, 　it combines with the water of Dongting Lake, and becomes even wider, becoming a vast, turbulent current without embankments, majestic and high-spirited, rushing east. Thus unfolds the magnificent scene of "Stars hang down on the vast wilderness, and the moon surges on the great river." If the Yellow River is called the Sorrow of China, then the Yangtze River can naturally be called the Joy of China. This is definitely not just a judgment based on the scenery. In terms of the influence it has on the lives of the Chinese people, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River also have such a clear distinction. The Yangtze River connects almost all the lakes and streams in its basin, forming a good irrigation system for the rice paddies in central China. This river basin has created the most densely populated place in the world, and the variety of agricultural products is extremely diverse. Plants and animals also have all kinds of species that should be found in subtropical, temperate, and cold zones. In the area through which this great Yangtze River passes, there are still Tibetans who maintain a semi-independent Buddhist aristocratic politics, 　　tribes who continue the samurai class's building system, Miao tribes who still practice chaotic marriage and polyandry, and 　tribes whose buttocks have fleshy tails.

According to ichthyology, the number of species in this river basin reaches more than seventy, which can be truly called the "Kingdom of Carps." There is no salmon in the Yangtze River, but there is the Yangtze beaked sturgeon, a relative of the Russian Black Sea 　shark. In addition, Dongting Lake often has the white Nag dolphin with a sharp beak. In the Yangtze River from the estuary to Hankou, there is a small whale-like porpoise (The Indian river porpoise) that swims up the river from the sea.

As for vertebrates, there is the world-famous Sichuan panda (Giant panda), which is the most valuable species in the animal taxonomy between bears and raccoon dogs. As for tigers and leopards, they are not uncommon along the Yangtze River basin, and there are also 　fish. The Chinese are not very concerned about this kind of natural science along the Yangtze River. Perhaps it is because the Chinese have always been busy praising the Yangtze River with literature! But whether it is uncultivated people or animal life, as long as they are studied in detail, there will definitely be produced literature that Chinese people do not know. It is a pity that the Chinese have not done this. Emile Ludwig, a famous biographer, wrote a biography of the Nile River in 1936, "The Nile the Life Story of a River." How wonderful it would be if a Chinese writer also wrote a biography of the Yangtze River! When Emile Ludwig stood on the banks of the Nile, he felt that this river was like a great man with life, and when I stood on the Yellow Crane Tower and looked at the Yangtze River, the same feeling arose spontaneously. The water of the Yangtze River is indeed turbid, and the scenery of the Yangtze River is quite ordinary, but the water volume, width, length, and depth of the Yangtze River can always be called a giant among the world's rivers. If the Chinese revolution succeeds in the future and can fully utilize the natural power of this giant, then the face of China will definitely be completely renewed. Just as the Aswan Dam has been built, and the desert in the lower reaches of the Nile has been transformed into fertile farmland, just as the Dnieprostroy hydroelectric power plant has been completed, and a great industrial city has suddenly appeared in the Dnieper River basin, if the huge water power possessed by the Yangtze River is utilized to generate electricity, then China will no longer have to worry about insufficient power. If so, then many great industrial cities that the Chinese have never dreamed of will definitely appear in the Yangtze River basin. But, in order to realize such an era, the revolutionary task of China—independence and autonomy—must first be completed. When independence and autonomy are thoroughly realized, and national capital builds industrialization along the Yangtze River, then the phrase "Asia for Asians" will have true meaning.

When we think of the mere 40 million Japanese, who have even generated tremendous productive forces since the Meiji Restoration, then the China with 400 million people and the huge natural power of this Yangtze River, after completing the national revolution, will generate what a great productive force in Asia, and it is predictable.

Like a giant snoring loudly in sleep, quietly, yet powerfully flowing, this Yangtze River, in front of me, cannot help but make me continue to think about these things. (End) Translated by Lu

A Short History of Guang Sheng Xiang Sock Factory by Ren He

Guangshengxiang Sock Factory was founded by Mr. Qianchu, the grandfather of Mr. Yu Zhijing, a famous knitting expert and big entrepreneur. It started in the 7th year of Xianfeng in the late Qing Dynasty. In the early stage, it was opened on Qipan Street, Sima Road. At that time, foreign goods had not yet been imported in large quantities. All places regarded Guangdong goods as important, and all areas north and south of the Yangtze River regarded this company as the general hub for procurement. Until the 　3rd year of Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty, it was moved to the western end of Henan Road, Sima Road to continue its business. At that time, Mr. Yu’s elder brother, Youpei, realized that the national situation was in danger and that promoting industry was not enough to save the country, so he invented the manufacture of mercerized silk socks in Guangdong and created various novel colors, which were sold in Hong Kong and Macao. At that time, Mr. Zhang Shaotang, the manager of the company, 　transported a large number of mercerized socks to Shanghai for sale and used his eloquence to the fullest. The storefront was called a sock factory, and this was actually the first. Later, due to the development of business, many affiliated companies were added one after another, such as Nanyang Sock Factory, Dadong Machine Factory, and Qin Yu Textile Sock and Shirt Factory. The Liuhe Company, as it is known in the market, is also the most famous Steamer, Black Cat, Crystal and 　Bo brand silk thread socks, all of which were originally sold by the company. In recent years, Mr. Yu has made further expansions in response to environmental needs, and has moved the company to the most prosperous area at the western end of Shilu, Nanjing Road. It is reported that the decoration has been completed recently and will open on the 16th of this month. At that time, there will be a grand scene. It is also reported that Mr. Yu 　Jing is currently serving as the general supervisor of the company, while Mr. Zhang Shaotang, who has been working for more than 30 years, is still the general manager, and Mr. Yu Yanji, Mr. Yu’s nephew, is the deputy general manager, and Mr. Liang Yuanjing is the manager.

### Thinking of Increasing Resources From Scholarship Aid

— Zhang Shizhou

Another new semester is about to begin, and only two months remain. The scholarship funds for the next semester are not yet firmly secured, causing concern. Whether the thousands of students who applied for aid in the previous term can continue their in-depth studies without being affected by price fluctuations depends on whether Shanghai society, after repeated appeals from the Shen Bao, continues to maintain their concern for the future of China!

Now, new strategies for increasing scholarship funds are listed below. It is hoped that readers and the broad intellectual class will generously offer insightful corrections.

(1) Free School Places: Every year-end, wealthy merchants and powerful companies throughout the city should extract some funds from their huge revenues and directly pay them to schools. This would accommodate talented individuals who are praised by the individual company, and those recommended by the school, and continually maintain their tuition fees every semester until they graduate. It is best to also organize a committee to specialize in this matter, so as to achieve twice the result with half the effort. If this trend becomes popular, countless talents who are about to be buried will undoubtedly have the opportunity to raise their heads again. After refinement, they can serve the country. The large-scale training of special and professional talents relies on this.

(2) Percentage-Based Scholarship Aid: The huge amount of daily retail sales and transaction funds of major companies throughout Shanghai is astonishing. If they can automatically and universally carry out percentage-based scholarship aid, or specially select a day to collect attached scholarship donations, the results will be considerable. The percentage for scholarship aid can range from 1% to 10%, depending on the company. The attached scholarship donations are entirely voluntary from customers, and the amount should ideally be only one li, solicited voluntarily by the staff. Since the amount is small, and based on the principle of doing good is the greatest joy, customers will naturally comply. Little by little, a huge sum of tens of millions of yuan can be established immediately. Every time a customer completes a transaction, the staff should give a specially printed two-part receipt with the seal of an impartial organization (one part is kept by the store for submitting the donation). Once the accumulated amount reaches 1,000 yuan, it should be immediately submitted to the Shen Bao or other designated collection agency to complete the procedure. It is hoped that the enlightened members of the city's industrial and commercial sectors can set an example and take the lead immediately, which will surely receive a great response.

(3) Penalties: Recently, the authorities have implemented a fourth round of water and electricity conservation, reducing consumption by another 50% based on the original limit. There is no doubt that the number of penalized users will increase significantly. The amount of fines is expected to be substantial. It is hoped that China Water & Electric and French Water & Electric companies can adhere to the principle of taking from society and giving back to the public, and donate the increased penalty income entirely or partially to scholarship funds. This would truly be a wise and appropriate measure, and the various misunderstandings and criticisms that the public has had about the two companies in the past can also be dispelled invisibly. Millions of poor and outstanding students are waiting for your support. It is hoped that all powerful members of the city can unite and respond broadly, not just being satisfied with maintaining existing achievements. Then, China's national fortune can, due to the reduction of illiteracy, gladly turn towards a more glorious and splendid path in the near future.

The Difficulties of Implementing a "Half-Day School System" — Zuo Qi

The National Forum on November 30 published an article entitled "The Problem of School Classes After Air Control and Power Saving," which proposed that schools adopt a half-day school system after power saving. It said, "...All schools in the city should uniformly adopt a half-day school system, from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM, ...all should perform morning exercises, ...". The author has some humble opinions, stated as follows:

(1) If classes start at 8:00 AM (and if morning exercises are strictly enforced, students must arrive at school by 7:40 AM), students must get up no later than 6:30 AM. At this time, the sky is not yet bright, which will inevitably increase the lighting time in students' homes, contradicting the purpose of saving electricity.

(2) If all schools in the city uniformly adopt a half-day school system, what about teachers who originally had concurrent classes in both the morning and afternoon? If they give up part of their concurrent classes, how will teachers whose lives are already strained make a living?

(3) Because housing is difficult to find and school buildings are insufficient, how can this system be implemented for those who already have morning and afternoon classes (such as Shanghai Municipal Yucai and Gezhi Middle Schools, one attending in the morning and one in the afternoon; Qingxin Girls' Elementary and Middle School, the middle school attending in the morning and the elementary school attending in the afternoon)?

(4) Young students who enter school at 7:00 AM need to wait until about 1:30 PM to have lunch, which is harmful to their health.

The difficulties in implementing a half-day school system are as mentioned above. Therefore, before actual implementation, the above points need to be considered.

### Relieving Poor People in Winter: Red Swastika Society Plans to Set Up Winter Shelters, Master Ku Qi Generously Donates Five Million Yuan

The Shanghai Branch of the World Red Swastika Society, in view of the suffering of the poor in winter, has set up a porridge kitchen in Xieqiao, Nanshi, which will open soon. Recently, a letter was received from Master Ku Qi, who vowed to set up a shelter to save the poor and entrusted the society to organize it. All expenses for clothing, bedding, and food will be provided by Master Ku Qi himself, and he first handed over 5 million yuan of national currency to the Swastika Society for preparation. It is said that the Society expressed great sympathy for Master Ku Qi's enthusiasm and determination and has agreed to accept the donation. They are now actively preparing food, clothing, and bedding and have stipulated that they will start accepting 400 male poor people from the 11th of this month. The method will follow the regulations of the vagrant training center. The Society has sent letters to various management offices to collect and send the poor to the Swastika Society. Only those who pass the doctor's examination will be accepted.

### Great China Factory Generously Donates Fifty Sets of Winter Clothing

A letter from Great China Rubber Factory Xingye Co., Ltd. states: "To whom it may concern, there are many who indulge themselves, and there are not a few who are impoverished and unable to extricate themselves. In view of this, our factory has made 50 sets of cotton-padded clothing. However, we do not have a proper plan for distribution. We have long admired your office for handling relief in a practical and realistic manner. Therefore, we have instructed someone to deliver the clothing. Please check and accept it. Although the number is small, it may be of some slight help." The Great China Factory's charity is admirable. In addition to properly distributing the delivered winter clothing, we hereby express our gratitude on their behalf.

### The Pain of Losing Eyesight Will Be Forever Remembered

There is a Mr. Xie whose son unfortunately died in a car accident in September. Now that the hundredth day has arrived, he specially donated 50,000 yuan as winter relief funds to leave a permanent memorial. We hereby express our gratitude on behalf of the impoverished recipients. The original letter is as follows: "To whom it may concern, my second son, Shizhang, was 24 years old. This summer, in June, he graduated from the Engineering Department of Datong University, ranking among the best, and twice received the Fei Gong Scholarship. He was deeply valued by his teachers. At the beginning of July, he joined the Shanghai Administration Bureau of China Central Railway, serving as a member of the Engineering Department. Unfortunately, on September 22, while returning to Shanghai from Jiaxing to inspect a project, he was involved in a tragic car accident on Maigen Road and died. His colleagues and friends were all saddened. We are grateful for the condolence money of about 50,000 yuan from the Hua Tie authorities and fellow comrades. In addition to a simple burial, we also reduced customary wasteful expenses. Now that the hundredth day of my deceased son has arrived, we will use the 50,000 yuan of condolence money for winter clothing and porridge donations as a memorial to my deceased son."

Our hospital has self-made a special cold relief ointment, which is extremely effective for treating chronic coughs and infantile pertussis. Apply it to the throat and the two acupoints on the second vertebra of the back, changing it once a week, and it can be cured in three weeks. We have specially sent 200 sheets for your office to distribute. If you need more after the distribution, our hospital will donate more."

### Charity Sale of Silk Gown Material, Hoping for Enthusiastic Bidding

Mr. Chen Junxin, on his fortieth birthday last year, was given a piece of first-class silk gown material produced by the German Lelihe Yangxing by relatives and friends. It has now been identified (1.9 chi long, 0.8 chi wide in the waist, 2.5 chi long in the sleeves, and 0.6 chi wide in the cuffs). He originally intended to make it into clothing for himself, but remembering the hardship of the times, there are countless people suffering from hunger and cold. Mr. Chen was heartbroken by this and was unwilling to wear this luxurious clothing. Therefore, he sent the material to our office for a charity sale, with a starting price of 100,000 yuan. The proceeds will be used for various charitable activities of our office. Mr. Chen's enthusiasm for public welfare is commendable. It is hoped that everyone will participate in the charity, not only fulfilling Mr. Chen's kindness but also benefiting countless people. It's a win-win situation. Why not join us?
