### On the Certainty of Political Victory

â€” Chen Bin-su

On the 27th of this month, this newspaper's "Weekly Commentary" published an article by Duke Tokutomi titled "Politics of Certain Victory." I deeply feel that Duke Tokutomi's arguments are quite similar to what we have been discussing, and are worthy of reference for the people of our country, especially those in power. Today, we have specially chosen the topic "On the Certainty of Political Victory," which means: "If politics are handled well, victory can be achieved," and also means: "Only by handling politics well can victory be achieved."

Duke Tokutomi said: "Today's politicians, if they do not investigate the needs of the people, this is a great and utter mistake. Politicians who grasp the needs of flowers and trees should water them when they need watering, fertilize them when they need fertilizing, prune them when they need pruning, and weed them when they need weeding. Similarly, just as a doctor understands the needs of a patient, only then can one appreciate the true essence of politics. In politics, there is a definite rule that one must thoroughly investigate the psychology of the people, and one must act according to the rules. If one does not understand the psychology of flowers and trees and still waters them on rainy days, then the flowers and trees are in danger of being waterlogged. This is because the relationship of politics has not been considered. This is essential for a large country or a small city or town. "This passage fully explains the duties that politicians should have. In China's current situation, we especially need great politicians, who need to win the hearts of the people, grasp the needs of the people, and do the work of watering, fertilizing, and pruning. Based on this need, today's Chinese politicians must possess the following conditions:

Be able to plan for the revival of the nation and the people, with a near-term plan of ten years and a long-term plan of fifty to one hundred years.

Have the patience to endure hardship and criticism, and not be afraid of being blamed or scolded for a time. In this situation, one should especially use political achievements to reduce criticism. Once there is right and wrong in politics, those who criticize will naturally also have right and wrong, and will naturally change from criticizing to supporting.

Clearly understand the evolution of the current situation and promote the construction of Greater East Asia, especially the basis for cooperation between China and Japan.

Have the courage to break the status quo. Maintaining the status quo is a passive action, while breaking the status quo is an active action. Today's political environment is one where if you do not advance, you retreat. If you are satisfied with maintaining the status quo, then the status quo will inevitably be unsustainable. For example, during Chairman Wang's convalescence in an allied country, he should not have been satisfied with maintaining the status quo in politics, but should have frankly negotiated with the allied authorities, broken through all adverse environments, stabilized the people's hearts with political construction, and cooperated in the Greater East Asia War with economic construction.

Lead by example, establish faith, and lead the whole people to strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.

We have always believed that the National Government is not strong enough, and the reasons are: First, although the central government does not lack wise leaders with rich political experience, their courage to break the status quo is still insufficient, and their belief in the certainty of political victory is not strong enough. Second, the government has returned to the capital for four years, but the people's representative body representing the people's demands has not yet been established, which means that the psychology of the people has not yet been fully grasped. Therefore, too little work has been done in watering, fertilizing, and pruning. At the same time, the opposite work has not been carried out with full force.

Duke Tokutomi said: "In recent years, we often talk about the doctrine of being well-fed. Originally, people cannot work on an empty stomach. If they are hungry but do not feel hungry, this is temporary. It is not a problem once or twice, but if this continues, the war cannot be fought. But there are also two kinds of being well-fed, one is being well-fed in the stomach, and the other is being well-fed in spirit." We also agree that unless the people are materially and spiritually well-fed first, it is not enough to talk about cooperating in the war. Materially well-fed, in a broad sense, is the stability of people's livelihood, and the most important thing is the people's food. In the past year, the Rice Control Association's handling of food, whether public rice or people's food, has been a failure. In the future, the National Government should automatically take full responsibility for handling this issue, given the urgency of public rice and the seriousness of people's food. To take a step back, even if the Rice Control Association does not repeat its mistakes after reorganization, we still feel that such an important issue of people's food cannot be shouldered by such an organization. Therefore, we believe that the stability of people's food is not the responsibility of the Rice Control Association and others, but has always been the responsibility of the National Government, and there will be no excuse in the future.

The people certainly hope to eat adequately, but we also hope that the government should first ensure that civil servants and the military police who protect the safety of the people are well-fed. If they are not well-fed, then the people should not even think about being well-fed, and this is also the government's responsibility.

### Japanese Submarine's Skillful Operation: Brave Assault on Enemy Fleet - A Record of Attack in the Mariana Sea

Southern Japanese Army Base, 28th Central News Agency dispatch: On June 11th, three small warships attacking Omiya Island were sunk by Japanese submarines. On the 19th and 20th, two enemy aircraft carriers were discovered. On the 30th, one of their aircraft carriers was sunk 30,000 meters east of Saipan Island. On July 20th, near 76 miles off the coast of Saipan Island, Japanese submarines launched torpedoes, attacking five enemy ships. Japanese submarines, submerged below the waterline, heard two loud explosion sounds approximately thirty minutes apart and observed the flames of enemy warships in the periscope. The Japanese submarines that attacked these five enemy ships have not yet returned. However, on June 16th, they fiercely attacked enemy battleship fleets and carrier fleets four times, breaking into their convoy formation. The Japanese submarines skillfully evaded enemy bombing. This can prove a glimpse of the progress of the Japanese naval tactics. The following is a record of the attack on enemy aircraft carriers in the Mariana Sea.

On June 11th, when the enemy attacked Saipan by air, Japanese submarine teams were dispatched to attack and destroy the enemy fleet.

### Flying Electric Submarine

All were deployed on various sea surfaces, and enemy aircraft and mobile units were detected four times. Afterwards, the submarine's sonar operator detected enemy warship sonar waves at 60 degrees to the right. However, because enemy warships blindly fired bombs, the periscope could not be raised. It was necessary to pay attention to the sonar waves. When the captain issued the order to prepare torpedoes, the enemy fleet seemed to be constantly firing bombs. The submarine could not surface. Afterwards, the enemy's sonar waves gradually became clearer, indicating that they were approaching. The captain raised the periscope and immediately discovered two enemy cruisers, followed by a battleship fleet consisting of three cruisers and ten escort ships. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and the captain immediately issued an attack order. At this time, the enemy ships had changed their angle and the battleship fleet fled west. Afterwards, an aircraft carrier fleet was suddenly discovered, forming a

### Ring Formation

Among them were two large aircraft carriers, one aircraft carrier converted from a cruiser, two cruisers, and ten escort destroyers. However, due to the long distance, it was not possible to launch a second attack. At that time, countless enemy aircraft were flying in the air, so the submarine could not surface to pursue. At the same time, enemy escort destroyers passed over the submarine's head three times. However, the successive crises were all overcome. While evading the attack of the enemy escort destroyers, two large aircraft carriers, two aircraft carriers converted from cruisers, and ten escort destroyers were discovered three times in the west, surrounding them. The aircraft carrier fleet was also too far away to launch an attack. As the setting sun was about to fall, the enemy was discovered for the fourth time.

### With Periscope

Looking through it, it was discovered that the aircraft carrier fleet, with two large aircraft carriers (converted from cruisers) as the mainstays, was concentrated in the Mariana Sea at dusk. At that time, the Japanese submarine was on alert in front of these enemy ships. The enemy aircraft carrier fleet was equipped extremely magnificently, with two large ships equipped in front, converted aircraft carriers placed in the rear, and cruisers equipped in front and behind. At that time, a sudden heavy rain fell, and the Japanese submarine's attack route was launched. At about 5:00 p.m., there was a strange thunder that shook the enemy ship. When the periscope searched for the enemy ship, anti-aircraft artillery fire could be seen. At the same time, Japanese friendly aircraft were attacking, and the enemy ships were counterattacking Japanese aircraft. The Japanese submarine's secret attempt was completely successful. There were also two enemy large ships, estimated at

### 20,000 Tons Class

The ship had an electric searchlight installed on the bridge on the central side, and behind the electric searchlight was a bulky smokestack. Enemy aircraft were all over the flight deck. At that time, the enemy ship had entered the Japanese submarine's attack range, and the Japanese submarine captain immediately looked through the periscope. At the same time, the Japanese submarine passed through the area 200 meters to the left and right of the enemy cruiser, and 100 meters away from the escort destroyer on the left side of the cruiser. The torpedoes were then launched at 6:07 p.m. The submarine had to submerge at a sharp angle.

### Suichuan Ganzhou Airfield Raided by Japanese Aircraft at Night: All Facilities Completely Destroyed

Japanese Army Frontline Tea Base, 28th Central News Agency dispatch: Japanese air force units raided the Suichuan and Ganzhou airfields on the night of the 25th. Amidst fierce anti-aircraft fire, they carried out accurate bombing, dropping bombs on the airfield runways and other facilities, which were all destroyed. These two airfields, centered on Suichuan and Ganzhou, with Xincheng, Nanxiong, Ji'an, and Jianchang airfields as satellites, were located in the middle of the Wuhan and Guangdong areas occupied by the Japanese army, an excellent position for bombing areas in central and southern China. Before the start of the Hunan campaign, it was used as an advance base for the Guilin airfield group or as a relay base for B-24 bombers, and was being greatly expanded. However, as the Japanese army's major campaign progressed, it gradually came under threat and a decision was made to abandon it. However, in August, it was considered a powerful stronghold for counterattacking Japan, and preparations were started again. However, after this night raid by the Japanese army, it has been completely destroyed.

### Torpedo Impact

Enemy ships three times. Subsequently, three enemy escort destroyers fired depth charges at the location of the Japanese submarine. At that time, the hull of the submarine shook for three hours. Seawater flowed into the water tanks from all sides, and oil from the oil tanks also flowed into the submarine. However, the Japanese submarine continued to fight desperately, and finally surfaced in the Mariana Sea at midnight.

### Japan's Political Warfare Has Achieved Victory: American Magazine Reveals

Tokyo, 28th Central News Agency dispatch: Among knowledgeable people in the United States, discussions of the failure of the political ideology of the Greater East Asia War have gradually risen. "Japan's Political Warfare Has Achieved Victory," recently published in the American business magazine, is attracting much attention. The content of the article is actually a prelude to the pursuit of freedom and independence by the countries and ethnic groups of Greater East Asia, and is also a development of the Asian ethnic revolution. The Japanese declaration stated that this war was a war for Asian ethnic groups to break away from European and American aggression, while Britain and the United States called it a crusade against Japan, the aggressor of Asia. Therefore, the problem lies in the understanding of these two declarations by Asian ethnic groups. However, people of color will definitely oppose the propaganda of Britain and the United States and believe that Japan is truly seeking liberation. Japan is promoting political, economic, and financial policies with military force as its background, actively cooperating with various ethnic groups in Asia, while Britain and the United States turn a blind eye to this kind of realization and do not give up their past ambitions. In the future, American youth will engage in this meaningless war and set foot in dense forest battles and special disease zones, which will cause endless suffering. Therefore, in the Asian political war, Britain and the United States have already suffered defeat.

### Main Force of Japanese Army Moves Westward, Poised to Attack Guilin: US Military in Chongqing Has Lost Contact

Lisbon, 28th Central News Agency dispatch: According to a dispatch from the New York Times correspondent in Chongqing, the Hunan war situation is as follows: The Japanese army has abandoned operations in eastern China, and no indication of this has been seen in the Chongqing area. The Japanese army is currently constructing roads south of Changsha under the harassing bombing of the U.S. Air Force's Fourteenth Air Force, and a major force is moving from the east side of the Xiang River to the west side, with the intention of attacking Guilin and Liuzhou. If Japan continues to advance southward, in addition to the Yuehan Line, it can also reduce the attacking power of the U.S. Air Force group in the south. When reviewing the U.S. military's landing operation plan in China from this point, it can be seen that when landing, its naval and army forces cannot use air bases in close proximity, and at the same time cannot obtain assistance from the regular army in Chongqing. Considering the current situation, the U.S. military's expectation of assistance from Chongqing is unrealistic. The situation in southeastern China is also quite delicate, as the Japanese army holds strong forces in Guangdong, and only a portion of them are moving north along the Yuehan Line. Therefore, the Yuehan Line has not yet been captured. The Japanese army's offensive, which began in July, is the most important operation for the Japanese army, because if this operation can block all military forces in Chongqing in the western provinces such as Yunnan and Sichuan, the Japanese army's defense in eastern China in the future can be reduced.

Guangzhou, 28th Central News Agency dispatch: According to a Chongqing Central News Agency dispatch, the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission announced the war situation in Hunan, Zhejiang, and Guangdong as follows: In Hengyang, fierce battles continued on the 26th and 27th. The Japanese army advancing from the southwest of Xiangxiang entered the east of Yongfeng on the 26th and is currently engaged in fierce battles with the Chongqing army. On the Zhejiang front, powerful Japanese troops finally reached a point 17 kilometers south of Wuyi on the 26th. On the Guangdong front, fierce street battles are unfolding in Lianjiang and other places on the Leizhou Peninsula.

Central News Agency dispatch: Chongqing telegram: When the Japanese army attacked Changsha, Zhang Deneng, the commander of the Changsha garrison and the commander of the Fourth Army, was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad on the 25th for losing the Yue Lu Mountain fortress, which led to the fall of Changsha City, following an investigation and trial by the military law enforcement office.

### Captured Regiment Commander Answers Reporter's Questions

Hengyang, 28th Central News Agency dispatch: "Training is more important than combat" - the slogan on the walls of Hengyang has been blurred by rain. The well-trained 10th Division of the Hengyang garrison was indeed quite powerful, but when their ammunition and food ran out, the entire army automatically ceased fighting, which dealt a great blow to the Chongqing side. On the 21st, the reporter visited the prisoner-of-war camp in the city, which held more than 4,000 prisoners. The reporter also held talks with Regiment Commander Cao Jing of the 26th Regiment, Regiment Commander Zhu Guangqi of the 29th Regiment, Regiment Commander Chen Debi of the 30th Regiment, and more than 40 officers above the battalion commander level, and answered questions as follows: Q: What is your only hope now? A: Our first hope is to treat the wounded, and our second hope is to give us food. We don't want other things like entertainment and comfort. Q: Since the Japanese soldiers and officers do not have rear supply, how about restoring your past organizational structure and collectively harvesting rice as a supply? A: That's great. If so, we will strengthen the organizational structure and make various preparations. We hope to be responsible for food supply. Q: What do you think of the leaflets issued by Japan? A: Continuing the war is not beneficial. In the past, we only regarded the Japanese army as the enemy, but we did not know that the United States was the one who gradually eroded China. Q: When was the last time you saw the newspaper? A: We stopped reading after the Japanese army entered Hengyang. Q: Do you know that the Beijing-Hankou Railway has been opened? We have no knowledge of news about North China, but we have clear news about the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway. Q: What does the political instructor do? A: Educate illiterates and organize labor service teams. Q: What kind of propaganda have you not done? What kind of anti-Japanese propaganda have you done? A: In the past, we only carried out oral propaganda for the illiterates. The only means used for those with weak anti-war will was slogans. The most commonly used ones were "Resist Japan to save the country," "Struggle arduously," "Resistance will surely win," and "Resistance will build the country." Q: Where did this propaganda come from? A: It was conveyed by the Military Affairs Commission's Political Department to the military in the form of official documents or booklets. Q: What is your state of mind now? A: At present, there are only a hundred uninjured people in our regiment. After more than forty days of fierce fighting, we are honored to see the peaceful East Asia. However, our position is now full of distress, so when you can understand our distress, then...

### Significant Losses for Anti-Axis Forces in Burma

Stockholm, Sweden, 28th Central News Agency dispatch: According to a London dispatch, Lord Mountbatten, the Supreme Allied Commander in Southeast Asia, recently returned to his Indian defense area after going to London to discuss with British chiefs. While in London, he told a group of journalists: The Burmese front is 700 miles long, second only to the Eastern Front. Burma is a place that the Japanese army must strategically defend. On the anti-axis side, it is also a place that must be contested to obtain a supply route to Chongqing. Our side suffered significant losses on this front. Since this year, about 10,000 have died in battle, 3,000 are missing, and 250,000 are suffering from diseases.

### German News Agency Editorial: Prospects for Japanese Production

Berlin, 28th Central News Agency dispatch: The German News Agency recently commented on the prospects for Japan's wartime production as follows: One of the important tasks of the new Japanese cabinet is to increase military production, and the realization of this matter is highly possible. Judging from various aspects, Japan has not yet fully utilized its industrial power, and the difficulties in the future are by no means insurmountable. Therefore, the problem of increasing military production in Japan is not a major one, but it is necessary to fully utilize existing strength, resources, and machinery, and to make appropriate and decisive adjustments. The basis for the possibility of improving wartime production in Japan is that the Japanese economy has advanced from light industry to heavy industry in a relatively short period of time. For this large-scale transformation to fully show its effectiveness, it must go through a considerable period of time, and before reaching its peak, there is still an unlimited path to come.

### Japanese Endo and Others Establish Aerial Achievements: Crash-Down American Aircraft Set Unprecedented Record

Japanese Army Base, 28th Central News Agency dispatch: When the U.S. military's B-29 aircraft, which they boasted was an invincible air fortress, carried out its fourth air raid on Kitakyushu, Japan, on the evening of the 20th of this month, the Japanese naval air force also participated in the battle. Among them, a single-winged aircraft flown by Lieutenant Endo and Sergeant Ozaki established an unprecedented record of shooting down eight B-29s and destroying six. According to a report from a certain base, the air combat record of the Kotsu aircraft is as follows: At 2:16 p.m. that afternoon, a formation of five enemy aircraft suddenly appeared from the oblique sun 30 miles northwest of a certain island in Nagasaki Prefecture. Endo's aircraft charged into the enemy formation and fired at it. The first and third enemy aircraft were hit and left the formation. Lieutenant Endo decided to shoot down these two aircraft and immediately fired fiercely at the first aircraft. The left engine of the aircraft was hit, emitting black smoke, and the nose drooped, plunging into the sea. After Lieutenant Endo fired at the third aircraft, the base of the right wing was also hit, emitting black smoke, and it immediately plunged down. The time between the two aircraft crashing was only nine minutes from the time they were discovered. Twelve minutes after the first air battle, a formation of three enemy aircraft was encountered again, with two in front and one in the rear. Lieutenant Endo decided to attack one of them and immediately prepared to fire. The enemy aircraft's wings swayed up and down and gradually descended. The aircraft was spotted by the Japanese army's new Cisi reconnaissance aircraft, which confirmed that it had been shot down. At 6:00 p.m., two enemy aircraft were discovered fleeing at full speed. Lieutenant Endo's aircraft, from above, accurately hit the rear of the first enemy aircraft, and the wings of the second aircraft were also hit. Both aircraft crashed at the same time. At that time, Lieutenant Endo wanted to pursue, but unfortunately, the ammunition was exhausted.

### Brest Garrison Refuses to Surrender

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency): German News Agency: According to an official German announcement, the American army requested the German garrison of the Brest fortress on the Brittany Peninsula to surrender, but was refused. Therefore, the enemy attacked yesterday with a strong infantry and tank force, and the intensity of the battle increased with time. With the support of the German army's naval and air force artillery, the German garrison repelled all offensives, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties. The enemy has formed several local protruding points in the forward positions of the fortress, which have been blocked.

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency): German News Agency: In the Brest fortress area, the American army has concentrated all its forces, and the start of a large-scale offensive seems imminent, because the shelling and air raids on the port and fortress have become more intense. The enemy attempted to enter the forward positions of the fortress, but was blocked by the German army's counterattack, and the enemy's persuasion to the German commander to surrender was also ignored. The American army has concentrated all its military strength to prepare for an attack on Brest, and has entrusted the areas of Lorient and Saint-Nazaire to French special attack teams and terrorist bandits, led by American officers. After the attack on the forward positions of Lorient completely failed, the terrorist bandits have now ceased their operations. Near Saint-Nazaire, the enemy is also completely in a passive position.

The German army pursued the retreating Soviet army, suppressed the enemy's bridgehead, and captured several fortified strongholds. In this battle, the German army's new anti-tank weaponry exerted its greatest power. In Romania, Soviet armored units and powerful tank forces continued to advance southward. In order to break through the Soviet offensive in the lower Prut River, the German army continued to fight. The fiercest fighting also broke out in the northern suburbs of Bucharest (the Romanian capital). In the Ploiesti area, the Romanian army, under the instructions of the Soviet government, attempted to disarm the German army. After inflicting a major blow on the Romanian army, the German army repelled it. The casualties of the Romanian army were extremely heavy. Thanks to thorough fighting, the German army finally repelled the superior Romanian army.

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency): German News Agency: The German army in Romania is currently engaged in fierce fighting on both banks of the lower Prut River. The Soviet army has crossed the Siret River and occupied Focsani, but suffered heavy tank losses. The German-Hungarian allied forces launched an effective counterattack, and the enemy's attempt to enter the eastern part of the Carpathian Mountains was unsuccessful. To the north, the German army (located west of BaranÃ³w on the Vistula River) continued its breakthrough offensive with powerful forces between the Vistula River and the Narew River.

Berlin, 28th (Havas Agency): The Soviet army, attacking between Bialystok and Warsaw, lost 55 tanks in the last 24 hours. After an artillery bombardment, Soviet tank forces charged into the German defense line northeast of Warsaw, and were repelled after fierce fighting. South of Pisa, the battle also became more intense. The Soviet army launched fierce attacks from two bridgeheads on the Vistula River, but was repelled and abandoned several fortresses.

### Greece Makes Five Demands on Bulgaria

Geneva, 28th (Central News Agency): German News Agency, London dispatch: The Greek government in exile today announced its five demands on the Bulgarian government as follows: The northern border of Greece should be militarily revised in favor of Greece. Punish the Bulgarian rulers, military leaders, and other responsible persons who opposed the Greek people. Pay reparations. Implement the policies of the anti-Axis countries. The anti-Axis countries should occupy Bulgaria.

US President Roosevelt personally went to Hawaii and convened a military conference of army and navy generals to give instructions on the rapid progress of the operation to retake the Philippines. It is said that the timing is in early September. Why is the US military so eager to forcibly wage war against Japan before completely agreeing on the Mariana Islands? The following points can be examined:

### Roosevelt Seeks to Win Hearts and Minds

First, this is Roosevelt's policy of trying to win hearts and minds in the autumn election this year to seek a fourth term. Although there is much evidence to the contrary, whether the US government in wartime still adheres to democracy as a land of freedom, at least the presidential election is a form determined by the people's vote, and the support of the people is absolutely necessary. However, the US government is now mobilizing human and material resources in response to the huge military demand. Due to the difficulty of life and the increase in the number of deaths and injuries, the people's hearts towards the government's actions may not be good. The repeated strikes in military-related factories and the rise in prices illustrate this situation. Therefore, if Roosevelt wants to be elected for the fourth time in the autumn election this year, he must at least obtain a major victory sufficient to reverse this national fortune, eliminate national dissatisfaction, and at the same time, transform his aversion through victory. Roosevelt, in any case, must find a way to reduce the people's dissatisfaction during the war and eagerly launch a major offensive against the people.

### Japan's Combat Power Increases with Time

Second, Japan's combat power is increasing with time. Before the Greater East Asia War, Japan had very little of the most important oil, tin, rubber, and other products in the munitions industry. It was considered quite difficult to carry out the war, but since it established Sumatra, Malaya, Java, Celebes, etc., it has been able to maintain a full supply. As a result of Japan's occupation of the world's main production areas of tin and rubber, the United States' supply has fallen into difficulty. In rubber products, almost all are reprocessed products or substitutes, which has been proven by the American-made B-29 bomber recently shot down in Japan.

In particular, quinine, a special medicine for malaria, is a special product of the South Seas Islands. The Greater East Asia War was launched in the South Seas, a malaria-stricken area, and has continued until now. Because the United States cannot obtain quinine, many people have died from the disease and are crying out in pain.

As for tin, although mines in Bolivia, South America have been developed, they are all substitutes of poor quality and have major shortcomings in manufacturing high-speed steel for military needs. Therefore, the later the war is, the more the United States' combat power will be weakened, and conversely, Japan's combat power will increase.

### The American People's Anti-War Atmosphere

Third, the fact that the anti-war atmosphere of the American people is gradually intensifying cannot be ignored. The impact of the war is not considered a pleasant phenomenon by people all over the world. Moreover, the United States is gradually becoming poorer due to the shortage of necessary civilian supplies and the reduction in food production. In addition, the rise in prices and the increase in purchasing power caused by malignant inflation have further fueled this trend. Therefore, the living problems of the American people will now reach the breaking point. In addition, the unfavorable progress of the war has only increased deaths and injuries, and the war results obtained are only bullet-like islands in the Pacific Ocean. Retaking the Philippines, landing on the Chinese mainland, the defense war on the Japanese mainland, and new operations with intentions in the war will still require the sacrifice of huge human and material resources; conversely, the purpose of the war is not enough to inspire sacred human love and noble national love, but is only for Roosevelt's personal world desire and the profit-seeking desire of some capitalists. All these forms have contributed to the anti-war atmosphere of the general public.

Therefore, if you want to end the war one day earlier, and to make a soldier active on the battlefield, you need seventeen laborers in the country. The conduction of modern wars of a guiding nature is impossible, so the United States hopes for rapid progress in the war.

On the other hand, Japan raised the banner of liberating the oppressed peoples of Greater East Asia, and aimed to build a new order in Greater East Asia. The one billion people of East Asia united as one, hoping to realize the war's goals, and a formidable combat power is being developed.

### The United States Attempts to Obstruct Japan

From the above points, it can be understood that the longer the decisive battle is delayed, the more advantageous Japan will be in terms of combat power. Therefore, the United States is now anxiously trying to destroy the fact that Japan is transferring the war resources of the southern regions it has maintained due to the victory of the Greater East Asia War to the Japanese mainland to enhance its combat power.

1.  Due to the fierce attack of the naval mobile unit in the Pacific, it wants to approach the Philippines, and in the Chinese mainland, it wants to cut off the southern communication line.
2.  Due to attacks on ships on the Chinese mainland and the Yangtze River, it attempts to cut off sea transportation routes.
3.  Due to the intensification of the air war on the Chinese mainland, it supports the Chongqing army, secures air bases against Japan, and at the same time, wants to strengthen pressure from the land.
4.  Due to the destruction of heavy industrial areas in Japan, it wants to reduce military production capacity.

In response, Japan succeeded in enticing the US army to the Mariana Islands for a "gradual reduction operation," while fortifying the Philippines, Taiwan, the Japanese mainland, and the Chinese mainland, accumulating combat power, preparing a posture to intercept, and waiting in strict formation for the enemy US army to attack. For example, on the 20th of this month, the attack on the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, which invaded Kyushu and the western part of China, was completely ineffective. Twenty-three enemy planes that were blindly bombing were shot down. In particular, the fighting spirit of the Japanese air defense soldiers who fiercely rushed towards two enemy planes and shot them down in one fell swoop made even the Americans gasp and call "The Japanese air force's political attacks are unexpectedly effective," implying the difficulty of invading the Japanese mainland.

### Japan Gains the Advantage of Timing and Geography

On the issue of time, Japan, which has already gained the advantage of timing and natural geography, is enhancing its combat power to the highest degree with the genuine unity of the Chinese and Greater East Asian nations. - It is said that Japan's aircraft manufacturing capacity is now the second in the world, so Japan is of course the first in the number of aircraft in the Pacific. - The future strategic posture, which is not afraid of anything, is only conservative and silent, so it is believed that it will surely reduce the invading enemy army.

### Police Bureau Strictly Restricts General Business Hours, Director Lu of the Administrative Office Issues a Statement

In order to implement electricity and knife conservation consumption and practice wartime life thoroughly, the Municipal Police Bureau has restricted general business hours and related matters and announced its implementation. Lu Qi, Director of the Administrative Office of the Bureau, issued a special statement on this matter, as follows: "The purpose of the Bureau's regulations on general business hours and related matters this time, based on the Municipal Government's Announcement No. 7907 of the Shanghai Municipal Government on August 2 this year and Announcement No. 8182 of August 12, is to implement the government's orders, which goes without saying. At this time of traffic difficulties and transportation obstacles, increasing material resources is almost the first duty of the people. Furthermore, as the war becomes more tense, practicing wartime life to invigorate the spirit of the entire people and strive for victory is even more the duty of the people. Therefore, the Bureau's actions this time are purely inevitable, and the citizens should especially cooperate and strictly abide by them. The general situation in Shanghai at present is far from our ideals, so the Bureau's regulations are extremely strict in order to bring them into the right track.

### Same Restrictions for Self-Generation

Now, many entertainment venues often set up candles or have their own power generation equipment to operate as usual after the regulated electricity usage time. In fact, the consumption of material resources is still unavoidable, and it also violates wartime life and creates a lock-up atmosphere. Therefore, the Bureau's regulations this time stipulate that those who operate without using electricity or their own power generation equipment shall still invite people to follow the Bureau's regulations and shall not exceed them in any way in order to thoroughly achieve the purpose of conservation and implementing wartime life. Shanghai's extravagance is the best in all regions. This phenomenon should not exist during wartime, and even in peacetime, why would it be good for the country's hard work? In times of national hardship, no matter what position one is in, one should take preserving the country's vitality as the premise and cultivate a national character of hard work and endurance.

### Customers Also Bear Corresponding Responsibilities

The effect expected from the restrictions on business hours in the Bureau's announcement this time is to make citizens have a deep understanding of the current situation and strictly and solemnly control their own lives in addition to abiding by the time. No matter how strict the government's crackdown is, it is still necessary for citizens to be aware and cooperate. In addition to ordering each branch bureau to implement it earnestly and dispatch personnel to investigate at any time, the Bureau will consider copying the residence permit numbers of customers stranded in various entertainment venues outside the regulated business hours and imposing appropriate penalties on them. Because exceeding the restrictions on business hours is the fault of the operators, but customers also have relative responsibilities. It is hoped that you will pay attention to it carefully.

### A Humble Proposal to Improve Prison Hygiene

â€” Yuan Rui-chang

In recent years, various countries around the world have not only focused on moral education for prisoners incarcerated for criminal offenses but also attached great importance to prison hygiene facilities. Good prison hygiene can affect the health of prisoners. Some say that improving prison hygiene treatment is tantamount to rewarding crime, which is a big mistake. The main point of freedom punishment lies in depriving or restricting the freedom of criminals, and it is impossible to harm their bodies and lives. It is the deserved result for a person to be imprisoned for committing a crime. However, if they do not have enough to eat and keep warm after being imprisoned, it is not permitted by humanity. If they get sick, become disabled, or die as a result, it is equivalent to adding physical punishment and life punishment to the punishment of freedom, which is not what they should receive. Therefore, the International Criminal Penalty Committee has regulations on the minimum treatment of prisoners, hoping to improve the treatment of criminals. The details focus on clothing, food, housing, labor, and medical care, and attention is paid to moral education so that they can repent, renew themselves, return to society, and become good and useful people. Furthermore, prisons are groups that deprive people of their freedom and are prone to various infectious diseases, which can affect public health. Therefore, in order to maintain humanity and protect the health of society, improving prison hygiene is an urgent matter. The late Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Justice Administration attached great importance to this issue. He died of typhus after inspecting foreign prisons. It can be seen that prisons neglect hygiene, and it is easy to die from infectious diseases. It is very worrying. As the head of the Wood City Health Department, I dare to write this humble proposal. I am grateful for the guidance of advanced social members.

Improvement Plan

A. Regarding Environmental Hygiene

Environmental hygiene includes buildings and all ventilation, lighting, heating, air volume, fire-fighting equipment, and the layout of prison buildings, such as prison cells, workshops, kitchens, bathrooms, sick bays, and pits, trenches, etc., must be carefully planned and fully equipped. The interior and exterior must be swept daily, scrubbed every other day, each room must have a spittoon, spitting on the ground is prohibited, sluices are often flushed, and pits and countries should be sprinkled with disinfectant water daily to ensure permanent cleanliness.

B. Regarding Diet

Diet nourishes the whole body, generates body temperature and strength, and replenishes consumed components. It is an essential element of life. Insufficient diet hinders nutrition, but inappropriate food combinations, improper cooking, or eating spoiled food are still not conducive to health, and may even lead to nutritional deficiency diseases and infections, leading to death. Therefore, prisons attach great importance to the handling of the diet of prisoners, striving to ensure that the quality and quantity can meet the necessary conditions for health. Generally, each person needs at least seven ge (approximately 0.74 liters) of rice or miscellaneous grains (such as millet, corn flour, and sorghum) per day, and at least four liang (approximately 200 grams) of green vegetables and soybeans per day, and two liang (approximately 100 grams) of fish or meat per week. As for food utensils, it is especially appropriate to adopt utensils that do not hinder hygiene, are easy to maintain, and do not produce toxins. The tableware for ordinary prisoners and sick prisoners should be used and disposed of differently in terms of color or form. The tableware of prisoners suffering from tuberculosis and infectious diseases should be strictly disinfected after each use to prevent infection.

C. Regarding Clothing and Bedding

Clothing and bedding regulate body temperature and prevent cold attacks. For the sake of maintaining prison hygiene, prisoners' clothing and bedding should be provided by the government. Each person should have two sets of single clothing and one set of cotton clothing and trousers. For the convenience of washing, and adding or subtracting according to the weather, each person must have four cotton blankets, which must be washed and dried frequently to avoid fleas and infectious diseases. The clothing and bedding of sick people and deceased prisoners must be disinfected. All new prisoners, after bathing, must change into prepared clothing and bedding, which must be disinfected and stored immediately to avoid bringing germs into the prison.

### Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau Proclamation â€” Jing Si Zi No. 18

In view of the recent active promotion of electricity conservation in this city, factories, groups, and residences should all abide by it. However, if the factories throughout the city are all subject to electricity restrictions for military needs and daily necessities, it will have a significant impact on wartime production. Therefore, in order to understand the product situation and electricity consumption of each factory, the bureau has specially prepared an electricity consumption survey form for factories to fill in truthfully. The bureau will conduct on-site investigations based on the form in order to consider the situation and make adjustments. If it is indeed a military product and daily necessities, the electricity consumption will be appropriately increased; otherwise, it will be strictly restricted or the power supply will be stopped. This will not only encourage the rear to increase production but also adapt to the purpose of wartime conservation. All factories in the city are required to bring the factory seal and the responsible person's private seal to the fourth section of the bureau within one month from the date of publication to collect and fill out the form. Each form is five sheets and costs 100 yuan in national currency for printing and handling fees. Failure to report will be regarded as a voluntary waiver and the power will be cut off immediately without any tolerance. It is necessary to announce this to the public. Director Xu Tianshen, August 28, 1941

### National Forum: Suggestions to the Municipal Tram Company Authorities

â€” Chun Feng

Since the tram company, in compliance with the authorities' intention to conserve electricity, adjusted its routes and reduced the number of trams, the "travel" problem of citizens from all walks of life has been considerably affected. One only needs to observe the long lines of passengers at major starting and ending stations during work hours, and the anxious and frustrated expressions of each passenger, to understand this clearly. If an emergency occurs, or a sudden rainstorm arrives, order and peace are further adversely affected. However, since electricity conservation is a settled policy, the only solution is to seek appropriate technical improvements to ensure that the public has no inconvenience or loss, while the citizens benefit. I would like to offer the following improvement suggestions:

Modify Tram Schedules

The current schedule and vehicle allocation have already been improved significantly compared to the past, such as increasing the number of trams during work hours. However, in practice, it is still insufficient to meet demand. Therefore, it is hoped that a thorough revision can be made quickly, taking into account the work hours of government agencies, private organizations, and major production companies and factories. Similar to train schedules, the number of trams running each day should be specified, i.e., 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM (hypothetically, the same applies below), 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM, and 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM, as fixed operating times. The originally scheduled trams should all run during these times, and completely stop outside these times. In this way, passengers will have a set schedule, and the increased frequency of trams running during these times will reduce waiting times, saving considerable mental and physical effort, and preventing disruption to public and business affairs. The tram company can also reasonably adjust its trams, personnel, and operations, which will undoubtedly lead to greater efficiency in business. As for the general public who are stopped from traveling, they can switch to human-powered rickshaws or walk. After the implementation of this new method, the city's traffic order will certainly be transformed.

Correct Tram Routes

The current tram routes in District 1, although the result of repeated deliberation and revision, seem beyond reproach. However, past considerations were based on old operating hours. If the above suggestions are adopted, then for the sake of facilitating the actual needs of all sectors, some essential old routes without other means of transportation should be restored as soon as possible. The most urgent needs among these are the long-distance routes of Lines 5, 3, and 1/12. The restoration of Line 5 is related to Shanghai's outer city transportation, greatly benefiting North Station passengers and small freight transportation; while Lines 3 and 12 are more directly related to wartime production enterprises. As for restoring long-distance transportation, since the suspension of through-trains, passengers traveling to central stations (such as Nanjing Road/Bund) must queue again to wait for trams, often spending an unspeakable amount of time and energy from the starting point through transfer stations, greatly affecting the work efficiency of political, cultural, and industrial personnel. Conversely, the tram company has not seen any benefit from the suspension of long-distance travel. As for ticket sales after the restoration of long-distance travel, long-distance tickets can be purchased at the starting station, which can save printing costs, so buying two tickets should not be inconvenient.

Regarding the Fare Issue

(A) Fare Increase: Considering current prices and the current fees for various vehicles, the low fare of trams in District 1 is widely praised. In terms of reason and rationale, a price increase is also quite reasonable. However, the authorities' policy of maintaining established fares and avoiding price stimulation is also commendable. Furthermore, public utilities are managed and subsidized by the authorities, and are not (necessarily) required to compete for profit with general private institutions. It is believed that the existing fare structure causes the company to suffer excessive losses, which is also a fact, and it is even more abhorrent that vagrants and beggars mix into trams to beg. Therefore, a moderate increase is not impossible. However, increases must be in multiples of five or ten cents, otherwise it will be a loss for either the passengers or the company.

(B) Corruption: The losses may be incurred by the company or by the passengers. For the company, the main issue is the corruption of ticket sellers on the tram. For passengers, the main issue is the retention of change by ticket sellers in booths at each station. The main reason for this is that employees' salaries are insufficient to maintain their livelihoods, and that the prevention of long-standing bad habits has not been done properly, which is also a major reason. Therefore, the following measures can be taken in the future: Unify the fare to five or ten cents, which will facilitate the payment of change; completely abolish ticket sales on the tram, leaving only one driver and one assistant per tram, and add one assistant for trams with two cars; the driver will also be responsible for opening and closing the front door, while the assistant will only be responsible for opening and closing the rear and trailer doors and assisting with other driving matters, and neither will be allowed to handle tickets; tickets must be purchased in advance before boarding, and inspectors will be assigned to check tickets at the tram doors; tickets must be collected when disembarking, and those without tickets will be fined twice the fare; the previous practice of exchanging fifty accumulated tickets for a lottery ticket, which does not conform to the Chinese "face-saving" concept, can be abolished. If the above tram schedules are revised, the company will not lack personnel.

Rectify Traffic Order

In the past six months, due to the diligent improvements made by the authorities and the company, improvements have been seen, but the situation has worsened since the reduction in the number of trams. In the future, if the above three new methods are followed, traffic order will certainly improve again. However, during tram operating times, passengers will inevitably crowd together. Therefore, a segmented queuing method can be adopted, setting up more ticket booths in the vicinity of the stations, near open spaces, at least two booths per station, with two lines for every three people. When a certain number of people is exceeded, another section should be formed. This will avoid obstructing general traffic and reduce the suffering and danger of queuing passengers, and ensure the quiet and tidiness of the station. However, at least two traffic maintenance officers must be assigned to each line, wearing uniforms and clearly marked with numbers. Except for military police personnel and pregnant women with obvious signs, no one should be allowed to cut in line. If there is any favoritism or irresponsibility in correcting this, other passengers will be allowed to report it. If passengers voluntarily allow others to enter the queue, the tram traffic maintenance officer may order them to leave together.

### Long-Cherished Wish (9) Navy

â€” Translated by Hong Yang

Around ten o'clock the next morning, Shengfu got off the streetcar at a certain point and walked straight to the Ministry of the Navy. He had seen the Ming Dynasty brick buildings from the tram, but this was the first time he had set foot in the courtyard. He thought to himself that there must be a steel statue of an old navy pioneer from his hometown standing in the courtyard, but he didn't bother to look for it.

He hesitated and wandered in front of the gate for a long time. Just as he was about to enter, the guard asked him his purpose.

"Since that's the matter, turn that way!"

Following the direction, he passed a dimly lit communication room. After explaining his purpose at the window, a middle-aged man silently took out a piece of paper.

Longfu filled out the form with his name, the name of the person he was visiting, the reason for his visit, and whether he had a prior appointment. After handing it to the clerk, he felt very uneasy. Would Lieutenant Colonel Feitian, who was so busy, meet with me? Besides, would he remember my name?

But after waiting for a while, the clerk reappeared and said simply and clearly,

"Please come this way!"

He went up the old and dim stairs. When he reached the corridor on the second floor, the clerk said, "It's over there," and left.

The gray door in front was tightly closed. Longfu stood there in a bit of a panic for a while. Because this was the Ministry of the Navy. What if he opened the door at random and found himself in a large auditorium?

However, just then, someone came out from the other side. It was a man without a suit jacket.

"Is this the reporting department?"

"Oh, yes."

Longfu was relieved and went in. In the room with neatly arranged desks, many people were working, and the sound of telephones was buzzing. Everyone was busy, so there was no one to greet or receive visitors.

But a clean-shaven soldier sitting in front of a desk inside suddenly looked up, saw Longfu, and waved his hand. Oh, that face, he remembered.

"Are you Mr. Feitian?"

To avoid making a mistake, Longfu asked.

"Yes, I am."

The lieutenant colonel read half of the introduction letter from Shao Wei, which had been delivered, and said to Longfu:

"The lieutenant has told me about you. I've seen your paintings at the Navy Exhibition... Please write a resume and attach it! Don't forget to write down your current address. And send a two-inch half-length portrait..."

Lieutenant Colonel Feitian, with his delicate features, rose to his feet with a voice that did not match his face. The meeting lasted only three minutes. (136)

### Social Service: Zhe Shao Hospital Adds Western Medicine

â€” Pei Yunqing

Nearly one million people from the seven counties of Shaoxing living in Shanghai have long-established rules for matters of health and death. Although fellow villagers do not lack in dispensing medicine for the poor and sick, the establishment of a hospital began in the 29th year of the Republic of China. Yunqing followed in the footsteps of my fellow villagers and elders, purchasing a hospital building at the intersection of Haining Road and North Shaanxi Road, setting up separate wards for men and women, and employing Chinese medicine physicians in internal medicine, surgery, and ophthalmology to treat the poor and sick and provide medicine. Those with severe illnesses were admitted to the hospital. Since its opening, the scale has been roughly established. This is all thanks to the kindness and generosity of my fellow villagers, who have created immeasurable blessings. Yunqing, in his own capacity, should strive for progress. Since the beginning of summer, preparations have been made to add Western medicine, modify the wards, and set up an operating room. Doctors Yu Ruxian, Chen Demao, and Qin Tingji have been hired to serve as vice president, medical director, and in charge of internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and other departments. Starting from September 1, the hospital will be completely converted to Western medicine. The original Chinese medicine physicians in internal medicine and surgery will be moved to the Shanghai Tongxiang Association of Shaoxing's seven counties on Anqing Road, where they will continue to provide diagnosis and medicine, not limited to fellow villagers. Buddhists consider birth, old age, sickness, and death to be the greatest sufferings of mankind. I hope that my fellow villagers in Shanghai who have great aspirations and want to relieve this suffering will not hesitate to provide guidance and suggestions.

### Good Opportunity to Learn Painting

The Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts is launching a Western book tutoring class this semester. There are no restrictions on entry qualifications. Classes are scheduled from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Tuition and miscellaneous fees are only 2,200 yuan. It is also heard that the school has hired Ms. Shen Yaqin to serve as the director of the piano group in the music department. In addition, founder Liu Haisu will come to the school twice a week to lecture in order to improve the academic atmosphere.

Since the Song Dynasty's English Book Room opened the second "Jin Zhi" room with the title of Grand Duchess GergÃ©, the entrance examination has been extremely strict. Song's painting studio has scheduled the start of the semester on September 4. Those who wish to study with him can still register for the exam. Application forms can be obtained from the First "Jin Zhi" Room, No. B14, Shanchang Lane, Carter Road.

### Charity School and Scholarships

The next semester of the Zhixing Night School at No. 17, Shunchang Road (formerly Bill Road) will begin on September 11. Several more famous teachers have been hired. Tuition for middle school and business courses starts at 550 yuan, and tuition for elementary school starts at 250 yuan. Electives such as accounting, bookkeeping, English, British business calculation, economics, etc., start at 150 yuan per course. Students with poor family circumstances and excellent character can apply for the school's scholarship. In addition, this semester, the school is cooperating with a certain chemical factory to run an industrial drug chemistry manufacturing department, which can be completed in one year for those with junior high school education or above. Students with excellent character can be guaranteed to work at the chemical factory.

The Jing'an Temple in this city, in view of the increasing number of rural children losing their education after the incident, has specially established the Buddhist Nanxiang Rural Primary School in the Xili East Township branch of the temple in Nanxiang Town to provide relief. Previously, the abbot of the temple, Dewu, the supervisor Mijia, and local gentry held a founders' meeting, which decided to jointly raise 500,000 yuan for expenses. The preparations have been actively underway for several months, and everything is ready. It is now scheduled to open on September 15. However, it is reported that there is still a shortage of 100 to 150 desks and chairs. It is hoped that those who are willing to care for education will come to discuss the matter in person.

The School of Commerce of Huadong University has hired Wang Ruilin of Global Trust Company to teach accounting, Qu Jingzhou to teach commercial arithmetic, Yin Minglu of Taiping Insurance Company to teach industrial and commercial management, and Zhong Xiangqing of Nanyang Tobacco Company to teach statistics this semester. Advance the teaching of applied subjects to cultivate practical talents in a short period of time, and hold classes after 4:00 PM so that industrial and commercial employees can also take electives. Therefore, it has gained the support of all sectors, and they have automatically donated scholarships of 5,000 yuan each, totaling 50,000 yuan. All freshmen in the first year can apply, and enrollment is now starting.

### Health Guidance

The Effectiveness of Meditation: I joined the Yinjin Meditation Society last year, and in less than half a year, I was able to pass three passes. Therefore, I became more diligent. Every time I meditate, my heart feels like a bright moon shining and filling my whole body. This summer vacation, I gathered those who had achieved results in previous meditation sessions and begged the teacher to study Da Zhou Tian De. Sometimes during meditation, I feel that my body is tall and goes up into the clouds, which makes me terrified. When I asked the teacher about it, the teacher said: This is the appearance of a tall body, which is a good sign, but you must let it be natural and not cling to it. The method of meditation is great for escaping life and death, and small for reducing illness and prolonging life. In the society, those who suffer from chronic diseases, such as Yao Ziming's neurasthenia and liver disease, Li Xingxiao and He Guangren's early-stage lung disease, and someone's stomach disease, have all recovered. The society is now recruiting the sixth batch of members, which will begin on the afternoon of September 2. If the number of people does not exceed the quota, classes will still be held at No. 58, Yongqingfang, New Dagu Road. (Shen Yinmei)

Friends' Aid Hospital Provides Preferential Treatment to the Academic Community: Friends' Aid Hospital on Shengmuyuan Road and Pushi Road provides voluntary treatment to the academic community. If you are poor, you can also receive medicine. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM. If you have any difficult or serious illnesses and cannot move, you can send a letter detailing the symptoms, and they can also provide answers without charge.

### Epidemic Prevention Needles Have Long Been Disinfected

The Municipal Health Bureau sent a letter yesterday stating: "In the Social Services column of the Shenbao on August 24, there was an article entitled 'Epidemic Prevention Injectors Should Pay Attention to Needle Disinfection,' which stated that the writer had seen in several places that injectors often used syringes to draw vaccine and attach needles, and injected dozens of people in succession without disinfection, and some did not disinfect at all from beginning to end, so that knowledgeable people saw it and regarded it as a dangerous path. It should follow the method of the Health Department of District 1, gather needles for disinfection, so that there will be no future troubles...etc.' After investigation, the epidemic prevention was originally carried out by the Municipal Health Bureau and the Health Department of District 1. The disinfection methods for all needles and syringes, in addition to those in District 1 as mentioned by Zhou Jun, the previous disinfection method of the Health Bureau was to disinfect a large number of needles and syringes in the bureau before departure, and then take them to the work site for application. It is suspected that it was not disinfected, and the reason is here. Now that the bureau and department have been merged, the disinfection methods have been uniformly implemented according to the previous District 1. Because the report is not entirely in line with the facts, it should be corrected. The Municipal Health Bureau"
