(2) On the night of November 26th, Japanese air units conducted a long-range bombing raid on Aslito Airfield on Saipan Island, bombing enemy B-29 aircraft concentrated on the southern side of the runway. Multiple aircraft were hit and caught fire, and over ten aircraft were destroyed. Two fires also broke out. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.

Hakkō Unit Launches Fierce Daytime Assault

Philippine Base, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese Army Special Attack Force launched another fierce assault on enemy ships in Leyte Gulf throughout the day on the 27th. Dozens of enemy ships were sunk, struck, or set ablaze. On the morning of the 27th, the Hakkō Unit of the Army Special Attack Force, under the escort of fighter planes, sorties toward Leyte Gulf. Seven Japanese planes daringly advanced and carried out direct strike attacks on enemy ships, sinking one large ship (believed to be a battleship), four large transport ships, and severely damaging one large ship (battleship or large cruiser) that caught fire, and more than one large transport ship. All these results were confirmed by Japanese escorting aircraft. In addition, three enemy aircraft, fearing the Japanese attack, evaded by making high-speed turns. The Japanese forces then started to carry out sure-hit attacks on three enemy large cruisers. When friendly aircraft hit the enemy ships, Petty Officers 1st Class Kumasaka and Ketsuzaki of the Japanese escorting planes retreated into the clouds. After emerging from the clouds again, the three enemy large cruisers had sunk to the bottom of the sea.

Naval Aviation Establishes Distinguished Service

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The reputation of the Japanese Navy's new bomber "Comet" and the new attack aircraft "Galaxy" has spread far and wide. The "Comet" is a single-engine aircraft, and the "Galaxy" is a twin-engine aircraft. The performance of both machines is excellent, and their speed is so fast that the enemy is extremely shocked when the Japanese Air Force sortied with both aircraft bombing together. Both "Comet" and "Galaxy" aircraft participated in the air battle over the waters of Taiwan in the middle of last month. They also participated in operations together with Zero fighters in the attacks by the Kamikaze Special Attack Force on enemy ships around the Philippines. At present, in the air battles around the Philippines, the Kamikaze Special Attack Force is establishing immortal achievements every time the "Comet" and "Galaxy" aircraft participate.

Decisive Battle Unfolds on Leyte

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The battle on Leyte Island is currently centered on the eastern foothills of the Yagu mountain range on the island and the western region of Carigara Bay. The intensity of the fighting is increasing daily. Both sides are mobilizing their main forces, and the atmosphere of a decisive battle is rising every moment. The struggle for air supremacy above the battlefield and the transportation and resupply battles around the war zone are also becoming increasingly active. The Japanese Army and Navy Special Attack Forces have repeatedly sortied, ramming enemy ships with fearless flesh-and-blood attacks, seizing the enemy's courage and shattering their spirits.

Enemy Suffers Night Attack on Samar Island

Japanese Army Base on the Philippine Front, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to the day and night battles on Leyte Island, a portion of the Japanese force landed on Samar Island near the opposite shore of Tacloban some time ago and advanced westward along the island's coast. By the 11th, they had advanced to the vicinity of Pinabacdao. The Japanese army, which had been standing by, launched a fierce counterattack from the 12th. On the 14th, they carried out a brave night attack. The enemy was suddenly attacked by the Japanese army and retreated to the vicinity of Kabiga, ten kilometers south of Pinabacdao, where they are currently constructing defensive positions. There has been no active advance since then. In addition, although the enemy has been publicizing that a large force has landed on Samar Island, its actual strength is only about one regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division, and its equipment consists only of mortars.

### Japanese Aircraft Bomb Saipan, Repeatedly Achieve Great Results

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Enemy B-29 aircraft took off from the Marianas and raided Longchuan, Manchukuo, on the 24th. They also invaded the skies over Tokyo on the 27th, but were fiercely attacked by Japanese aircraft and fled in disarray. In contrast, the Japanese Air Force launched preemptive bombing raids on Saipan on November 3rd and 7th, and then launched a third attack on Saipan Island on the 26th, achieving great results. The Japanese bomber squadron, on the 26th, used moonlight to reach the enemy base on Saipan Island and took advantage of the enemy's shift on Sunday, carrying out a precise bombing raid on the main airfield, Aslito, at that base. They separately eliminated the enemy's anti-aircraft barrage and the obstruction of enemy fighter planes, dropping bombs on enemy B-29 aircraft gathered in the southern part of the airfield. As a result, several enemy B-29 aircraft were burned and over ten were damaged. In addition, Japanese aircraft set two enemy facilities ablaze. The Japanese aircraft, after achieving their objectives, triumphantly returned.

### The Rainy Season in Burma is Over; Warfare Becomes More Intense; Chungking Forces Near Bhamo Repelled

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Burmese front has gradually become more active as the rainy season has ended. In particular, since the middle of this month, the offensive by the Chungking forces has become more intense. The Japanese army is also launching counterattacks everywhere. At the same time, the Chungking forces on the Myitkyina front have retreated to the north. The battle situation in each of these areas is recorded below. (1) The newly organized 30th and 38th Divisions of the Chungking forces in northern Burma advanced to within five kilometers of Bhamo since the 16th and launched an attack from three directions. The Japanese garrison on that side bravely intercepted them and has now repelled them. In addition, the newly organized 22nd Division of the Chungking forces crossed the Irrawaddy River from the Shwegu area and attempted to advance further south, but was thwarted because it was crushed by the Japanese army everywhere. At present, Bhamo is still in the hands of the Japanese army. On the Myitkyina front, the Japanese army continues its fierce attacks. The British Indian army, after suffering heavy losses, has retreated to the north. (2) The Japanese army in the Kalewa area is currently gradually reorganizing its battle lines. At the same time, it is still firmly defending the area around Kalemyo and 30 kilometers north of Kalewa. They are currently confronting the enemy. (3) The enemy's 81st West African Division in the Kaladan area is gradually gathering its forces in the Paletwa area, but there are no major changes in the battle line in that area. The same is true in the Buthidaung area.

Burmese Front Base, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese air force in Burma launched a surprise attack on the enemy airfield in Myitkyina, northern Burma, on the night of the 25th, braving fierce anti-aircraft fire to repeatedly attack. Seven locations were hit and caught fire. Enemy aircraft and ancillary facilities on the ground were heavily damaged. Enemy fighters attempted to intercept but were repelled. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.

Editorial

### Improving Agricultural Experimentation Work

This year is the year of increased production. Eleven months of the year have already passed. What are the results of the increased production? We have tried to review it, and it is feared that the statistical figures have not increased. In the agricultural sector, the harvest in some areas is not good. In the industrial sector, raw materials and power are limited. Therefore, the year of increased production is only a nominal term.

Regarding increased agricultural production, to achieve actual results, three conditions must be met: first, timing; second, environment; and third, technology. The former is natural, and the latter two are man-made. However, human effort can compensate for natural deficiencies, such as spraying water in times of drought. If human effort is lacking, even good timing will be in vain. Therefore, the man-made environment and technology are two major factors in increasing agricultural production.

The so-called environment belongs to the political sphere, such as the establishment of public security, which allows farmers to focus on cultivation; the elimination of arbitrary taxes and levies, which reduces the suffering of farmers; the so-called technology belongs to the scientific sphere, such as the improvement of cultivation methods, the improvement of cultivation tools, the prevention of diseases and pests, and the selection of seeds. Therefore, increased production is a practical task, not a theoretical problem. At the same time, it is a continuous task, not one that can be accomplished overnight.

Therefore, we believe that if we talk about increased agricultural production, we must first gradually achieve progress in the environment and technology. In terms of technological research, the Central Agricultural Experiment Station should bear considerable responsibility. Recently, a reporter dispatched by this newspaper to inspect various places visited the station and reported on the current working conditions of the station (see today's travel communication). After reading the visitor's notes, we deeply feel that the work of the station is limited by funding and cannot fulfill its due mission. Therefore, it contributes very little to the improvement of agricultural technology and does not meet the conditions for increasing agricultural production. We hope that the relevant authorities will improve it in practice. Here, we offer the following suggestions:

(1) Experimental institutions are not administrative institutions and absolutely require practical work, especially the demonstration and utilization of results. They must not be regarded as dispensable government offices, merely assigning a few personnel. Necessary business expenses should be increased as much as possible, but must be absolutely used for business purposes, so that all technical work can be advanced in sequence according to the pre-planned plan. Other administrative expenses should be found separately and also increased. At the same time, the experimental station must also adapt to the environment, organize and utilize part of the land for experimentation and production. Although it cannot be self-sufficient, it will be helpful.

(2) Among the staff of the experimental station, there are many who are well-educated, enthusiastic about research, and dedicated to their work, such as Gu Xinmei and Wang Linong, who are both scholars in the agricultural field and are very willing to devote their lives to their work. However, due to the pressure of life, they have to seek other part-time jobs, and their energy is dispersed. On a personal level, they feel extremely painful, and the work efficiency is greatly reduced. Therefore, the station should provide cadres who are engaged in practical work with a level of treatment that can solve their family's livelihood, so that they can devote their energy and work with peace of mind, without any worries.

(3) The station needs a lot of labor to promote experimental work, but the existing workers cannot work with peace of mind due to the poor treatment. Therefore, the treatment of workers should also be reasonably improved, and cheap distribution of daily necessities should be given in addition to wages. At the very least, they should not be regarded as side jobs, which would reduce work efficiency.

Finally, we hope that the allied countries will provide assistance in terms of technology and materials. During the wartime academic lectures organized by this newspaper and others this spring, Dr. Sasaki, an agricultural expert from the allied countries, was hired as the first lecturer to come to China to give lectures, which attached special importance to increased agricultural production. We hope that the competent authorities will take practical measures to ensure that increased agricultural production has practical results.

### A Visit to the Central Agricultural Experiment Station

— Min Xian

In recent years, the voices of revitalizing rural areas and increasing production have been sung loudly, and all parties have placed great expectations on them. This is a major undertaking related to the future of the country. The plans must be properly and meticulously developed, and the improvement of agricultural technology, which is an important condition for achieving success, must be given extreme importance. Therefore, the reporter specially visited the Central Agricultural Experiment Station.

An Old Professor Talks About the Past

The station is located on Xiaoling Street in Jiangning County, east of Nanjing. After passing through Xiaoling Street Town for about a mile, the gate of the station came into sight. A paulownia tree led to a large road. The right side of the road was planted with saplings, about ten acres in size. The left side of the road was planted with leguminous plants, such as soybeans and mung beans, as well as sesame crops, all for experimental purposes, also about ten acres in size. After a brief look, I entered the station's office and learned that the director was Chen Yanshan, director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Ministry of Industry, and the deputy director was Shen Shouquan, a famous breeding expert. Both had gone out on official business. The cabinet asked the reporter to wait in the reception room. The reporter looked around at the furnishings, which were all very simple. A gentle old man was sitting next to him. After inquiring, I learned that he was Gu Xinmei, a famous professor and rice expert, who is currently the director of the Food Crop Department of the station. Mr. Gu taught at universities in Beijing and Shanghai and is an enthusiastic educator. Speaking of all the circumstances, he sighed deeply, saying that the station had a considerable scale and history before the incident. At that time, it occupied more than 2,000 acres of land. During the incident, most of the houses were destroyed by fire. The current office building was rebuilt, and part of the land has been transferred to other uses, and part of it has been left to lie fallow due to insufficient labor. Only 1,660 acres remain, which have not been fully utilized. Speaking of the work of the Food Crop Department, he said that the scope of the Food Crop Department is generally limited to rice and wheat. Potatoes, yams, etc. are secondary. Now, in wartime, raw materials and tools are lacking, so a large number of experimental works cannot be started. Currently, only variety comparison experiments and cultivation method improvement work are being carried out. This year, rice in Jiangnan has suffered a lot from rice borers. Taking Wuxi as an example, in severe cases, the entire field has white ears and no rice can be harvested. This situation should not be ignored. Early rice cultivation is currently being tested to avoid the harm, and the results may be successful. The reporter asked whether the station currently owns more than 1,000 acres of land and can be self-sufficient. Mr. Gu said, "If in the hands of a villager, ten acres of land can maintain the life of a family, and their own labor is not counted. The public sector has limited labor and no mechanical use. The expenditure on hiring labor is huge. Regarding the hiring of labor, there are too many difficulties. Because local farmers all have their own fields, they are willing to come during the slack season, and they want to leave during the busy season. Even the long-term workers employed by the station are willing to pay fines and ask for leave during the busy season. Almost everyone who comes to work at the station regards it as a side job, and there is no adequate lower-level cadre to manage it, so that many laborers are lazy and not serious about their work, and there are other kinds of personal relationships. Self-sufficiency is not only hopeless, but also often feels insufficient." Speaking of this, the director of general affairs, Shu Yuguang, came out to see us.

Director Shu Talks About Recent Situation

According to Mr. Shu, the station currently has one director and one deputy director each. There are two offices under them: the Secretary's Office and the General Affairs Office. In addition, there are technical departments, including the Industrial Crop Department, the Food Crop Department, the Animal Husbandry Department, the Soil Fertilizer Department, the Plant Disease and Pest Department, and the Forestry Group, the Garden Group, and the Sericulture Group. Recently, the Sericulture Group may be merged with the Zhenjiang Sericulture School. In addition, there is a saying that the Dashengguan and Yaohuamen cotton production agencies will be merged with the station. Furthermore, in order to protect and increase the number of domestic animals, it is planned to establish a veterinary serum manufacturing plant in Shanghai. There is also a farm management office to handle this year's agricultural land affairs. There are fewer than 100 workers and long-term workers. The number of short-term workers varies from day to day depending on the amount of work. There are more than 100 staff members. The reporter asked about the business expenses. Mr. Shu replied that although the station receives more than one million yuan per month, most of it is for administrative expenses, and the business expenses are less than 20 percent. Later, he accompanied the reporter to visit various departments with great enthusiasm.

Work of Each Room

Room 1 - Farm Management Office - The station is an experimental institution, and all field experimental work is carried out by each department and group separately. The remaining land, accounting for about 60 percent of the total farm, is managed by the office for the purpose of breeding improved varieties and general cultivation. However, the labor, farm tools, fertilizers, seeds, etc. required by each department and group are provided by the office, and various agricultural products are also under the control of the office. The person in charge of the office said that if the facts and financial resources permit, they will improve and enrich the workers' labor, and add compost sheds and fertilizer pools to increase the fertility of the soil.

Room 2 - Food Crop Department - Hosted by Gu Xinmei, as mentioned above. When the reporter entered the room, he saw Mr. Gu busy with wheat cultivation method experiments and broad bean variety observations, so he did not bother him and withdrew.

Room 3 - Animal Husbandry Department - Hosted by Lu Xijun, the former dean of the College of Agriculture of National Central University. Unfortunately, he was out on official business and could not meet him. The work being carried out in the room is to cross Merino sheep with Chinese sheep in order to obtain superior breeds and increase wool production. A technician in the room also told the reporter that the demand for wool is greater in wartime. Taking one pound of worsted yarn as an example, it costs more than 10,000 yuan. However, Chinese sheep not only do not produce abundant wool, but also are coarse and the woven fiber is short. Merino sheep have no comparable shortcomings, but their reproduction is not as good as that of Chinese sheep. After crossbreeding, the quality will be improved and the quantity will increase.

Room 4 - Soil Fertilizer Department - The department head had also gone out on official business, so technician Zhou explained the experimental situation of increasing organic matter and improving soil properties (that is, sowing plants on the ground first, then turning them into the soil and then planting crops, which is commonly called green manure). According to him, in many places in China, farmers do not apply fertilizer when planting crops, or if they do, they are limited to using human manure and bean cakes, and they expect to harvest as much as possible. In fact, the harvest decreases year by year, so the authorities should pay attention to the allocation of artificial fertilizers and the teaching of their use.

Room 5 - A combined room for the Plant Disease and Pest Department and the Sericulture Group - Since the silkworm rearing period has passed, the Sericulture Group has no research work. The Disease and Pest Department is hosted by Wang Linong, a famous entomologist. Unfortunately, Mr. Wang went to Shanghai and could not meet him, but the tense working situation in his room is worth recording. For example, rice borers are difficult to treat and have been rampant for many years. The room is conducting research on rice borer egg parasitic wasps. According to a technician, rice borer eggs are too small and numerous to be captured, so they are allowed to hatch into moths and cause harm. Now, a kind of Trichogramma wasp is collected from abroad. This wasp is very small and likes to lay eggs in rice borer eggs. Then, the rice borer larva hatched in the rice borer egg will be eaten by it. Although it is cannibalism in the object, it is a sure-fire strategy for humans to eliminate rice borers. The speech was quite interesting.

Other groups, such as the Forestry Group, the Agricultural Economics Group, and the Agricultural Extension Group, are all working hard in their positions. After browsing all the rooms inside, Mr. Shu led a tour of the fields. There are two greenhouses and two vegetable areas. It is said that part of the vegetable area is jointly operated by the staff and their families to make a living. There was an old man with white hair and two young children working on insect work. He said that he was the father and his two sons of a staff member. Finally, I visited the harvesting field and saw cattle sheds, sheep sheds, chicken coops, pig pens, and livestock such as Dutch cattle, improved breed pigs, and Merino sheep. (Sent from Nanjing)

### Japanese Troops in Guizhou Province Reach Phoenix Ridge; Great Achievements in Three Months

Guizhou Front, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - A rapid unit of the Japanese army broke through the border of Guizhou Province on the night of the 27th, entered a 13-kilometer area within Guizhou Province, traversed Phoenix Ridge, and is continuing its advance.

Guilin, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a dispatch from the Japanese army base on the Guizhou front on the 28th, after the Japanese army attacked Liuzhou, in order to crush the Chungking forces' illusions, the first-line units are now advancing rapidly, attacking both sides of the Qian-Gui Railway in the northwest region. At present, they have broken into Guizhou Province, cutting off the command system of the 93rd Army, which is directly under the Guangxi Provincial Defense Chungking Forces, and the 20th, 28th, 46th, and 93rd Armies, all of which have fallen into a state of confusion. The Japanese army's close-quarters assault has changed into a pursuit war. The Chungking forces have now retreated to the Duyun-Dushan area.

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Powerful units of the Japanese China Expeditionary Force are pursuing into Guizhou Province. On the day of the fall of Nanning, they broke through the natural barrier of Limingguan at the southern end of the province and advanced to the Guizhou Plain. The Japanese army pursued the Chungking forces from Liuzhou into Guizhou Province. Since the 15th, they have broken through the provincial border in the Yishan and Siyu areas, and finally broke through Limingguan, a key fortress in southern Guizhou Province, on the 24th, rushing into the Guizhou Plain and continuing to pursue. After the Japanese army's sudden entry into Guizhou Province, Guizhou has been a base for Chongqing to cultivate its military strength and hinder the Japanese army's offensive since the Sino-Japanese Incident. Now it has been placed in front of the Japanese army, giving a very profound blow to the Chungking forces. Three group armies are currently stationed in Guizhou Province: the 35th Group Army, the 27th Group Army, and the 16th Group Army. All three group armies have been heavily attacked by the Japanese army and have suffered a great loss of combat power. Chongqing can only fight back with weak combat power under such a fierce attack by the Japanese army. The situation is generally chaotic. The Chongqing side had previously stated that Japan would attack Guiyang. With Chongqing's current combat power, it is difficult to prevent the Japanese army from advancing. Chongqing is in such a difficult situation that, according to reports, the results of the continental front from early September to mid-November include a total of 57,200 enemy corpses and prisoners, 411 artillery pieces, and 1,345 light and heavy machine guns. It can be seen how significant the blows to Chongqing were in the Liuzhou-Guilin campaign. Moreover, 18 aircraft, 18 locomotives, 916 passenger cars, and 62 automobiles and tanks were captured, which is an unprecedented achievement since the Sino-Japanese Incident.

Air Supremacy is in the Hands of the Japanese Army

South China Front, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The chief of the press department of the Japanese army in South China issued the following statement at 2:00 PM on the 26th regarding the battle situation after the occupation of Nanning: After the Japanese army occupied Liuzhou, they continued to advance westward, pursuing the main force of the Chungking forces. At present, they have captured Nanning in one fell swoop. The US Air Force base in the Guilin-Liuzhou area has been completely destroyed. The significance of the Japanese army's control of air supremacy in China is quite significant in the war. The key to the success of this operation was the Japanese army's ability to overcome ground difficulties and demonstrate rapid mobility. The US Air Force is sacrificing China to carry out its ambition of invading East Asia, and its tyranny has aroused the resentment of the Chinese people. During the operation, the Japanese army maintained strict military discipline and explained the East Asian situation and the purpose of the operation to the Chinese people in detail, which won the understanding of the evacuated people, who unanimously returned to assist the Japanese army. At present, the air supremacy in southern China is entirely in the hands of the Japanese army. Although the US Air Force has retreated to Kunming and Chengdu, the destruction of these bases is also a matter of time.

### Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War Will Be Expanded Commemoration

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - December 8th is the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. As the East Asian Liberation War enters the decisive stage, its significance is self-evident. The Japanese Embassy in Nanjing, in order to expand the commemorative events, specially convened relevant agencies from allied countries in Nanjing at the embassy conference room at 3:00 PM yesterday (28th) to hold a joint meeting to discuss all preparatory matters.

### Head of the New Life Movement Inspection Group Discusses Impressions of Visiting Japan: The Japanese People are Full of Hardworking Spirit

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - The New Life Movement Promotion Association of the National Government, a Japanese Production Increase Inspection Group of nine people, has been in Japan for a month since their arrival. Now that the inspection is complete, the group took a ship from Shimonoseki on the 24th to return to China. According to Mr. Zhou Sen, the head of the group, his impressions are as follows:

The impressions of this inspection can be summarized into five points. (1) In the past, we suspected whether Japan had widespread food shortages during the war, but this time, after visiting various places and witnessing the efforts of Japanese farmers and the abundance of harvests, we are certain that Japan has no food panic. (2) Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, most Japanese citizens have gone to the front lines. Therefore, most of the production increase workers in the rear are replaced by Japanese youth group members and major middle school students. Among them, what is most noteworthy is the efficiency of Japanese women's work, which is by no means inferior to that of men. This is due to the good habit of being diligent and enduring hardship. (3) The intensity of the training of Japanese youth group members and their hardworking spirit are truly admirable. Even when cold winds are blowing, they are still barefoot and bareheaded, practicing and working in the rice paddies. (4) The diligence of Japanese youth group members and the labor service guidance workers are greatly related, because the instructors can be selfless and disciplined, lead by example, and serve as a model in everything, so that those who are guided will not be lazy or idle.

(5) The whole of Japan presents a tense atmosphere, and all citizens are loyal to their duties and work hard without slackening. The so-called leisurely and carefree feelings have long disappeared. At present, Japanese military officers and civilians are united and fighting hard to serve the country, hoping to achieve final victory.

### American Planes Attack Anqing, Four Shot Down

Hankou, 28th (Central News Agency) - On the afternoon of the 25th, about ten Chongqing-American P-51 type aircraft attacked the Anqing area. With the cooperation of Japanese warships and local troops, four of them were shot down.

### Roosevelt to Take a Vacation

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports: President Roosevelt said at a press conference yesterday that he had decided to go on vacation elsewhere. This news may surprise people, but the location has not yet been determined.

### Fierce Fighting in the Northern and Southern Wings of the Western Front

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports that in the battle in the eastern district of Aachen (Roer), although the enemy used a large number of planes to assist in the battle, the progress was very limited. North of Arras in Lorraine, the left wing of the US Third Army is attacking northeast between the Moselle and Saar rivers. It made some progress at first, but was soon blocked. To the south, General Patton's army only launched small-scale attacks on the German Western Front.

Contending for Bolchen City

The enemy's vanguard on the Merzig-Saarlautern line has reached the Saar region, and to the southwest they are still fighting for Bolchen and have not yet reached St. Avold. In the Lorraine-Palatinate border area, the progress of the right wing of General Patton is slow, and three divisions have been sent by the US First Army to reinforce them, which shows that General Patton's army is exhausted.

The US Third Army, which crossed the Vosges Mountains into the central part of Arras, has had its northern wing counterattacked by the German army in order to prevent the enemy from surrounding the German army in the Vosges Mountains. The US troops in the central Vosges Mountains have crossed the mountain range and entered the Bruche Valley and its eastern slope. The US troops and the French First Army in the southern Vosges Mountains, after reinforcement, launched a fierce attack between the Vosges Mountains and the Swiss border.

Breakthrough of the Swiss Defense Line

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - Reuter reports that a German military spokesman said yesterday afternoon that French troops near the Swiss border broke through the German defense works along the Delle-Basle road. No detailed reports have been received here yet.

### Civic Welfare Association Holds 4th Members’ General Meeting: Approves Fundraising to Purchase Miscellaneous Grains for Discounted Sale

Since its establishment two years ago, the Shanghai Civic Welfare Association has spared no effort in promoting the welfare of the citizens of this city, conveying the wishes of the citizens, and assisting the authorities in implementing good policies. Its affairs are becoming more and more consolidated.

Opening Speech by Chairman Wen Lanting: "Dear members: Today, our association is holding its fourth members' general meeting. I am very pleased that you are all participating enthusiastically despite your busy schedules. Our association was established in response to the needs of the citizens of Shanghai. For the past two years, we have received the enthusiastic assistance of all members and people from all walks of life, and the affairs of the association have been thriving. In the future, we will resolutely follow the established policy and move forward, seeking genuine welfare for the citizens of Shanghai in all aspects. The various important matters recently handled by our association are detailed in the association's report, so I will not repeat them here. However, the scope of social welfare undertakings is extremely broad, and due to limited finances and the limited capabilities of our colleagues, and because we are all engaged in our own duties, it is not easy to fully satisfy the expectations of the citizens, but we will do our best to do what we can. Today, there are other proposals to be submitted to the meeting for discussion. These proposals are all related to the welfare of the citizens and urgently need to be carried out. I hope that all of you will discuss them enthusiastically and formulate concrete plans to implement them quickly. The original number of members of our association was 100. Previously, in order to strengthen the association's affairs, the board of directors decided to solicit another 100 new members, making a total of 200. In this way, with the strength of the masses, the affairs of the association will surely have continuous development. Currently, 43 new members have been recruited, all of whom are people of high reputation from all walks of life in this city and enthusiastic about public welfare. There are still 57 fewer, and we are still soliciting them. Looking forward to the future of our association, it is full of light and hope. I hope that all of you will work hard to serve our association with the intention of relieving the hunger and suffering of others, so as to benefit the citizens. I wish you all good health."

During this experimental period, all service times are temporary decisions. If the electricity increases, the full-day service will be restored immediately. We hope the citizens will pay attention to it at any time. In the near future, we will try to maintain two shifts every day, from 6:30 AM to 8:30 AM, and from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM in the afternoon, for tram lines 1, 2, 7 and 8." As for the person in charge of the French Tram Company, "In order to maintain special transportation, the company authorities have taken the same steps as the Urban Transportation Company. It was originally scheduled to resume the full-day service of lines 1, 4 and 10 yesterday (28th), but we received a temporary notice from the Huazhong Hydropower Company that it could not be implemented due to reasons. During this temporary experimental period, the service times of the vehicles are all provisional in nature. If the electricity increases, the full-day service will be restored immediately. The current service lines are 4 and 10, and the service times are from 6:30 AM to 9:00 AM, and from 3:30 PM to 6:00 PM in the afternoon."

### Carrying Out the Chairman's Will: A Letter to the People from the Chinese Kuomintang

The Chinese Kuomintang issued a letter to the people in order to carry out the Chairman's will: The original text is as follows:

The development of the National Revolution, from the late Qing Dynasty's Yiyou Year (1905) to the present, has been nearly sixty years. During these sixty years, our party comrades and revolutionary people have been nurtured by our General Sun Yat-sen, and subsequently encouraged by our Chairman Wang Jingwei. They have been able to avoid difficulties and dangers, and fight to the death with evil and corrupt forces. The revolutionary movement has continued to advance, and has continued to encounter setbacks. The most significant blows were the death of the creator of the Republic of China, our party's General Sun Yat-sen, in 1925, and the death of the Head of State, our party's Chairman Wang Jingwei, twenty years later today. At a time when the great cause of peace, anti-communism, and national construction has not yet been fully completed, and the East Asian national liberation struggle is in full swing, the revolution has lost its teacher, the people have lost their reliance, and East Asia has lost a pillar. This is truly a major misfortune for our party, and an irreparable loss for our country and East Asia. Our party comrades, the people of the whole country, and people in East Asia, are all weeping and mourning. In the midst of bewilderment and anxiety, we urgently want to inherit their legacy to comfort the spirits of our General and our Chairman in heaven. The work left unfinished by the General was continued and led by the Chairman. The work left unfinished by the Chairman is now completely entrusted to our shoulders. Looking around the world, the country is fragmented, the flames of war have not yet subsided, the obstacles to unification still exist, and the suffering of the people is already deep. With dangers ahead, how can we break through? With heavy responsibilities and a long road ahead, how can we bear them? Our party comrades, encountering this great tragedy, observe the overall situation externally and examine the national conditions internally, and increasingly feel the arduousness of our mission. Therefore, with the unanimous resolution of the Central Executive Committee, we strengthen our belief, carry out the legacy, and announce to the compatriots of the whole country, the people of East Asia, and the people of the world:

Launch a Mass Movement, Gather Revolutionary Armed Forces

Our Chairman was a revolutionary hero for the country and the successor to the General for the party. During the General's lifetime, he assisted him on the left and right, shouldered heavy responsibilities, promoted the interpretation of his ideas, advanced party affairs, and planned the revolutionary struggle, sharing hardships and not complaining. After the General's death, the Chairman accepted the will, led the comrades, and continued the struggle. Because of this, there was the establishment of party discipline, the launching of mass movements, the gathering of revolutionary armed forces, and the establishment of the National Government. It was originally hoped that the Northern Expedition would be successful, unification would be in sight, and the revolutionary movement could move from the first half of the struggle against the internal forces to the second half of the struggle against the external forces, in order to realize our party's long-cherished wish to seek freedom and equality for China and to strive for independence and liberation for Asia. Unexpectedly, just as the revolution was entering its climax, it became the most dangerous time of crisis. The remaining forces of feudalism took advantage of it to corrupt the essence of the revolution, the communists took advantage of it to split the revolutionary camp, and the imperialists took advantage of it to stifle the progress of the revolution. Changes occurred frequently, and eventually evolved into a situation of intertwined internal and external troubles since the 16th and 17th years (1927 and 1928). (To be continued)

### Personnel Changes in the Police Bureau

In addition, the Supervisory Department of the bureau strictly promotes the duty inspection work, so dozens of police officers are punished for dereliction of duty and missed posts every day, as announced by police orders.

### Police Bureau Fingerprint Fee Correction Collection Method

The Judicial Department of the Supervisory Bureau of this city has submitted a temporary method for collecting public funds for the Jianzhi Section to the Municipal Government for instructions to make appropriate revisions and implement them strictly. The main points of this method are extracted as follows: The scope of appraisal is limited to fingerprints, Chinese and Western handwriting, and weapons. Government agencies that need appraisal for official business may request free fingerprint appraisal. Collection Method for Public Funds. Because the tricyclist is a private business, the section shall press his fingerprints and check whether he has a previous record when he receives the license to determine whether to keep him. The cost of paper, ink, soap, and inspection procedures is 30 yuan per person. Other carters, pimps, petitioners, privately employed tricyclists, and privately employed car drivers are charged 100 yuan per person for the same reasons as above. Business-employed car drivers are charged 50 yuan per person, and rickshaw pullers are charged 10 yuan per person. For private requests to investigate fingerprints, the fee shall be determined according to the severity of the circumstances and the amount of materials used, ranging from 300 yuan to 5,000 yuan. For private requests to identify fingerprints, the fee shall be determined according to the type of situation, ranging from 300 yuan to 3,000 yuan. The fee for appraising handwriting is limited to private lawsuits and is currently set from 2,300 yuan to 10,000 yuan, depending on the subject of the lawsuit, and is increased or decreased according to the complexity of the work. Incidental expenses are calculated separately. All government agencies, courts, and legal entities may request the Identification Section of the bureau to appraise on behalf of their parties. As for public funds and other expenses, they shall be paid with a receipt from the bureau. For weapons appraisal, a checkup fee of 30 yuan shall be collected annually for each licensed firearm and paid with a receipt from the bureau.

### Tonight's Shenbao Cup Basketball Game: Hualian vs. Dahua, Huaying vs. Tongren

The Shenbao Cup Basketball Game has reached a crucial stage in Group A. The Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory team has won seven games out of seven. Tonight is the last second game against Dahua. If they can pass this level, they will play against Zhongbei in the championship final. Dahua is composed of new and old famous players, but unfortunately, they are inferior to others. They had great ambitions beforehand, but the model of the old generals is still there. It can be seen from the battle against Zhongbei that the victory or defeat of tonight's battle is insignificant to Dahua, but for the sake of reputation, they will inevitably do their best to compete. The battle is related to the Hualian championship, and the great battle is even more needless to say. Another Group A game, Huaying vs. Tongren, is also related to the ranking. Tonight's schedule is as follows: Qingxie vs. Fei Dui (B3) 6:30 PM, Huaying vs. Tongren (A) 7:15 PM, Hualian vs. Dahua (A) 8:15 PM.

(Hualian) Zhang Huixiang (Team Leader), Kong Guangyi (Captain), Qu Xilin, Wu Chengzhang, Fan Qinggong, Bo Tuo, Zhang Xianlun, Zhang Liangxiong, Xu Jusheng, Quan Changchun, Chen Zuoliang, Yan Youling.
