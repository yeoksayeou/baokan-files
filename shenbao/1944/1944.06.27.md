### Editorial: Seize the Opportunity

Regarding the issue of increasing agricultural production, especially grain production, we have raised it several times for the authorities' reference and to promote public attention. In today's extremely serious grain problem, the fundamental method of increasing production is indeed an urgent plan that cannot be delayed or relaxed. Allied nations such as Japan are constantly striving for excellence in increasing production during wartime, both in industry and agriculture, constantly reviewing and seeking progress. However, the conditions of the Allied nations in industrial and agricultural production, such as equipment, technology, raw materials, transportation, etc., are all stronger than ours, and we cannot hope to reach them. However, they are still not satisfied and are constantly making reforms and progress to adapt to the environment and maximize efficiency. On the other hand, the situation in our country is scattered. Although there are production increase plans, the effectiveness of implementation is still questionable. We feel even more admiration and shame for the unremitting spirit of our ally Japan.

Today, our newspaper selects and translates two articles about our ally Japan promoting food production. Although the specific methods are different from our current situation and cannot be fully adopted, the spirit of enthusiastic production increase and adaptation to the environment is sufficient to provide us with examples to catch up. In particular, the translation and commentary state: "In the past, for the purpose of expanding factory production, there was no time to consider anything else when absorbing workers. Now, due to the adjustment of military and civilian factory production and the improvement of factory labor management, it is considered possible to transfer redundant employees from factories to rural areas. This can be seen as a result of reflection based on the demands of the serious war situation, and it is truly a epoch-making policy." This further illustrates how Japan is humbly reviewing the facts and reflecting on finding more reasonable policies that can adapt to the requirements. This is especially worthy of our vigilance and imitation.

Recently, the rice price in this city has shown a slight rebound due to the continuous supply. If the entire control mechanism is improved and the overall plan can be widely implemented in various places, it is believed that the rice price will return to normal, which is very possible. Unfortunately, there are too many minor problems. Even if there are temporary emergency measures, the effect is minimal. In short, the food problem is a permanent problem. The fundamental solution lies in increasing production. It is hoped that the主管 authorities will pay attention to studying the production increase plan at any time, earnestly implement it, and strive to gradually achieve results. Regarding the current food problem in this city, we still advocate stepping up the smooth flow of sources, and must fully facilitate transportation and along the way checkpoints. According to a person from Qingpu, the Qingpu County Government originally had an order prohibiting the export of rice. When this city requested that the ban be lifted for three days, porters were transporting rice from morning to night, shoulder to shoulder, and regardless of young or old, men or women, they all went out as temporary rice sellers. From this, it can be seen that, first, there is absolutely no surplus rice in the producing area. Second, there is no one transporting rice from the producing area. The problem lies in whether there is an overall plan and passage along the way. If the government has an overall plan and can implement it in all rice-producing areas, so that transporters can make a profit, and there is no harassment or obstruction along the way, then the source can be continuously unblocked and there will be no panic.

There are still two months before the new grain is harvested. The source after two months can naturally increase in quantity. Based on the experience gained last year, in these two months, we hope that the authorities will quickly plan to reform the rice control mechanism and adjust personnel issues, eliminate all past obstacles, be reasonable and smooth the source. Time flies, and the two months will be here in a blink of an eye. Seize the opportunity and don't miss it.

### Translated Commentary: A Help to Promoting Food Production

The increase in food production is the basis for stabilizing the people's lives, and it progresses in conjunction with the increase in military demand, like interlocking gears, to consolidate the road to victory. The person in charge, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, has previously set up a central promotion headquarters related to wartime food production, and decided on a policy of requesting cooperation from all parties. On the 12th and 14th, it conducted various discussions focusing on the issue of increasing rice and wheat production. The necessary methods for increasing the production of major foods such as rice and wheat and general agricultural products do not need to be said, and cannot be exhausted in a few words. What I want to say here, in addition to the sowing of rice and the harvesting of wheat, I intend to briefly describe my views on the supplement and utilization of labor shortages in rural areas today before the busy farming season, as follows:

Originally, one of the characteristics of agriculture in our country is the small-scale operation of many families on small plots of land. However, in today's wartime, the area of strict land and the amount of agricultural labor have been greatly reduced, which is unavoidable. The authorities established a system of essential agricultural personnel on the job in February of this year, and engaged in the coordination of agricultural and industrial labor and the ensuring of rural labor. Now, in order to keep rural labor in its original state, we are also starting to plan for students and non-farm laborers and the training of female labor, in order to make up for this shortcoming. However, recently, the agricultural and commercial authorities have further realized the need to mobilize rural workers, and have also given special consideration to the mobilization of factory workers to rural areas.

Therefore, not only strengthening the agricultural mobilization of students and children related to agriculture and rural areas, but also, when necessary, planning to mobilize students who are currently employed in factories and students who are scheduled to be mobilized in factories to rural areas, and even factory workers who are employed, are also planned to be mobilized to rural areas. These are indeed noteworthy facts. In the past, for the purpose of expanding factory production, there was no time to consider anything else when absorbing workers. Now, due to the adjustment of military and civilian factory production and the improvement of factory labor management, it is considered possible to transfer redundant employees from factories to rural areas. This can be seen as a result of reflection based on the demands of the serious war situation, and it is truly a epoch-making policy. The question here is when and where should these factory workers be sent? This will probably depend on the actual situation of each factory and rural area, and will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. The most effective way to increase food production is, of course, to have factory workers and students return to rural areas. Here, there may be many difficulties in transportation and other circumstances, but in view of the precedent of the military implementing the return home system during the busy farming season, this may not be impossible. The fathers, brothers, and children who are engaged in factory labor can once again be with their families. What a happiness this will be for the agricultural families and villages in terms of spirit and production! The benefits of the integration of rural areas and factories are truly immeasurable.

In this way, the unique defense of the family's agricultural production, which is inherent in our country, will be able to be further developed, and this god of family production must immediately be expanded to the spirit of production of neighbors and the country. There is no need for the use of neighborly spirit as urgently as in today's agricultural production. No matter which village you go to, the old, weak, women, and children are all engaged in labor, and young and middle-aged men are called to the battlefield and factories. Even if there are very few healthy men left, for themselves, for their neighbors, for the caretakers of friends, and for the entire tribe, they cannot but bear two or three heavy labors.

In addition, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural tools are all distributed through the neighborly system, and the system of rice offering and rewards is basically based on the tribal unit of the neighborly system for joint and several liability. Furthermore, the arrangement of cultivated land and drainage are not the responsibility of each farmer on their own. The spirit of mutual assistance between neighbors implemented in military rescue, childcare, and other undertakings should also be fully applied to labor service, the use of agricultural machinery, and the operation of agricultural labor. Even if they are all old, weak, women, and children, and there are a few men, in order to enable them to support each other and move forward on the road to increased production, it really depends on the inherent neighborly spirit of our country to promote food production, which is also a great help.

By the night of the 24th, the Japanese army still maintains the main line of the city of Garapan and Mount Tapochau (44 meters above sea level), the highest peak of the island. It also goes out to attack from time to time or creates opportunities to dive into the enemy's position, fire artillery to prevent the enemy from using Aslito Airport, and destroy the enemy's artillery positions.

### Japanese Army Central Unit Attacks Hengyang Airport and Advances on US Air Force Base in Chongqing

A certain Japanese army base in Hunan, June 26th, Central News Agency Urgent Telegram - The Central Unit of the Japanese Chinese Expeditionary Force is continuing to attack along the Yuehan Line. At dawn on the 24th, it attacked a corner of Hengyang Airport, an important defense of the Yuehan Line and the forward base of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. It immediately defeated the stubborn resistance of about two divisions of the Chongqing 10th Army defending the airport and is currently expanding its battle results. According to the report, this is the first time that the attack on the US Air Force base stationed in Chongqing has been successful in this operation.

Lisbon, June 26th, Central News Agency Telegram - A Reuters correspondent in Chongqing said on the 25th, explaining the situation of the Japanese army's attack on Weiyang, an important strategic location in Hunan, that according to reports from the front line, the vanguard of the Japanese army has approached a location five kilometers east of Weiyang. The Japanese army advancing south along the Yuehan Line has also reached locations nine and a half kilometers northeast of Hengyang and sixteen kilometers east. In addition, the Japanese army advancing south from the east side of the Yuehan Road has also crossed Laishui and is now turning west, reaching a location about five and a half kilometers from Weiyang.

Lisbon, June 26th, Central News Agency Telegram - According to a Chongqing telegram, the Chongqing military authorities announced on the 25th that the battle situation in Hunan is as follows: Fierce battles have broken out on the Hengyang defense line. After arriving at Leixi City, the Japanese army crossed the Moshui River (a tributary of the Xiangjiang River) at noon on the 24th and attacked various locations about ten kilometers northeast of Hengyang and seventeen kilometers east. In addition, another Japanese army crossed Guashui and launched an attack, advancing westward and fighting in the area about six kilometers west of Weiyang. The battle is currently progressing throughout the entire area. Another Japanese unit broke into Pingxiang in the morning of the 24th.

The Japanese army occupied Youxian Hubei, an important base. A certain Japanese army base on the front line, June 26th, Central News Agency Telegram - The Japanese army's rapid unit went south along the Wanyang Mountains and captured Pingxiang on the 22nd. Taking advantage of the momentum, it advanced rapidly and occupied Youxian on the 25th, an important defense point for the Chongqing army defending Hengyang. After the Japanese army broke through the Yingyang Mountains, it advanced south and destroyed the Chongqing army's 26th Army from the Third War Zone, and occupied the area near Pingxiang in one fell swoop. Another unit also responded to this, destroying the remnants of the Chongqing army's 20th Army, 37th Army, and 44th Army near Liling, and annihilating the Chongqing army's second army, which was defeated and retreated from Zhuzhou, thus completing the capture of Youxian.

Lisbon, June 26th, Central News Agency Telegram - According to a Reuters important correspondent, the battle situation in Hunan is as follows: Hengyang is an important strategic location in Hunan, and has been a place contended for by military strategists since ancient times. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, it has become the most important industrial, commercial, and transportation center in Central and Southern China, because it is located at the intersection of the Yuehan and Xianggui railways, and is therefore the transportation center between South China and Sichuan Province. Therefore, if Hengyang falls into the hands of the Japanese army, not only will the Chongqing and US air forces lose a major base, but the land connection between western and eastern China will also fall into a difficult situation. Furthermore, if the Japanese army secures Hengyang and then occupies the entire Yuehan Road, it can further attack Guilin in the southwest and Guangdong in the southeast. If this is the case, the situation will become even more serious. The Chongqing army, which is poorly equipped, cannot prevent the Japanese army's armored units from advancing along the railway or highway. It is expected that the Chongqing military headquarters will attempt to counterattack after the Japanese army's transportation has been stretched to saturation or after the Japanese army has broken into the mountains of Hunan.

### Jian Department Determined to Rectify Road Police

Nanjing, June 26th, Central News Agency Telegram. The Jian Department spares no effort in rectifying the road police, but in the past, the road police were too corrupt and the accumulated habits were difficult to change, so the effectiveness achieved in a short period of time was very small. In the past, they could only check passengers and their luggage and were only responsible for maintaining order at the station. Regarding this point, I hope that all sectors of society will be aware of it. We will implement rectification as a whole, hoping that the road police can eliminate corruption and earnestly take on the responsibility of loving the road and protecting the people. In order to practice the Asian Wing-Praise Movement and communicate Chinese and Japanese ideas and culture, the Oriental Culture Research Institute was established and started to employ people of prestige from all walks of life. Now the institute has officially changed its name to the East Asian Worldview Research Institute. It not only studies abstract theories, but also establishes itself on thought and conducts research that combines knowledge and action, in order to compete with the Asian Wing-Praise Association and become one of its important affiliated institutions. It also maintains all relations with the Chinese side, conducts research and investigations, establishes lectures, publishes publications, provides itinerant guidance, and convenes lectures and seminars at any time, in order to open a new era for the establishment of the future worldview of Chinese and Japanese thought. Its future is indeed worth looking forward to.

### Professor Nikawa Hara Publishes Remarks on Post-Greater East Asia Political Organization

Tokyo, June 26th, Central News Agency Telegram. Professor Tsugiji Suwara of the Central University here argues that the political organization of post-Greater East Asia should be based on the "order of the family" to carry out all new construction. His remarks are as follows: No matter what country it is, there is no one who does not hope for the maintenance and development of his motherland, and the existence of countries under order, in short, is caused by non-oppositional, that is, selfish people. This kind of mutual opposition and selfishness is used to dream of ensuring world domination and obtaining profits from it, which is the fundamental concept of the current British and American world policy, and is also the biggest reason for the outbreak of this war. There is no reason for a country to exist in isolation or opposition. There are not many countries that can be self-sufficient economically, so the concept of a world economy has arisen. The old world economic order believed that everything could be satisfied with money, so there was often a danger of destroying this order due to political influence. A world economy is not possible without a world political background. The League of Nations was once a kind of world political organization, but because Britain and France turned this kind of political system into a tool to protect their own interests, it collapsed. At the same time, the world economy was also impossible to realize. Until now, the only way for several countries with the same destiny to cooperate with each other to seek the survival of the country is "having and not having in common" and "coexistence and co-prosperity." The ideal of building a wide-area economic zone and a co-prosperity sphere has arisen because of this, which is a historical necessity. However, a wide-area economic zone can never be realized if it does not abandon the individualism and separatism caused by the old order principle. The principle of "order of the family" can be applied to groups, and a large wide-area economic zone can be formed. The combination between individualists is based on mutual exploitation. On the contrary, the combination of families is entirely based on morality, which is the way for the coexistence of the whole and the few. Individualism even advocates abandoning the family, such as the Nomie thought of the elder son leaving the family, which represents the root thought of modern Europe, but in East Asia, both husband and wife are regarded as part of the family, and are indispensable cells for the formation of the whole. Leaving the whole means not being able to survive, which is the fundamental ideal of the family. The new order of the world in the future must be based on this principle in order to prevent the recurrence of war. Japan is currently using this kind of ideal to complete the construction of the new order of Greater East Asia. The Japanese state is based on the familial state order, and it will expand this kind of order to the entire East Asia and then present it to the world. Under the control of machinery is the postwar management theory of Britain and the United States, in other words, it can also be said to have the political concept of a police state. Taking the destruction of order as an excuse to do whatever they want, if they hold this kind of concept, they will never be able to eradicate the root of disaster.

### President Bose of the Free Indian Government Issues Statement and Is Confident That German Forces Will Win in Western Europe

Rangoon, June 26th, Central News Agency Telegram. Jiangtara Bose, president of the Provisional Government of Free India, issued a statement on the 25th regarding the start of the Allied forces' landing operation in Western Europe, as follows: The European invasion operation promoted by Britain and the United States has finally begun. This kind of move not only does not shake the Axis camp, but also causes many complaints among the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. As far as Germany is concerned, before the start of this operation, the German army repeatedly challenged Britain and the United States, hoping to start the final decisive battle as soon as possible. At the same time, the people of Britain and the United States also requested to open a second front. The Soviet army also questioned whether Britain and the United States were sincere in opening a second front, while Britain and the United States extended the deadline for two years with various excuses. As a result, the landing operation that was launched cannot be credited to themselves. The Soviet Union knew the intentions of Britain and the United States from the very beginning of the landing operation. Soviet newspapers such as "War and Labor Class Magazine" criticized the actions of Britain and the United States as inappropriate and did not recognize this European invasion operation as a real second front. Britain and the United States had to deal with Germany in order to fulfill the agreement with the Moscow government. When the operation was launched, Britain's ambition to dominate the earth and America's dream of restraining the world faced the crisis of being shattered. As a result of the fierce battles on the coast of France, the Anti-Axis has lost a lot of manpower, material resources, and resources. After the German army's unmanned planes demonstrated in London and southern England, all parts of Britain felt panicked, and the bombing of the London area still continues day and night. Therefore, the warlords of London and Washington must regret that they should not have launched the suicide landing operation. In fact, the atmosphere in Britain and the United States is extremely pessimistic. On the contrary, Germany's bear-like attitude is as usual, and it is confident to start a decisive battle with Britain and the United States. I have stayed in Germany for a long time to visit wartime Germany, so I know the internal strength of Germany very well. Therefore, I am confident that the German army will be able to completely annihilate the British and American troops who have landed. The American forces are divided between Asia and Europe, so all freedom-loving Indians welcome this fact, because the German army's launch of a destruction war against the British and American forces is most beneficial to the Indian National Army's independent struggle.

### Northern France Tank Battles: Tilly Reduced to Ruins, Enemy Fleet Discovered at the Mouth of the Orne

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency, citing official German war reports, stated: Yesterday, the enemy launched a strong infantry and tank offensive against the Tilly area, eventually occupying the ruins of the city, but suffering extremely heavy casualties.

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – A Huitong News Agency war correspondent, Webb, reported: Fierce fighting has been taking place since yesterday morning twenty kilometers west of Caen in the area of Le, which is the right flank of the anti-Axis bridgehead, no more than twenty kilometers deep. The current center of the British offensive is about six kilometers wide, with a force of about four divisions, including two tank divisions. The attack began around 7:00 AM after about five and a half hours of shelling, and fierce fighting is ongoing. So far, the Central Army has only penetrated about 1,000 meters at one point. Enemy naval and air forces are assisting in the operation, and German aircraft and artillery are also keeping pace. It is expected that the fighting in the Tilly area may expand to Caen in the coming days. The main objectives of the British forces are clearly the Bogage-Caen highway and the area south of Caen near the Orne.

Stockholm, 26th (Central News Agency) – According to a Huitong News Agency report, Reuters received official information today that British forces have occupied Tilly, and the attacking forces have advanced to within 1,000 yards of the city.

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reported: The main event on the Western European front this week was the large-scale American offensive against the Cherbourg fortress. There are also noteworthy developments in other areas. German positions on the east bank of the Orne River and between the Dives River (which flows into the Seine Bay east of the Orne River) have been under heavy Anglo-American naval artillery fire all day, indicating that the anti-Axis forces are planning to launch a large-scale operation in the area soon, further expanding their bridgehead on the east bank of the Orne. The German side further anticipates that the anti-Axis high command will attempt to re-occupy the city of Caen and advance eastward from there, thereby increasing the depth of the bridgehead. This move will require the anti-Axis forces to deploy more troops, and there is currently insufficient space for them to use. These intentions of the enemy have become increasingly clear. The enemy launched a major offensive on a broad front in the Tilly area on Sunday, which is a testament to this. According to early reports, although British forces temporarily breached some gaps in the German front lines in multiple attacks in the Tilly area, they were ultimately repelled.

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – The British have assembled a large convoy of supply ships and landing craft, numbering about 350, totaling 270,000 tons, and are using a large number of warships to protect them from naval artillery bombardment and aerial attacks, attempting to suppress the German coastal artillery east of the Orne River. However, German defensive fire still sank two landing craft off the coast of Ri de Belra.

### The Final Battle for Cherbourg

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reported military news: The final battle for Cherbourg took place at 8:00 PM last night, when the remaining German defenders telegraphed the German High Command, "The final battle for Cherbourg has begun. The commander is fighting alongside his men. Hail the Führer, Hail Greater Germany!" The great battle for Cherbourg has come to an end, and the port has fallen into the hands of the anti-Axis forces. The enemy used ten times the number of troops and war materiel of the German forces in an attempt to occupy the city yesterday. German officials released the following report on the final battle: After American tank units and infantry forces invaded the Cherbourg urban area from the south and east, the remaining German troops had only enough ammunition to last for a few hours. Enemy aircraft constantly attacked German defenses in the ruins, and enemy dive bombers also joined the battle, coordinating with their ground forces. Enemy fighters prevented the German air force from reinforcing the German defenders, and enemy warships bombarded the German defenders with heavy artillery, attacking them from all sides. However, the German troops still fought step by step, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Many enemy tanks were destroyed by landmines. The enemy reached the arsenal area at nearly 6:00 PM in the evening, and the fighting was particularly fierce. The enemy's attempt to surprise the German forces failed, and they ultimately occupied the area by bombarding the German forces with heavy artillery at close range. German defenders in the northeastern part of the Cotentin Peninsula are still fighting the enemy. The Roule fortress on the Cherbourg-Valognes road repelled all American attacks last night, and it is expected that the fighting around Cherbourg will continue.

### A Glorious Page in German War History

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – Part of the American forces broke into a corner of Cherbourg city at noon on the 25th. German forces along the coastal batteries continued to resist. At 2:26 PM on the 25th, the anti-Axis warship fired a large-caliber gun, sinking two enemy cruisers, demonstrating the bravery of the German forces. According to front-line news from the German News Agency, the German defenders of the Cherbourg fortress fought fiercely as follows: Fortress Commander Rear Admiral Hennecke continued to report on the connection between the Youke battery and the Landemare battery until 1:20 PM on the 25th. The Brommy naval battery was under land-based artillery fire, and communication with the Brommy battery was cut off at 1:37 PM. The Youke battery fiercely bombarded the anti-Axis cruiser fleet while also being subjected to intense land-based artillery fire. At 1:46 PM, German positions were heavily shelled by enemy artillery, and the entire city of Cherbourg was shrouded in intense artillery fire. At 2:02 PM, the Hamburg and Youke batteries, regardless of intense land-based and sea-based artillery fire, shelled the anti-Axis fleet. At 2:32 PM, the anti-Axis fleet finally retreated. One enemy cruiser was hit and caught fire, and the Hamburg battery sank one enemy cruiser and damaged another. At 2:40 PM, the Youke, Hamburg, and Landemare batteries continued to engage in artillery battles under enemy artillery fire and low-altitude bombing. At 3:00 PM, the anti-Axis fleet shelled the Cherbourg batteries with shrapnel from outside the range of the batteries. At 3:15 PM, the artillery commander still reported that the soldiers of the Youke and Hamburg garrisons were continuing to fight fiercely. At this time, American forces had approached the outskirts and launched a bayonet charge. The German naval batteries, despite the attack by superior enemy forces, had accomplished their mission. The battle for the Cherbourg naval port is truly a bright page in the history of the German Navy.

### Street Fighting in Vitebsk: Soviet Offensive Aimed at Minsk

Ankara, 26th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reported from Moscow: The Soviet military headquarters announced in its Sunday night communiqué that street fighting is taking place in Vitebsk, which is defended by five German infantry divisions.

Three hundred kilometers in front of the crucial point of Riga has turned into a glorious and bloody battle. A summary of reports from the front lines indicates that the four major battle areas are: Soviet forces east of Bobruisk intend to recapture Bobruisk, launching offensives from the cities of Rogachev and Zlobin. German authorities claim that German forces in this area withdrew several kilometers on the 24th and are bravely fighting from new defensive positions. In the Orsha area, Soviet forces are fiercely attacking to secure the highway from Smolensk to Minsk, but German defenses are very strong, preventing the Soviet forces from advancing as desired. In the Vitebsk area, Soviet forces intend to encircle and capture Vitebsk, while also advancing rapidly towards the cities of Polotsk and Minsk. According to German front-line reports, Soviet forces have formed a salient, which is currently being resisted by German forces.

### Soviets Lost Sixteen in Three Years of War

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reported that German officials claimed that the number of Soviet prisoners of war has reached 5,650,000. Moscow has only announced half of the losses of tanks, artillery, and aircraft. According to German estimates, in the past three years, the Soviet Union has lost 93,420 tanks, 88,646 artillery pieces, and 57,954 aircraft.

### Eastern and Western Fronts Echo Each Other

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – As the anti-Axis forces on the Italian front make steady progress and the American forces in Normandy completely encircle Cherbourg, the Soviet forces on the Eastern Front seem to be echoing this, launching a major offensive on the northern and central routes, spanning 800 kilometers of the 2,000-kilometer front. The key points of the Soviet offensive are as follows: First, the area from the Anya River through Mogilev to Orsha, with the old battlefield of Orsha in the middle. The main objective of the Soviet forces is to maintain the Smolensk-Orsha-Minsk road. Second, the flanks of Vitebsk, which has repeatedly been the site of fierce fighting since the German offensive on the Eastern Front began in 1941. Third, the Soviet offensive in the area east of Rogachev is smaller in scale and can be regarded as a feint operation against the main Vitebsk-Orsha front. Fourth, the attack aimed at encircling Ostrov from the northeast and north of Ostrov. The units deployed on each front are four divisions under the command of Soviet Generals Popov, Merekov, and Gorov. From a topographical perspective, their intention seems to be to maintain the east-west trunk road between Smolensk, Orsha, and Minsk. The German High Command believes that the Soviet forces will use camouflage operations in one area and drive their main force to break through in other areas, or gradually deploy various formations at certain times and places to implement different segmented operations. Furthermore, according to German aircraft reconnaissance, judging from the congestion of Soviet equipment, the Central Front, which has suddenly become active since the 22nd, is not the main operation, but seems to be concentrating its main force on the central and southern fronts. German authorities believe that the Soviet forces may engage in a major decisive battle with the German forces in the area from Ternopil to the Polish plains, and that a second landing operation may also be launched on the Northern France front, concurrent with the Normandy operation. Therefore, the German forces have made full preparations. The German forces are well aware that the Soviet Union's full-scale attack must be related to the Second Front of the United States and Britain. Therefore, after retreating to the predetermined line last winter, they built a very solid defensive line. Therefore, the main battlefield is placed in Northern France, with the Eastern Front being the second most important battlefield. For the enemy offensive on the Italian peninsula, they will use the inner line of operations to quickly concentrate effective forces and destroy the enemy's main force. For the Soviet Union's full-scale offensive, they will also calmly observe the development of the war situation with full confidence.

### German Troops Withdraw from Piombino Port

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reported military news: The German garrison at the port of Piombino on the northern Italian coast and the German naval artillery on the Italian mainland coast have recently withdrawn northward to avoid being encircled by the advancing enemy forces. The artillery and important facilities of the German base have been destroyed. Before withdrawing, the German garrison continuously shelled enemy artillery positions on the opposite island of Elba.

### Air Raid on Versailles: 700 Casualties

Paris, 26th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reported: Local newspapers reported that anti-Axis aircraft bombed Versailles on Saturday morning, causing about 700 casualties, including 225 deaths. A train bound for Paris was bombed, killing many passengers. In addition, Orleans was attacked twice on the 20th and 23rd, killing 350 civilians. According to the Paris Soir, the entire city of Versailles was bombed.

### Chongqing Issues 1,000 Yuan Banknotes

Central News Agency reported that Chongqing recently issued two types of banknotes, 1,000 yuan and 500 yuan, which have been circulating since the beginning of the month. However, the reasons for issuing large-denomination notes have not been specifically explained. According to Chongqing's total budget for last year, it was 3.6 trillion yuan, while revenue included only 142.4 billion yuan from customs duties, 90 billion yuan from wartime consumption tax, 212.5 billion yuan from direct tax, 37.87 billion yuan from total tax, 560 billion yuan from tobacco and alcohol tax, 37.89 billion yuan from mining tax, 341.48 billion yuan from land tax, 34 billion yuan from the new unified tax, 41.75 billion yuan from salt tax, 100.505 billion yuan from salt monopoly revenue, 68.44 billion yuan from sugar, 7.75 billion yuan from matches, and 60.01 billion yuan from cigarettes, totaling 1.10698 trillion yuan. In addition, the so-called "Victory Public Bonds" amounted to 300 billion yuan, food bonds to 639 billion yuan, and food savings bonds to 79.7 billion yuan, totaling only 2.12568 trillion yuan, still a huge shortfall of 1.514461 trillion yuan from the original expenditure budget of 3.6 trillion yuan. Therefore, it is necessary to issue large-denomination banknotes to make up for the shortfall in revenue. This is one reason. Moreover, this year's new budget is much larger than last year's, reportedly amounting to about 7 trillion yuan, making it even more necessary to issue large-denomination banknotes to support the already collapsing financial system. This is another reason. At the same time, after the Japanese army launched new operations in Henan and Hunan, Chongqing's main strongholds, Luoyang and Changsha, successively fell, and the peaceful area further expanded, leading to an increasing demand for central reserve notes. Therefore, although the reason for our government's issuance of 500 yuan notes this time is to meet the demands of silver and money merchants, on the other hand, it is also due to the needs of the new peaceful area. Conversely, Chongqing has repeatedly lost strongholds, its military base is gradually being lost, and its political position can no longer maintain public trust, resulting in higher prices and a greater shortage of materials, leading to the shaking of the entire economic foundation. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the face value of currency to balance income and expenditure. In fact, given the internal importance and difficulties, it should be understood that the issuance of these two large-denomination banknotes cannot hide the shaking of its financial foundation and the panic in the minds of the people under its rule.

The Central Headquarters for Promoting Wartime Food Production, established within the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, held its first joint meeting on the 13th of this month and its first advisory meeting on the 14th, actively engaging in concrete activities.

The Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce held its 33rd Annual General Meeting in the auditorium of the Chamber at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 26th), and drew lots to re-elect directors and supervisors. A total of all directors, supervisors, and member representatives of various trade associations attended. Competent authorities sent personnel to attend and provide guidance. Details are compiled as follows:

### Attendees

Representatives of the competent authorities included: Mai Jingming, Director of the Insurance Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Industry; Huang Xianggu, Director of the Social Insurance Bureau of the Ministry of Social Welfare; Wu Zuyao, Section Chief of the Economic Bureau of the Municipal Government; Sun Mingqi, Director of the Social Welfare Bureau; Xi Peiwen and Shen Jianfeng of the Shanghai Branch of the New Movement Association; Zhu Yangwu of the Food Bureau; Lu Jizhi and Duan Bingyan of the First District Public Office; Cao Boquan of the Commercial Coordination Association; and others.

### Solemn Ceremony

The presidium of the general meeting was composed of Lin Kanghou, Wen Lanting, Pei Yunqing, Wang Boyuan, Guo Shun, Huang Jiangquan, and Shen Weiting. The meeting was opened with a bell, and the presidium took their seats. The entire assembly stood at attention and paid the highest respect to the national flag and the portrait of the Father of the Nation. A moment of silence was observed. The chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting. Chairman Yuan Yangke was hospitalized, and Pei Yunqing delivered a farewell speech on his behalf, stating, "I have been in charge of this association for two years. Looking back on the past two years, it has been since the opening of the Greater East Asia War. In order to adapt to the wartime system, under the policy of "controlled economy," industry and commerce have borne the brunt of the impact, facing an unprecedentedly severe era. Therefore, in the past two years, there have been countless storms and waves. In terms of industry, there is a lack of raw materials, limitations on power, and continuous price increases, which have led to a sharp increase in wages, affecting costs and output, and leaving us in a precarious situation. In terms of commerce, the sources of goods are scarce, most commodity prices are controlled, the cost of living continues to rise, expenditures increase sharply, and inventories dwindle, causing many to worry about "sitting and eating until the mountain is empty." As for the countless difficulties faced by the industrial and commercial sectors and the unexpected events that occur from time to time, they are even more numerous. Although this association has made repeated meager efforts within its responsibilities, the results have been limited. This is partly due to environmental constraints and partly due to my own mediocre talents and lack of credibility. I have rushed about in vain, unable to alleviate the current difficulties, and I feel guilty before the gods. Fortunately, I have been assisted by all the directors and supervisors, as well as the diligent and dedicated work of all members of this association. With the understanding of our members, we have been able to barely maintain the current situation. This is what I should be grateful for and what I can be content with. In addition to the routine reports on the work of each department under the jurisdiction of this association at this year's general meeting, the proposals of the members of each industry and the proposals of this association have been carefully reviewed and offered for discussion. I hope that everyone will express their valuable opinions, promote industrial and commercial welfare, alleviate the difficulties encountered, and gather ideas for the benefit of all. Standing Director Lin Kanghou reported on general affairs, and Wang Boyuan reported on financial affairs. Regarding the budget of this association, according to the provisions of the association charter, it should be submitted to the general meeting of members for resolution and reported to the competent authorities for record. However, due to the sharp and rapid increase in various commodity prices in recent years, which have deviated from the norm, the work of preparing the budget for the assembly has also become very difficult. In order to suit the actual situation, it is proposed to prepare the budget and final accounts simultaneously at the end of the fiscal year, submit them to the board of directors for approval, send them to the board of supervisors for review, and then submit them to the general meeting of members for ratification and report them to the competent authorities for record. Shen Weiting reported on guidance, Wang Boyuan reported on commerce on behalf of Ye Fuzhi, and Guo Shun reported on investigations. Officials delivered speeches, with Lai Jingming and Huang Xianggu representing the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Social Welfare, respectively.

### Discussion Proposals

The discussion proposals were presided over by Lin Kanghou: 5 proposals to strengthen the association and its affiliated trade associations; 3 proposals to improve the grain administration control system; 1 proposal that inspections of weights and measures should be leniently punished; 1 proposal to thoroughly liberalize the free trade of secondary commodities; 1 proposal to fairly allocate special industrial and commercial raw materials; (omitted); 3 proposals to revise the articles of association; 4 proposals to strengthen the organization and develop the affairs of the association; 1 proposal on how to eliminate obstacles and dredge the sources of materials, as transportation and traffic are the lifeblood of commerce, to benefit commerce; 1 proposal on how to increase the electricity consumption for important industrial use to benefit production; the price limits set by the authorities are not only inconsistent with reality in terms of high and low levels, but also the approval period is indefinitely extended, often the time when the first price limit is announced is the preparation period for the second and third price limits, causing great suffering to merchants and people, 1 proposal on how to improve the situation to alleviate the difficulties of merchants; 1 proposal that the Shanxi Road Bridge and Fujian Road Bridge on the Suzhou River have not yet been opened, affecting the commerce of the northern district, and it is proposed to petition the authorities to open them immediately to prosper the market; 1 proposal to petition the economic and administrative authorities to restrict the prices of raw materials, and to stipulate a time limit for the application and evaluation of manufactured products, so as to avoid affecting the difficulty of manufacturers' reproduction and maintain industry; 1 proposal to levy a 4% wartime consumption special tax on embroidery products, as ordinary goods, exempt from the list of luxury goods, in order to maintain production; 1 proposal that Article 13 of the Provisional Regulations for Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations should delete the restriction of "major commodities", so that industries that deal with major commodities can also follow the example of strengthening trade associations; 1 proposal to request the transfer to the financial authorities to unify the business tax collection methods in various districts of the city, "Since the city has recovered the concessions, the amount of business tax is inconsistent, resulting in the need to levy taxes in districts such as Nanshi and Zhabei, while those that can be exempted are districts such as District 1 and the old eight districts, so that merchants and people do not know what to do," in order to eliminate disputes and unify the tax policy; 1 proposal to request the transfer to the Ministry of Finance to exempt the Shanghai yarn and cloth industry from the profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the 32nd year of the Republic of China; 1 proposal to request the transfer to the government to promote handicrafts to meet the needs of the people, and to give special protection to the hand-woven industry, a total of 18 proposals, all of which were resolved by the general assembly, and detailed cases will be published separately.

### Election by Drawing Lots

Subsequently, Wu Zuyou, the representative of the competent authority, drew lots, and the remaining directors were Yuan Ludeng, Qin Runqing, Jin Zongcheng, Xiao Yicheng, Wang Renqing, Wei Shanfu, Pan Xusheng, Zhang Lianfang, Shen Weiya, Niu Zhizi, and Xie Meisheng, a total of 11 people. The remaining supervisors were Lin Kanghou, Wen Ting, Wu Yunzhai, Chen Zhongnan, Wu Dingming, and Wang Housheng, a total of 6 people. Then, the directors and supervisors were re-elected. As a result, Shen Weiting, Xi Rungeng, Xie Xiaochu, Chen Panjun, He Wuliang, Yang Guanqi, Cen Zhiliang, Dai Zibin, Li Gengyang, and Shen Kunquan, 10 people, were elected as directors, and Pei Yunqing, Guo Shun, Wang Boyuan, Jiang Shangda, and Qian Zongfan, 5 people, were elected as supervisors, and 7 alternate directors and 4 supervisors were elected.

Then, Wen Lantong delivered the closing speech, roughly saying, "It has been two years since the establishment of the association. This is the second annual meeting, and it is also the time for the directors and supervisors to draw lots to re-elect half of them. The meaning of today's meeting is very important. Fortunately, we have received guidance and encouragement from all the esteemed guests, and we are deeply grateful. It is especially gratifying to see all the members attending enthusiastically and gathering together. I hope that in the future, all the affairs of the association must pay attention to the instructions of the superiors and work hard to live up to everyone's expectations. It is expected that after this increase in new life, there will be more progress at next year's annual meeting," and so on. Finally, a group photo was taken, and the meeting adjourned at 8 o'clock.

### Thoughts on the Major Battle of the Mariana Islands - Broadcast Speech by Director Osaka of the Continental News

Director Yoichi Osako of the Continental News delivered a broadcast speech on the Mariana Islands operation at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station at 9 pm on the 25th. The main points are as follows:

### Clumsy Tactics Will Inevitably Lead to Failure

I would like to briefly state my thoughts on the major battle situation in the Mariana Islands, which is currently in fierce fighting. Observing the current battle situation with a cold eye, I can assert that "the enemy America has already been defeated." In all military operations, it is most clumsy to divide one's own strength against the enemy into two. The reason for the failure is rooted in this. For example, the enemy America has poured most of its forces into the second front in Europe, and then concentrated the remaining forces on the Pacific front, which is this kind of situation. The reason why the enemy America took this reckless move must be that they underestimated the Japanese air power in the Inner South Seas. Considering the attack on Saipan, it was a major gamble. The enemy believed that once Saipan was attacked, the Japanese army would definitely come out to fight, and they could destroy them in one fell swoop and resolve the Pacific War. Moreover, if they could seize Saipan, the distance to Tokyo could be reduced to 1,268 nautical miles, and the distance to the Philippines could be reduced to 1,500 nautical miles. Then, with the B29 bomber, they could bomb Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Yokohama, the Philippines, and other places, all under the control of the air. Once the air supremacy in the Western Pacific is secured, and then the sea supremacy is grasped, the connection between Japan and the South Seas can be cut off.

### The Japanese Army Obtained Unprecedented Results

The enemy America, with most of the Pacific Fleet, consisting of more than 20 aircraft carriers and more than 10 battleships, led more than 100 transport ships, and began attacking Saipan on the 11th. The attacks were repeatedly unsuccessful until the 15th, when the third landing operation was successfully carried out, and about two divisions of troops were deployed to land successfully, and fleets were dispatched to surround them from all sides. In addition to bombing with carrier-based aircraft, they also used naval guns to bombard. The Imperial Navy had anticipated this action of the enemy long ago, and had been secretly preparing for it, waiting for the opportunity to annihilate the enemy. As a result, from the 12th to the 18th, our air force carried out fierce battles, and from the 19th to the 20th, part of our combined fleet launched a dignified attack. On the 23rd, the air force was even more active, and a total of 4 battleships, more than 11 aircraft carriers, 6 cruisers, 1 destroyer, 1 warship of unknown type, and 1 submarine were sunk or damaged, 6 transport ships were sunk or damaged, and more than 400 aircraft were shot down or damaged. This was the greatest victory since Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. Although it has not been possible to obtain a decisive victory over the entire mobile force dispatched by the enemy, it can be asserted that the enemy has already begun to carry out evasive operations outside the bombing range of the aircraft.

### Remote Logistics Base, Many Difficulties

The nature of modern naval warfare is completely different from the naval battle of the Sea of Japan in previous years. Due to the advancement of fleet equipment, the increase in the radius of action after the development of aircraft, and the expansion of the battlefield, the operations are becoming increasingly difficult. For example, the occupation of the sea and space has become meaningless. Only by directly destroying the enemy or destroying the enemy's air base and destroying the enemy's air power is it a necessary condition. Moreover, the two sides are hundreds of nautical miles apart, and they are launching search operations day and night. From this, it can be seen that modern warfare is complex and profound, and it is by no means as simple as ordinary people imagine. Therefore, it is impossible to seek a great victory without any damage to oneself. In this battle, our side also lost one aircraft carrier, two auxiliary oil tankers, and 50 aircraft. This battle has the greatest and most important character since the outbreak of the war. The importance of the wartime logistics line is self-evident, but the enemy America's closest logistics base, the Marshall Islands, is also more than 1,000 nautical miles away. Such a remote logistics line is unprecedented, and the difficulty is naturally in mind. On the contrary, our side can be supplied continuously from the country through the Ogasawara Islands, which is extremely convenient. By waiting for work at ease, the enemy army can be annihilated.

### Wallace's Trip to Chongqing Aims to Strengthen Pressure on Chongqing - Statement by Minister Matsudaira

The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held a regular press conference for Chinese journalists from the city at the Huamao Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, at 2 pm yesterday (26th). The embassy was attended by Minister of Information Matsudaira, Vice Consul Fukuma, and others. Minister Matsudaira gave a detailed account of the purpose of US Vice President Wallace's trip to Chongqing. The details are as follows:

### Purpose of Trip to Chongqing

Minister of Information Matsudaira first said: US Vice President Wallace, after arriving in Chongqing on the 20th of this month, held four or five talks with Chiang Kai-shek. On the 24th, he even issued a simple joint statement, which stated in detail: "The two sides have completely identical views on basic principles and objectives, and at the same time reaffirmed mutual assistance in the war against Japan," and so on. Mr. Matsudaira said: According to the information he obtained, the purpose of Wallace's trip to Chongqing was to try to prevent the tendency of nationalism from occurring within the Chongqing regime, and at the same time prevent Chongqing from resuming its movements in East Asia. Recently, the British and American media have fiercely attacked Chiang Kai-shek's "China's Destiny," believing that it has reactionary and xenophobic ideas. In addition, the Five-Five Constitution of Chongqing has also been severely attacked as not being democratic, and they have also instigated reporters stationed in Chongqing to demand so-called freedom of speech. This is the means used by Britain and the United States to prevent Chongqing from becoming self-aware.

### Oppressing Chongqing

Minister Matsudaira also said: Recently, when Chongqing and the Communist Party of China abolished the army, Chongqing frankly resolved the Communist Party as a party fighting for political power. Britain and the United States regarded Chongqing's attitude towards the Communist Party as reactionary and totalitarian, and oppressed Chongqing to make concessions to the Communist Party. After the Cairo Conference, Chongqing had a considerable atmosphere of excitement, but after March of this year, due to the soaring prices in Chongqing, especially the shortage of food, and externally, because Japan preemptively launched operations on the Indian-Burmese border, causing the intensification of the Indian independence movement, and the operations in Henan Province, the unexpectedly rapid progress of the Japanese army aroused anxiety among the Chongqing military, government, and people, and there was a hope of returning to East Asia. Therefore, the United States immediately dispatched Wallace to try to prevent it. Finally, Mr. Matsudaira said that according to our observations, the United States will demand more from Chongqing in the future, and the pressure from Japan will become more widespread. In the future, all the actions of Chongqing's top leaders will be forced to follow the instructions of the United States, and Chongqing's hope of self-awareness will become narrower. This is not only harmful to the development of Greater East Asia, but also useless. In order to thoroughly eliminate the opium and refresh the appearance of the city, a Drug and Gambling Investigation Section has been specially set up in the judicial department, and excellent police officers have been selected to take on the investigation work. It will be officially established on July 1st to start work and severely investigate the crimes of manufacturing and selling opium and drugs.

### Household Registration Section Reassigned to the Baojia Section

The household registration section originally established in the administrative office of the First Police Bureau of the city has recently been ordered to be abolished. The original household registration work is now handled by the Baojia Section of the First Police Bureau, which is taken over by the Second Section under the jurisdiction of the office. After thorough investigation, it was found that Yang Chuan and others' job-related behavior of accepting bribes

### Was Truly Illegal

The inspector-general, Weng Changxi, who was in a supervisory position, failed to fulfill his duties in investigating the case, but instead acted as a bribe-giver, and is also suspected of dereliction of duty. He should be dismissed from his post, and the fugitive Jiang Zhenzhou should be investigated. The investigation of the above-mentioned criminals has now been completed, and they have been handed over to the local procuratorate for interrogation, and then to the local court for investigation and punishment according to law.

### Police Officers of Huashan Road Sub-Bureau Prosecuted According to Law for Dereliction of Duty and Accepting Bribes

Regarding the case of Yang Peisheng, director of the judicial division of the Huashan Road Sub-Bureau of the First Police Bureau of the city, investigator Fu Xiaofu, and inspector-general Weng Changxi, and others accepting bribes and dereliction of duty, a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday made a special visit to the director of the bureau, Li Shiyu, who explained in detail the process of the bribery and dereliction of duty case: When the city's household rice was distributed by the Huazhong Rice Allocation Association, it was first weighed by the Maritime Affairs Office to show fairness. However, the staff

### Secretly Engaged in Malpractice

Reduced the number of catties weighed, reported more than less, filled in the weighing list, and sold the embezzled amount at black market prices to make profits. The incident was detected by Yang Peisheng, director of the judicial division of the Huashan Road Sub-Bureau, and others, who arrested Qi Weiyuan and other seven staff members of the weighing department of the Maritime Affairs Office. After interrogation, they were found guilty of embezzlement in their work, and were sent to the procuratorate for review in mid-May. When Yang Peisheng and the handling investigator Fu Xiaofu were handling the case, they planned to go to Yangshupu first to arrest a few rice merchants, saying that they were suspected of

### Buying Stolen Goods

And falsely accused the district chief of the rice industry, Lu Jingwu, that they would continue to arrest other colleagues, spreading the word outside. The rice merchants were panicked and went to Yang Chuan to dredge the relationship, hoping to avoid investigation. At that time, Chuan Xiaofu and Jiang Zhenzhou, the eye line in the case who was at large, were specially responsible for contacting the rice merchants. 16 companies including Yuantai Rice Store handed over 160,000 yuan to Chuan, and 30 companies including Dayoukang handed over 300,000 yuan to Yang, and 9 companies including Sanyang handed over 130,000 yuan to Jiang, a total of 590,000 yuan. Except for the expenses for the eye line Jiang for opening up the room and meals at the Dongfang Hotel when contacting, and the refund of 160,000 yuan to the rice merchants, the remaining 270,000 yuan,

Has been transferred out. When Yang and Fu were handling the case, the Shanghai Office of the Inspectorate became aware of it, and Chuan presented a 150,000 yuan promissory note from Juxingcheng Bank to Weng Changxi, the inspector-general of the district, to dredge the relationship, hoping to make up for the settlement. Weng showed the ticket to Saito Tadashi, a Japanese inspector, who refused and ordered him to return it immediately. Weng returned the original ticket after two or three days, and sent Zhang Rou, a member of the interrogation section, and Huang Erchang, the detective chief of the investigation section, to Saito Tadashi of the Inspectorate

### Electric Tram Service Restored in District 1

The Shanghai Electric Tram Company, in order to care for the difficult life of its employees, has promised to provide great guarantees to all employees, and in order to facilitate the transportation of citizens, it has managed to restore the operation of routes 1, 2, 7, and 8 and the four main lines yesterday afternoon (26th). Most of the employees, after understanding the company's sincerity and considering the inconvenience of transportation for all citizens, have returned to the factory to serve. The company's Beikai Road Factory, Jing'an Temple Road Depot, Huishan Depot, Jiading Road Station, Jing'an Temple Station, etc., all posted notices, roughly saying: "Our company has given all employees great guarantees. The result of the operation on this (26th) day shows that there is no difficulty or uneasiness at all. Therefore, the scheduled trains will be operated as usual tomorrow (27th) morning. Please go to the depot as usual to serve. Please do not delay," etc. The company is very sorry for the inconvenience caused to the citizens by this strike, and sincerely hopes that all employees will return to work immediately and continue to serve, restore the entire line, and facilitate the citizens.

### Residents of Military-Managed Apartments Extended Their Eviction Date

Regarding the issue of the evacuation of residents from military-managed apartments, according to reliable sources, it is now known that the military-managed apartments will be rented by military families in the future, while the original rented residents will move into the residences of British and American expatriates in Shanghai. The original plan was for all residents of the apartments under military management to evacuate before the 15th of this month, but because some of the British and American expatriates have not yet moved into the concentration camps, it has been decided to reschedule the evacuation to early July. It is also heard that the British and American expatriates who have not yet entered the concentration camps will all be transferred to the concentration camps by the end of this month.

### Li Xianglan Hosts Cultural Figures

The famous movie star Li Xianglan's solo concert, sponsored by the China Film Federation Company and supported by the Manchukuo Film Association, will be held at the Lyceum Theatre at 2:30 pm and 8:30 pm on the 1st of next month, and at 8:30 pm on the 2nd and 3rd.

### National Forum: Suggesting Various Guilds Establish Scholarship Funds for Children of Workers

— Long

In the past month, due to the abnormal fluctuations in rice prices, all levels of society have been greatly affected, especially the matter of tuition fees for the next semester, which is the most serious. If only a slight increase is made, schools will naturally have difficulties maintaining operations. However, if the increase is too large (such as the rumored tuition fee conversion to rice policy), parents will be even more helpless and at a loss.

The so-called parents are mostly salaried employees. Their monthly income, when stretched to support a family of eight, will leave them with hardly enough to eat. Even maintaining personal life is difficult. Although the Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers have measures such as scholarships and student loans, they are like a small amount of porridge for many monks, ultimately difficult to universalize. Looking back at various industries, except for a very few exceptions, the rest have substantial financial resources. Taking the hardware, foreign goods, and new medicine industries as examples, they have received special favors over the years, becoming the darlings of big business, with asset values soaring. If each guild could raise millions or tens of millions of yuan from its members to serve as scholarship funds for the children of workers, it would be easy and achievable in one fell swoop. I believe that the directors and supervisors of various trade guilds are all outstanding individuals, renowned in their time, and admired by people from all walks of life. They should have keen insight and make this grand aspiration, opening up a path for the children of ordinary workers to continue their education, indirectly sharing some of the national responsibilities, and also creating blessings for their own descendants.

Recently, it was reported that the Egg Industry and Thermos Bottle Industry guilds have both started to handle scholarship matters for the children of workers, and the Changzhou Fellow Association and others have also declared their continued efforts to run scholarship funds. It is believed that other industry guilds and fellow associations have strengths no less than those listed above, so why worry about not being able to catch up quickly and stand shoulder to shoulder with them?

However, if various industry guilds or fellow associations believe that there is no problem with providing funds, they may entrust the Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers to handle the administrative aspects, in order to achieve efficient results. I believe that the authorities of both newspapers have always regarded nurturing talents as their own responsibility and will certainly not refuse.

### Naval Painters (8): The Navy

— Written by Toyoo Iwata, Translated by Hong Yang

"Principal Kawaide and Mr. Ogata both saw you when you entered the school in Kagoshima."

Masato said this while starting to peel the skin of a preserved fruit.

"Oh, are the teachers both well?"

Tadao also thought of his alma mater and felt a surge of infinite emotion.

"They are both safe and sound. Mr. Ogata likes cigarettes very much, so I gave him three boxes of 'Hope' brand cigarettes. He was very happy. Those cigarettes are very hard to get these days."

"He likes cigarettes and also likes sake."

"Yes, there are very few teachers as memorable as him. Also, a memorial monument for the fallen soldiers has been erected on the second middle school's parade ground, did you know?"
"I didn't know that."

"A very solemn monument has been erected in front of the east side of the school building. The names of the alumni who died in action from the September 18th Incident to the July 7th Incident are engraved on the monument. My older brother's name is also on it."

"So, Shinichiro died in action. When I saw it in the Kagoshima newspaper, I was filled with regret!"

"Yes, in the end, my brother died before me."

Masato said this slowly and calmly.

"You are also a soldier, you might be listed on the memorial monument for the fallen soldiers at some point."

"…"

Masato looked down and smiled slightly, using a fork to spear a persimmon.

"Speaking of this, even if I dedicate my life to painting warships, I won't be listed on the memorial monument for the fallen soldiers. Thinking about that makes me really depressed!"

"You shouldn't think about these things. Whether it's you or me, as Japanese citizens, we are no different. If you think that only soldiers can enjoy fame, I think that's wrong."

These words were spoken in a low voice, but with great strength. Tadao was silent for a moment.

"Well then, let's go!"

Masato called the waiter to settle the bill. Tadao hurriedly stopped him, saying that Tokyo was his home and he should naturally be the host, but Masato smiled and said:

"I've already received my salary. Aren't you still relying on your family to make a living?"

As soon as Tadao heard these words, he stopped arguing about paying and just scratched the top of his head.

Although the two of them left the restaurant, neither of them wanted to part ways. At the same time, neither of them was the type of person who could drink continuously.

"There are still many things I want to say and hear. Masato, do you have to return to Yokosuka?"

"Not necessarily, but lately I've gotten used to sleeping on the ship, and I feel very comfortable."

"Well then, why don't you come stay at my apartment for the night? Although it's a simple and uncomfortable room…"

"That doesn't matter. Okay, I'll bother you for one night!" Masato readily agreed. (107)

Gratitude to Nanyang Hospital: I was previously introduced by your column to Nanyang Hospital for a free lung examination and was found to have pulmonary tuberculosis, requiring hospitalization for treatment. However, I am a poor and weak teacher, how could I afford the huge medical expenses? Fortunately, the hospital president generously agreed to free hospitalization and administered artificial pneumothorax and medication. I was admitted to the hospital on the 2nd of this month and discharged on the 17th. During that time, I received careful treatment from Dr. Ding, the director of the Department of Tuberculosis, and my condition improved day by day. Moreover, the wards were clean and bright, and the nurses provided attentive service, which made the patients feel infinitely comforted! Recalling the sincerity of your introduction and the kindness of the hospital, I specially write this letter to express my gratitude and will never forget it. Sincerely, Wu Xuehai.
