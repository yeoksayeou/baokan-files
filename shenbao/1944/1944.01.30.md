### Sunday Commentary: Re-evaluating the Relationship Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party - Yoshida Higashi

Shanghai is a place where people often discuss possible events as if they were already realities. Recently, two rumors have been circulating like wildfire: one about a reconciliation between Britain and Germany, and the other about Chiang Kai-shek visiting Yan'an. According to the world situation a month ago, both rumors were still limited to possibilities. To turn these possibilities into realities, objective conditions are naturally required. Before listening to such rumors, it is best for people in Shanghai to first examine whether there are such objective conditions in the current world situation.

One of the most significant characteristics of the recent friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is that Chiang Kai-shek himself has been drawn into the vortex of this struggle. In the past, no matter how intense or sharp the friction between the two parties was, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) always adopted a policy of "pointing at the mulberry tree while scolding the locust tree," that is, criticizing the "anti-communist trinity" of He Yingqin, Zhang Qun, Chen Lifu, and others, while indirectly attacking Chiang Kai-shek. Since Chiang Kai-shek published his book "China's Destiny," he has become the ideological guide of the "anti-communist trinity," and the CCP has directly and openly attacked Chiang Kai-shek himself. This political offensive by the CCP clearly reflects the successful progress of the Soviet army on the Eastern Front. It is purely speculation that Chiang Kai-shek would personally visit Yan'an to ease this domestic situation. However, this speculation ignores the following objective situations.

Chiang Kai-shek still has not relaxed his military blockade policy against the Chinese Communist Party. Under the current international situation, Chiang Kai-shek cannot openly wage war against the CCP. However, he naturally cannot turn a blind eye to the CCP's expansion of its influence beyond the blockade line. Britain and the United States also do not want Chiang Kai-shek to overly suppress the CCP, causing a large-scale massacre between the two parties, which would weaken Chongqing's ability to resist Japan. However, as long as this limit is not exceeded, Britain and the United States will naturally not speak out, no matter how Chiang Kai-shek suppresses the CCP.

Chiang Kai-shek believes that if the Allied forces win, then "a final victory" will be his own merit, and the people of the whole country will support him personally. Therefore, using this popular support to eliminate the Chinese Communist Party is something that can be achieved overnight. Chiang Kai-shek also believes that if, under certain circumstances, he can compromise with Japan, then with the assistance of Japanese military force, eliminating the Chinese Communist Party would also be an easy task. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek believes that no matter which path he takes, it will not harm him. Before the final opportunity arrives, it is enough to limit the development of the CCP. This is the true intention behind Chiang Kai-shek's blockade policy of the border regions, and it is also the hope of Britain and the United States.

If Chiang Kai-shek immediately launches an anti-communist war, it will weaken Chongqing's anti-Japanese fighting force, and it will also weaken the Soviet Union's anti-German fighting force. Because the CCP is based in Yan'an, it is in fact guarding the Soviet Union's Far Eastern border. If the Soviet Union's Far Eastern border is not secure, the Soviet Union will have to withdraw troops from the German-Soviet front. Therefore, before the final opportunity (i.e., the collapse of the Soviet Union or the collapse of Germany, preferably both suffering heavy losses) arrives, Britain and the United States are also unwilling for Chongqing to provoke the Soviet Union.

### Chief Iguichi's Speech on the Anniversary of the National Socialist Party's Rule: Believes the Glorious Victory of Germany is Not Far Off

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency): The 29th is the 13th anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule in Germany. Chief Igaichi, Second Department of the Japanese Information Bureau, specially invited German correspondents stationed in Japan to give a speech. The gist of the speech was: Since the assumption of power by Führer Hitler on January 30, 1933, eleven years have passed, and the great achievements of the National Socialist Party are rare in history. The most important of these is the unity of the German nation and the consolidated position of Germany in the world. Since 1933, German production has increased year by year, and German industries on the verge of bankruptcy have been rescued. The German nation has been rescued from division and reorganized. The progress of the German National Socialist Party during its eleven years in power is not like that of Britain and the United States, which aims to dominate the world, but lies in ensuring the survival of the German nation. However, Germany's survival and attempt are incompatible with the totalitarianism of Britain and the United States, which attempts to place the whole world under its control. London and New York are actively engaged in war instigation, so Germany has no choice but to launch a war. Germany must fight bravely to ensure its survival, which is the same as Japan, and the basis of the alliance between Japan and Germany also lies here. The complete success of the German National Socialist Party is the time to smash Anglo-American totalitarianism. The enemy has recently launched a major propaganda campaign to launch a European landing operation. The time when they start the landing operation is the time for Germany to exert its combat power. I firmly believe that Germany's glorious victory is not far off.

### Argentina Takes Measures After Severing Ties with the Axis

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency): According to the Argentine president, who met with reporters on the 28th, regarding the countermeasures taken by the Argentine government after severing ties with the Axis powers, he declared, "It is not yet time to explain some of the measures that will be implemented immediately after severing ties with the Axis countries. However, as a result of the severance of ties, certain measures should be taken internally in terms of domestic policies, and necessary measures should be taken internationally to protect the rights and interests of Argentine citizens. I believe that the above countermeasures are extremely important. As of yesterday, the representatives of the two countries in Argentina have lost their qualifications as representatives, but based on international courtesy and other principles, they continue to receive protection and preferential treatment, and the representatives of the Argentine government receive the same treatment. Although the Argentine government has severed diplomatic relations with Japan and Germany, it does not target the citizens of these two countries. Therefore, Japanese and German citizens residing in Argentina must sincerely understand the Argentine government's generous purpose. The Argentine government will not take any measures except for general vigilance. However, publicity envoys will be subject to more stringent controls than usual. Regarding trade, the Argentine government is gradually implementing plans for close cooperation with the countries of the Americas."

### Fierce Soviet Offensive in the Northern Sector; German Troops Retreat from Tosno

Stockholm, 29th (Central News Agency): The Soviet offensive in the northern sector of the Eastern Front has intensified in recent days, and there are roughly five lines of attack. One is from the Orenienbaum area, attacking Narva on the Estonian border. Another is to cut off the railway between Leningrad and Luga. One is from Tosno, heading towards Luga. Another is from Novgorot-Seversky, targeting Badiegaia on the railway between Leningrad and Vitebsk, and then advancing to take Luga. One is from Staraya to attack Dno. Fierce battles have broken out in all of the above locations, with the greatest pressure from the Soviet forces in the southern Leningrad area. According to a message from Berlin on the 28th, the German army retreated from Tosno on the railway between Leningrad and Moscow and from Vozhasovo on the railway between Leningrad and Narva. A tug-of-war is currently taking place along the line from Lyuban, west of Tosno, and from Chimotvo in the south of the area to the east of Badiegaia. It is said that street fighting has also broken out in Lyuban and Chimotvo, and the battle area is gradually approaching Leningrad. The railway line to Vitebsk is also under battle around Lake Irno. The Soviet army under General Merekov is also aiming at Badiegaia and Dno, carrying out a strong advance. According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, the vanguard of the Soviet army has reached Simsuk, 28 miles northwest of Staraya Russa.

### A Gamble to the Last Ditch: An Overview of the German-Soviet Front

Two and a half years since the start of the war, the German-Soviet war, which has undergone many fierce battles, now takes the great plains of western Ukraine as its main battlefield, with fierce battles raging in various parts of the central and southern regions. Falling snow, severe cold from five or six degrees below zero to twenty degrees below zero, and constant blizzards: under this great nature, the Red Army is exerting all its strength to try to regain the world, and the German army is responding with flexible tactics. The situation in which the two armies are engaged is truly an unprecedented continental defense war in history. The German authorities have also pointed out the seriousness of the battle situation, and the urgent situation in Western Europe, as well as the complex political problems that come with the westward shift of the war, in military and political terms, its turbulence condenses new visions.

### A Glimpse of the Current Battle Lines

The current battle line stretches from the Galeria Isthmus in the north, through the Leningrad region, to Navel in the center, and Vidbusk. From here, it forms an S-shape southward, connecting to the Kerch region of the Crimean Peninsula. The main battlefields in between are west of Navel, around Vidbusk, west of Richitz (the above being the central battle line), near Sarnui in former Poland, east of Lovono, the upper reaches of the Southern Bug River south of Belchiziv, southwest of Kirovgrad, the Krivoy Rog region, and the Kerch region. Among these, the line from southeastern former Poland to southwest of Kirovgrad, a distance of approximately six hundred kilometers, is the most fiercely contested area. In mid-November of last year, taking advantage of the momentum of recapturing Kyiv, the First Ukrainian Front army, led by General Fatuzhin, continued westward, reaching the two cities of Zhitomir and Korosten. However, the German forces under the command of Field Marshal Manstein launched a pincer attack from the north and south on this extended wedge, causing it to retreat. Nevertheless, the Fatuzhin army, having formed a powerful unit with complete winter equipment, launched a large-scale counteroffensive on December 24th, following the previous westward route. This large army group, consisting of zero infantry and cavalry corps, zero tank divisions, and zero artillery divisions, under air cover, further expanded its offensive, with its right wing towards Sarnui, the center towards Lovono, and the left wing attacking south of Zhitomir.

In response, the German forces, based on the tactic of shortening the battle line since last summer, avoided unnecessary troop losses while directly attacking the flanks of the Red Army, continuing to inflict material and human damage. Therefore, they withdrew again from the recaptured cities of Zhitomir and Korosten, allowing the Red Army to enter and exit the territory of former Poland. Only a small number of troops stubbornly defended key locations to cope with the attacking Red Army units.

### The Ukrainian Front

Meanwhile, in the Kirovograd region, the Red Army's Second Ukrainian Front army (commander General Koniev) began operations on January 5th, posing a direct threat to the southwest of the city. As a result, the Ukrainian front became serious. Namely, the Fatuzhin army used its right wing to penetrate the gaps in the German forces, approaching the Polish border, while also ordering its main force to capture Vinnitsa from Zhitomir and Berdichev, heading towards Bessarabia to link up with the southward-moving Koniev army, planning to encircle the German forces within the large bend of the Dnieper River. Currently, they are engaged in fierce battles with the German forces who are ambushing them in the upper reaches of the Southern Bug. As for the Red Army's Third Ukrainian Front army (commander General Malinovsky) in the Krivoy Rog region, which is temporarily in a stalemate, and the Fourth Ukrainian Front army (commander General Hoth), stationed from the Kherson region to the mouth of the Dnieper River, it is reported that they are currently gathering forces, so the flames of war will soon reignite. In addition, the Soviet Union is also coveting the iron ore region of Krivoy Rog and the manganese ore region of Nikopol.

### The Baltic Army

Outside the Ukrainian front, the Red Army, since mid-December of last year, launched a counteroffensive with the newly formed Baltic Army in the western Navel and Vidbusk regions, but was blocked by the German forces and temporarily came to a halt. This Red Army unit, judging from its name "Baltic," shows its intention to advance along the Baltic countries. Also, in the Kerch region of the Crimean Peninsula, the Red Army under Timoshenko is also waiting for an opportunity to counterattack, but the German army, on high alert, does not allow it to cross the line.

Thus, the goal of the Red Army's third winter counteroffensive can be seen as utilizing the changes in the Mediterranean and Western European situations to cut off the German forces in the north and south, recover Ukraine, and break into the Baltic region. But can this action encircle the 〇〇 million German troops from the Dnieper River to the Dniester River in this vast southwestern Ukrainian region?

### German Forces Secure Strongholds

In this regard, the German forces are securing six railway lines in the rear and maintaining strongholds on the front lines, as well as in the eastern part of former Poland. Especially in the north, southwest of Leningrad, there are solid fortifications. Although the German authorities will continue to shorten the battle line, there are solid fortifications on the German-Soviet dividing line within former Poland. The result of shortening the supply lines has lengthened the Red Army's supply lines. In addition, after March, due to the melting of ice and snow, the humid western Ukraine will turn into a sea of mud. The counterattacking Red Army is well aware of these points, and is therefore determined to exert all its strength during the winter to expand its gains. The commander of the German Central Army is the famous Field Marshal Kluge. Field Marshal Manstein, commander of the Southern Army, is the general who conquered Sevastopol the year before. The true strength of the other German units has not yet been revealed, and there is great expectation as to when and where they will show their power. General Fatuzhin of the opposing Red Army is also a veteran of many battles and an authority on tank warfare. His troops all have a strong will to fight, and the Soviet Union still has ample reserves of strength.

### Berlin Again Suffers a Terrifying Air Raid: The Fifth Time This Month

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports: A large formation of British bombers launched the fifth terrifying air raid of the month on this city at dawn today.

### Launching a General Offensive Aimed at Rome: Anti-Axis Forces Continue to Reinforce

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Havas News Agency, dispatches from the front lines state: In the past twenty-four hours, there has been little change on the southern Italian front. German forces launched a counteroffensive north of Cassino, which was very successful. Enemy forces continue to land fresh troops at the Anzio beachhead. A large-scale war is unavoidable soon. The outcome of this battle will determine whether the enemy's landing is successful. The German High Command is deploying its forces in preparation for the coming battle.

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: Due to the landing of powerful anti-Axis forces at Anzio, a new front has been established in Italy. Anti-Axis commander Alexander is using the largest convoy of transport ships in the Mediterranean to reinforce the area, and it is expected that they will be fully assembled soon. The Anti-Axis forces' operational intentions are to first cut off the connection between Rome and the Garigliano River front before directly attacking Rome, or to attack the Alban Hills, about ten kilometers southeast of Rome, north of the Anzio beachhead. It is expected that a large-scale fierce battle will unfold around these hills in the next few days. After the end of the battle, the Anti-Axis countries will know what significant sacrifices must be made to carry out landing operations in areas controlled by the German army. In order to coordinate the general offensive launched in the Anzio area, the enemy seems to be planning to launch offensives in the Cassino and Garigliano areas south and along the Adriatic Sea coast, but this is only to contain the German forces in front of Anzio.

### Anglo-American Attention to the Soviet-Polish Dispute

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the border dispute between the Soviet Union and Poland, the Soviet government has consistently insisted on resolving it independently, refusing the intervention of the United Kingdom and the United States. As a result, relations between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States have returned to the state before the Tehran Conference. According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, the Soviet Union has again demanded the reorganization of the Polish government-in-exile and the dismissal of cabinet members who filed a lawsuit regarding the Katyn Forest massacre. The United Kingdom and the United States are most concerned about the method of resolving the dispute.

### Preparations for the Exchange of Residence Permits in Districts 1 and 8: To Begin on February 1st

(Central News Agency) Regarding the issue of recalling the Citizen Certificates and Identity Residence Permits of citizens in Districts 1 and 8 and exchanging them for Residence Permits, according to information obtained by reporters from relevant authorities, it has been largely decided that the procedures will likely begin on February 1st. This is one of the main planned initiatives of the Municipal Government after taking over the two concessions. In the future, the identity certificates of all residents in the city can be unified, and those who harbor evil intentions will have no place to hide. The city's public security can also be effectively maintained. As for the specific methods of exchanging permits, the details will be officially announced by the Municipal Government. It has also been learned from another source that the heads of various Baojia have received official orders to instruct citizens to prepare so as to avoid being rushed at the last minute. Furthermore, citizens must personally complete these procedures on the specified date to prevent fraudulent substitution.

### Citywide Implementation of Rationing Oil by Population in Early Next Month: Oil to be Distributed Once a Month with Oil Purchase Certificates

(Central News Agency) The threat to the city's cooking oil supply has not been eliminated, and it has become particularly severe since the suspension of the household oil ration. The needs of citizens are urgent, and black market prices are active. After thorough discussions among the Municipal Food Bureau, the responsible authorities of Districts 1 and 8, and the Oil and Food Committee, it has been decided to adopt a system of rationing oil by population. It is expected that this will be universally implemented throughout the city in early next month. The details are recorded below:

Curbing Price Hikes

Cooking oil is one of the main staple foods of citizens. Although the authorities have worked hard to maintain it in the past, public demand is high. The serious panic over cooking oil has not been resolved, and the allocation of household oil has been suspended. Citizens rely on the black market for cooking oil. Around the Spring Festival, black market oil prices have fluctuated repeatedly, directly and indirectly threatening people's livelihoods. In order to curb price hikes and reduce the black market, the Municipal Food Bureau, the responsible authorities of Districts 1 and 8, and the Oil and Food Committee have repeatedly discussed and decided to implement a system of rationing oil by population throughout the city.

Four Ounces per Person

Regarding the implementation of the citywide system of rationing oil by population, oil coupons will be issued, similar to the allocation of grain and sugar. Each person will receive one coupon, and citizens can purchase oil with this coupon. It is tentatively scheduled to be done once a month. The amount of oil allocated per person, regardless of age, is four ounces. If practically possible, efforts will be made to increase the allocation to half a catty per person. The designated retail stores for oil allocation will be the oil shops owned by the Oil and Food Committee.

Universal Implementation

The issuance of oil coupons for rationing oil by population will be the responsibility of the responsible authorities in Districts 1 and 8. The Municipal Food Bureau will supervise the various districts within the blockade line. Various procedures are actively underway. The Director of the Municipal Food Bureau, Ji Hua, has instructed the head of the bureau, Yang Wen, to make preparations quickly. After receiving the order, Yang is maintaining close contact with all relevant parties and it is expected that the implementation can be seen in early next month. At that time, the serious threat to cooking oil in the city can be universally resolved.

The bravery of the soldiers at the front, the increased production of personnel in the rear, and the struggle of various sectors of East Asian countries in the war are all vividly displayed, deeply inspiring the audience and strengthening the belief that we will achieve the final victory in the Greater East Asia War. The exhibition is scheduled to close this afternoon (30th). This morning is the last chance in Shanghai. Members of all provinces are advised not to miss this opportunity. After the closing, all the photographs will be sent to Suzhou for exhibition. After the Suzhou exhibition, they will be transported to Xuzhou for exhibition.

### China Shipping Vice President Mr. Yamamoto Passes Away

(Central News Agency) Mr. Takeo Yamamoto, Vice President of China Shipping Company, suddenly died of a heart attack at 8 p.m. on the 28th of this month. Mr. Yamamoto was born in Asahikawa, Japan in the 19th year of Meiji. He was a classmate of Mr. Shigekichi Watanabe, former Vice President of China Shipping Company, and studied at the Hall of Japanese Commerce. He graduated in the 43rd year of Meiji with excellent grades. In the 2nd year of Taisho, he joined Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line). At the age of 37, he was appointed as the head of the Dalian branch and served as the head of branches in San Francisco and Hong Kong, actively participating in the global shipping industry. In the 8th year of Showa, he became the head of the Shanghai branch. During this period, he also served as a member of the former Shanghai Municipal Council. In the 13th year of Showa, he became the head of the Osaka branch. After only one year, he was appointed as the Director of Toa Kaiun Kisen (East Asia Shipping) due to the needs of the times. He made significant contributions to the expansion of wartime transportation. On November 28th of the 31st year of Showa, he succeeded Mr. Shigekichi Watanabe as the Deputy Chairman of China Shipping Company. During the fourteen months of assisting Chairman Su in handling company affairs, he saw even greater improvements. Unfortunately, his death is a loss to the Sino-Japanese shipping industry.

### Ancient and Modern Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition: Jointly Organized by the Continental News and this Newspaper

Painting and calligraphy are a kind of cultural art, which has a long history and a high status in our Eastern countries. The Continental News and Shen Bao are jointly organizing the "Ancient and Modern Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition" to introduce Chinese painting and calligraphy art and promote our inherent culture. It will be held from February 2nd to 6th at the China Painting Academy on Jing'an Temple Road. Approximately 300 pieces of famous paintings and calligraphy from the Ming and Qing dynasties and modern times will be collected and displayed in categories. There will also be special rooms for the paintings and calligraphy of Lord Shen Zipei (Zengzhi), as well as special rooms for the paintings and calligraphy of Wu Changshuo and Wang Yiting. Lord Shen Zipei was a great Confucian scholar in the late Qing Dynasty with vast knowledge and a unique calligraphy style. It is especially rare to have all of his works. After various searches, they have been made into a special room. Wu Changshuo and Wang Yiting are famous modern artists. With the support of their descendants, Wu Dongshu and Wang Jimei, all of their collected posthumous works will be specially displayed. These are all rare. Two-thirds of the exhibited paintings and calligraphy are not for sale. Only one-third will be sold by consignors. Preparations are actively underway. The exhibition will open on February 2nd. All are welcome to visit from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. daily.

### Rickshaws Unauthorized to Increase Prices: Police Bureau to Strictly Crack Down

(Central News Agency) Regarding the recent increase in prices for rickshaws in this city, a reporter recently interviewed a senior official in charge of traffic affairs at the First Police Bureau. According to the official, the sudden increase in rickshaw prices has not been approved by the municipal authorities and is therefore illegal. Strict crackdown and punishment should be given. The chairman of the rickshaw trade association, Fu Xiangxun, has been summoned to the bureau and informed that he should immediately inform all rickshaw companies that they must not increase prices without the approval of the municipal authorities. Otherwise, they will be severely punished. Regarding rickshaw pullers extorting tips for alcohol and soliciting business along the way, the police authorities believe that simple fines are not effective in curbing these behaviors. Stricter measures will be taken. For the first offense, the driver's license of the rickshaw puller will be revoked. For repeated offenses, the vehicle license will be revoked. These measures will be implemented as soon as they are submitted for approval. It is hoped that citizens will cooperate with the authorities to ensure a thorough solution.

### Commentary: Agricultural Production Increase Conference

At the very beginning of this year, with the theme of "The Plan for the Year Lies in Spring," we advocated that in this year of increased production, the first effort should be focused on increasing food production and maintaining the agricultural labor force. This is because, in China, increasing agricultural production is indeed a prerequisite for increasing industrial production. Given that our country can currently only talk about the development of light industry, and within light industry, raw materials for things like the weaving of yarn and cloth, and the manufacturing of flour, are all dependent on agricultural production. This is obvious without needing a wise person to point it out. Therefore, the Ministries of Food, Industry, and Construction have scheduled an agricultural production increase conference to be held in Beijing on February 9th. The goal is to promote increased agricultural production and to ensure that the various provincial and municipal authorities understand the central government's overall production increase plan and its implementation methods. Undoubtedly, this conference will make a significant contribution to this year of increased production.

Regarding the technical issues of agricultural production increase, and even the rural revitalization issues that are indirectly related to agricultural production increase, we are not prepared to put them on the discussion list now. What we expect from the agricultural conference is only one thing: no matter what methods are used to increase production, we must have a minimum target for this year's production increase campaign. This minimum target is to ensure the domestic food supply, just like the food supply situation for Japan and Manchuria this year. According to the report given by the Director of the Japanese Food Administration to the House of Representatives Deficit Public Bond Committee in Tokyo the other day, in Showa 19 (Republic of China Year 33), Japan and Manchuria will definitely not rely on foreign rice. In addition to rice and wheat, they also plan to make potatoes and miscellaneous grains major food sources. We only hope that the agricultural production increase conference can take this as a lesson, because this is the only prerequisite for stabilizing people's livelihoods during wartime.

Moving Out Report Procedures: Those moving out should send the household registration certificate issued by the former West Shanghai Police Bureau to the Baojia Section of the police substation in charge, and obtain a "Household Registration Movement Report Form." Fill it out according to the instructions, and have it certified by the Jia head, Bao head, and Lianbao head (when the Lianbao head certifies, each person registering should be on the register). Then, send it to the Baojia Section, and submit the previously issued residence permit, as well as a fee of five yuan. The Baojia Section will then cancel the registration in the record book, and issue a receipt, as well as the Household Registration Movement Certificate, which is the lower part of the Household Registration Movement Application Form. This certificate is used to move, and to report the move to the new district. (Note 1) The procedures for moving elsewhere are the same as those for moving out, but only the household registration of those moving elsewhere needs to be canceled on the household registration certificate, and the household registration certificate does not need to be submitted. Lost Citizen Certificate Report Procedures: Those reporting should have the Jia head, Bao head, and Lianbao head provide a letter of certification, and apply to the Baojia Section for re-issuance, and pay a handling fee of ten yuan.

### Post-Spring Festival Stock Market Opens High, but Soon Weakens; Large Number of New Stocks Listed

Yesterday, the Chinese stock exchange resumed trading as usual after the Spring Festival holiday. It was a Saturday, so trading was only open for half a day in the morning. Hopes for a bull market were seen, but turned into disappointment. A selling trend prevailed, and stocks in various sectors declined. The main reason is that credit has not eased, and lending by banks and money shops is still under serious consideration. In addition, sixteen new stocks have been approved for listing, which is diluting purchasing power. Some investors are also selling old stocks to raise cash. Confidence in the market is faltering. Among textile stocks, Wing On Textile Factory saw the largest drop compared to the pre-holiday price (January 20th), falling 17.5 yuan. China Textile, Sin Hwa, and Rong Feng each fell 6 to 8 yuan. Yuen Yuen and Chen Fung each rose by 1 yuan. In addition, new stocks such as Chen Tan Silk Weaving, Fook Cheong Dyeing and Weaving, and Foo Min Weaving were listed and began trading. In the department store sector, Wing On and two other companies each fell 5 to 7.5 yuan, but Kwong Hwa Department Store rose. Shanghai Department Store rose to 24 yuan. In the culture sector, Chung Hwa Bookstore and China Film both saw declines. Pu Fung Paper, ex-dividend, opened at a high price of 16.5 yuan, but was difficult to buy. Among new pharmaceutical stocks, French Pharmacy entered the 70 yuan range. In the chemical sector, five new stocks were traded: Calcium Milk Powder, China Timber Dryer, New Asia Hygiene, Tak Sing Chemical, and Zhen Chung Chemical. Great China Match dropped slightly by 30 yuan. In the public utility sector, North Water and China Electric were flat. Kung Sing Electric rose by 1.5 yuan. In the real estate sector, Hing Yan and Heng Hing opened, each rising by more than 3 yuan from face value. Wing Hing and Lien Hwa were all slightly lower. Other stocks such as Hong Yuan Confectionery retreated. Sun Lok and Tai Sun Wah Industries rose slightly. Kiu On entered the 40 yuan range. Sing Tai Enterprise debuted and rose to 14.5 yuan on buying. The closing prices at noon are listed below: Stock Name Noon Close Wing On Textile Factory 215.00 Ta Tung Silk Factory 59.50 China Textile Factory 88.00 Sin Hwa Textile Factory 92.00 Rong Feng Textile 84.00 Yuen Yuen Printing and Dyeing 39.00 Lun Wah Dyeing and Weaving 66.50 Tung Chai Printing and Dyeing 27.75 Chen Hing Cotton Weaving 48.00 King Lun Shirt and Socks 27.50 King Fook Shirt and Socks 38.00 China Silk Industry 472.50 Mei Ya Silk Fabrics 193.00 Chen Tan Silk Weaving 55.00 Wing On Company 232.50 Kwong Hwa Department Store 27.25 New Shanghai Company 152.00 New Hwa Company 26.00 National Goods Company 1154.00 Chung Hwa Film 82.00 Chung Hwa Bookstore 610.00 World Bookstore 139.00 Chun Fung Paper 16.00 French Pharmacy 68.00 New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory 34.25 Great China Matches 730.00 Calcium Milk Powder 15.25 New Asia Hygiene 20.00 Nanyang Tobacco 740.00 Hong Yuan Confectionery 101.00 Kung Sing Electric 20.00 Wing Hing Real Estate 36.25 Tin Fung Real Estate 20.00 Lien Hwa Real Estate 33.25 Sun Lok Industry 24.50 Kiu On Industry 38.50 Lee Asia Industry 56.00 Great China Industry 20.25 New Asia Construction 26.75 New Chung Industry 25.00 Kam Hing Chen Industry 17.50 In other news, Shanghai Department Store, with capital of 30 million yuan and assets estimated to be several times higher, listed its shares yesterday at 10 yuan per share.

### Weekly Commentary (Continued from Page 1)

Furthermore, the CCP is very clear that as long as Chongqing continues to resist Japan, it will not launch a large-scale military campaign to suppress the communists. Therefore, before Chongqing reaches the final moment, the CCP will try to expand its territory as much as possible to prepare for any eventuality. In terms of military preparations, the CCP's current power, in addition to Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, is also widespread in Hebei, Shandong, Jehol, Shanxi, Chahar, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Guangdong and other twelve provinces, where detachments of the CCP army are stationed. For example, the "Third and Fifth Detachment" of Zhejiang Province originally consisted of only 80 CCP cadres, who traveled from Shanghai, via Pudong, to the Yuyao area. They engaged in organizing the masses, and now have a military force of as many as 150,000. In terms of ideological preparations, Mao Zedong recently published "Two -isms" to counter Chiang Kai-shek's "China's Destiny," and demanded that CCP members pay attention to the open struggles that will occur in the near future.

In short, whether there is cooperation or friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, there are certain limits. The friction has not yet reached open military suppression, and the cooperation has not yet exceeded the scope of peaceful coexistence. This status quo of KMT-CCP relations will continue until the final moment.

In this internal and external situation, no matter how intensified and deteriorated the KMT-CCP relations are, there is no basis for Chiang Kai-shek to risk flying to Yan'an. Chiang Kai-shek's visit to Yan'an is simply equivalent to the Kuomintang surrendering to the Communist Party. The real figures who guide the Kuomintang internally are the so-called "anti-communist trinity" that represents the national bourgeoisie and landlords. Chiang Kai-shek will never risk opposing their opinions and causing a split within the Kuomintang.

Therefore, what we must pay the most attention to is why these kinds of rumors arise? Under the current situation, the strengthening of anti-communist forces in Chongqing is naturally a major factor that promotes Chongqing's approach to Japan. If Chongqing starts a military campaign to suppress the communists, it would prove that a compromise has already been reached between Chongqing and Japan. However, under the current situation, if there is no compromise between Britain and the United States and Chongqing, then a compromise between Japan and Chongqing is also impossible. Therefore, the beginning of military action against the communists is also the beginning of a compromise between Britain and the United States and Chongqing with Japan. What kind of meaning this compromise has for the Soviet Union, which is currently repeatedly striking Germany, is of course unnecessary to explain! Conversely, the improvement of KMT-CCP relations would prove the strengthening of Chongqing's anti-Japanese resistance forces, and the Soviet Union could then safely engage in the anti-German war. Britain and the United States, in particular, believe that they must give the Soviet Union such a calming agent now. In other words, the Soviet Union is indeed suffering from nervous sensitivity about the recent rumors of a British-American-German compromise. Naturally, the Soviet Union itself has its own difficulties that make it unable to avoid suffering from nervous sensitivity. Originally, Britain and the United States had agreed to open the second front at the end of last year, but it has not yet been launched today. And the British and American troops have been slow to advance on the Italian front. In the final analysis, this winter offensive is still being supported solely by the Soviet Union against the powerful German counterattack. The Soviet Union had just advanced to the Polish border, and Britain and the United States immediately wanted to guarantee the pre-war status of Polish territory. William Averell Harriman loudly and cautiously proclaimed to the British and American upper classes: "The Soviet Union's westward advance is a crisis for Britain and the United States." Moreover, the Soviet Union's supply lines are too long, and the offensive is becoming more and more difficult. If Chongqing takes this opportunity to launch a war against the Chinese Communist Party, the Soviet Union would have to immediately turn its attention back to the Far Eastern frontier. And Chongqing's attack on the Chinese Communist Party, as mentioned earlier, implies a compromise between Japan, Britain, and the United States, and it also implies a compromise between Britain, the United States, and Germany. The Soviet Union would naturally also think that this is proof that the world war is turning into a class war. The Soviet Union, which constantly expands its power by taking advantage of the contradictions between capitalist countries, believes that the most terrifying thing is the anti-Soviet united front of capitalist countries. The Soviet Union also knows that this world war will one day reach this anti-Soviet stage. The Soviet Union's hope is only to delay such a day as much as possible, to incite capitalist countries to fight each other as much as possible during this period to weaken their strength, while preserving its own vitality and national strength for the final struggle. Britain and the United States also know that the Soviet Union is building its strength for the final moment, so they are trying their best to let the Soviet Union fight to the death with Germany alone in order to weaken its strength. To achieve this goal, Britain and the United States are trying their best to reduce the Soviet Union's worries about its rear, and allow it to safely engage in a life-and-death battle with Germany. The rumors of renewed KMT-CCP cooperation arise from this hope of the Allied countries. However, the essence of KMT-CCP relations, despite these rumors, is only a conditional truce between belligerents before the final rupture. (Translated by Da Lu)

### Navy Military Class (4)

—Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang

That year also passed as usual, and soon the third semester was published. The body of Makoto, who had been weakened by typhoid fever, had completely recovered to its original state, and so he devoted all his energy to his studies. Therefore, his grades were also remarkable, and he went one step further.

17-year-old fourth-year students – he and his classmates all became nervous. Those with good grades could go to higher-level schools after four years of graduation. Everyone was talking about their future problems. When Makoto expressed his desire for the Navy, the number of classmates who hoped to enter the Army and Navy schools was truly surprisingly large. It is said that this is a phenomenon unprecedented in the history of the Second Middle School.

Makoto was in the fifth group of the fourth grade. The class teacher was Mr. Ogata. At the beginning of the new school year, Mr. Ogata said very satisfied, "The number of people who aspire to military schools is so large, it is really a good phenomenon. I have also discussed it with the principal, so let's name this class the "Military Class." It is meaningless to just call it the Military Class. We must overcome difficulties and achieve the highest enrollment rate in the county. Otherwise, I definitely hope that you can achieve the highest enrollment rate in Kyushu. Soon, we will become the number one middle school in Japan – to be honest, the responsibility for whether the Second Middle School can become the number one middle school in Japan rests entirely on your shoulders!"

Mr. Ogata's enthusiasm was too intense, so his later words were mixed with a lot of dialect.

Under such circumstances, the Military Class, which will be immortalized in the history of the Second Middle School, was finally established. Makoto, Takao, Komori, Bandai, and all participated in it, needless to say. However, most people aspired to the Army. Together with other classes, there were a total of 41 people. Mathematics, English, physics, and chemistry all had teachers in charge, and fierce preparation education and strict training were carried out in the classroom or at the teachers' homes. "Decide and act, and even ghosts and gods will avoid you – you must have this kind of determination for the entrance exam!" At that time, Major Kikuchi, who had already retired, also came to encourage them in this way.

The teachers who taught were very enthusiastic, and the students who learned were also very enthusiastic. In the hearts of every student, it was deeply engraved that their winning the crown of admission was also promoting the reputation of their alma mater. Such enthusiastic preparation for the entrance exam is probably rare in the whole country.

From that time on, Makoto and his classmates in the Military Class often visited Mr. Ogata's home. English was his best subject. But he asked the teacher very impolitely about any questions he had, and the teacher had to explain the difficult idioms to him very clearly.

Since Makoto entered Mr. Ogata's home, he was moved by the unpretentious, jewel-like personality of the teacher. His gentle, noble samurai family style couldn't help but make people feel awe. There was a warm and peaceful home with an elderly mother, a wife, and six children. Makoto, who liked children the most, became good friends with the teacher's 13-year-old eldest son and the fourth son, who was just two years old this year.

The teacher seemed to like drinking very much. However, he would definitely take Makoto and the others to Seika-do for refreshments once a month. At this time, Makoto truly felt the meaning of the Western "mentor" for Mr. Ogata. (3)(7)(4)
