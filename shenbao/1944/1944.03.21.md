### Simultaneously Forbidding Foreign-Style Gambling

During the press conference held by the City Propaganda Department on the 18th, the City Government Secretariat, in response to questions about the banning of gambling dens in the city by the end of March, stated: "Rumors of postponing the ban are all untrue. The government has already ordered all gambling dens to close by March 29th, and there will be no postponement." The severity of the harm caused by gambling is self-evident and known to all. The city government's determination to ban gambling is, of course, a commendable act of good governance.

The harm of gambling lies in its ability to lure and deceive people, erode their will, and lead to financial ruin. While the methods of gambling may vary, their ability to cause harm remains consistent. Therefore, since gambling has been banned, all forms of gambling with harmful characteristics must be completely prohibited. There should be absolutely no distinction made based on the method, creating loopholes. To say that gambling with the same harmful characteristics can be banned on one hand and allowed to exist on the other simply because the method differs is absolutely unfair and incomplete. If Chinese-style gambling is banned because it is harmful, while foreign-style gambling is allowed to exist because it is not, this is a self-contradictory and absurd phenomenon. For example, the "shaking stall" pai gow in the Nanshi gambling dens is a Chinese-style form of gambling and should be banned. However, the jai alai, dog racing, and horse racing in the first district are foreign-style gambling and need not be prohibited. Regardless of any excuses, this is ultimately unreasonable and will not gain the trust of the people. We support the city government's ban on the Nanshi gambling dens, and we further support the city government's complete ban on all gambling dens with gambling characteristics, regardless of the district or method, to prevent them from moving elsewhere and harming the citizens again.

Some might say that the existence of foreign-style gambling dens can subsidize municipal finances; otherwise, finances would be affected. But we must ask:

How much does the city government receive each month?

How much do the shareholders of the gambling dens receive each month? Is their personal income greater than that of the city government? Is the subsidization of government finances being used as an excuse to conceal and fulfill personal desires?

How many citizens are lured into depravity and financial ruin each day and each month because of the existence of gambling? When weighing the income from subsidizing municipal finances against the loss from luring citizens into depravity and financial ruin, is it appropriate and justifiable in the overall relationship between the city government and the citizens? What is more important? What are the advantages and disadvantages?

Our ally Japan recently decided to cease high-end entertainment. During this decisive battle phase and at this critical juncture, our ally, in order to implement the spirit of the decisive battle, resolutely closed even legitimate entertainment venues. And we, as a participating country and a participating city, should there be any need for the existence of these gambling venues?

From any perspective, foreign-style gambling should absolutely be banned simultaneously with Chinese-style gambling. Furthermore, the city government's finances should focus on streamlining various tax revenues and legitimate sources of income, rather than on gambling with harmful effects on the public and illegitimate methods.

As for the gambling den workers, although they will be affected by the ban on gambling, the government or social organizations should be responsible for guiding them towards productive work. In addition, after the Nanshi gambling dens are closed, the buildings, which are quite spacious, can be transferred to schools for use, which would naturally have a more positive meaning.

Finally, it is hoped that the Ministry of Social Welfare will design more meaningful and simple entertainment methods that are accessible to the masses, affordable, and adapted to the environment. In this important year of the decisive battle, in Shanghai, a crucial rear base, entertainment should be absolutely simple and economical, in line with the principle of being accessible to the masses.

District inspectors will conduct inspections, guide farmers in improving agricultural tools, and compile reports.

### A Glimpse of the Command Structure of Various Nations

In order to concentrate the overall national strength to complete the war, by integrating both material and spiritual aspects, the close coordination between command and state affairs is absolutely necessary. As the world's war situation intensifies day by day, the major belligerent countries are moving further into this stage. The unification of the two has become a general trend. Therefore, the "pure operation" of independent nature formerly adopted by various countries no longer exists. The administrative measures of modern war's total war must correspond to operations, and operations must be materially and spiritually consistent, so that the national strength moves quickly. The greatest task to establish and prepare for is responding to this need, starting with our ally Germany, to the Soviet Union, and our enemy countries, like England and the US have also followed suit. Regarding the existing military and national affairs organizations, unification of national affairs, the establishment of new institutions, or the appointment of heads of state and prime ministers and presidents as supreme commanders, to coordinate the command, military affairs, and national affairs into a unified war guidance system. The traditional military and command organs are under these to take on their respective military duties. The command structures of the various countries are described below:

Japan

The Japanese and American armies, fiercely fighting in the raging Pacific, have entered the final decisive stage. As the war becomes increasingly important, in order to further tighten the coordination between command and political affairs and to develop the highest total strength of the overall military, the concurrent appointments of General Tojo of the Army as Chief of the General Staff and Admiral Shimada of the Navy as Chief of the Naval General Staff were indeed epoch-making. The close integration of political and military strategies is the greatest essential of advancing war studies, needless to say. From this, in order to adapt to the harsh situation and to have a complete and unimpeded powerful formation, there is an extremely large contribution to operational guidance and morale, and it can be said that the Japanese land and naval forces have established a bedrock system. The history of the naval command is recorded below:

General Staff Headquarters

The General Staff Headquarters was not originally an independent organization. It was first established within the Ministry of the Army in March of the sixth year of Meiji and was called the Sixth Bureau. In February of the seventh year, the Sixth Bureau was abolished and renamed the Staff Bureau. The director of the bureau was concurrently held by Lieutenant General Yamagata Aritomo of the Army. The second director of the bureau was Tori O Koetai. In December of the 11th year of Meiji, it became independent as the General Staff Headquarters. The first chief of the General Staff Headquarters was Yamagata. The second was Lieutenant General Oyama of the Army, followed by Lieutenant General Oyama concurrently serving. Then Prince Arisugawa Taruhito became appointed. On May 14th of the 21st year of Meiji, the regulations of the General Staff Headquarters were revised, and the Army General Staff Headquarters and Navy General Staff Headquarters were established within the department. The former chief of staff was renamed Military Officer, and Lieutenant General Ozawa Takeo was appointed as Military Officer. On March 9th of the 22nd year of Meiji, the General Staff Headquarters was changed to the Army's military command organ, the same as the current system, that is, separated from the Naval Staff Headquarters, and was thus called the Chief of the General Staff. The first Chief of the General Staff was Prince Taruhito, followed by Lieutenant General Kawakami Soroku, Marshal Oyama, Marshal Yamagata, General Kodama Gentaro, Marshal Okubo Yasukata, Marshal Hasegawa Yoshimichi, Marshal Uehara Yusaku, Kawai Osamu, Suzuki Soichi, and General Hata Hanzaku in that order were appointed Chief of the General Staff. When the Manchurian Incident occurred in December of the 6th year of Showa, Prince Kan'in Kotohito was appointed Chief of the General Staff. In October of the 15th year of Showa, General Sugiyama was appointed, until today. The Chiefs of Staff were full-time.

Naval Command

The Naval Command was initially independent when the regulations of the General Staff Headquarters were revised in March of the 19th year of Meiji. In May of the 21st year, the regulations of the General Staff Headquarters were revoked and changed to a military officer system. However, the fundamental policy of the Naval Command to separate and be independent from other military affairs organs did not change in the slightest. Under the military officer, there were the Chief of the Army General Staff Headquarters and the Chief of the Navy General Staff Headquarters, who assisted the military officer and managed the affairs of the army and navy. By the major revision in March of the 23rd year, the army and navy were distinctly separated, divided into the General Staff Headquarters and the Naval Staff Headquarters. At the same time, once an independent military command organ was again under the jurisdiction of the Minister of the Navy. The naval military command organ, from the dual organization of military command and military administration, returned to a unified organization. Thus, the Minister of the Navy was on the same level as the Minister of the Army in terms of military administration, and in terms of military command, he was on the same level as the Chief of the General Staff. Later, because the naval forces had increased dramatically, and it was believed that the military command structure needed to be independent, the Naval Command Ordinance was enacted on May 19th of the 26th year, and the Naval Staff Headquarters was changed to the Naval Command and became independent, not belonging to the Minister of the Navy, becoming an independent military command organ. Then the Naval Command Ordinance was revised several times, but the outline of its organization remained largely unchanged. Until September 27th of the 8th year of Showa, the Naval Command Ordinance was revoked, and the current "Military Command Ordinance" was enacted, that is, the Naval Command was changed to the Military Command, and the Chief of the Naval Command was changed to the Chief of the Military Command, and the Naval Command mechanism was established in name and in fact. The first Chief of the Military Command was Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu, the second was Admiral Nagano Osami in the 16th year. Looking back at the Chiefs of the Naval Command and the Chiefs of the Military Command as follows: Vice Admiral Handa Kuranosuke, Admiral Hatayama Sukeki, Marshal Ito Sukeyuki, Marshal Togo Heihachiro, Marshal Ijuin Goro, Marshal Shimamura Hayao, Admiral Yamashita Gentaro, Admiral Suzuki Kantaro, Admiral Kasa Kanji, Admiral Taniguchi Naosumi, Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu, Admiral Nagano Osami. Now that the war has entered the decisive stage, the high density of military command and military administration is extremely important. Therefore, Admiral Shimada concurrently serves as the Chief of the Military Command. However, the General Staff Headquarters or the Military Command are both parallel with the Ministry of the Army or the Ministry of the Navy. Structurally, military administration and military command stand independently side by side, and the upper level seeks to tighten military command and military administration. We will exert the unified strength of highly political and strategic integration.

Germany

On February 4, 1938, the German government issued the "Presidential Decree on the Command of the National Defense Forces," to purify the command system of the National Defense Forces. According to this decree, the overall command of the army, navy, and air force was held solely by the Fuehrer Hitler. The National Defense Bureau, which had previously been an auxiliary organ of the National Defense Forces High Command, was promoted to the National Defense Forces High Command. The supreme commander of the National Defense Forces became the Fuehrer Hitler's subordinate, all other intermediate organs were abolished, and the leader directly appointed the commanders of the army, navy, and air force. This reform of the National Defense Forces command system not only promoted the unification of the command power but also made the structure of the party and the state, whose contacts had previously been less smooth, closer together, to ensure the perfect mobilization of forces. This naturally had great political significance. According to this reform, the Fuehrer Hitler, concurrently served as the party leader, the Prime Minister, and the supreme commander of the National Defense Forces, gathering the orders of the party, the state, and the military into one. Since the end of 1941, he has also served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Army. Under him, Marshal Keitel serves as the General Inspector of the National Defense Forces and Chief of the Staff of the Supreme Command, assisting the Supreme Commander. The Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force is Marshal Goering, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy is Grand Admiral Doenitz, each responsible for military affairs. (To be continued) (Hong.

### Three Matters of Principle for Capital Increase of Insurance Companies; Supervisory Bureau Effectively Prevents the Occurrence of Malpractices

The Insurance Supervisory Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, regarding the case of insurance companies increasing capital within a specified period, had previously issued a circular to all companies to comply with it. Now, in order to prevent the occurrence of malpractices, the Bureau has specially stipulated three items that should be paid attention to when insurance companies increase capital. In addition to reporting to the various cases, the Bureau yesterday especially inspected and issued the relevant points for attention, ordering the Shanghai Special City Insurance Industry Association to forward them to its member companies for compliance. Points for Attention: The capital increase of each company should be paid entirely in cash. It is strictly forbidden to use the company's assets as shares or to use undistributed profits to offset the stock price. Shares of each company's capital increase should be first offered to the old shareholders. If there is a surplus, then it can be raised elsewhere. The capital increase funds of each company should all be entrusted to the West District Office of the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank for collection. The funds cannot be withdrawn and used until all the funds have been collected and verified by this Bureau.

### Large German Aircraft Formation Heavily Bombs the Port of Hull; American Aircraft Attack Southern Germany Again

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency): The German News Agency reported that a large formation of powerful German bombers flew over the Strait again before 2:00 AM today to launch a major attack on the British mainland. The weather was clear at the time, so the visibility was excellent.

Another dispatch stated that before midnight last night, a large formation of German bombers carried out a concentrated bombing of the port of Hull on the east coast of England. As far as is known, the results can be described as extremely satisfactory. The German aircraft that left the target area last saw many large fires in Hull and the port, especially in the dock area.

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency): The German military authorities announced that American bombers and long-range fighter squadrons attacked southern Germany across the Alps on the 19th. German aircraft immediately took off to intercept them and engaged in fierce air combat, shooting down 20 of their four-engine bombers and many fighter aircraft.

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency): The German Fuehrer's headquarters announced on the 19th that the British and American air forces suffered heavy losses in air raids on the German mainland and German bases in the north during the past 24 hours, losing a total of 93 aircraft, including 13 four-engine aircraft. The enemy air force bombed Munich and Friedrichshafen during the day, and Frankfurt was raided again on the night of the 18th, resulting in damage and casualties.

### New Iranian Cabinet Under Organization

### Situation Tightening in Western Europe; Germany Actively Strengthening Defenses

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency): In the southern Eastern Front, Soviet troops are still advancing along the railway from Lviv to Odessa, and the communication between the two cities has been partially cut off. Judging from the current situation, the Soviet Union has no intention of easing its offensive and seems likely to take advantage of the situation to launch an attack on Romania in one fell swoop. However, the German army will also endure all sacrifices and do its best to stop the Soviet army on this defense line. It is believed that the German army will mobilize a considerable number of reserve troops in this area, and they are currently being mobilized. According to observations by military experts here, when the pressure from the Soviet army in this area increases in the future, Germany, in order to prepare for the Allied forces to launch an offensive in Western Europe, will definitely withdraw a part of its forces to defend Western Europe. This is the opportunity for the Allies to land in Western Europe. The recent bombing of Germany by the British and American air forces has not achieved remarkable results, so the British and Americans may concentrate their main forces in the future to bomb various industrial cities in Germany to thoroughly destroy the German air force before the British and American troops land. The opportunity for the opening of the Second Front now seems imminent. Furthermore, the British and American air forces have repeatedly attempted to bomb Berlin, and they have engaged in large air battles with German fighter aircraft with a large number of long-range fighter aircraft during the day, attempting to deplete the German fighter aircraft. Therefore, when the British and American forces land in Western Europe, the power of the German air force may be slightly reduced. It is now reported that the British and American armies have gathered in Eipul and various coastal areas of southern England. In short, the situation on the western European coast is gradually becoming tense.

### Italy Axis Counter-Offensive Fails; Germany Defends Cassino

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – German military authorities announced that the Allied forces' operations at Nettuno and Anzio bridgehead have lasted for 60 days, resulting in losses of 15,000 personnel and 500,000 tons of ships. The Allied landing operations on the flank of Nettuno began with the landings at Liri and Termoli on September 9th and October 14th of last year. One of their objectives was to quickly break through the Cassino front and encircle the German forces there. Another objective was to capture Rome through a lightning attack, but it ended in failure.

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – The German Supreme Headquarters war report of the 19th stated that Allied forces, with tank support, continued to fiercely attack Cassino. German forces, with the assistance of the Air Force, repelled them after fierce fighting.

### Roosevelt-Churchill Meeting Considered Possible

Stockholm, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters report, Swedish newspapers claim that rumors from Washington indicate that Roosevelt and Churchill will meet again. Although not officially confirmed, it is indeed possible. If Roosevelt and Churchill do meet again, the purpose will not be to discuss the war aims of Britain and America, as Britain is currently apparently disregarding discussions on this matter. British leftists are criticizing the increasing number of those who do not adhere to the Atlantic Charter, and strongly advocate that British foreign policy should be clearly explained. London political figures believe that British leftists lack the traditional experience of the Conservative Party, and do not understand the meaning of power politics. They have forgotten that the various declarations of the Atlantic Charter are only for adapting to the current general war situation. Swedish newspapers also claim that Roosevelt also hopes that the foreign policy of the Allies can be clarified before the next presidential peak. The London Observer believes that agreements initiated by Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles can be expected to be approved when Roosevelt and Churchill meet.

### Romanian Press Harshly Criticizes US Peace Overtures

Bucharest, 10th (Central News Agency) – The "Current Events" newspaper here has resolutely rejected the American call for Romania to accept the Allied peace terms. The newspaper cited a commentary in the New York Times stating that "the time seems ripe for the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to issue a joint statement on the political situation in the Balkans," and criticized it, saying that no one is asking the Allied side for such a statement. If the United States wants to know what Europeans think, it should know that anti-Soviet sentiments overshadow all war issues.

### Current Affairs Musings

—Tokutomi Sohō

I am definitely not trying to create panic, but this war can be said to be unprecedented and unrepeatable. It is a great sacred war that has continued since the founding of the nation by Emperor Jimmu's Eastern Expedition. I believe that comparing Emperor Jimmu's Eastern Expedition with today's Greater East Asia Holy War is most appropriate. Although every war in Japanese history has its own significance, the Eastern Expedition was a war to unify the Japanese archipelago, and the Greater East Asia War is a war to unify the entire Asian continent. The Jimmu Eastern Expedition is the premise, while this Greater East Asia War is the conclusion. From a historical perspective, these two great wars are blood-related and closely connected.

We must understand the reason why the Holy War is a Holy War. We are definitely not fighting to plunder oil. Nor are we fighting to plunder rubber. Nor are we fighting to plunder iron and tin. We are fighting to protect the world, to eliminate the demons that will bring the world to an irrecoverable catastrophe. The so-called demons in the world are of course Britain and America! If you carefully examine their actions, no demon can surpass them. One of their own citizens, Milton, described Satan in his book "Paradise Lost," but compared to today's Churchill and Roosevelt, Satan still has some masculine spirit and the demeanor of a demon leader. However, the heads of today's demons are really not worthy of Milton's pen. Apart from being called old men who are "thieves and bandits," there are no other more appropriate complimentary words to praise them.

If you look at the numbers, the Mongol army that attacked Japan and the number of our Japanese soldiers have a huge difference. But at that time, our Japanese national policy was unified and consistent. Every corner of every remote village was filled with the ambition to conquer mountains and rivers and to kill the enemy and achieve success abroad. Some people even advocated that instead of defending on the Genkai Sea, it would be better to advance and counterattack the mainland. The Great Mongol Empire, which spanned three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa, could not exert its power on Japan because of the strong and vigorous spirit of solidarity against the enemy in Japan. Although they often wanted to conquer Japan, they thought the Japanese were very brave and could not be conquered, so they abandoned their ambition to send troops. Their unfavorable calculation finally told them to give up sending troops to invade. In return, they believed that invading Japan would cost a great price, and whether the gains were certain was still unknown. This was their concept of "not worth the loss." Even later, in the Ming Dynasty, not sending troops to Japan was considered a good plan. This was the practical lesson left to them by the Yuan Dynasty, and they realized that invading Japan was a foolish thing. Therefore, from beginning to end, they dared not harbor any covetous intentions. So, it is said that the best secret to victory is to use solidarity against the enemy to crush the enemy's attempts and make the enemy deeply aware that they cannot win, creating a psychological despair for the enemy. This is the best policy. The most important thing to thoroughly subdue the enemy is patience. People often say that victory lies in the last five minutes, which refers to this. It is like two children standing in a river fighting a water fight. If neither is willing to give up, there will never be a winner. Only when one side cannot bear the discomfort and admits defeat, and the other side can endure, can a winner be determined. Therefore, a major element of victory is patience.

However, food is necessary for patience. If your stomach is empty and you still say you are not hungry, this kind of patience can only be limited to a temporary moment and cannot last. So, at any time, you cannot endure an empty stomach. Although enduring an empty stomach is also a kind of patience, for the sake of greater patience, this kind of patience like enduring an empty stomach should not be necessary. Besides food, there are also military supplies and human resources. Taking the most immediate situation as an example, it is right to manufacture more sophisticated aircraft and train more skilled and brave pilots. Today, our Japanese government authorities are using all their strength to make rapid progress in this regard, which is naturally something that should be done. In any case, the main task at present is, as Confucius said, to have sufficient food and sufficient soldiers. Confucius also said: "When there is sufficient food and sufficient soldiers, the people will begin to trust them." This word "trust" is the most important of all. The so-called "trust" is the belief in victory. However, the belief in victory comes from understanding the purpose of our Holy War. Today, we are acting on behalf of Heaven, shouldering the sacred task of eliminating the six enemies of mankind. It is a set policy to complete this mission. We have no doubt about our chances of victory. We should consciously grasp this task and must complete this task. If so, the so-called final victory will definitely belong to us.

### Conflict of British and American Interests in Developing West Asian Oil Fields

The US government's plan to develop the Arabian oil field area has caused considerable debate in the US Congress. Senator O'Mahoney, a vanguard of the Democratic Party who attacks the government, demanded the dissolution of the American Petroleum Reserve Corporation, which is active in obtaining Arabian oil field concessions. The old isolationist party also criticized Roosevelt for not trying to win over Churchill.

The conflict between Britain and the United States caused by the oil concession issue of Bahrain Island is also a recent event. The amount of money the United States intends to invest in developing Arabian oil fields is approximately US$410 million (of which US$110 million is for pipelines and plant construction). It is said that this plan has been agreed upon by Ickes, the director of the Wartime Fuel Adjustment Bureau and president of the Petroleum Reserve Corporation, and the British Overseas Oil Allocation Committee. The Soviet Union has not yet been consulted, but the Soviet Union has also requested to obtain an oil port in the Persian Gulf.

### Domestic Opposition

Furthermore, the US development of West Asian oil resources is in conflict with British oil concessions in that region, developing into a difficult diplomatic issue. There is also strong opposition within the country, and the position of Ickes, the wartime fuel director in charge, is quite difficult. James Murphy, former vice president of Mobil Oil Company, also launched a vigorous opposition movement against the above-mentioned government plan, pursuing Ickes's responsibility and demanding his resignation. To complete this plan, at least US$200 million of huge funds are required, and 500,000 tons of steel need to be used. But what is the result? The oil transport cost between Texas and New York in Britain is only 11 cents per bushel, while in the new plan, the transport cost from Arabia to Egypt is as much as 24 cents per bushel, plus 15% of the loss of oil in transit. From an economic point of view, it is extremely unwise. (Xiang:) Translated from the March 6th issue of Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)

### The Commercial Control Association Holds a General Meeting of Members; The Executive Yuan Appoints Cai Shengbai and Others as Preparatory Members

The National Commercial Control Association, having received a joint letter from all directors and supervisors of the association, stated: "Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, our government has had to control various important commodities in order to establish a wartime economic system, and to take into account public opinion, the National Commercial Control Association was specially established to assist the government with commercial autonomous groups, improve the material management system, and complete the wartime economic system. When the preparatory organization began in March of last year, subordinate organizations, such as the Joint Association and the trade associations under it, were either waiting to be organized or waiting to be adjusted. It was difficult for the members to elect directors and supervisors from among the representatives. As a temporary expedient, the government appointed us to temporarily fill these positions. In addition to being appointed, we deeply feel that the responsibilities are not light. Until today, the various lower-level organizations have been established and adjusted in order. The representatives attending the meeting have also been recommended one after another, and the resolutions have been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors and Supervisors of the Association, and have been reported to the government for records. According to the provisions of the Provisional Charter of the Association, the term of office of directors and supervisors is one year, and there are not many days left before the term expires. The government should be requested to convene a general meeting of members in accordance with the law, and to elect the next directors and supervisors from among the representatives to conform to the original purpose of commercial group autonomy. As for the preparatory work for the general meeting of members, it seems that the government should also be requested to designate several people from the attending representatives to be responsible for handling the matter, in order to show fairness. We hereby jointly write a letter, hoping that you will examine and forward it for approval." After receiving the letter, the Commercial Control Association, in accordance with Article 21 of the Provisional Charter of the Association, which states: "When the term of office of the directors and supervisors of the Association expires or there is a vacancy, it shall be handled in accordance with the Provisional Regulations of the National Commercial Control Association," should be handled in accordance with the regulations. The Association prepared a roster of members' representatives and forwarded it to the Executive Yuan, and requested that several people be designated from among the representatives attending the meeting to be responsible for handling the preparatory work for the general meeting of members. According to the reporter's investigation: The Association has received instructions from the Executive Yuan: "Cai Shengbai, Li Ze, Shi Lüqing, Xu Xiaochu, Liu Jingji, Chen Zishan, Zhu Chunbo, Wang Yuqing, Shen Jinzhou, Pan Xusheng, Jiang Hongbin, Xiang Shengwu, Chen Bofan, Ye Youcai, Cheng Nianpeng, Zheng Yuandian, Shen Weiting, Cai Zixiang, Yang Shaozhen, and Cao Qiming are appointed as preparatory members for the general meeting of representatives, and Cai Shengbai is appointed as the convener. You should immediately comply and report accordingly." After receiving the order, the Association immediately sent letters to all directors and supervisors and instructed the preparatory members to be informed, and also sent a letter to Cai Shengbai requesting him to comply and report on the situation of compliance, so that it could be forwarded for records.

### Numerous Robbery Cases Occurred; Repeat Offender Gang Caught; The Laozha District Police Substation Arrested Eight Robbers

Since the implementation of the light control in this city, petty thieves and robbers have been active, taking the opportunity to rob passersby of their belongings. The First Police Bureau ordered all police substations to step up their guard and send police officers to patrol the streets. It also ordered the police brigade to assist in patrols in various districts. The Laozha District Police Substation received a telephone report from the Xinguang Cinema at 10:30 pm on the 18th, stating that robbers with weapons were stripping pedestrians of their property at the Ningbo Road intersection. The sub-bureau chief Hong Hanbin and Fu Xia, along with the chief of the judicial section Liu Junqing, the chief of the anti-robbery section Chen Jinzhang, the detective Huang Yingjie, and a large number of detectives, rushed to the scene to arrest the robbers and implemented a blockade in the entire district. The robbers opened fire and resisted arrest upon hearing the police, and then fled into the Xinguang Cinema. The detectives arrested the robbers on the spot and took them to the bureau. The robbers confessed their names as Jia Yihai, 25 years old, from Shaoxing, living at Room 41, Southeast Hotel, GuiPing Road. They had five or six accomplices who specialized in stripping pedestrians of their clothes at night. The bureau went to the address and arrested accomplices Wang Bingnan, 23 years old, from Zhenjiang, Xi Wenxing, 21 years old, from Jiading, Gu Xuefu, 18 years old, from Tongzhou, Yan Jinlin, 22 years old, from Shaoxing, Yang Bolin, 19 years old, from Shanghai, totaling six people.

### Songping, Director of the Intelligence Department, Published His Impressions of His Visit to Suzhou; Chinese and Japanese People Show a Spirit of Cooperation

The Chinese and Japanese people show a spirit of cooperation.

Songping, the director of the intelligence department of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy in China, went to Suzhou on the 17th for official business and returned to Shanghai on the 19th after completing his work. He published his impressions of his inspection of Suzhou, stating that Suzhou is the birthplace of the Purifying the Countryside Movement. Suzhou, two years after the Purifying the Countryside Movement, is bound to have made more progress than other places, so he made this trip. During his stay in Suzhou, he visited the provincial government authorities and factories, and his impressions were excellent. For example, he visited the Suzhou Lun Textile Factory. The factory was previously managed by the military, but it has now been returned to its original owner, Yan Qingxiang. Although the factory feels that there is a shortage of raw materials and fuel, it is still working hard to increase production, and its products are supplied to both Chinese and Japanese people in the local area. The factory is working hard on the cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese business circles. The second is the efforts of the Jiangsu Provincial Government to communicate Chinese and Japanese cultural work. The Provincial Japanese Language School was established and opened on February 20, with more than 30 students. The school not only teaches Japanese, but also offers courses in politics, economics, and culture. A Japanese-style house has also been built in the provincial government so that people can learn about Japanese customs and habits as a tool for Chinese-Japanese cultural penetration, with far-reaching intentions. These are all manifestations of Chinese-Japanese mutual assistance in completing the Greater East Asia War. Other examples include the assistance of local Japanese soldiers and civilians to China. Recently, five professors from Tongwen College assisted in the work of purifying the countryside in Wuxi and Jiangyin. Mr. Dang Yong, a Japanese expatriate in Suzhou and the general manager of Suzhou Construction Materials Company, provides various kinds of assistance to Chinese farmers. His wife is particularly enthusiastic about poverty relief and medical care, so she is highly respected and admired by the farmers. The "Buddha's Temple" in Suzhou is another example, spreading religion and working on Chinese-Japanese cultural communication while helping Chinese refugees. It also established a Japanese language school, etc. It is also quite popular among the people in Suzhou. There are many examples of Chinese and Japanese people working hard to cooperate, which shows that the Chinese and Japanese people are moving towards close cooperation.

### Analyzing Recent European Developments

The regular press briefing of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy in China was held at the Cathay Hotel yesterday at 2:30 PM.  The Embassy was represented by Information Minister Matsudaira, Vice-Consul Fukuma, and other officials.  Reporters from various Shanghai newspapers were present. Minister Matsudaira provided a very detailed analysis of the recent European situation, focusing on the differences among England, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The following is a record of his remarks:

Although the three countries of England, the United States, and the Soviet Union outwardly presented a united front on European policy at the Tehran Conference, an analysis of the recent European situation after the conference reveals that the three countries have differing opinions and increasing friction. Examples are as follows: To appease the Soviet Union, England does not hesitate to compromise Poland, agreeing to the Soviet Union's annexation of a large part of Polish territory. Although Poland requested help from various countries, the United States was caught in the middle and simply resolved the matter with verbal assurances. Within Yugoslavia, the guerrillas are divided into two factions: one supported by England and the other by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union demanded that England cease its aid. England eventually relented, automatically abandoning support for the Mihailović guerrillas and submitting to the Soviet Union. England and the United States disagree on the establishment of a Jewish state. The United States advocates establishing a Jewish state in Palestine, while England sympathizes with the pan-Arab movement. England and the United States are competing for oil development rights in Persia (Iran), with both countries attempting to dominate. The Soviet Union suddenly recognized the Italian Badoglio regime without notifying England or the United States in advance. The United States expressed dissatisfaction with this, and U.S. Secretary of State Hull issued a statement refusing to recognize it. Turkey is unwilling to join the anti-Axis powers. Turkey deeply understands that if it joins the alliance with England and participates in the war, it will inevitably bear the brunt. The conflict between English and Soviet forces is bound to occur in Turkey, becoming even more blatant. Therefore, Turkey is trying its best to maintain neutrality. Soviet diplomats are very active in the northeastern part of the Mediterranean, which has aroused British concern. Recently, Dr. Malan of the Union of South Africa, on March 16, even made an anti-Soviet speech, saying: If the anti-Axis forces win in the future, it will inevitably lead to the spread of communist forces. Therefore, to prevent communist forces, it is advisable to assist Germany in defeating the Soviet Union. In short, the current European situation is very complicated. The increasingly divergent opinions of England, the United States, and the Soviet Union make it difficult to be optimistic about the anti-Axis powers' path to victory.

### Government Clarifies Officialdom, Shanghai Circles Express Support, General Prices Already Declining

The National Government, in order to clarify officialdom and punish corruption, has conducted thorough investigations for several months. It has already sentenced to death in Beijing former Director of the Food Department's Aquatic Products Administration, Hu Zheng, and Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Food Administration, Hou Dachun, for major fraud in the procurement of military grain. When the news spread, people in all circles of Shanghai were excited. This measure serves as a warning to unscrupulous officials and merchants and is the greatest manifestation of suppressing hoarding, stabilizing prices, and securing the people's livelihood. Since then, general prices in Shanghai have already started to decline. Government officials stationed in Shanghai and relevant agencies have been reassured and are conscientiously working at their respective posts. It is reported that various financial institutions in the city and all sectors hope that the government will continue to conduct thorough investigations and punish corrupt merchants and poor officials. Once the national politics are clean and honest, industry and commerce and the people will be able to abide by the law and develop their businesses.

Commentary

### General Uprising Movement

In order to concentrate all efforts on enhancing production, the Japanese government decided at the cabinet meeting on the 25th of last month to adhere to the decisive battle and disregard prices. To date, twelve items, including the concrete requirements to stop high-end entertainment, have been announced and implemented. Simultaneously with this, there is the National General Uprising Movement, the main goal of which is to enhance production. The Japanese National General Uprising Movement, so far, includes: 1. Restricting passenger transportation, with the aim of enhancing combat power and evacuating the population for air defense. 2. Strengthening the women's volunteer corps system, with the aim of enabling unmarried women to cooperate in manual labor. 3. Implementing measures to encourage labor and boost morale, with the aim of rapidly improving the labor efficiency of industrial plants. Among the above three implementation guidelines, two are purely focused on enhancing production.

We believe that such a National General Uprising Movement is most suitable for today's extremely sluggish production sector in China. In other words, the remedy contained in the National General Uprising Movement is the only good medicine for treating anemia and neurasthenia in today's Chinese production sector and should be adopted by the entire nation, both high and low. At a time when speculation is no longer feasible, officials and the people should cooperate and work hard to promote various production undertakings. Those in supervisory positions should thoroughly supervise the production sector to improve the labor system and refresh labor management. Those in management positions should strive to strengthen factory organizations and rapidly improve factory production efficiency. The previous decline is like yesterday's death, and the subsequent effort is like today's birth. There must be a general uprising in the economic sector in order to speak of a leap in wartime production.

### Grain Trade Groups Demand Unified Rationing, Petition City Government Together Yesterday

They also requested that, in accordance with the Executive Yuan's approval, the special allocation of each industry be concentrated under the Unified Allocation Office for coordinated distribution to ensure fairness and avoid ambiguity. At the same time, they stated the difficulties faced by members of each industry and requested prompt relief measures to maintain their businesses.

### Flour Factories Change to Daytime Operations

### A True Man's Diary (4)

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

June 8th (Wednesday) Rain.

The rain from yesterday continues to fall today. It must be the plum rain season.

I am very tired from the lectures on navigation and shipbuilding. Without worrying about the outcome of the exam, I must first aim to develop real ability. I will not follow officers without real ability.

June 11th (Saturday) Sunny.

The first clear day after a long rain. Wearing the military uniform of the Second Bridge today, my heart is very happy with this bright appearance.

After cleaning, while carrying the dinghy, the hook was lost. I am very ashamed to have lost it while I was responsible for guarding it.

There was land combat training, and a defense battle with the position. Although we were the attacking army, the defensive army quickly converted to offensive, so I heard we fell into a chaotic state. Although it was due to the poor command of the company commander, it was also due to a lack of combat spirit.

July 6th (Eternal Summer) Sunny.

Although the exam has ended, the time is only very normal, so I do not regret being safe and sound. I can only advance towards my duty.

After dinner, there was the movie "Defense at Sea." The broadcast was completed. It was a speech by a naval giant about the current situation. Afterwards, the supervisor gave a warning: "Be cheerful," "Conserve materials," and "No smoking," etc. Before the student team, it was really helpful to ban smoking. I admire it very much.

July 20th (Water) Sunny

We in the Ordnance Department must also understand the hard work of weapon production and pay attention to the improvement of military equipment.

Swimming training requires only effort, and communication (Note: Communication training) can be further strengthened with effort.

August 23rd (Fire) Sunny.

Starting this week, I am determined to exert myself and be especially nervous, but I fell asleep in the "Navigation" class, which is shameful. The instructor often says, "Our work is also a service to the country. If you can think of it this way, you won't doze off." That's right. I must correct this.

September 18th (Sunday) Sunny.

School Anniversary, Hachiman 例祭 (annual festival). At 10:30 I went out to the 330th Association (Note: Kagoshima Prefecture Association). Major M said that performance at military school is important, but that is only a part of naval life. Efforts after graduation are more important. Furthermore, being noticed by superiors is also a sign of a promising future.

September 27th (Tuesday) Sunny.

I welcomed the arrival of His Imperial Highness, and the graduation ceremony for the 60th class was held. After the graduation ceremony, I gave a speech as Chief of the Naval General Staff. I vowed to serve the country to the death with excitement. With this gratitude, I will move forward from tomorrow.

September 28th (Water) Sunny.

At the appointment announcement ceremony, I was appointed squad leader and became student number one. After two and a half years of waiting, I finally became number one, and I deeply feel the weight of responsibility. Although education that prohibits corporal punishment is good, it must not allow the student hall to become an existence that has lost its spirit. This must be considered.

October 7th (Gold) Sunny

Hitler Youth visited.

In welcoming today's 50th anniversary of the establishment of the military flag, looking up at the radiant naval flag of the rising sun, thinking of the deep meaning within it as we are now on the path of the Holy War, it strengthens our beliefs.

From the letter of a candidate, I learned that if you do not study hard while in school, the future will be difficult. So-called bravery of blood is not successful, and we must work hard in the future.

October 16th (Sunday) Sunny. If it is said to be a ball-playing weather, it is certainly very cold. The so-called blood energy of courage is not a successful trial, forced by the present, so all are working hard in the self-study room.

A servant is cleaning the latrine, and because he did not know he began to urinate in the latrine, and thinking about it, it is really embarrassing. He did this mistake when people did not know.

October 20th Century Auspicious (Earth) Cloudy, sometimes rainy.

The exam is over, and I am preparing for the "Early Thousand Early" educational assignment in the morning.

5:30, Exit, all the way to Takamatsu.

Night sailing, on duty for two hours. The so-called Always on the deck, one's knowledge will be broadened.

### Improvements in Forced Grain Purchases

— Song Qingxiang

Since the establishment of the Rice Control Association, its rationed quantity has not satisfied the citizens. The reasons for this, although due to the unsoundness of the control mechanism and the lack of personnel unity, the daily price difference with the black market rice price is too large, easily causing the office staff to see the benefit and take advantage of it. But the most important thing is that the purchasing area disregards the farmers' capital and forcibly suppresses the price of purchases, causing the local farmers to regard the purchase as a long journey. All rice and chestnuts are either used to brew wine and food, or to transform other substances to avoid the purchase by the authorities, or even to change the area of rice and wheat cultivation to other crops that avoid being purchased in order to seek high profits. Such planting is difficult to fully describe. If the method of forced purchase is not improved for a long time, not only will the quantity of rice rations not increase in the future, but the panic of rice and grain will become more and more serious. Seeing the black market rice price becoming more expensive, the food problem is unimaginable.

I believe that for the establishment of a public welfare undertaking, the relevant local authorities should provide considerable assistance, and so should the transportation agencies. If the Rice Control Association offers the local market price to farmers in the rice-producing areas to purchase grain, and then consults with the transportation agencies to reduce the freight as much as possible, after transporting the rice, the Association should distribute an adequate amount to all citizens at the original purchase price to meet their daily needs. If this is the case, the farmers in the purchased area will have a considerable profit from their labor, without losing their capital. They will definitely offer all their crops to the purchasing agency as much as possible. Furthermore, the citizens of Shanghai can purchase an adequate amount of rationed food at a price slightly higher than the current price, avoiding relying on the black market. Since citizens do not need to purchase expensive food on the black market, the black market will naturally disappear. With the black market gone, the Rice Control Association will be able to fulfill its responsibility of unified allocation by successfully obtaining an adequate amount of rice. I hope that the ruling authorities will pay attention to this.

### The Purpose of Establishing Jishan Library

— Liu Zhifang

The late philosopher Liu Zongzhou was a great Confucian of the late Ming Dynasty, whose scholarship followed the Yangming school. He was loyal and passionate throughout his life, and upright and unyielding. He once lectured at the Jishan Academy in Shaoxing, and was called Mr. Jishan. Fellow villagers in Shanghai admired the spirit of the wise men, so Zhifang and others formed the Jishan Society in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), with the aim of promoting culture and pursuing educational and charitable undertakings. Furthermore, due to the soaring prices of books, the progress of culture has been greatly affected, and vocational youths and students who need extracurricular materials are all deeply troubled by economic difficulties. There are not many libraries in Shanghai, and due to geographical reasons, they cannot be widely circulated. Therefore, we jointly established the Jishan Library with Mr. Mao Panxi, the founder of the Benliu Bookstore, investing one million yuan to collect more than 20,000 books and novels of various kinds, so that young people can use their spare time to improve their studies and morals, and also to reduce unnecessary consumption. Now, in order to uphold the purpose of popularizing education and assisting young people in seeking knowledge, it is not limited to those from Shaoxing, and young people from all walks of life can apply to join and borrow books free of charge. (Just notify by phone, and we will order the driver to exchange books so as to avoid inconvenience for readers.) The opening is scheduled for the 22nd of this month, to welcome guests from all walks of life and to begin circulation. The address is at 127 Liuhe Road, inside the Shaoxing Fellow Villagers Association. Telephone number 95569.
