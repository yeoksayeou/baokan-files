### Establishing a Strong Political Force

â€” Chen Bin He

Yesterday afternoon, the four groups of the City Industry and Commerce Association, the Citizens Welfare Association, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, and the News Federation held a joint tea party to welcome the newly appointed Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Mr. Wu Songxing, and Director of Security, Mr. Xiong Jiandong. Bin He participated in the event and gave a brief speech. I am now writing down the following notes:

Shanghai is China's largest city, with a population of five million, and it is the center of the economy. Most of the country's production power is concentrated here, and most of the country's trade and commerce gather here. Objectively, it should generate great power and play a leading role. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and China's participation in the war, Shanghai has not exerted its great power or played a leading role in contributing to the war. On the contrary, at times all forces are dispersed and wasted. Why? It is undeniable that the central reason is the lack of a strong political measurement. Because political power is the core. When the core is strong, the surrounding dependencies will naturally be strong. When both the core and the surroundings are strong, the overall great power will naturally emerge. In other words, if there is a strong political power as the center, and various forces are concentrated, then great power can be generated. If there is no strong political power as the center, various forces will tend to disperse. After dispersion, they will each go on abnormal paths. Taking Shanghai's economy as an example, a review reveals speculation, hoarding, wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, rising prices, shrinking production, and the salary class's living conditions becoming increasingly difficult. These are all detrimental to the country and society without any benefit. This is an example of Shanghai's lack of a strong political force, an undeniable fact.

Therefore, our first requirement is that Shanghai must have a strong political power as the center to concentrate economic, cultural, and other forces to generate overall great power. The promotion of a so-called strong political force can be discussed in two aspects. First, the highest administrative organ, the municipal government, must improve its personnel. We deeply admire Mayor Chen's talent and prestige. Recently, Mr. Wu Songxing was appointed as the Director of the First District Office and Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and Mr. Xiong Jiandong was appointed as the Director of Security and Director of the Rural Clearing Affairs Bureau. We believe that the appointment of Mr. Wu and Mr. Xiong, with their talents, to assume key leadership positions is the municipal government's determination to improve its personnel, and we are very satisfied and grateful. However, the municipal government should further review whether the personnel of the directly affiliated agencies are sound. If the personnel of the entire municipal government are not completely sound, then the overall administrative efficiency and administrative facilities will still be a problem, and a strong political force will still be out of reach. Second, during this decisive period, Shanghai, an important base in the rear, the various departments of the municipal government bear important responsibilities. It is not enough to passively ensure that individuals do not do bad things and that their personal reputations are not damaged. At the same time, they must have the courage and resolve to actively overcome all difficulties and eliminate all wartime abnormalities. In particular, we expect Mr. Wu and Mr. Xiong to lead by example and take the lead in pioneering this. Furthermore, the power of the government's few people is certainly not enough. It must be coupled with the full cooperation of the people. The people must have the opportunity to participate in politics, and all policies and decrees must first be widely understood by the people. Therefore, a true organ of public opinion is urgently needed. In this way, Shanghai can be made a model area of Chinese politics and a model area for contributing to the war effort. Furthermore, it can be made a model area for Sino-Japanese cooperation.

Regarding Sino-Japanese cooperation, according to the current situation, it is far from the goal of a model area. Whether it is in terms of cooperative undertakings or the feelings of both sides, the goal of a model area has not been achieved. It is hoped that in the future, all unreasonable phenomena that hinder the cooperation of both sides should be reflected upon and reformed by both China and Japan. All undertakings that can increase the feelings of both sides, or production undertakings, or undertakings that are beneficial to the war, should be continuously worked on and sincerely cooperated on by both China and Japan.

Establishing a strong political force as the center, coordinating economic forces, Sino-Japanese cooperation, making it a model area of Chinese politics, and a model area of Sino-Japanese cooperation. At this crucial juncture of the decisive battle, we cannot afford to be passive and mistaken! We cannot afford to be slack and negligent! If Shanghai cannot build a strong political force, then there is no point in talking about the political power of the whole of China. If China cannot build a strong political force, then there is no point in talking about actually contributing to the war!

### Japanese and Indian Troops Advance Westward on the Dimapur-Imphal Road; Enemy Troops in Imphal Are Being Encircled and Annihilated

Central News Agency, Front Line on the Indo-Burmese Border, 6th: The enemy forces north of Tonzang and northwest of Dimapur have collapsed and retreated. Currently, Japanese and Indian troops are advancing northward on the road from Tonzang to Imphal, and a unit of Japanese and Indian troops has begun to advance westward on the road from Dimapur to Palel. The enemy's base, Imphal, is being surrounded from all sides, and a war of annihilation is currently being launched against the main force of the enemy's Fourth Army, the three divisions. The main force of the enemy's 37th Brigade of the 23rd Division and several thousand remnants of the 17th Division north of Tonzang have been retreating into the national border since the 1st, and the Japanese and Indian troops are attacking them. By the 3rd, a unit of Japanese and Indian troops had advanced 10 kilometers into Indian territory, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. After the fall of Dimapur, one brigade of the enemy's 23rd Division and one brigade of the 23rd Division were also annihilated. As a result, the main force of the Japanese and Indian troops advanced from Dimapur, while another unit of Japanese and Indian troops cut off their retreat route. Since the 1st, they have continuously bombarded the defeated enemy northwest of Dimapur, and their motorcades and barracks and warehouses in Kiphima (18 miles northwest of Dimapur) have been set on fire. In addition, the Japanese and Indian commando units blocking the retreat route of the enemy forces northwest of Dimapur have attacked the enemy troops attempting to provide reinforcements and continue to attack Palel (located on the road from Dimapur to Imphal, the exit for Imphal and other places), the headquarters of the enemy's 20th Division. On the 3rd, they advanced to a position 10 kilometers east of Palel.

Central News Agency, a Base on the Indo-Burmese Border, 6th: Chikha, 7 kilometers south of the border, and the Tonzang-Imphal road are key points on the Indo-Burmese border, where the enemy has established a defensive line. However, it could not withstand the fierce attacks of the Japanese army and has now collapsed. On the night of the 4th, the enemy set fire to the ammunition depot, and the fire was very intense. The ammunition depot experienced a series of large explosions, and the situation was extremely tragic. The various units of the Japanese army, with the force of raging waves, launched a rapid attack on Chikha. By dawn on the 5th, the Japanese army, under the cover of artillery fire, broke into a corner of the enemy's line, defeated the enemy's key points, and Chikha will soon fall.

### Indian Chairman Bose Issues Another Statement Urging Indians to Jointly Strive for Independence

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 5th: The Provisional Government of India has been actively reviewing various administrative measures and gradually implementing them as the Free India area expands rapidly with the progress of the war. Chairman Jiangtela Bose issued a second statement on the 4th, emphasizing that Japan has no political, economic, or military ambitions towards India. The Provisional Government of India is the only legitimate government of the Indian people, and all enlightened Indians should abandon everything to join the Indian National Army to jointly strive for the freedom and independence of their motherland. The full text is recorded as follows: Gentlemen, the Provisional Government of Free India, based on the general will of the three million Indians in East Asia, established the Indian National Army in Chao Nan on October 21, 1943. Under the command of the Provisional Government, it has broken through the border and penetrated deep into Indian territory. The Provisional Government of Free India is your own government, so we must complete a major mission, which is to use force to drive the British and Americans out of the sacred land of India and establish a permanent free Indian national government based on the will of the Indian people. The Provisional Government of Free India will continue the armed struggle until it defeats the British and American forces and drives them out of India. At the same time, it will also engage in the construction of the liberated areas. The Provisional Government of Free India is the only legitimate government of India for the Indian people. The Provisional Government will provide the greatest assistance and cooperation to the Indian people in the liberated areas through the Indian National Army and the administrative officials appointed by the Provisional Government. The Provisional Government is the guarantor of the lives and property of the Indians in the liberated areas, so any act that is beneficial to the enemy British, Americans, and Allied forces or hinders the Provisional Government's great cause of reviving India will be severely punished. The Provisional Government sincerely hopes that the Indian people will fully cooperate with the Japanese army, our allies. The Japanese army is providing us with unlimited support in order to crush our enemies. In the past two years, the British army has strengthened its own forces with troops from India, America, Australia, and East and West Africa. In view of this, the Provisional Government accepted the good intentions of the Japanese army's support after the start of the Greater East Asia War, and believes that the Indian National Army, with the cooperation of the Japanese army, will be able to crush the British and American forces and achieve the complete liberation of India. The Provisional Government absolutely trusts Japan's attitude towards India, and believes that Japan has no political, economic, military, or territorial ambitions towards India. What Japan is concerned about is only the overthrow of the long-standing enemies of East Asia and the defeat of British and American aggression, so that this war can end and world peace can be realized. In order to have the conditions of an independent national government, the Provisional Government is now preparing to issue rupees in various denominations as India's own currency. However, in the past, due to the rapid development of the war situation, our army advanced into India, so the Provisional Government's preparation for issuing currency was not completed. Under this situation, the Provisional Government had no choice but to temporarily use the currency of the Japanese government as a temporary measure. Once the Provisional Government establishes its own currency, it will immediately recall the Japanese currency. Fellow compatriots, at this time when we are driving out the evil forces of the enemy from our own country, you should do what the citizens of Free India should do, join your own Provisional Government of Free India and the National Army, and jointly strive for the freedom and independence of your motherland.

### German Foreign Minister Issues Statement Resolving to Defend Romania; Says Soviet Declaration is a Political Conspiracy

Central News Agency, Berlin, 6th: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop met with Futo, a special correspondent of the Romanian News Agency stationed in Berlin, and said that the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union has become increasingly difficult because Britain and the United States cannot stop the Kremlin's policies. Regarding the reply to the correspondent's question, the German Foreign Minister pointed out that Britain and the United States have discovered that Moscow is now in a leading position, but Europe does not use the cracks between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to defeat the Soviet Union. The only way for Europe to win is to hope for the strength of the allied countries in Europe. The German Foreign Minister also refuted the enemy's rumors that the German army had abandoned Romania, and expressed that the German army's defense of Romania was as firm as its defense of Germany. Regarding the Soviet Union's statement that entering Romania was purely for military purposes, when asked for the Foreign Minister's opinion on this, he replied: Foreign Minister Molotov's declaration is not surprising to those who have paid attention to Soviet foreign policy for the past 25 years, because political conspiracies are often part of the Soviet strategy. When its military strength has exceeded its highest point, the Soviet Union often uses political tricks. The Germans believe that the reason why the Soviet Union is accelerating the use of current means is that after suffering terrible sacrifices last year, the Soviet Union is trying to end the current campaign at the least cost. The Soviets recalled that they had once been close to victory, but ended up being defeated. Therefore, they hope to reduce their risks as much as possible. This can also be explained by the Soviet Union's action of deceiving Finland with moderate ceasefire conditions. Its seduction of Bulgaria and promises to Romania are all intended for this purpose, but it is believed that every Romanian knows the value of Soviet promises. Regarding the British Prime Minister's remarks in the House of Commons that he was satisfied with Molotov's statement and that he had expressed the British government's satisfaction to the Kremlin, when asked for the German Foreign Minister's opinion on this, he replied: The explanation of this matter is very simple. This is an example of extreme hypocrisy. London has been able to experience the fact that Churchill cannot resist Stalin, and all are afraid that this matter will eventually become the misfortune of Britain. The opposition of the central people to Churchill's policy is gradually increasing its voice. The Soviet Foreign Minister's declaration is a good opportunity for Churchill to make a disguise. Churchill has sacrificed Finland, the three Baltic countries, Poland, and the Balkan countries to the Soviet Union. In fact, this is the sacrifice of Britain's traditional policy towards Europe. After Molotov issued the declaration, this gambler appeared in the House of Commons, disguising himself as a believing in the true meaning of the Soviet declaration to create the impression that Britain's interests were not threatened by the Soviet Union. When asked for the Foreign Minister's opinion on the situation in Romania after the Soviet army crossed the Romanian border, the German Foreign Minister replied: Romania is part of Europe, and the Soviet Union's threat to Romania is a threat to the whole of Europe. The defense of the Dniester River is the same as the defense of other strongholds in Europe. Regarding the rumors that the German army is willing to abandon Romania for strategic reasons, it is extremely ridiculous. This is similar to saying that the Germans will abandon Berlin. The Germans defend Romania in the same way as they resist the heavy air raids of Britain and the United States. The Soviet army's entry into Romania has strengthened the cooperation between the German and Romanian armies. The German army will defend Romanian territory until Romania regains its freedom and prevents Bolshevism from invading the Balkans.

### Appointment of Commander of Tokyo Division by the Japanese Army Ministry

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: The Japanese Army Ministry announced on the 6th that Prince Kaya Tsunenori, Lieutenant General and Commander of the Nagoya Division, has been appointed as the Commander of the Tokyo Division. Hara Michio, Lieutenant General and former Principal of the Army Military Academy, has been appointed as the Deputy Director of the newly established Air Force Supervisory Department and concurrently Deputy Director of the Army Air Force Headquarters. Niizuma Takeshi, Major General, has been appointed as the Director of the Military Horse Replenishment Department.

### Illegal Hoarding by Chongqing Officials and Merchants

Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th: Chongqing has recently become more active in punishing corrupt officials and treacherous merchants. Since the National General Mobilization Conference was convened last year, all bank warehouses specializing in hoarding have been inspected. As a result, more than 1,000 cases of illegal activities have been reported. A Chongqing broadcast on the 3rd severely criticized the evil acts of hoarding and speculation, stating in essence that: more than 20 banks in Sichuan Province have a total of 152 warehouses. After inspection, 363 cases of illegal activities were found, involving the hoarding of materials worth more than 60 million yuan. More than 600 cases of illegal activities were found in the other nine provinces. Since most of the hoarded materials are valuable items, it is expected that the amount will also be very large. At this difficult time for the country, it is heartbreaking that there are so many illegal activities. Therefore, a military court should be convened to stop the trend of hoarding and speculation.

### Ambassador Tani Fetes Minister Chu and Others

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th: Tani Masayuki, Ambassador of the Allied Powers to China, invited Minister Chu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Minister Mei of the Ministry of Interior, Minister Lin of the Ministry of Propaganda, Ambassador Chen, and Ambassador Lu of Manchuria to a banquet at his official residence at 6:30 PM the day before yesterday to celebrate with our government authorities and welcome Ambassador Chen Jicheng, our ambassador to Manchuria, who recently returned from Manchuria. Ambassador Tani, accompanied by Minister Horiuchi, Secretary Shimizu, and others, cordially entertained the guests. During the banquet, Ambassador Chen was specially invited to talk about the current situation in Manchuria for more than an hour, and Ambassador Lu added to the discussion. Then, they frankly exchanged views on strengthening the friendship between China and Manchuria and strengthening the Sino-Japanese-Manchurian axis. The banquet ended happily at around 11:00 PM.

### Chongqing's Melancholy

â€” By a Contemporary

A week ago, Japan and the Soviet Union reached an agreement on extending the fisheries treaty for five years and transferring rights to oil and coal resources on Sakhalin Island. This resolved a long-standing issue, and the friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union were fully manifested through these economic measures. The stability of the northeastern part of Asia was further ensured, which is a well-known fact. Prominent Soviet newspapers, Izvestia and Pravda, each published an editorial on this matter. In their conclusions, they pointed out that the agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union was a manifestation of their amicable relations, and emphasized that the friendly relations between the two countries would become even closer. However, the most affected were, of course, Britain, America, and Chongqing. They selectively quoted Soviet newspaper editorials, deliberately distorting the facts, claiming that the agreement was merely a unilateral diplomatic victory for the Soviet Union, or that it indicated Japan's weakening position, using this to conceal their embarrassment and console themselves.

Internally Filled with Contradictions

The enemy's comical propaganda was inconsistent in its tone. Chongqing, four days after the conclusion of the Japan-Soviet negotiations, also broadcast a special report in Russian, following the tone of Britain and America, without much originality. However, two points seemed particularly important. Chongqing, humbly speaking of the Japan-Soviet agreement, said, "This gives Japan some hope before the Allied forces launch an offensive," acknowledging that Japan's position had been strengthened. They also specifically stated, "This matter requires full understanding among the United Nations," seemingly expressing a hint of resentment towards the Soviet Union for not fully informing the United Nations in advance. The Chongqing-based special correspondent for an American newspaper, Ober, broadcast on Chongqing radio on the 4th, saying that the Japan-Soviet agreement increased Chongqing's military threat from Japan and shattered hopes of enlisting Soviet participation in the war against Japan. These words depicted Chongqing's internal melancholy. In short, Chongqing is also an Asian nation, and they also hope to stabilize Asia. However, they feel melancholy because the Japan-Soviet agreement promotes stability in Northeast Asia. This is Chongqing's greatest contradiction. It is not impossible for Chongqing to escape this contradiction, but unfortunately, the path to escaping this contradiction is deliberately obscured by Chongqing's leaders, who suppress the light of the people.

The day after the news of the Japan-Soviet agreement was released, a Moscow newspaper stated, "This is another worry for Chongqing," and published a report from a TASS correspondent in Ulan Bator about Chongqing's troops violating the borders of the Mongolian People's Republic in Xinjiang Province. The correspondent also stated that the Mongolian People's Republic government was established under the 1936 mutual assistance treaty, and if violations of the border by Chongqing's troops continue, it is believed that the Soviet Union will provide all necessary assistance to the Mongolian government.

Centralization of Xinjiang

Everyone knows that TASS is a purely Soviet state organ, and its reports are much more detailed and important than the irresponsible news from the American Associated Press and United Press. Therefore, the TASS report made Chongqing even more embarrassed. Furthermore, Chongqing has continuously promoted the "centralization" of Xinjiang Province. Sheng Shicai, the chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, has now been appointed Deputy Commander of the Eighth War Zone, and a Kuomintang branch has been established. At the very least, it can be said that a large part of its bureaucratic structure is controlled by Chongqing. Therefore, the border conflicts can also be seen as conflicts between the Soviet Union's proxy, the Mongolian People's Republic, and Chongqing. Chongqing remains silent about this internally, and externally claims, "The reported details do not conform to the facts," or says, "Outer Mongolia is part of China, and the Soviet Union should not interfere," even using "there is no factual basis" to dismiss everything. The Moscow government has remained silent on this matter so far, but Chongqing's worries and anxieties are increasing day by day. In addition, it utilizes the Chinese Communist Party for the war of resistance against Japan, but on the other hand, it fears the growing influence of the CCP, so it constantly attacks them politically and militarily. In this situation, Chongqing is surrounded by the constraints created by the relations between the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia, the relations between the Soviet Union and China, and the friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. Its only hope lies in relying on the United States, dreaming that the results of the Cairo Conference will be realized. However, in fact, the United States also believes that it is better to abandon Chongqing and utilize the CCP for the war against Japan. For example, the American "New Republic" weekly openly advocated supporting the CCP military in an editorial, believing that the CCP's political and military strength is more effective than Chongqing's in stabilizing Asia. If this is indeed the case, where will Chongqing go? The harsh reality has gradually shattered the opium-induced dreams made of American goods.

### German Garrison in Kovel, Poland, Relieved; Situation in Carpathians Also Improves

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) â€“ German military authorities announced: The German garrison in the former Polish city of Kovel, although surrounded by Soviet forces with several times their strength, was still able to demonstrate their firm fighting spirit and hinder the Soviet advance. German armored forces northwest of the city, under air cover, launched a fierce attack and successfully rescued the German garrison in Kovel. The area around the city has now returned to the German defensive line.

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) â€“ According to a report from the military correspondent Colonel Orpe of the DNB (German News Bureau): Due to the heavy rain turning into blizzards on the Eastern Front and the German authorities' counterattacks, the enemy's offensive on the Eastern Front has greatly weakened in recent days. Therefore, reinforcements for the German forces in the Carpathian Mountains and Bessarabia have been able to proceed quickly, without needing to transfer reserves from Western Europe. In addition, on the entire front of the Prut River, the Hungarian army is fighting shoulder to shoulder with the German army, repelling the Soviet offensive. North of Odessa, the enemy's attacks are becoming increasingly fierce. The Soviet army has only penetrated German positions in the Raszjejnaje area; attacks by the enemy in other areas have been blocked, especially in the lower reaches of the Dnieper River. The German withdrawal along the Black Sea coast was not disturbed. The enemy advancing from Balti towards Chisinau has not yet been able to cut the railway from Iasi to Tiraspol. German and Romanian troops are fighting together in this area. Soviet crossings of the Prut River north of Iasi have been repelled by German aircraft. West of Cernauti, large German forces have been fighting for many days and have reached the west bank of the Dniester River from the north. At the foot of the Carpathian Mountains, the German army has been able to stop the enemy's southward advance, and the situation is gradually improving. On the northern wing, German forces in Brody and Kovel have begun counterattacks. The enemy has been repelled south and northeast of Brody, and German forces have occupied large areas northeast of Kovel. On the central front, large-scale enemy offensives in Vitebsk, Orsha, and Drutsk have been blocked. On the northern front, the enemy is preparing for a large-scale breakthrough towards the Baltic Sea, and large forces have been attacking Pskov fiercely. There, enemy forces are concentrating in large numbers.

### Four Organizations Host Grand Reception for Secretary-General Wu and Director Xiong

Upon the appointments of Mr. Wu Songgao as the new Secretary-General of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government and Mr. Xiong Jiandong as the Director of the Municipal Security Bureau, recognizing that the municipal administration is well-staffed, the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, the Industrial and Commercial Association, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, and the Press Association jointly held a tea party yesterday (the 6th) at 4:30 PM at the Industrial and Commercial Association Hall in the Koa Building to express their respect.

The guests of honor, Secretary-General Wu and Director Xiong, arrived promptly. Guests and members of the four organizations who attended included: from the Allied side, Deputy Director Watanabe, Vice-Consul Fukama, Special Higher Police Chief Goshima, Chairman Funatsu, President Osaka, Akamatsu, Hidaka, Takechi, Tsutsumi Takashi, Kurimoto, and Yamamoto; from our side, Zhang Yipeng, Su Chengde, Wen Lan, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Gu Nanqun, Ren Xiaoshan, Shen Siliang, Xu Xiaochu, Xu Guangqun, Wang Boyuan, Jin Zongcheng, Wang Haibo, Xiang Kangyuan, Chen Riping, Liu Yunfang, Xu Liqu, Weng Yongqing, Zheng Hongyan, Lu Feng, Zhu Yongkang, Yang Huilang, Chen Shao-wei, Wu Yong'an, Lei Xianzhi, Zhan Peilin, Xu Busun, Zhou Mengbai, and Song Zhuozai, totaling over a hundred people. The reception began with a speech by Chairman Wen Lanting.

Chairman's Speech

Today, the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Association, the Citizens' Welfare Association, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, and the Press Association are jointly hosting this reception to welcome the new Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Mr. Wu Songgao, and the Director of the Security Bureau, Mr. Xiong Jiandong. Both gentlemen are accomplished scholars and promising talents. Shen Bao's short commentary on the 2nd of this month introduced the talents of both gentlemen, and I strongly agree, feeling fortunate for the future of the new Shanghai municipal administration. Now, I would like to invite Mr. Chen Binsu to deliver a welcoming speech on behalf of the group. (The original text can be found in today's editorial in this newspaper.)

Secretary-General Wu's Speech

I am very grateful for the joint tea party hosted today by the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, the Industrial and Commercial Association, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, and the Press Association. I just heard Mr. Chen Binsu's words, which, from my personal perspective, are of great significance. These valuable opinions can serve not only the government authorities but also the general public.

The importance of Shanghai's position has just been explained by Mr. Chen. I would now like to briefly report on my involvement in Shanghai's local administration.

I have served in the diplomatic field for many years, as is well known to my friends, but there are motivations and reasons for my gradual transition from a diplomat to a local official. In March of last year, our ally Japan decided to return the exclusive concession to China and decided to assist China in recovering other concessions. I believe that the purpose of the Chinese national revolution is to seek freedom and independence. The reason why China has not been able to achieve freedom and independence is due to many factors, but the constraints of unequal treaties are the main reason. If the concessions are not recovered for even a single day, China cannot achieve freedom and independence for a single day. At that time, I was ordered by Chairman Wang to participate in the committees for accepting the concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights. The reason I participated in these two tasks was because I felt that after the recovery of the concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, at least the demands of the people for the past twenty years would be adequately satisfied. Therefore, after the signing of the agreement for the return of the concessions, I went to Hankou in March of last year to take over the concession. In May, I was assigned to Tianjin to take over the French exclusive concession. In mid-July, our allies decided to assist China in returning the Shanghai International Settlement, and at the same time, the French authorities also made a similar statement, returning the Shanghai French Concession. Later, I also participated in the signing of the return agreement. After the return of the International Settlement, new institutions were organized to handle the administration of the former International Settlement. At that time, Mayor Chen hoped that I would help and serve as the Chief Secretary. I was willing to take on this role for two reasons:

I know very well that Japan's return of the concessions to China is a manifestation of its new policy towards China, and the purpose of the new policy is to gradually support China in achieving freedom and independence during the war. I feel that since our allies have such good intentions, we should cater to these good intentions. Therefore, I devoted myself to receiving the International Settlement and establishing a new administrative agency, namely the First District Public Office, to manage the administrative affairs under the jurisdiction of the former Shanghai Municipal Council. This motivation can also be said to be a diplomatic motivation.

Although I was not born in Shanghai, I received my secondary and university education in Shanghai, and I have a close relationship with Shanghai society. Based on this standpoint, it is my wish to do some work for Shanghai society, so I resolutely participated in local administrative work. This motivation can be said to be a motivation to serve society.

I have been involved in the administrative work of the First District Public Office since August 1st of last year. Later, the First and Second Districts were merged, and I continued to work until now. Not long ago, Mayor Chen, due to his busy schedule, appointed me to concurrently serve as the Director. Since last year, I have found it difficult to extricate myself from local administrative affairs. Recently, I was also appointed to concurrently serve as the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and I have transformed from an ordinary diplomat to a Shanghai local official. The duty of a local official is to serve the local area and to receive guidance from superior agencies and superior officials. Since I have agreed to take on this position, I will continue to serve according to this goal and assist Mayor Chen in completing the construction plan of Greater Shanghai.

However, Shanghai's society is complex, and Shanghai's position is important. Mr. Chen has already explained this in detail. In the future, I will handle general administration based on three major principles:

The most important thing in handling administration is the full cooperation between the local authorities of China and Japan to solve all problems. Regarding this point, anyone from the Allied side who has been in contact with me knows that I will first study each problem clearly with reason and then discuss it together. We discuss problems with a cool head and a warm heart, right is right, wrong is wrong, and we cooperate sincerely without shirking responsibility. I will definitely implement this spirit of sincere cooperation from beginning to end.

Shanghai society is composed of various aspects, the so-called combination of politics, economy, and culture, and cooperation from all aspects is essential. As Mr. Chen just said, politics is only one aspect of it. To promote the entire work, we rely on the close cooperation between the local people and the government. In this regard, I not only ask Mr. Wen Lanting, Minister Zhang Yipeng, and local seniors to provide guidance at any time, but also hope that the press will use written or written communications to urge the municipal administration to improve and reform, so that each problem can be paid attention to.

In addition to these two points, the most noteworthy aspects of administration are "unity" and "simplicity". How to turn disunity into unity and how to turn complexity into simplicity is also an important principle for handling administration.

Although I am a diplomat, I am not afraid of rhetoric. I only hope to be practical and progressive, taking one step at a time and doing one step at a time. I will serve Shanghai with my limited ability, and I would be very fortunate if I can make a slight contribution to the relationship between China and Japan.

Director Xiong's Speech

Gentlemen, I am very grateful for the reception held by the four organizations today. I have been ordered to serve as the Director of the Shanghai Security Bureau and the Director of the Clearing and Settling Affairs Bureau. These two positions have two names and two agencies, but in reality, they have only one task, which is to establish Shanghai's security. In other words, if the security team can be sound and the Clearing and Settling Affairs Bureau can be sound, Shanghai's security can be established. Otherwise, this goal cannot be achieved. Therefore, my responsibility is very heavy, and my ability is very weak. I am very worried about taking on such a heavy responsibility with such a weak ability.

When I took over this position, I expressed four opinions to my colleagues. First, in terms of personnel, we will absolutely handle matters based on talent. Second, in terms of finance, we will absolutely handle matters with an open attitude. Third, we will do our best to eliminate corruption in the future. Fourth, our colleagues must always consider the two words "the people". One and two are internal problems, and three and four are external problems. However, even if I have taken over, whether the security team is sound and the Clearing and Settling Affairs Bureau is sound is still a question. Because the security team is composed of various elements, their levels are inconsistent. Therefore, the only way to improve the security team is to first reform the current security team and second, to rebuild the security team.

Because China has always had a conscription system, the problem is not that the quality is poor, but that the service time is too long. At most, after serving for three years, they become activity leaders or platoon leaders. With this weakness, we must use a conscription system to re-select the security team. If we can get the cooperation of all sectors to recommend two thousand young people in their twenties in Shanghai, train them for half a year, and have them serve for half a year, then after one year, they can retire. Then we can recall the second batch and use the conscription system to transform the security team in order to achieve the goal of establishing security. Shanghai's security must be established by Shanghai people. Therefore, I believe that if we want to create a good security team, we must rebuild the security team using a conscription system.

Second, the most important part of the Clearing and Settling Affairs Bureau is the blockade management bureau. There are sixty or seventy inspection stations directly under the Clearing and Settling Affairs Bureau, with ten people in each station, totaling six or seven hundred people. However, the operating expenses of the inspection stations are very low. With an average distribution, it is naturally difficult to maintain a livelihood. Therefore, the Clearing and Settling Affairs Bureau is very worried about how to proceed with the blockade management bureau. I am a soldier, and I am not good at talking. Today, I would like to ask everyone present to change your welcoming hearts into hearts that urge and supervise us. In particular, I hope that the press can provide more criticism and supervision in terms of public opinion.

Chairman Funatsu's Speech

Today, the four organizations welcome the new Secretary-General Wu and Director Xiong. We have listened to your high-level speeches. Now, as a member of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Association, I would like to say a few words. Recently, there has been a lot of noise from all sides about promoting clean government. Clean government is needed by any country. The principle of integrity is self-evident, and there is no need to reiterate it. However, clean government is not a work of lip service; it must be put into practice. It is wrong to promote the name of integrity without actually practicing it. Furthermore, it is useless to sing about integrity and persuade people to be honest. We must practice what we preach. To give a realistic example, Minister Zhang, who is present, is a model official who practices what he preaches. If every official were as clean as Minister Zhang, then becoming a local official would be a humble statement. Secretary Wu's achievements during his tenure in the First District Public Office were already well-received by the people. One of the most satisfying things that the new government has done in the political field is to appoint Mr. Zhang Yipeng as the Minister of Justice and Mr. Wu Songgao as the Director of the First District Public Office and concurrently as the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government. Shanghai society is complex, with so-called people from all over the world living here. Therefore, the position of local official must be held by talented people. Now that Secretary Wu is using his outstanding diplomatic talents to handle local administration, he will surely achieve great things. I am deeply grateful for the future of Shanghai. As for Mr. Xiong Jiandong's appointment as the Director of the Security Bureau and concurrently as the Director of the Clearing and Settling Affairs Bureau, it is also a fitting and talented move. Mr. Xiong has already explained the significance of taking on this position clearly. In the past, I have also been involved in investigating and researching the security team for a long time, but due to difficulties in progress, despite many efforts, I have not achieved satisfactory results. In short, the security team must be well-trained in any case so that security can be maintained. Mr. Chen Binsu just said that Shanghai is the center of political, economic, and cultural affairs, so reforms should start in Shanghai. I agree with his opinion. Shanghai can play a leading role, and its actions can affect other places. Therefore, to revive all construction, we must first establish security. If security is not established, construction cannot be started. Therefore, establishing security is a prerequisite for everything. Since security is so important, the talents who are responsible for security must be carefully considered. This time, Mr. Xiong has been appointed to take on this role, which is truly a fitting and talented move, and I admire him very much. At the same time, this is also a manifestation of a sound personnel problem. Today, on the occasion of this welcoming meeting, we hope that Secretary Wu and Director Xiong will redouble their efforts in the future, do their best for the local area, and fulfill their mission.

The Domei News Agency has a long history and a large scale, and it is well-suited to undertake the task of spreading news between the Allied countries and reporting on the movements between the Allied countries, and it is worthy of the name "Domei". Today, we bid farewell to Mr. Iwamoto and welcome Mr. Sasaki at the same time. Both gentlemen are the backbone of the Domei News Agency, and we hope that the strength of both gentlemen will promote the alliance power of our press.

Director Iwamoto Delivers a Speech

I have served at the Domei News Agency for eighteen years. In the past two years, I have come to serve in China. I am very grateful for the guidance and cooperation of my Chinese press colleagues. Recently, I have been transferred back to the headquarters to serve. I am willing to always remember the experience and lessons I have learned in the past two years and continue to serve. At the same time, I hope to come to China again in the future to meet with you all.

Director Sasaki's Speech

I have served in China and Manchuria for over twenty years. This time, I have been ordered to come to Shanghai, and I am very pleased to have the opportunity to meet with the Shanghai press. In the future, I hope to have more guidance and support so that I can fulfill my duties. Due to the limited time today, I will simply state my wishes and hope to have your guidance.

### First Police Bureau Hosts Chiefs of All General Lianbao Yesterday; Holds Discussion Meeting

### Rice Control Association Encourages Purchases: Additional Material Coupons for Timely Deliveries

To ensure the food supply for civilians and the military, the Rice Control Association has been vigorously promoting the purchasing efforts by issuing material coupons. It is reported that the Association is now offering procurement merchants in all areas an additional 10% in material coupons (for a total of 30%) for those who deliver rice according to the purchase orders between February 23rd and April 10th, to encourage them. However, regarding how to deal with some procurement merchants who have already received loans but have failed to deliver rice according to the purchase orders, or even have not delivered a single grain of rice, the Association has not yet made any decisions. The reporter, therefore, specifically visited the Association to inquire in detail. The response was: "The standard for distributing materials by this Association is based on the purchase orders made by each procurement merchant. Those who delivered in full before February 23rd are given 20%. However, those who can deliver in full between February 23rd and April 10th will receive an additional 10%. This is to adapt to the objective environment and to encourage procurement. The situation has been quite good. Most of the procurement merchants in various areas have been able to deliver on schedule according to the orders, but there are also some who have only delivered a portion. The Association will strictly urge these procurement merchants to deliver. As for those who have not delivered a single grain of rice, the Association will immediately request the government's assistance to severely punish them without leniency."
