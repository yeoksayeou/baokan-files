### Contributing to the General Association of Commerce

There are two ways to control the economy: one is for the government to implement control through administrative power; the other is for the people to implement control with a spirit of self-governance. As far as our China is concerned, the current National General Association of Commerce is adopting the latter approach, with the private industrial and commercial sectors forming autonomous control organizations, and the government only playing a role of supervision and guidance.

In order for the control work based on the principle of self-governance by the people to achieve the benefits of control as expected, three conditions must be met: the first condition, which is also the most necessary, is "the morality of merchants." The so-called "spirit of self-governance" is based on moral concepts, because those who participate in commercial control work should in principle be purely business people. If they lack the moral concept of merchants, there is simply no spirit of self-governance to speak of. Without the spirit of self-governance, it is difficult to obtain the benefits of control. Moreover, control is still in its infancy in China, with no regulations to follow and unfamiliar to the public. Therefore, if handling is not done properly, it will not only be unprofitable but also easily lead to the opposite phenomenon of harming the people. Therefore, the morality of merchants is indeed the most fundamental condition for the current control work in our country. As for the content of merchant morality, the scope is very broad, and the most important thing is that under the wartime controlled economy, the public interest of the wartime state should come first, and the private interests of individuals or a few should come later.

The second condition is that those participating in control work should be limited to people from the industrial and commercial sectors. Since it is a commercial self-governing organization, it should of course be limited to merchants. If non-merchants participate, it is easy to gradually form a bureaucratic organization, which will inevitably lose the meaning of commercial self-governance. For example, rice control work should be undertaken by rice merchants, but in fact, many are not rice merchants, thus forming a bureaucratic organization. There are many phenomena that deviate far from reason in the measures taken, which make the rice problem increasingly serious, and it continues to deteriorate, like trying to untangle silk by adding more knots.

The third condition is that society should have the power of sanction. For the control work, if loopholes are discovered, or if there are unreasonable measures, and it is predicted that they will hinder the wartime economy and people's livelihood, society should exert its power to strictly criticize, correct, sanction, and eliminate obstacles, and promote rationalization. However, in the past, the power of social sanction has not been fully exerted. Although there have been some sanctions in public opinion, they have not been easily valued by the authorities and have not achieved the effect of sanction. For example, in the work of the Rice Control Association, there have been loopholes and various unreasonable measures in the past. Although various newspapers, especially this newspaper, have strictly criticized them, they have not been humbly adopted by the authorities in the end. The control work in the past, as a whole, it is no exaggeration to say that failures outweigh successes, especially the rice control work, which was a complete failure. Recently, the General Association of Commerce has been adjusted, and five committees have been set up under it to implement control work, while the Mountain General Association of Commerce reviews and supervises in terms of vertical organization and connects and integrates in terms of horizontal organization. We hope that the General Association of Commerce must exert its own power and responsibilities to the fullest, pay special attention to the spirit of commercial self-governance, and value the necessary conditions that should be possessed in the current stage of control work. At the same time, we would like to make the following suggestions regarding the actual work of the General Association of Commerce:

The five control committees under the General Association of Commerce, namely rice and grain, cotton, flour and wheat, oil and grain, and daily necessities, should be consistent in terms of organization, personnel, and facilities, and there should be no phenomenon of deviating from the General Association of Commerce and acting independently. The most urgent task at present is that the Rice Control Association should be reorganized as soon as possible and the winding up should be handled. After the reorganization is sound, it should focus all its efforts on preparing for the autumn harvest control plan, which should be complete, thorough, reasonable, and not repeat the mistakes of the past.

The yarn and cloth control work will be merged with the cotton control work, and the organization should be sound as soon as possible.

In the internal organization of the General Association of Commerce, there is a planning department, which can be said to be the nerve center of the General Association of Commerce, which is extremely important, and should absorb as many specialized talents as possible to undertake planning work. Among the commercial groups in Shanghai, there are many with decades of history, and there are many talents with rich experience and familiarity with commercial habits. The General Association of Commerce can extend invitations to borrow them. As for those who are eager to seek connections from various sources, they must not have appropriate talents, and should especially be rejected, so as to become a model commercial self-governing organization where everyone has talent and every talent is used, so that control becomes work that is beneficial to the wartime state and beneficial to the wartime people's livelihood.

### East Asia Literature Conference to Be Held in Nanjing

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The third conference of Greater East Asian writers was originally scheduled to be held in Nanjing, the capital of China, but was postponed due to various reasons. After consultation by the parties concerned, it is proposed to be held in Nanjing this autumn.

### Spokesman for the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry Talks, Urging Chongqing to Reflect as Soon as Possible

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The spokesman for the Greater East Asia Ministry made the following remarks to the press corps on the 7th: The imperial statement issued on the 5th has clearly stated that the goal of the current Chinese operation is to crush the ambitions of the United Kingdom and the United States to dominate Greater East Asia. The operation of the Japanese army has implied that the first priority is to block the counter-offensive of the Chongqing army. Once a good opportunity arises, it will launch a fierce offensive in the Pacific. At this critical moment, Chongqing should understand that it is a member of Asia, and that the United Kingdom and the United States are the common enemies of Greater East Asia. The Chongqing army is willing to be a lackey of British and American imperialism and is hesitant on the road of resistance. In the future after the war, China will still be unable to escape from being a semi-colony of the United Kingdom and the United States. The so-called "resistance to oppress the country" is actually "resistance to destroy the country" or "resistance to sell the country." The intellectuals within Chongqing are all worried about the future of China. It is quite questionable whether the United Kingdom and the United States will have the sincerity to fulfill the existing agreements after the war. A review of the history of British and American aggression against China will make it clear in a day. Looking at the cold and cruel self-interest situation of treating the exiled Western European regimes, it is very clear. The Chongqing elements must also have some concerns about this point. Whether China should be subordinate to the British and American world hegemony should be reflected upon again and again. Chongqing should deeply understand the historical lessons of the past, seriously understand the original intention of Greater East Asia's co-existence and co-prosperity, and reflect quickly.

### Lin Propaganda Director Broadcasts to Chongqing "Striving for an Active Way Out"

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - "To all officers and soldiers, comrades, and compatriots in Chongqing:

When I am about to open my mouth to talk to you on the radio, an uncontrollable emotion surges into my heart. Thinking of the situation in Pinghan and Yuehan, what I see in my eyes seems to be piles of old and new graves. What I hear in my ears seems to be With this mood, what else can I say? But I deeply know that your mood is no different from mine. After all, I have to say a few words.

In the Battle of Changsha, many officers and soldiers sacrificed. Among them were my classmates from middle school. He was a passionate young man and a general from Huangpu. In addition, there are many officers and soldiers that I know or do not know. Like him, they are passionate young people, and like him, they have sacrificed. Why did they have to sacrifice like this? For the United Kingdom and the United States? They are young people who have been tempered in the revolutionary climax. Anti-British and anti-Americanism has been his consistent ambition since he joined the revolutionary movement. Why sacrifice for the United Kingdom and the United States? For the Communist Party? They are young people who have shed blood and tears in the anti-communist struggle for the past fifteen or sixteen years. Why sacrifice for the Communist Party? For the motherland... (unclear telegraph code) The war of resistance that has changed its nature, the war of resistance that is manipulated and fooled. Only by cutting off the vitality of the nation-state can it no longer be delayed, but they have sacrificed after all. Why did they sacrifice in such an unclear way?

In March of this year, in an article entitled "Reiterating Our Position," I solemnly raised four questions. The first question, "What is the current situation forced by continuing to sacrifice in China as a battlefield? What are the hidden worries that it will cause in the future? Is it necessary to sacrifice in vain in the tragic situation of neither being able to fight nor being able to make peace?" Now, only three months later, the encounter has been encountered. The hidden worries have also deepened. What is the point of sacrificing in vain like this? We know that you have had some discussions about the situation on this issue. (two-character telegraph code unclear) Everyone will not fail to understand. What is worrying is the attitude of Japan, respecting our country's independence and autonomy in the "Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty." Whether every word can be realized without change. We have repeatedly explained this. Now that we see the statement of the Japanese government, "only to crush the ambitions of British and American aggression," "the Chongqing army can refuse to cooperate with the United Kingdom and the United States, and it is also recognized as a friend," what it seeks from our country is based on the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, respecting our country's independence and autonomy, in order to complete the permanent friendly relations in East Asia. Then we see the bulletin of the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army, which says, "Among the enemies attacked, it is the United Kingdom and the United States, not the general public." Then it says, "Your desire to return to your hometown is no different from the love of the Hunan people for their hometown. I believe that you are now on the Chinese battlefield. In order to complete the war, you must treat the Hunan villagers with the love of your own country and the love of your neighbors," and lists eight major precepts as the standard of action. Even for the people's supplies, equipment, shopping, currency, (one-character telegraph code unclear) corvée, etc., it does not hesitate to be cumbersome and impose strict restrictions. The true intention of the allied country Japan is even more clear and unmistakable here. This is the fundamental policy of the allied country Japan. Since the allied country Japan takes it upon itself to be the vanguard of defending East Asia and liberating East Asia, it will not change or destroy this fundamental policy. To be honest, on the Japanese side, it is also loving Japan and loving East Asia. It will not change or destroy this policy. On the Chinese side, it is also loving China and loving East Asia. It will definitely not want this policy to be changed or destroyed. To change, to destroy, and to make it change history and destroy it every day, there are only the extremely evil British and American imperialists who want to enslave China, separate China and Japan, and dismember East Asia, and their crazed special forces. Perhaps some people say that since you are our friends and have signed an alliance treaty with us, why do you have to (three-character telegraph code unclear) Then we cannot help but ask in return, why did Chongqing not accept this policy, promote peace, and complete reunification when we signed the alliance treaty, so that Japan's real enemy could no longer use China's territory as its battlefield and provide its sacrifices, so that Japan could use its military force in the Pacific to fight a decisive battle with the United States, but instead willingly accepted the various instigations of the Menlo Park Conference and created today's tragedy. Alas, the past is already in the past, and there is no need to mention it anymore. After today, what will happen? (To be continued)

### Ministry of Finance Instructs Silver and Money Businesses to Be Cautious in Lending Purposes, Soaring Gold Prices Are Due to Manipulation

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - The recent soaring gold prices in Beijing and Shanghai have affected commodity prices, which is of great importance to people's livelihood. The reporter specially visited the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance for this matter, and was told the following: The recent skyrocketing gold prices in Beijing and Shanghai have made various commodity prices the center of expansion and contraction in the gold market, thus causing major adverse effects. According to investigations, it is due to the fact that powerful speculators in Beijing and Shanghai have manipulated the gold market, which is the biggest reason. This has created the recent unstable state of soaring gold prices, indirectly affecting the people's livelihood, which is of great importance. Although most of the silver and money houses in various places handle their business in accordance with the law, there are not a few who disregard national laws and seek huge profits. In view of this, the Ministry hereby reiterates its previous order and has separately instructed the Silver and Money Business Associations of Beijing and Shanghai to instruct their members to handle loan business in the future in accordance with the various provisions of the previously promulgated laws and regulations, and to handle it carefully. It is necessary to strictly review whether the purpose is proper. If it is found that the funds are used for speculation in violation of regulations, they will be severely punished and no leniency will be shown. At the same time, the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank was ordered to strictly investigate, and various financial institutions were ordered to follow the correct track in handling loan business, so as to eliminate speculation, suppress commodity prices, and stabilize people's livelihood.

### Japanese Military Operations Deeply Imbued with Political Significance: Japanese Forces in South China Capture Qingyuan

Central News Agency dispatch from a certain Japanese military base on the Hunan front, dated the 7th: The scale and vigor of the current mainland operations launched in North China, Central China, and South China are unprecedented in the history of mainland warfare, differing greatly from previous operations. First, since January of last year, when the Japanese military implemented its new China policy, the Japanese China Expeditionary Force has clearly demonstrated its true colors in these operations. Judging from their combat actions, these operations contain significant political implications, fundamentally different from the nature of past warfare. Second, the Japanese military in mainland China still maintains a strong force. Hu Zongnan's most elite troops of the Chongqing regime have consistently avoided confronting the Japanese military. Furthermore, Tang Enbo's troops have been fearful of Japanese attacks since the incident, often concealing their main forces. This time, they were completely surrounded and annihilated by the Japanese military. From any perspective, the results achieved are the highest record in the history of mainland warfare. The Japanese military's swift capture of Changsha and Liling on the Hunan front is also rare in the history of mainland operations. Third, purely strategic operations, combined with the Japanese military's discipline and precision, have resulted in the continuous success of the Japanese military. The intent of the operations is to connect with the people in the resistance areas, so that every action of the Japanese soldiers is perceived as realizing the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty. The Japanese government issued a statement on the 5th, stating that the Japanese frontline soldiers fundamentally regard the Chinese people as friends, and will not treat the Chongqing troops as enemies unless they cooperate with Britain and the United States. The Sino-Japanese conflict has been ongoing for seven years, and the nature of mainland warfare has been completely transformed, carrying profound significance.

Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, dated the 7th: According to the Chongqing military authorities, the situation in Hunan is as follows: Fierce fighting continues in Hengyang. The intensity of the battle reached its peak within the twenty hours from the afternoon of the 4th to noon on the 5th, and fierce fighting continues. The Chongqing troops are exerting all efforts to counterattack along the Hengyang defense line, and intense battles are currently underway near Yongfeng.

Central News Agency dispatch from Guangzhou, dated the 7th: The Japanese Southern China Expeditionary Force captured Qingyuan County on the 3rd, completely clearing out the remaining defeated Chongqing troops. As of now, the confirmed results of the Japanese military's operations are as follows: 135 Chongqing soldiers killed, and 41 captured. In addition, the Japanese military seized two Chongqing army flat-trajectory guns, 120 flat-trajectory gun shells, four light machine guns, 49 rifles, 920 rifle bullets, and countless other military supplies.

American Aircraft Adopt Guerrilla Tactics

Central News Agency dispatch from a certain Japanese military base on the front line, dated the 7th: After the Japanese military launched operations in various parts of China, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing lost its southwest air bases and was forced to retreat inland. Under these circumstances, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing had no choice but to abandon its tactics of white-day air raids and adopt rear-area guerrilla tactics, specializing in disrupting Japanese maritime transportation routes at night and carrying out indiscriminate bombings. According to recent news, the Chongqing side has opened surveillance caves to build an airfield and radio wave weapons room in Guilin. Several American technicians are stationed in this weapons room, reporting the time of departure, direction, angle, and distance of Japanese aircraft one by one using electrical currents. According to recent news from a downed enemy aircraft, U.S. reconnaissance aircraft are also equipped with radio wave reflectors to detect the movements of Japanese aircraft. Through the organized use of the above functions, they can immediately understand the situation of nearby Japanese bases, as well as the takeoff and landing of Japanese aircraft, and seize the opportunity for attack. In addition, in order to detect the situation of ships sailing at sea, they also dispatch reconnaissance aircraft and submarines equipped with reflectors, as well as civilian ships equipped with wireless radios, distributing them along the Chinese coast to carry out radio wave communication missions, waiting for opportunities to disrupt the rear. However, the superior equipment of the Japanese side is sufficient to surpass the Chongqing side. When Chongqing aircraft approach, Japanese aircraft can quickly adopt an interception posture in a short period of time, and can also quickly detect the movements of Chongqing bases, and can use radio wave warfare to surprise the air force stationed in Chongqing, achieving glorious victories.

Japanese Military's Comprehensive Combat Results for Half a Year

Central News Agency dispatch from a certain Japanese military base on the front line, dated the 7th: Since the beginning of this year, the Japanese military has launched sweeping operations everywhere, so the attempt of the Chongqing and Communist forces to launch a general counteroffensive has become a pipe dream. The comprehensive combat results for the first half of this year are recorded as follows: 400 engagements, 89,587 Chongqing and Communist troops killed or captured, destroyed facilities including 9 arsenals, 2 food warehouses and clothing factories, 2 textile factories, and 1 district government office. 5,404 bodies left behind, and 947 captured. Captured 2 mortars, 4 light mortars, 133 rounds of ammunition, 2 automatic rifles, 24 Czech-style light machine guns, 2,633 rifles, 15,561 rounds of ammunition, and 134 landmines. Moreover, if the above combat results are compared with the same period last year, the number of engagements and the number of bodies left behind have doubled. This is sufficient to show that the Japanese military's operations are active and the Chongqing and Communist resistance forces are declining daily.

### Philippine Statement Refutes and Accuses American Ambitions

Central News Agency dispatch from Manila, dated the 7th: On June 30th, Roosevelt signed the resolution of Congress authorizing Philippine independence. In response, the Philippine Presidential Office issued the following rebuttal statement on the 6th, severely criticizing American ambitions. The main points of the statement are as follows: Although the United States claims to grant the Philippines independence, any laws or contracts made by the United States today, when the Philippine people have already declared independence, are of no avail. Moreover, to make the restoration of government institutions and the provision of land, sea, and air force bases as conditions, this is nothing more than an attempt to conquer the Philippines again and make the Philippines a battlefield. The Philippine people not only ignore this issue but are also dumbfounded by the shamelessness and incompetence of the United States. The Philippines cooperates with its ally Japan and has the responsibility to complete this great war. The people of the whole country will never succumb to any deception or threat.

### Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association Holds a Meeting of Representatives: Focus on Current Affairs Issues

The general intention of the meeting of representatives is that, under the current situation, the country should establish a unified system, and the Imperial Rule Assistance Association must strive to achieve it.

Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, dated the 7th: German News Agency reports: Military sources state that the American troops in the Cotentin Peninsula launched a particularly fierce offensive from day and night on Thursday, attempting to launch a decisive breakthrough against the German defense line with various combat methods. Attacks on the Villedmond-Montebourg-La Haye-du-Puits railway junction remain the focus of the war. The American troops continued to reinforce, and their offensive only reduced its intensity until midnight. The German army secured all major positions in the defensive and counter-offensive battles, and the American army was annihilated in large numbers, forcing them to withdraw part of their forces during the battle and replace them with reserves.

### Kluge's Military Achievements are Remarkable

Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, dated the 7th: The newly appointed Supreme Commander of the German Army in Western Europe, Marshal Kluge, established his military achievements in the battle of breaking through France at the beginning of the summer of 1940. In 1941, he moved to the Eastern Front and fully demonstrated his instinct as a mechanization tactician in the large-scale encirclement and annihilation battles against the Soviet army in Minsk and Smolensk. Furthermore, during the Soviet summer offensive last year, he severely damaged the Soviet army and orderly withdrew from the bulge formed by the Soviet army.

Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, dated the 7th: German News Agency reports: On the Eastern Front, fighting has spread to Kovel, Plock, and Tarnopol on Thursday. The Soviet army has advanced towards the German front line in many places. West of Kovel, the Soviet army fought with strong forces supported by tanks, but all attacks were repelled and suffered heavy losses. The fierce fighting in the central region is still taking place in the southeast and northeast of Baranowicz and Vilnius. The Soviet army has repeatedly intensified its artillery preparations, attempting to cross the Dvina River, but was defeated by the German army. The Soviet army's repeated attempts to break through in Plock also failed.

### Four-Nation Anti-Axis Conference Postponed

Central News Agency dispatch from Amsterdam, dated the 7th: German News Agency reports: Washington sources state that U.S. Secretary of State Hull announced at a press conference yesterday that the Soviet government has not expressed its attitude towards the U.S. government's proposal to hold a four-nation conference to discuss post-war international security organizations, so the holding of the conference has been postponed.

Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, dated the 7th: Transocean News Agency reports: The British Daily Mail claims: American political figures say that the international monetary conference currently being held in Bretton Woods has no achievements, and Congress will not adopt an international monetary plan or approve an agreement on post-war economic policies under any circumstances. Both American writing pens recognize that the United States may join an international organization after the war, but it does not include organizations such as the international police force or the world court.

### Turkish Cabinet Meeting

Central News Agency dispatch from Istanbul, dated the 7th: German News Agency reports: The Turkish cabinet held a meeting on Thursday afternoon under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Saraçoğlu.

### American Air Force Uses Winged Gliding Bombs

Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, dated the 7th: Transocean News Agency reports: A German official revealed that the American Air Force used unmanned winged bombs during the attack on Cologne on May 28 and the attack on Hamburg on June 18. These bombs are remotely launched by fighter-bombers towards the target, and their flight towards the target resembles a glider. The German military assesses that this bomb has no aiming device, and its accuracy is far inferior to that of the Meteor bomb.

### Churchill Acknowledges the Power of the Meteor Bomb and Urges Londoners to Evacuate

Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, dated the 7th: According to a London dispatch: Churchill stated in the House of Commons on the 6th regarding the German attacks on Britain with Meteor bombs that it would be a mistake for us to underestimate this special attack method today, so the British government has never taken it lightly. If the anti-Axis forces did not bomb France, the German Meteor bomb attacks on London would have been fiercely launched six months ago. As of 6 a.m. on the 6th, the German army had launched 2,754 Meteor bombs, and British casualties totaled 2,752 people. All aspects of the situation in Britain must be suitable for military operations plans. Britain cannot allow any discord to occur in the Normandy operations and attacks on special German targets. London must not be conquered by the German army.

Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, dated the 7th: According to a London dispatch: In view of the increasing threat of Meteor bombs, British Prime Minister Churchill has advised citizens without special missions to evacuate London immediately, and has also opened air-raid shelters previously forbidden to the public.

New Weapons Attacking Britain Will Become More Intensive

Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, dated the 7th: On the 6th, German military experts refuted British Prime Minister Churchill's report in the House of Commons on the bombing of Meteor bombs, saying that the figures released by Churchill in his speech were completely incorrect and did not correspond to the truth. The number of Meteor bombs launched by the German army against Britain to date cannot be released due to military secrets, but it is definitely more than the 2,000 or so bombs reported by Churchill. Churchill also said that the average weight of a Meteor bomb is one ton, which is also incorrect. Its weight already exceeds one ton. It is also unbelievable to say that an average weight of one ton, a one-ton bomb can only kill one person. The German people, who have been heavily bombed, already know the power of a one-ton bomb. The bombing of Meteor bombs has not yet entered the proper stage, and the performance of the shells is improving daily. In the future, London and southern England will be bombed even more like rain. The first goal is to bomb British military areas within a short period of time, and its weight is the same as the bombs dropped on Germany and allied countries by the anti-Axis forces.

### Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Visits Bulgarian Authorities

Central News Agency dispatch from Sofia, dated the 7th: Transocean News Agency reports: Soviet Chargé d'Affaires to Bulgaria, Kirsanov, visited Bulgarian Prime Minister Bagrianov and yesterday visited Foreign Minister Draganov again. Soviet Ambassador Lavrishchev is still in Moscow.

### A Report About Mr. Chen Youren

— Li Weichen

I.

Three days after Mr. Chen Youren's death, just as the cremation ceremony had concluded and I began to feel a deep sense of sorrow, lingering and reluctant to leave the Jing'an Temple cemetery, some friends advised me to write an article about Mr. Chen's thoughts and actions. At that moment, a wisp of white smoke was slowly rising from the chimney of the crematorium, dispersing with the wind. I looked up at the sky, grieving for the deceased, my heart surging with a mix of emotions, thinking about the cycles of formation, existence, destruction, and emptiness, and how all thoughts vanish like smoke. Life is like a dream, like smoke, so what is there to say!

A few days later, my friends continued their earlier proposal. At the same time, other friends urged me to collect articles and compile them into a book as a memorial to Mr. Chen. They said, "The death of a figure like Mr. Chen should be a grand occasion, not the lonely affair it is now." I could not agree with this view. After a storm, there is silence. What is the point of needlessly stirring up trouble and deliberately creating a clamorous spectacle, just to make "the mourners rejoice"?

Recently, however, several of Mr. Chen's close friends and Mrs. Chen, in her grief, have also pressed me to write an article. They had heard some very inaccurate rumors about Mr. Chen and wanted me to issue a statement and explain Mr. Chen's words, deeds, and thoughts over the past two or three years, to prevent unscrupulous people from seizing upon them and exploiting them. One rumor they heard suggested that Mr. Chen's death was not normal. This was a harmless piece of gossip. Another rumor claimed that some people were invoking Mr. Chen's name to spread falsehoods, claiming that Mr. Chen had a "strategy for restoring order and governing the country," which he had entrusted to them before his death, tasking them with forming an organization and carrying out activities according to this brilliant plan. This was a useful fabrication. Mrs. Chen was particularly anxious about this matter and wrote me the following letter a few days ago: "Mr. Li:

You were my husband's friend and colleague for the last seven years, and I believe you understand him fully. I authorize you to deny and refute any inaccurate publicity regarding his reputation or facts. If you deem it necessary, you may clarify or explain his words, actions, and thoughts. I will provide all materials for your reference. You have always been regarded as a 'political heretic,' and I believe only a 'heretic' dares to offend people for the sake of truth. Chen Zhang Liying, June 23rd."

For the past two or three years, I had resolved not to write articles. This letter, however, forced me to break my vow. But I always believed that there was no need to argue with those unscrupulous people. Only the most incompetent and pitiable people would try to elevate themselves by attaching themselves to the dead. "A god is a god, and a ghost is a ghost. A clown dressed in imperial robes will never be revered as an emperor." Therefore, in this article, I will simply present the facts of Mr. Chen's later years as truthfully and objectively as possible. If I cannot paint a lifelike portrait of Mr. Chen in his later years, it may be due to unfavorable lighting and surroundings in the studio, or perhaps my understanding is insufficient, or my skills are too poor. I apologize in advance to Mrs. Chen, Mr. Chen's friends, and the nation for this.

II.

Because some believe that Mr. Chen's death was not normal, I should take responsibility for dispelling this unnecessary misunderstanding. At the same time, to help friends of Mr. Chen in various places understand his condition during his illness and at the time of his death, I should first provide a brief report on the changes in Mr. Chen's health in recent years, the course of his illness, and the circumstances at the time of his passing.

The public's impression of Mr. Chen is that he was no more than fifty years old, and they cannot imagine him growing old. This is due to Mr. Chen's progressive ideas, his passionate and challenging speeches, and his youthful courage and indomitable revolutionary spirit. Moreover, his demeanor did not resemble that of an aging person. Even in the stillness of death, his solemn, serene expression still made people feel that he was active, dynamic, and forward-looking. But he was already sixty-nine years old, or seventy by the traditional count, the age of "rare antiquity."

Mr. Chen's spirit was always strong, and he never seemed weary from reading, writing, thinking, and talking all day long. When he returned from Europe in 1938, full of blood and sincerity, to rush to the nation's aid, his physique was particularly robust. But by the end of October, when Guangzhou and Wuhan fell in quick succession, we would meet every evening after nine o'clock, under a dim light, and ponder together. In that short week, he aged! The muscles in his face tightened! The wrinkles deepened! And his hairline turned gray! From then on, his body gradually thinned. Worry can hurt people, needless to say.

But Mr. Chen was still not ill. In the ten years or so before the outbreak of the Pacific War, he could be said to have never been sick. But the war environment eventually affected his health.

The "beginning" was very subtle. It was on the evening of December 21st or 22nd, in the freezing cold, amidst the smoke and the air raid bombardments of Hong Kong. At that time, fuel was undoubtedly scarce, and hot water was certainly unavailable. His love of cleanliness, however, drove him to take a cold shower, and as a result, he caught a cold. Soon after, Hong Kong fell, and he was sent to the Hong Kong Hotel, where he lived in confinement, suffering from both illness and anxiety. This was the beginning of the change in his health.

I often think that the Japanese military authorities were quite lenient to those sent to live at the Hong Kong Hotel. If Mr. Chen had requested medical attention, the guards would surely have allowed it. But Mr. Chen's character was such that he never asked for favors, so he did not make a request at the time, and allowed his illness to develop naturally. On March 25th or 26th of the following year, I stayed at the Hong Kong Hotel for two days and, with the permission of the manager, was able to meet with Mr. Chen. After not seeing each other for four months, with no certainty of life or death, this meeting was naturally filled with both joy and sorrow, and at first we were almost speechless. I still remember that Mr. Chen was dressed neatly that day, his spirits were good, and his manner was very peaceful, but he was thinner! Older! His beard and hair were sparse! And completely white! We talked for a long time that day, and he told me everything that had happened and the policies he had decided on. Before parting, he also dictated his will.

At the end of April, we came to Shanghai. During the summer and autumn, Mr. Chen's health seemed to recover somewhat. But in the winter, due to the lack of a stove, he caught a cold again, and relapsed repeatedly. His body's resistance was inevitably weakened. In addition, in March of last year, due to some kind of provocation, he felt wronged, and became even more indignant, and grew even thinner. But his warrior spirit still supported him, so that people did not feel the weakness of his body.

Speaking of the course of his final illness, it was initially related to catching a cold. Because the cold reduced his resistance, other illnesses were able to take advantage and develop. Since the end of last year, he had caught several colds, but he recovered each time. He always thought he was better, but his temperature was still one or two degrees above normal. He only felt a little tired, which did not hinder his reading and research.

At the beginning of April, his temperature was still around 99 degrees Fahrenheit. After various medical examinations, and the diagnosis and research of many specialized physicians, it was determined that he was suffering from tuberculous peritonitis in its early stages of development. After about twenty days, the tuberculosis bacteria spread to the pleura. But thanks to the treatment of the physicians, by around May 10th, the peritonitis and pleurisy had subsided, his abdomen had shrunk, his fever had gone down, and his white blood cell count had increased from 4,000 to 6,000, and his red blood cell count had increased from 3.5 million to 5 million. Everything proved that his illness was clearly on the road to recovery. I still remember Mr. Chen stroking his abdomen at the time, expressing satisfaction and relief.

But a day later, unfortunately, there was a new change. Mr. Chen suddenly suffered from neurasthenia. At first, the doctors were quite concerned that his meninges had been affected, or that the tuberculosis bacteria had spread to his brain. After a detailed examination by specialists, these concerns proved to be unfounded; his entire brain was normal. Apart from often expressing a sleepy but unable to sleep state, Mr. Chen really did not feel uncomfortable at that time. Sometimes, he loved to talk, and he talked with extraordinary enthusiasm, speaking eloquently about the problems of our country after the war.

After the 16th, the changes became more noticeable. Mr. Chen did not talk much and seemed indifferent to everything. Occasionally, he would smile, as if trying to comfort Mrs. Chen and say a few words. But what he said was always in French, not English.

Mr. Chen's pulse was usually faster than most people's, but his heart was very strong. Unexpectedly, on the 18th, his heart suddenly changed. On that day, he seemed very restless, always sleepy, but unable to fall asleep easily. It was not until 2:15 a.m. on the 19th that he fell asleep, and it was a deep sleep. Little did we know that this was the last time Mr. Chen would sleep peacefully in this world!

The above is the course of Mr. Chen's illness.

Now I should report on the circumstances of his passing. With a thousand emotions difficult to chase after the person has departed, I can only suppress my feelings and offer a brief recollection, starting from the afternoon of the 19th.

As mentioned above, Mr. Chen was sleeping soundly. Therefore, Mrs. Chen did not want to disturb him and waited until after noon before trying to wake him up to drink some broth that had been prepared. She called him several times, but Mr. Chen remained asleep and did not wake up. At that time, Mrs. Chen began to show worry and anxiety, but she still could not imagine that her husband would sleep soundly forever.

Around four or five o'clock, Mr. Yan Junren came to visit him. He talked with Mrs. Chen for a long time and seemed to give Mrs. Chen a lot of comfort and encouragement. But when leaving in the garden, he solemnly said to me, "Mr. Chen is an old friend. If there is anything I need to help with, please do not hesitate to notify me at any time." His words revealed the truth and made me immediately feel that Mr. Chen's final moment was approaching. The sadness of my mood at that time goes without saying, but I was still hoping and unwilling to despair.

That afternoon, Mr. Chen's pulse was already not good. But the nurse hid the truth from Mrs. Chen and only reported the actual situation to the doctor. And the doctor spoke very cautiously after the consultation, probably not wanting to increase Mrs. Chen's worry and anxiety.

Around ten o'clock in the evening, Mr. Huang Hanyang received a report from the doctor and immediately arrived. He gently said to me, "I'm afraid it's not good." But he and I both lacked the courage to tell Mrs. Chen this news.

Around eleven o'clock, Doctors Huang Yihui, Lin Zhaoyi, and Wu Xudan all came. They examined him a lot, discussed it for a long time, and then decided to administer an injection. Later, they discussed again, and finally announced to Mr. Huang Hanyang and me: "Mr. Chen is gradually sinking." But we still couldn't muster the courage to tell Mrs. Chen this.

Around one o'clock, Dr. Lin and Dr. Wu left, but Dr. Huang stayed. He said to us sadly, "Now it's a matter of two or three hours." At that time, Mrs. Chen happened to walk into the study from the bedroom next door where Mr. Chen's sickbed was located. Dr. Huang had no choice but to announce to her: "Now it depends on Mr. Chen himself." The despairing sadness seemed to make the air heavy in an instant, and everyone's breathing suffocated.

But since things had come to this, Mr. Huang Hanliang suggested that I notify Mrs. Chen's sister, Ms. Zhang Yunying. It was necessary to have a relative accompany Mrs. Chen in the face of the impending grief. Around two o'clock, Ms. Zhang Yunying and her husband, Mr. Chen Shuwu, arrived. Mr. Yoshida Tosuke also came. Why did I notify this Mr. Yoshida? Because he was the one who had been ordered two years ago to accompany Mr. Chen from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Over the past two years, he had always expressed sincere admiration for Mr. Chen, and in fact had often provided unexpected help. I believe his heart understood Mr. Chen.

From about nine o'clock that evening, Mr. Chen, although asleep, coughed several times every twenty or thirty minutes. And these coughs gave Mrs. Chen great comfort and hope. She always thought her husband was about to wake up. Little did she know that these were Mr. Chen's farewell "gentle coughs" to the world.

After one o'clock, Mr. Chen's breathing gradually became labored. Soon it gradually became thin. At 2:15, his pulse was almost stopped. After repeated injections by Dr. Huang, his breathing gradually and intermittently recovered. But soon it became thin again. Finally, at 3:05, while Mrs. Chen stroked him and weakly called out to him, this progressive, dynamic, resolute and indomitable revolutionary warrior quietly and solemnly passed away.

"Destiny is cruel"! In that instant, I had no tears, and only muttered this sentence.

But I must also report that during Mr. Chen's final illness, from the onset to his death, he never groaned. Whether he had no pain at all or had some pain, I have no way of knowing. But what I do know is that he refused to receive help from others and did not want to make others sad. Even if he was in pain, he always endured it.

As for the doctors who consulted on Mr. Chen's illness, in addition to the ones mentioned above, there were also Doctors Zhou Chengxu, Diao Xinde, and O'Pu'er. They, like Doctor Wu Xudan, were invited to study and treat Mr. Chen's illness. I can say with certainty that all the doctors have done their best, both in contributing opinions and in administering treatment. The passing of a person is sometimes beyond the power of human effort, alas! (To be continued)

### Seventh Air Defense Day Tomorrow: Air Defense Training and Announcement of Planned Activities by the Air Defense Headquarters

According to an announcement by the Shanghai Special Municipality Citizen Air Defense Headquarters, in addition to various air defense drills on the seventh Air Defense Day on July 9th this year, the sound and traffic control regulations stipulated in Announcement No. 24 of the Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Command must be strictly enforced. Three training alert alarms will be issued on that day, and sirens will be sounded three times at the specified times. The alarm times are as follows:

First time: 10:00 AM to 10:30 AM.

Second time: 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM.

Third time: 9:00 PM to 10:30 PM.

During the first and second alarm periods, all vehicles must be strictly controlled, and they should be parked in locations that do not obstruct traffic. Pedestrians should be guided to stand quietly on both sides of the road. Traffic will only be resumed after vehicles and pedestrians have come to a complete standstill for five minutes. Motor vehicles may proceed at speeds not exceeding 20 kilometers per hour, and other vehicles and pedestrians may also continue to advance within the limits that do not hinder air defense work. Drivers of all motor vehicles are urged to pay special attention and refrain from excessive use of horns during training alert periods unless absolutely necessary. During the third alarm period, in addition to conducting other air defense drills, special attention will be paid to light control. During this time, from 9:00 PM to 10:30 PM, all streetlights will be turned off. In addition, the lights of bicycles, rickshaws, and other vehicles will also be strictly controlled. On that day, military authorities will be consulted to inspect whether the horns and headlights on automobiles are too powerful during alerts, and adjustments will be made accordingly.

Planned Activities

The activities planned by the authorities to be held on that day are detailed as follows: 1. Training alert alarm issuance time and cancellation time:

(The alarm issuance time and cancellation time will be conveyed by sounding sirens.)

Category Alert Alarm Issuance Time Alert Alarm Cancellation Time

First time 10:00 AM 10:30 AM

Second time 3:00 PM 3:30 PM

Third time 9:00 PM 10:30 PM

Major training matters when the first and second training alert alarms are issued:

(A) All vehicles should be ordered to park in locations that do not obstruct traffic. (B) Pedestrians should be ordered to stop and stand on both sides of the road. (C) Only after vehicles and pedestrians have stopped completely for five minutes will traffic be reopened. During the training alert alarm issuance time, the speed of automobiles and other vehicles should be below 20 kilometers per hour. Other vehicles and pedestrians will be allowed to proceed in order within the scope that does not obstruct traffic. (D) During the training alarm issuance time, the arbitrary use of car and motorcycle horns should be strictly prohibited, except under unavoidable circumstances.

Implementation of Light Control

Major training matters when the third training alert alarm is issued:

(A) The same training as when the first and second alarms are issued should be implemented. (B) Light control will be implemented throughout the city from 9:00 PM to 10:30 PM, and streetlights will be turned off during this time. (C) Crackdown on light control for all types of vehicles. During previous alert alarms, many bicycles, rickshaws, and cargo vehicles did not have their lights on, and there were also many cases where the dimming and shielding equipment were not properly installed, and lights were only turned off after being pointed out by police officers and Baojia personnel. Therefore, the guidance personnel should instruct all vehicle owners to install dimming and shielding equipment properly, and instruct them to turn on the lights. However, when an air raid alarm is issued, the lights must be turned off. (D) During the alarm issuance, the shielding and dimming devices of flashlights should be strictly controlled to ensure thoroughness.

Sound and Traffic Control

2. On that day, with the assistance of the military, inspections will be carried out to check the warning devices (horns) and adjustment devices of various motor vehicles (automobiles, etc.), and the presence or absence of light shielding equipment. Special crackdown teams will be assigned to various locations in the city to ensure thorough sound control and light control. 3. The Baojia self-defense organization should be used to guide all citizens to strictly implement "keep to the left." 4. Attention should be paid at all times to check whether open-air stalls are obstructing traffic and whether the night-time light shielding equipment is in good condition, and crackdown should be implemented. 5. Comprehensive air defense training. In addition to the aforementioned training and crackdown matters, each sub-bureau should carefully implement comprehensive air defense training based on the actual conditions of its jurisdiction. 6. When implementing training on this Air Defense Day, all air defense measures suitable for actual combat should be adopted, so as to achieve satisfactory results.

Air Defense Headquarters Announcement

According to another announcement issued by the Shanghai Special Municipality Citizen Air Defense Headquarters: Regarding air defense training, after an alert alarm is issued, traffic should be temporarily stopped for five minutes as in the past. After five minutes, cars and pedestrians will still be allowed to move, but it should be on the principle of not hindering traffic. After an air raid alarm is issued, all vehicles must be completely stopped and parked in locations that do not obstruct traffic. At the same time, pedestrians should immediately disperse and seek nearby shelters for ten minutes. Afterwards, if the situation permits, pedestrian traffic should be restored. During air raid alarms, every effort should be made to avoid crowds gathering on the roads.

### Citizens Should Pay Close Attention To Light Control

Regarding the enemy's recent base and contemptible movements toward the peaceful area by the air force in Chongqing, the press division of the Japanese Fleet in Shanghai, at the joint press conference between the army and navy yesterday afternoon, deeply hoped that the people of Shanghai would strictly control lights and responsibly protect the iron wall mission of the Greater Shanghai city. The light control facilities and knowledge of air defense control were explained in detail again. The details are as follows.

Reasons for Air Defense

We can classify the enemy's attempts to carry out air raids as for the following reasons:

Our enemy, the United States, in order to avoid the fate of having their air bases in mainland China destroyed, is attempting to disrupt the peace in Shanghai. Therefore, the Shanghai air defense authorities, in view of this, have repeatedly issued announcements regarding air defense and air defense explanations to guide citizens. This is to protect the lives and property of citizens, and the Citizen Air Defense Headquarters is also making every effort to guide citizens, but it has not yet reached a fully complete state. If citizens lack air defense knowledge, they will certainly suffer great casualties and losses in the event of an enemy air raid, which is an obvious fact. Therefore, air defense is to defend oneself, and striving for air defense throughout Shanghai is the responsibility of defending Shanghai.

Strictly Prevent Light Leaks

The Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Authorities in this city issued an important announcement yesterday (the 8th) to further warn citizens who are completely indifferent to air defense. The content is that anyone who still leaks light when an air raid alarm is issued will be severely punished in accordance with military law. Checking that no light is leaking when an alarm is issued is the easiest and most convenient thing to do, and it is also the most important task. According to enemy aircraft, light is the only target in the darkness. Therefore, any house with light leaks will be bombed by the enemy, and the surrounding area will also be implicated. The people of Shanghai should pay close attention to this point. The past enemy bombing situation is detailed below for reference. Before enemy aircraft drop bombs, they do not have a fixed target, and they cannot distinguish the importance of the area, that is, they use light as the goal, so we should avoid light leaks as the most urgent task.

Pay Close Attention

According to the current Shanghai alert training, the houses along both sides of the road are still good. However, in each household with gaps in the houses, they think that the light is invisible, and they still turn on electric lights. Although no leaks can be seen on the ground, the light is very obvious on the roof. It is even clearer when viewed from the air, so these households are still concealing and deceiving themselves, and the jurisdictional guidance agencies and self-defense groups consider them to have bad intentions. Therefore, in the future, more attention should be paid to light leaks and light leaks, and those who violate the rules when light control is incomplete will be punished by power outages and severely punished in accordance with military law. I hope the citizens will pay extra attention.

### Rice Prices Soar: Authorities Thoroughly Investigate Manipulation, Deeply Hope Citizens Will Not Be Used

Since the Rice Control Committee followed the regulations of the "Temporary Measures for Rice for Citizens in Beijing and Shanghai" and the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Rice for Citizens in Shanghai" and announced the method of requisitioning rice, which has been implemented since July 1st, the price of rice in this city has suddenly risen again, causing panic. The reporter visited the Rice Control Committee and was told, "Recently, after the implementation of the requisitioning method, the price of rice soared, and most people attribute it to the implementation of the requisitioning and its excessively low price. However, according to actual price statistics, the total amount of requisitioning from July 1st to 4th was very small. No matter how low the requisitioning price is, if there are no unscrupulous merchants using general psychology to take the opportunity to manipulate prices, how could it affect the price of rice so greatly? In addition to strictly investigating and cracking down on unscrupulous merchants who manipulate rice prices, we deeply hope that the general public will trust the government's established policies and all its measures, and do not disturb themselves needlessly and be used by unscrupulous merchants, then the price of rice can be stabilized."

### Nanshi Intensifies Air Defense Exercises

The Second Police Headquarters of this city, in order to promote thorough air defense in the entire Nanshi area, intensify training of self-defense corps members, and suppress local terrorist incidents, has successively implemented air defense and terrorism drills. The details of each situation are recorded below. Those who violate the lighting control will be punished, and the supply of electricity will be stopped. Therefore, last night, during the police siren, all lights in the area were extinguished, making it more complete than in the past. Yesterday, under the supervision of the Air Defense Headquarters of the Second Police Headquarters, the three police stations in the Nanshi area successively launched air defense exercises. The traffic, fire extinguishing, and rescue work were all directed by the respective police stations. As a result, significant progress has been made in both action and technique. The Yimiao Police Station of Nanshi City also started at 6 p.m. yesterday in Yimiao and ended the drill, and traffic was restored immediately.

### Taishan District Terrorism Drill

The Taishan District held a large-scale terrorism drill at the entrance of the Daxing Road Grand Theater at 3 p.m. yesterday (the 7th). Three simulated terrorists threw bombs resembling explosives at the location. The police officer on duty immediately telegraphed the Taishan Police Station, which dispatched a large number of detectives to blockade the entire area. At the same time, the Japanese military police and garrison in the nearby Hunan District also arrived at the scene to arrest the terrorists. By about 4 p.m., all three simulated criminals had been captured, and the exercise concluded. The blockade was lifted, and traffic was restored. Similar exercises were also held in other districts at the same time.

### Minister Izumi Reveals Japanese Military's War Objectives: Annihilate Enemy British and American Forces on the Chinese Mainland

Minister Izumi of the Army Reporting Department of the Allied Powers in Shanghai met with Chinese reporters from this city at the Joint Army and Navy Reporting Conference yesterday (the 7th). He provided a thorough explanation of the recent situation and objectives of the mainland operations. The minister's remarks are recorded as follows: Minister Izumi first said that the nature of the operation in Hengyang was the same as the battle to attack Luoyang. The ongoing operations of the Japanese army are largely complete, and urban combat has already begun in Hengyang. Therefore, the fall of Hengyang is imminent and will be known within days, and significant results from the attack on Hengyang are expected to come soon. It has been found that Xue Yue, commander of the Ninth War Zone of Chongqing, had 30 divisions of national troops under his command, but most of them were defeated by the Japanese army. Currently, he has a force of less than three divisions. The defeated soldiers of the 27 divisions are in disarray and unlikely to return to their original state. The Japanese army continues to reorganize its ranks, maintain its strength, and prepare to launch another operation in the next stage. Therefore, the Chongqing army has no way to launch a counterattack. The Supreme Headquarters announced that the South China Expeditionary Army began its operational activities on the 27th of last month, and has attacked the Seventh War Zone of Chongqing, occupying Qingyuan, Conghua, Longmen and other places. In coordination with the Japanese troops fighting in the Ninth War Zone, they are launching fierce attacks. It has been found that of the entire 1,100 kilometers of the Yuehan Railway, only 300 kilometers have not yet been occupied by the Japanese army in this area. Regarding the significance of this mainland operation, the Japanese government issued a solemn statement yesterday, revealing the war objectives, which is very clear and has already been deeply understood by everyone. Therefore, the Japanese military's operational objective in South China and Henan-Zhejiang is to annihilate the enemy British and American forces on the Chinese mainland and to shatter the British and American ambition to dominate East Asia. Therefore, in the history of world wars, Japan has demonstrated a spirit of righteousness. In addition, the objectives of the ongoing Pacific operations and the Burma operations are completely the same as the mainland operations.

### North Jiangxi Road Power Resumes

Since the implementation of air defense in this city, it has become increasingly perfect. However, a small number of residents are still negligent in lighting control. For example, in the North Jiangxi Road area, after the alarm was issued, a small number of households still had lights exposed, which was discovered by the local police station. Therefore, on the 19th of last month, the electricity supply to the above-mentioned locations was suspended as a punishment. It is now known that after the power supply was stopped in the area, the Baojia personnel conducted thorough guidance from house to house, strictly shielding all windows and lights to ensure that the lights would not be exposed in the future. It is heard that all households have earnestly followed the guidance. The local police station has sent personnel to investigate and confirmed that the power company was notified on the 6th to restore the power supply. In the future, residents in all areas must be careful about lights and avoid repeating the previous mistakes.

### Seventh District Expedites Issuance of Cloth Purchase Certificates

The Seventh District Office of this city is distributing cotton cloth purchase certificates based on the household registration statistics for February. All households that resided in the area before the end of February of this year, and have reported their household registration to the police station and Fang office, can receive the cloth purchase certificate. However, in order to prevent fraud, avoid omissions, and prevent impersonation, the office has ordered careful handling, and prepared a cotton cloth allocation application form, which is given to each Fang chief to forward to each household by level. The exact number of household members is to be filled in, stamped separately, and submitted to the office for verification before issuance. It is reported that there are a total of five Fang, totaling 53 Lianbao, with more than 87,320 households and more than 400,950 people in the Seventh District. All must be strictly examined. The certificates could have been distributed in February, but the application forms submitted by the residents did not follow the prescribed procedures, and many were found to be inconsistent after verification, which delayed the date. It is heard that all staff of the district office are working overtime to expedite the review and approval process, and it is expected to be completed within the next week.

### Garden Lecture Meeting Scheduled for Today Starting at 6:30 PM at the Hardoon Garden

### Readers' Scholarship News

Regarding Examinations and Screening

The seventh session of application and recommendation forms for this newspaper's reader scholarship has now been gradually submitted by various schools. The office will begin reviewing and registering them from the 11th. Each school should collect the receipts and come to pick them up, and distribute them to the students by the 15th or on a self-determined date. Regarding the screening methods: For initial screening, a small number of applicants have scores that do not meet the standards, or have acceptable family circumstances, or are in ineligible grades (primary school), so they must be screened first. These ineligible students will not be registered, and only their names will be notified to the school. If there are photos attached, they will also be returned to the schools. Regarding the examination, the unified examination will be held after July 20, which has already been announced. Generally, students in elementary and junior high school can finish the examination within the month, while students in high school and the first year of university will be postponed to the beginning of next month. A few schools have requested that the examination scope be announced, but this year's examination will use a test format, which is broader and cannot be temporarily prepared. Those who have consistently good academic performance and are not rote learners do not need to prepare temporarily. There will be no examination for screening for students in their second year of university or above. A different screening method will be determined separately.

### Special Consumption Taxes from Various Regions Remitted to the Central Reserve Bank

The special consumption tax during wartime, organized by the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, for both retail of goods and consumption taxes on banquets and hotels, was first levied in the fifteen major cities in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two special cities of Beijing and Shanghai, starting from January 16th of this year. Then, on May 16th, it was further extended to all districts, counties, towns, and villages in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. The competent authorities for tax collection are the tax authorities in the jurisdictional areas of the various tax branches of the Taxation Department. Areas without tax authorities are collected by local government agencies on behalf of the tax authorities. Because local financial authorities in various provinces insisted on objections, they had been actively promoting tax administration, so the Taxation Department has been ordered to collect the consumer tax seriously. All the consumer taxes collected by the local tax authorities are transferred to the national treasury through the branch offices.

Sharp Increase in Central Reserve Bank Remittance Business

In order to regulate funds and facilitate the operation and prosperity of commerce and industry by merchants and people, the Central Reserve Bank is doing its best to handle inland remittance business. Branches in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Huaihai, Guangdong, and Hubei have been linked for remittance, and the remittance fees charged are extremely low. Recently, in order to prevent the use of remittance funds for speculative business, the amount of remittance has been subject to considerable restrictions. It is now known that the remittances from Shanghai to the mainland have increased in recent months, and the remittances into Shanghai have also increased significantly. In May of this year, remittances from the mainland to Shanghai amounted to more than 900 million yuan, and remittances from Shanghai totaled more than 342 million yuan, of which the most went to Guangzhou, Hankou, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Wuhu, Wuxi, Bengbu, Suzhou, and Anqing.

It is now known that the association has compiled statistics on income and expenditure at the time of the year-end handover in order to seek maximum efficiency. The total income is more than 13,590,000 yuan. After listing the necessary expenses in detail, it is heard that all designated funds are centrally deposited in the Central Reserve Bank, totaling more than 9,870,000 yuan. In addition, donations for aircraft purchases and donations for cloth offerings are still deposited in the Shanghai Fuxing Bank. Recently, it has been heard that the association is very anxious to complete the project quickly, and various industry associations are also promoting it separately. It is expected that the results will be very satisfactory.

### Minister Matsushima Discusses the Pacific War Situation: American Fleet Suffers Alarming Losses

Colonel Matsushima, Minister of Reporting for the Allied Japanese Fleet, gave a speech yesterday (the 7th) at the Joint Army-Navy Press Conference regarding the general situation in the recent Pacific War.

Fleeing in Embarrassment

Minister Matsushima said that the enemy's mobile forces attacked the Ogasawara Islands and Iwo Jima, but the Japanese army and air force defending the locations fought together. The enemy has been forced to flee in embarrassment, and the enemy mobile force is no longer present on the sea surface from that area to Ban Island. However, the enemy is still overestimating itself and continues to recklessly attempt to launch a last-ditch attack with some of its ships in conjunction with ground combat forces. From June 11 to the end of June, the enemy spared no effort to transfer the majority of its Pacific fleet to attack Japan's inner line islands. In the fierce battles over these twenty days, the enemy's American ships suffered heavy damage, with more than forty-eight ships sunk or damaged by the Japanese military and 665 aircraft lost. At the same time, they suffered significant losses on land. On the 5th of this month, American Secretary of the Navy Forrestal admitted that the damage suffered in the battle of Ban Island was unexpected. Therefore, the Japanese navy's skillful operations have resulted in alarming losses for the American fleet under the induced strategy.

Boasting Shamelessly

Currently, most of the enemy's Pacific fleet has been sunk or damaged, and the remaining ships are still attempting to repair and replenish supplies in Hawaii or the Marshall Islands. Although the heroic Japanese navy has achieved this great victory, it is still conserving its strength and waiting for the remaining enemies to complete their replenishment before launching a renewed attack on them. What you should particularly understand is that the American navy has suffered extremely heavy damage. Furthermore, the replenishment of damaged ships at sea is very different from the replenishment of ground troops, and it is difficult to achieve the same speed as the surface assembly. Therefore, the enemy naval authorities are very anxious, so it is no wonder that Forrestal admitted in his statement on the 5th that the future of the naval battle is too distant. At the same time, the erroneous information published by Forrestal, claiming that 664 Japanese naval vessels were sunk or damaged near Ban Island, is truly shameless. Regardless of the nature of the American people, it is astonishing that the responsible naval commander would make such wild statements.

Strictly Prevent Light Leakage

Then, he provided a detailed explanation of the Shanghai air defense problem, saying that after the Japanese army achieved great success in the Central China region, the American air force in Chongqing was deeply anxious. Recently, in order to implement "containment" tactics, they have been actively engaging in activities in the peaceful zone. Therefore, we should pay special attention to their attempts to use the bright moonlight period to engage in deceitful actions. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that the citizens of Shanghai will pay further attention and strictly control lights. At the same time, the army and navy authorities have issued a special notice that no light leakage is allowed during future light controls. Those who dare to deliberately violate the rule will not only have their electricity supply cut off, but will also be severely punished according to military law. It is deeply hoped that the citizens of Shanghai will take on the responsibility of defending the city of Shanghai, and do their best to control themselves. This is what I deeply hope that the citizens of Shanghai will do.

National Forum

### My Opinion on Adjusting the Shanghai People's Food Method

— Yu

According to various statistics, the amount of rice produced in the Shanghai urban area is slightly over 192,000 shi in 1935, and at most 233,000 shi in 1941. The average annual output is only 200,000 shi. The total number of Chinese people in the urban area is about 3.2 million. Assuming that children account for one-quarter of the total number, and that adults consume six he of rice per day and children consume three he of rice per day, the annual consumption should be between 6.29 million shi and 6 million shi. Supply and demand offset each other, and the annual shortage is often around 5.5 million shi to 6 million shi, which must rely on imports from other places to make up for the shortage.

Since the Executive Yuan promulgated the Temporary Measures for the Food Rice of the People of Beijing and Shanghai on May 24th of this year (1944), and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government and the Rice and Grain Control Committee announced the Provisional Measures for the Management of Food Rice for the People of Shanghai on June 1st, the Rice Control Committee no longer seems to be responsible for the rice for Shanghai citizens' households. It is necessary to wait for the rice from farmers or purchasing merchants to arrive in Shanghai before it can be unified. Although the allocation price is said to be calculated by appropriately reducing the price of the tribute, it will inevitably be much higher than the previous allocation price. After these two measures were promulgated, the public was confused and restless all day long. Coupled with the manipulation of speculators and the purchase of large households, the price of rice rose sharply and was unattainable. On May 25th and 26th, the black market price of rice in Shanghai was still below 6,000 yuan per shi, but between June 2nd and 3rd, it soared to 13,000 yuan per shi, a surge unprecedented in its intensity. Most of the people in Shanghai are salary earners, and how many people have a monthly income of 10,000 yuan? Even if they have an income of 10,000 yuan, it is only enough to buy rice, and all other expenses can be said to have reached the point of being overwhelmed. Because of the unlimited quantity of transported people and the exemption from military rice purchase, the price of rice began to fall. However, since the Rice Control Committee implemented the purchase method on July 1, it has rebounded sharply. It is definitely not something that ordinary citizens can afford. If no proper and good strategy is planned, not only will the people be unable to bear it, but the entire society will be in danger of collapse. At that time, there were many comments on the previous two food rice management methods, but no specific measures had been pointed out. In addition to ordering the registered rice merchants to form a purchasing group, the authorities do not seem to have determined specific methods on how to promote it as efficiently as possible. Therefore, I dare to present my humble opinions:

### Dredging Rice and Grain Sources

Procurement merchants purchasing from rice-producing counties: To make this method truly effective, there are still many difficulties to overcome. Although Shanghai residents are extremely anxious about food, the rice production in each county is also limited. Even if the procurement merchants have official passports, it is doubtful whether each county will be willing to cooperate. Therefore, the following four points should be noted in the procedures:

A. The government should issue an order to the three special municipalities and two cities, instructing their subordinates that rice merchants from Beijing and Shanghai with official passports to purchase rice should be allowed to do so. As for the quantity to be purchased, it should be based on statistics to comprehensively assess the availability, so that while meeting the needs of Shanghai residents, the needs of the local area can also be taken into account.

B. Rice and grain procurement must be expedited. In addition to those who voluntarily use their own (or company) funds for procurement, the funds of procurement merchants should be transferred by the municipal government and the Grain Control Committee to negotiate loans from banks to facilitate the process, so that the procured rice can be stored in designated public warehouses.

C. During this period of war, military transportation is extremely urgent, and rice and grain transportation inevitably faces difficulties. The government should strictly order its subordinates that, regardless of land or water transportation, rice and grain should be given priority over military transportation. If the shipping business can be encouraged and unnecessary passenger ships reduced, so as to increase transportation capacity and maintain the people's food supply, it is especially important.

D. In principle, the activities of independent rice merchants should be prohibited, but in reality, the power of independent rice merchants is essential to maintaining the food supply for Shanghai residents. Because independent rice merchants are driven by profit, the transportation is limited and the cost is increased due to the intermediary role of the independent rice merchants. Therefore, in principle, they should be prohibited. However, before the government has a definitive solution and rice and grain cannot be transported to Shanghai in large quantities, independent rice merchants are still great contributors to supplying food to Shanghai residents.

Adjusting the Food Grains Held by Shanghai Residents: Although there are no accurate statistics on the amount of grain stored by Shanghai residents, it is common for many wealthy residents to store grain for times of famine. Moreover, due to hoarding and manipulation by large households and unscrupulous merchants, the amount of grain stored is definitely not small. For emergency relief, it may be possible to first transfer and use it to meet the needs of providing rice to registered households. The methods are as follows:

A. Purchasing Stored Grain According to Grain Control Committee Notice No. 12: "The amount of rice stored by residents should be limited to three months, and any amount exceeding that will be considered hoarding." Therefore, all civilian stored grain exceeding three months can be purchased immediately to meet civilian needs. In the meantime, there are still matters that need to be explained, that is, the quantity of rice per person per month is not specified, which causes the difficulty of not knowing what to do. During wartime, it may be advisable to set a limit of 1.5 dou per person per month, averaging the large and small, which should be sufficient to meet the needs.

B. Purchase Price: The purchase price of civilian stored grain should be calculated based on the cost plus a 20% profit margin. Everything may be lenient so that people are happy to sell, but it should be much cheaper than the market price. In addition, the purchase price must be paid promptly, and do not delay, so as not to lose credibility.

C. The local community leaders should conduct investigations and report on the grain stored by various parties. It is not easy to know everything. At this time when there is a shortage of old and new grain and rice prices are rising daily, how easy is it to ask people to sell enthusiastically? The only way is to order the local community leaders to conduct thorough investigations and report truthfully, and economic police should be responsible for reviewing. If there are any violations, they will be punished accordingly. If the grain purchased from the people can also be used for the people, it will naturally win the support of the majority of the people.

### Procurement of Grain Institutions

Unification of Rice Procurement Organizations: From now on, there should be a responsible organization for rice procurement in Shanghai. If the Grain Administration Bureau is responsible, the Rice Control Committee may be abolished. If the Rice Control Committee is responsible, the Grain Bureau should also be merged. Not only are the functions of affiliated organizations such as the Procurement Team and the Preparatory Committee of the Rice and Grain Trade Association mixed and difficult to clarify, but the Shanghai Grain Adjustment Committee and the Central China Rice Allocation Association should also be merged to unify authority and fix responsibility.

Personnel Issues: Grain administration is related to the people's food supply, and personnel should be strictly screened. How the grain administration organization should be adjusted in the future is the sole responsibility of the standing bureau, and outsiders should not interfere. However, personnel issues must be carefully considered and must not repeat the same mistakes.

Supervision Issues: Since the implementation of the controlled economy, the power of the person in charge is very large, they can make decisions on everything, and there are more opportunities for abuse. Without a strict supervision mechanism, it is not easy to achieve the effect of prevention. Furthermore, in times of chaos, severe punishment should be applied, and there should be no tolerance, lest it invites trouble. The Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee's proposal to establish a supervisory committee is an urgent matter.

### Other Issues

Find a way to maintain the household rice during this transitional period: The distribution of household rice must be maintained, so that there is hope for lower rice prices.

Abolish excessive taxes: There are many reasons why rice and grain in Shanghai are much more expensive than in the inland areas, and extortion by the military police and harassment by excessive taxes are also important reasons, which must be stopped as soon as possible.

Food conservation: At this critical time of crisis, people should be advised to conserve food or use miscellaneous grains as substitutes to help them through the difficulties.

In the blink of an eye, another year has passed, and 1941 has arrived. It doesn't feel like a universal New Year, because on top of the 2600th year of the era, we need to add a one, so the entire nation feels that something new is about to begin. The Japanese Imperial Army is not only flexing its military power on the Chinese mainland, spreading the nation's virtues, but also has troops stationed in French Indochina. In Europe, Germany has already gained absolute military dominance. Moreover, the abolition of the Japan-US Treaty of Commerce and Navigation has not only taken effect, but Roosevelt also declared in his New Year's address that he would fully aid democratic countries. Even Muta-guchi Takao, who lives in a small apartment, wants to flip through photos of warships and face the main battleships of Britain and America.

Majoto often writes letters, saying that the situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly urgent, but he never says anything specific. Beyond that, his letters are full of a soldier's determination and hope, and words of encouragement for Takao.

One day, Majoto wrote in a letter: "The warship I'm serving on has been changed again. Because it's a warship that moves suddenly and frequently, please send letters directly to the dormitory from now on." Takao felt very sad, because he couldn't see the majesty of the warship that Majoto was serving on in the photo album.

Soon after, Tokyo was entering early summer. It was the first day of Navy Memorial Day. Takao received a very solemn letter. The sender was a certain organization of the Navy and the Marine Art Association, jointly named.

The Marine Art Association has been holding a marine painting exhibition every spring for the past two or three years, so Takao has gone to see it, but he was disappointed because all the paintings were marine landscapes such as fishing villages and lighthouses. This year he was planning to go, but he hadn't left yet.

Takao thought that he had received an invitation, so he hurriedly opened the letter. But inside, it wasn't a printed item, but a long letter written with a brush:

"This time, your work "Warship" has been reviewed and it has been decided to request an award from the Minister of the Navy..."

Takao was so surprised that he almost jumped up. He had not submitted anything, but it had been reviewed and would be requested an award from the Minister of the Navy. Of course, he was surprised.

(What's going on?)

He was stunned for a long time, even forgetting to breathe.

That painting was stored in Ichirai San's houseboat. On the day he submitted it for competition, he was harshly criticized by Tsuruhara, and Ichirai's ambiguous attitude made Takao fly into a rage. Later, he even went to Ichirai's residence to get his father's funds, but he only stood at the door and received the money from his wife, and he didn't go to the houseboat. At the same time, he never mentioned that painting again after that. (113)

### Problem of Household Deregistration After Distribution Certificate is Used

My friend, Mr. Zhou, who has been unemployed for a year, recently found a job in Beijing and was about to set off, but unexpectedly, because the distribution certificate has been used, a problem arose in deregistering his household. The cloth purchase certificate he received had already been used to buy cotton cloth, and it had been made into new clothes so that he could bring them with him when he left. Even the invoices had been discarded. Now the issuing office must ask him to submit the cloth purchase certificate before he can deregister his household. However, this kind of cloth purchase certificate has already been used, so where can he get it again? My friend's family depends on him for a living, so he has to go to work, and of course he has to deregister his household, so a serious difficulty has arisen. I checked and "household deregistration is not allowed within six months after the distribution certificate is used" Citizens have not seen this notice beforehand. Now that a problem has arisen, I don't know if there is any remedy. I hope the authorities will give some guidance.
