### Current Educational Problems

Currently, Shanghai faces two serious problems that are extremely widespread and closely linked to the lives of its citizens. It can even be said that every citizen and every family is anxious, worried, and even helpless in the face of these two problems. However, the emergence of these two problems did not begin today; their evolution to this point has reached an extremely serious stage. Judging from the trend, if effective countermeasures are not urgently devised to gradually reduce their severity, they will inevitably escalate, becoming irreparable. Thinking about this, one cannot help but shudder.

What are these two serious problems? First, it is the food problem upon which citizens depend for their livelihood. Second, it is the education problem upon which the prosperity of the nation rests. The former is a problem that oppresses every citizen, while the latter is a problem that threatens every family. Who is without life, and who can cook without rice? Who is without children, and who can bear to see them deprived of education? However, the current reality is that rice prices are soaring, and even with calloused hands and feet, one cannot solve the problem of being adequately fed. Tuition fees are soaring, and even with pawning possessions and borrowing money, one cannot solve the problem of being unable to attend school. Such is the reality, and we cannot hide or evade it. The problems of today cannot be solved by the efforts of the citizens alone, nor can they be effectively solved by the efforts of only a part of society. It is necessary to combine all the strength of the relevant authorities and earnestly innovate to have any hope of a solution.

Regarding the rice problem, we have continuously discussed it and offered many suggestions. Regarding the education problem, we have also repeatedly pointed out the issues. At the same time, we have been running a reader scholarship fund for six sessions, not only speaking but also taking action. However, the seriousness of the problem is increasing day by day, and coping with it is becoming increasingly difficult. Although the applications for the seventh scholarship fund have been rigorously screened, there are still more than 7,000 applicants. Moreover, the fees of various schools in the next semester will be several times higher than the previous semester due to the rising cost of living, with some even proposing to set fees based on rice prices. We aim for a total scholarship fund of 10 million yuan to distribute to the applicants, but the amount is extremely small, which will inevitably reduce the number of scholarships and increase the number of students dropping out of school. Furthermore, even reaching the 10 million yuan target is still questionable based on the current amount. Schools argue that increasing tuition fees is justified by the increased salaries of faculty and staff and other expenses. However, from the perspective of the general student population, parents are already struggling to cover living expenses, so how can they afford the burden of their children's high tuition fees? This will inevitably lead to children dropping out of school, completely contradicting the principle of universal education, where all school-age children have the opportunity to study. However, universal education is a fundamental plan for national development and cannot be abandoned due to minor obstacles. We offer the following suggestions based on practical and feasible considerations:

It is undoubtedly necessary to ensure that faculty and staff have a minimum level of stable living conditions so that they can teach with peace of mind. However, if private schools use the pretext of stabilizing the lives of faculty and staff to charge tuition fees that exceed what is needed, it is akin to commercial profiteering. Educational authorities should strictly prohibit this situation, setting uniform fee standards that must be followed and not allowing miscellaneous fees to be charged under various pretexts.

Schools are not commercial institutions. School authorities should allocate three-quarters of tuition revenue to faculty and staff salaries. Finances should be transparent, and educational authorities should conduct impartial inspections at any time.

The salaries of faculty and staff in both municipal and private schools should prioritize stable living conditions, with the amounts being equal. It is acceptable for tuition fees in private schools to be slightly higher than in municipal schools, but a limit should be set. If private schools have insufficient income, the municipal government should provide subsidies based on their performance.

The municipal government should treat faculty and staff in both municipal and private schools equally, uniformly devising methods for special rationing of essential goods. School authorities should use a portion of the tuition revenue to purchase essential goods and provide them to faculty and staff.

The children of faculty and staff of any school should enjoy preferential treatment, such as reduced or free tuition.

The municipal government should allocate large sums of money to various scholarship organizations before the start of the next semester, based on their performance, to be used as scholarships to help impoverished students continue their education.

In short, the lives of faculty and staff must be stable so that they can serve in education with peace of mind, and school fees must be low so that school-age children, especially those from impoverished families, have the opportunity to study. The gap between these two should be filled, first, by preventing schools from commercializing and pocketing the profits, and second, by unified subsidies from the municipal government. We firmly believe that the municipal authorities are extremely concerned about educational issues and will be able to handle them well, so that the future of education will not be bleak and precarious. The rise and fall of the nation truly depends on this!

### Japanese Planes, Taking Advantage of Bad Weather, Surprise Myitkyina Airfield, Destroying 39 Planes on the Ground

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency): The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3 p.m. today: On July 7, Japanese air force squadrons in Burma braved adverse weather conditions. They launched a surprise attack on the enemy airfield at Myitkyina, completely destroying and burning 22 fighter planes and 16 transport planes on the ground, totaling 39 planes. The Japanese planes returned safely.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency): The Chinese troops stationed in India and commanded by American General Stilwell, after being fiercely attacked by the Japanese army near Kasa, lost most of their combat power. They then joined forces with the remnants of the air force unit in the northern dense forest and gradually advanced towards Gaman (70 kilometers north of Myitkyina) and Mugawin (70 kilometers northwest of Myitkyina). On May 17, a detachment of Chinese troops took the opportunity to infiltrate the Myitkyina area. Currently, both sides are engaged in fierce battles in the southern region of Gaman and the border region of Mugawin. Furthermore, from May 17 to the present, the Japanese army has defeated 11,000 Chinese troops in the vicinity of Myitkyina alone. The battles in the vicinity of Myitkyina are particularly intense, with the Chinese troops repeatedly increasing their forces, now reaching one and a half divisions. However, the Japanese army in the vicinity of Myitkyina has not been affected in any way. On the contrary, the losses of the Chinese troops are increasing daily. The Chinese troops are currently attacking Myitkyina under the cover of artillery fire, but to no avail. Furthermore, Japanese planes in Burma, in cooperation with the army's operations, have been actively flying over the Chinese troops, reconnoitering their military strength. On the 7th, Japanese fighter planes braved the rain to launch a surprise attack on the Chinese troops' airfield, destroying 39 planes. At that time, the Chinese troops fired intense artillery fire, but the Japanese planes suffered no damage and have all returned to base.

Burma Has Entered the Decisive Battle Phase

A certain Japanese army base on the Burmese front, 10th (Central News Agency): The offensive and defensive war stretching thousands of kilometers, centered on Burma, has now entered the decisive battle phase with the arrival of the rainy season. On the Nu River front, the 20th and 11th Group Armies of the Chinese Expeditionary Force, in an attempt to retake the Burma Road, previously invaded the west bank of the Nu River. However, due to the arrival of the rainy season on the Nu River, their rear supply was insufficient, and even air supply was not carried out as desired due to continuous rainfall. In addition, due to the Japanese army's attack, their troops in northern Vietnam and the Longling area also suffered heavy casualties. Since the end of last month, the Japanese army has launched a preemptive attack on the 76th, 87th, and 88th Divisions of the Chinese First Group Army, which had invaded the northeastern region of Longling, and after conducting a fierce attack, has thrown them into a state of collapse. Therefore, in order to reverse this unfavorable situation, the Chinese troops sent the 76th Division to attack on the evening of the 5th. After the Japanese army north of Mangshi attacked them, they further attacked the Chongqing Road from the south. On the morning of the 6th, another unit of the Japanese army also attacked the rear of the Chinese troops, engaging in hand-to-hand combat, and finally annihilated a regiment of that division, totaling 1,500 men. Mopping-up operations are still continuing. On the Myitkyina front, the encirclement operation of Myitkyina by the Chinese 14th and New 30th Divisions and the American army has also made no progress. At the same time, due to the counterattack of the Japanese army in that area, they have been defeated everywhere and are currently retreating step by step. On the 6th, the Japanese army unit, taking advantage of the Chinese troops' unpreparedness, launched an attack and also raided the main positions of the Chinese troops at night, achieving war results. A total of 138 Chinese soldiers were left dead, and 56 were captured. Since the Chinese troops invaded on May 17, in just 50 days, the number of dead and wounded has reached 11,000. The Japanese army's position has not only remained unmoved, but its morale has also become more elevated. On the contrary, the Chinese troops' fighting spirit is weakening day by day, with surrenders and desertions emerging one after another.

Japanese Minister Fujiwara Flew Back to Tokyo Yesterday

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency): State Minister Fujiwara, who went to Korea, Manchuria, and North China to inspect, flew back to Tokyo at 5:45 p.m. on the 9th.

### Japanese Planes Bomb British, German and Chinese Troops Positions; Enemy Planes Bomb Guangzhou Area

A certain Japanese army front-line base, 10th (Central News Agency): The Japanese Air Force, in close cooperation with the northward operations of the Japanese army in South China, not only eliminates the attempted obstruction of the Chinese and American air forces over the battlefield every day, but also repeatedly bombs the positions of the Chinese troops. At times, they search for defeated and残兵残將 in the mountains, and at times they bomb supply boat groups, all of which have achieved considerable results. For example, on the 7th, they bombed about 500 Chinese troops retreating into the mountains about 20 kilometers north of Qingyuan, inflicting great losses on them. On the 8th, they attacked the headquarters of the Chinese 159th Division in Sanmendong (40 kilometers northeast of Qingyuan). On the 9th, they launched a surprise attack on a group of 300-200 Chinese boats gathered on the Beijiang River about 40 kilometers north of Qingyuan. At the same time, they also bombed the positions of the Chinese troops in the Yingde area east of that location, destroying them. It is reported that the aforementioned position is the second line of defense for the Chinese troops north of Guangdong. The Chinese troops who have been defeated from the first line of defense north of Qingyuan are collapsing towards the second line of defense. These Chinese troops have been carrying out defense preparation work with Yingde as the center.

Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency): At 9:30 p.m. on the 8th, thousands of enemy B-25 aircraft attacked the Guangzhou area, carrying out indiscriminate bombing. Many incendiary bombs hit and burned civilian houses in Longtan near Guangzhou. Dozens of bombs also fell on the streets of Shiqiao and near Xiaolan in Zhongshan County, killing and injuring dozens of farmers. Furthermore, at 9:40 a.m. on the 9th, an enemy plane attacked Gaibao. The ground troops engaged it and quickly repelled it.

Enemy Planes Attacked Anqing and Were Defeated; A Certain Japanese Army Base, 10th (Central News Agency): At 12:30 p.m. on July 7, two enemy B-250 aircraft and four P-51 aircraft attacked Anqing. One of the P-51 aircraft was shot down by the Japanese army and navy (one uncertain). The remaining aircraft were all repelled. The Japanese side suffered no damage.

Japanese Planes Bomb Suichuan Liangshan

A certain Japanese army base, Central News Agency, Daily: After the Japanese Air Force received information on the evening of the 8th that enemy aircraft had once again invaded northern Kyushu on the mainland, they immediately dispatched their forces to intercept them. Among them, a fighter squadron dispatched along the Beijing-Hankou Railway encountered a B-29 aircraft near Xinyang in the upper air. Recognizing it as an enemy aircraft that had invaded northern Kyushu, they attacked it and drove it away. Furthermore, a fast reconnaissance aircraft squadron responsible for searching for enemy aircraft conducted extensive reconnaissance on that day. Based on the reconnaissance reports of that squadron, the Japanese fighter squadrons further launched a major attack on the Suichuan Chinese army airfield in the afternoon. Braving intense anti-aircraft fire, they bombed and destroyed one B-24 and one P-38 aircraft. One Japanese plane also did not return to its base. On the same day late at night, the Japanese bomber squadrons further attacked the Liangshan Chinese army airfield. Braving fierce anti-aircraft fire, they broke through into the upper atmosphere above the airfield and destroyed five B-24 aircraft, one small aircraft, and two unidentified aircraft, and set fire to one area of the airfield. At the same time, another team of Japanese bombers further attacked Zuo Yang, destroying its military facilities, with fires breaking out in four places at the airfield.

Even with one soldier left, we will never stop until we have completed this great mission. To all of you who have assisted India's independence for the liberation of India, I would like to express my condolences and first express my gratitude."

### Hong Kong's Recent Situation

Stopping Rice Rationing

The main force governing Hong Kong is not only carrying out the war but also, following the progress of the war situation, studying and adapting new policies in accordance with the severity and urgency of the situation to suit the reality of Hong Kong. From April 15th, the Governor-General's Department stopped rationing rice to the general population. At the same time, it established new regulations for the consumption of electricity and gas and revised tax rates. The regulations for gas were implemented on April 1st, and the regulations for electricity were implemented on April 13th.

Restrictions on Electricity Consumption

Restrictions on gas consumption are based on the number of families in December of last year. They remain the same for general household users. For hotels, restaurants, tea houses, etc., the amount restricted in January of this year was further reduced by 40%, to 60% of the original amount. As for restrictions on electricity consumption, the supply of power to the production side is given the most importance. The amount of electricity for general use, electric heating, and electric lighting is reduced to 50% of the previous consumption. The supply of electricity for wasteful and unnecessary uses is stopped. From June 1st, the use of electric lights for general use is restricted to four hours from 8 p.m. to 12 a.m. From the 4th of the same month, the operation of trams in the city was also suspended.

In addition, the tax rate revision greatly increased taxes on four types of taxes: food and beverage tax, entertainment tax, alcoholic beverage tax, and business income tax. In particular, the food and beverage tax, with a minimum of 10% on consumption of two to five yuan per person, can be as high as 50%, 70%, or 100%. This tax rate is not high compared to mainland Japan, but when comparing Hong Kong's prices with those in mainland Japan, the tax burden is actually not low because the taxation level is extremely low.

Residents' Enthusiastic Cooperation

Hong Kong's recent state of decisive battle has been increasingly strengthened and established with the progress of the war situation. What is noteworthy here is the residents' cooperation and enthusiasm in this regard. When rice rationing was stopped, the Governor-General's Department considered the blow to morale and provided a sufficient period for the public to make supplementary preparations. On March 15th, one month before the implementation, an announcement was issued that after April 15th, rice rationing would be stopped to the general public, except for those who cooperate with the military and government. This measure naturally became a major problem in life when the guarantee of being able to purchase rice at a fixed price for two years was no longer available. Therefore, after rice rationing was stopped, various prices in Hong Kong also rose sharply.

This sharp rise in prices was caused by the actions of some Chinese merchants who were accustomed to hoarding and speculating, but it was a temporary phenomenon that was inconsistent with the reality of Hong Kong, as later prices would prove. The Governor-General's Department took appropriate measures when rice rationing was stopped, but it was also due to the Chinese merchants' recognition and self-awareness of a new Hong Kong that they rose up.

The Chinese merchants, who were accustomed to hoarding and speculating, also started from an absolute sense of trust in the authorities. In order to ensure the food supply, they resolutely rose up and actively cooperated with the organizations in implementing the war system. The most powerful of these is the Civil Food Mutual Aid Association, established by Hu Wenhu last autumn. In order to hope that the association would carry out active activities, Hu Wenhu planned to revitalize agriculture in the South China area and planned to establish the China Overseas Chinese Agricultural Bank in Guangdong to provide farmers with the funds needed for developing arable land and fertilizers. He is currently applying to the Guangdong Provincial Government for permission to establish it. When this bank starts operating in organic connection with the Civil Food Assistance Association, its contribution to the food problem in Hong Kong will be very great.

In addition, similar cooperative organizations are also gradually being established. These organizations have considerable connections with the agencies surrounding Hong Kong and can obtain a considerable amount of rice and grain. Therefore, they not only eliminated the food insecurity caused by the cessation of rice rationing but also created a business purpose for the Chinese, who were focused on profit, to stabilize their lives by prioritizing the interests of the public over individual interests. This is a welcome phenomenon for the entire Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in Hong Kong. This can represent the leap forward in the Chinese people's understanding of the current situation.

Railway Connection to Guangdong

What is promoting and strengthening Hong Kong's construction is the surprising recovery of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway along the cleared line last autumn and the results of the clearing of Lantau Island a few days ago. Shortly after the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway was cleared, on December 28th, Hong Kong allowed general passengers to use it to Shenzhen. From the 10th of last month, it was further extended to Zhangmutou. Stations and other facilities have also been completed, and the full line will be opened soon. The railway completely connects Guangzhou and Kowloon. In this way, if Hong Kong and Guangdong can travel freely between them via this railway, the exchange of trading materials agreed upon with Guangdong in the past will become smoother. At the same time, a large amount of agricultural products from the abundant farms along the route can be expected to flow in. During the clearing, it was completely a wilderness, but now, along the line, rice and vegetables are everywhere, turning into abundant fertile land, which can fully meet Hong Kong's expectations.

### Germany Again Employs Flooding Tactics; Fierce Street Fighting in Caen; German Troops on the West Bank of the Vire River Hinder Enemy Advance

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency), Huitong News Agency: German troops south of Caen are shelling the British Second Army to the north. The British infantry and the 12th Armored Division, commanded by General Dempsey, have been attempting to push south in the Caen-Tilly area since the day before yesterday, but they have been stopped. The German army has opened the Holgate lock at the mouth of the Orne River, flooding a large area and preventing the British army from advancing eastward. British troops in Caen have not yet crossed the Orne River. The southern and southeastern parts of the city are still in German hands.

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency), German News Agency: On Sunday, the British army launched a large-scale offensive in the Caen sector. Their powerful armored forces invaded the northern part of the city of Caen in the afternoon. Fierce house-to-house fighting then ensued. The British commander deployed more troops yesterday. In addition to the heavy artillery of British warships at the mouth of the Orne River, there were also motorized howitzers and the air force, attacking the entire German line continuously in a coordinated manner. The British army launched an offensive from the north and northeast at noon and broke into several points in the German defense line, quickly advancing to the ruins of the city of Caen. This morning, the resistance centers north and northeast of the German position were still fighting fiercely with enemy aircraft, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. One German resistance point destroyed 17 enemy tanks in short-range combat. Between the Vire and Tout Rivers, after reinforcements, the American army launched a large-scale offensive, advancing to the west side of the Vire River and as far as Gavarn and Haissey. The North American army's offensive at Sainte-Mère-Église was defeated. A German assault east of La Haye-du-Puits recaptured an important high ground from the American army.

Stockholm, Sweden, 10th (Central News Agency), Huitong News Agency is forward-looking: Reuters reports that Caen and La Haye-du-Puits have been occupied. The German army is counterattacking in these two locations, and fierce battles are taking place in the suburbs.

### Affected by the War, Chongqing Faces a Food Crisis and Its Finances Are Becoming Increasingly Depleted

Central News Agency: Since the Allied Japanese army launched operations on the mainland, taking important strongholds and reaping major war results, it is currently also launching fierce battles in Hengyang, expanding the campaign to eliminate the enemy's British and American forces in mainland China. A portion of the Japanese army is continuing to bravely advance south, while another portion is responding by starting to move north. This operation has caused great anxiety to Chongqing. According to reliable sources, since the start of the Henan-Hunan-Guangxi Campaign, prices in eastern Zhejiang have been continuously falling sharply, falling by 30% to 40% compared to prices in Shanghai. The reason for this is that after Chongqing lost Luoyang and Changsha, inland transportation was completely cut off from Chongqing, and eastern Zhejiang has always been extremely rich in materials, which are now stagnant, leading to low prices. Looking at prices in Chongqing, the price of rice on the black market has already reached over 10,000 yuan. Originally relying on rice from Hunan and Sichuan for supply, the transportation of Hunan rice to Chongqing will be interrupted after most of Hunan is occupied by the Japanese army. Therefore, Chongqing has become greatly alarmed, and the black market price of rice has soared to over 11,000 yuan. In addition, foreign goods have also become 30% more expensive. As for the reason for Chongqing's failures, it is also due to excessive pride. When the Japanese army approached Changsha, the Chongqing army immediately fled upon hearing the news, which was unexpected by the Chongqing government. The Japanese army's preparations for operations are thorough, and Chongqing cannot cope with the Japanese army's attacks. At the same time, public opinion in Chongqing tries to avoid publishing unfavorable news from Hunan, hoping to avoid making the public take it seriously. On the contrary, they do not hesitate to greatly exaggerate the operations in the Pacific and Burma. As for the bleak situation of the Hunan war, it is believed that the Chongqing army will suffer major blows again in the future development of the Hunan war.

Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency): Chongqing's finances are becoming increasingly strained. Kong Xiangxi, who recently went to the United States to attend the International Monetary Conference, talked to American reporters about Chongqing's financial situation and mentioned the post-war currency system. He said that the war between China and Japan has lasted for seven years, and all of Chongqing's financial resources have been exhausted. The richest areas of China have mostly been occupied by the Japanese army, and Chongqing is in a state of extreme exhaustion, leading to abnormal inflation. In order to save the crisis, the authorities have tried their best to maintain revenue, but the total amount of tax revenue this year is expected to only be 52% of the national treasury's expenditure, and it is still questionable whether it can be collected according to the expected amount. The recent Japanese army's offensive has had a great impact on tax revenue, with a loss of about 100 million yuan per month. Currently, foreign goods are very expensive in various areas of Chongqing, and domestic goods are also becoming increasingly expensive due to transportation difficulties and reduced production. In addition, prices vary greatly in different regions, making it even more difficult to determine the true value of the legal tender, and the authorities are extremely anxious. In short, since the Sino-Japanese Incident, Chongqing's currency system has entered a state of chaos.

### Japanese Maritime Bureau to Build Tankers

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese Maritime Bureau, in order to enhance the maritime transportation of liquid fuel, has planned to build a large number of wooden tankers and has already started construction at high speed. Recently, it also notified shipyards across the country to manufacture them together. Based on past experience in building a large number of wooden ships, it is well known that building wooden oil tankers takes even less time. Using the remaining capacity for building ships to produce wooden oil tankers will greatly contribute to the transportation of strategically important liquid fuels, and the results are highly anticipated.

### Manchukuo Organizes Concordia Youth Action Squads

Xinjing, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Manchukuo Concordia Association, in order to enhance combat power and unite youth strength, has decided to form Concordia Youth Action Squads in major cities and villages throughout Manchukuo starting from the beginning of next month. Students from middle schools who are physically strong and have pure thoughts will be selected as members to learn skills such as rescue, sanitation, camp construction, and transportation, and to unleash the vigor of youth during wartime. The formation method is to have students in the third grade and above form the first squad, and students in the first and second grades form the second squad. Each squad is further divided into three platoons, and each platoon is divided into three or five sections, with each section typically consisting of ten people. As for the rural action squads, they will be set up in villages of each county. Considering the importance of rural youth activities, it has been decided to use villages as units to form these squads. Members will be youths aged between ten and twenty-five who are ambitious and energetic. A headquarters will be established in each village, and a section will be established in each settlement. Their mission is to build ethical villages and implement national policies as their two major goals. At the same time, in accordance with the evolution of the national situation, they will undergo ideological training, literacy education, sanitation training, military training, practical training, civil engineering, and other general skills, all of which are required to be learned.

### The Philippines' Defense Posture is Being Actively Improved; The Food Problem Has Already Established a Foundation

Manila, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Philippines' defense posture has recently been actively improved. At the same time, due to the direct involvement in combat, the demands on the Philippine economy are increasing daily. Consequently, the Philippines' strategic materials are becoming increasingly needed as the situation becomes more urgent. The situation is reported as follows: Today, the Philippines can be said to have established a foundation for all its food problems. Due to this need, the Philippine government has placed its focus on food countermeasures, launched a food production increase campaign, and implemented mandatory farming orders, making every effort to solve all food problems. On the part of the general public, the food issue is closely related to their direct lives, so they are taking the lead in providing voluntary cooperation with food policies. However, the core of the food problem can be said to lie in collection, transportation, and distribution. Since the establishment of the "Food Corporation," a rice control organization, the Philippines has made various efforts to manage the collection and distribution of rice. However, because the results have not been entirely satisfactory, the Philippines will inevitably undergo some changes in its rice collection countermeasures. In the current urgent situation, it is impossible to strongly promote the existing development policy. In particular, there is an absolute need to increase the production volume of resources such as Manila hemp and coconuts. However, in order to rapidly develop these resources with limited manpower and resources, it is necessary to stop developing other industries. In order to establish a self-sufficient economy in the Philippines, non-urgent industries should also maintain a certain level. For example, sugar is a necessity for daily life, and it is necessary to ensure and increase its production volume. In addition, key development sectors should adopt efficiency-centered principles and systematically reorganize inefficient business sectors in all aspects. At the same time, efforts should be made to allow employees and materials to engage in efficient business sectors and other emergency projects. On the other hand, various basic industries necessary for the Philippines' self-sufficient economy are also being prepared. With the steady import of materials, the industrial products of this year should be able to achieve self-sufficiency. Therefore, except for some products that require advanced technology, there is no need to import other products for the time being.

The Philippines Issues Second Long-Term Public Bonds

Manila, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - President Laurel has ordered the issuance of a second long-term public bond worth 150 million pesos. This issuance of long-term public bonds is a continuation of the 20 million pesos bond issued last May, and together with the 15 million pesos short-term public bond issued in April, the total amount of long-term and short-term public bonds issued is 50 million pesos. To prepare for the issuance of public bonds, the Philippine banking sector is currently seeking to circulate cash, and the general public is also enthusiastically purchasing them. It is expected that the issuance of public bonds will achieve satisfactory results.

### New Sports Youth Camp Holds Entrance Ceremony

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The New Sports Youth Summer Labor Life Camp held an entrance ceremony on the 10th, presided over by Camp Commander Lin Bosheng, who reported on the significance of holding the camp. Afterward, they visited the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, and Camp Commander Lin presented flowers on behalf of the participants. They paid tribute to the martyrs of the National Revolution and the Japanese comrades who aided the Chinese Revolution, and held a picnic and recreational gathering. At 6:40 PM, a general meeting was held at the camp, with Deputy Camp Commander Xu giving instructions. From the 11th, the camp trainees will engage in labor service and attend classes. Important officials of the National Government will also visit the camp to give lectures.

### Zhengzhou Opens Teacher Training Institute

Zhengzhou, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Henan Province, which has recently emerged from the anti-Japanese war, is now actively seeking the construction of a new order, and primary schools in various places have also resumed classes one after another. Therefore, the authorities have specifically opened a teacher training institute in Zhengzhou's No. 1 Elementary School to provide training to various teachers. The training focuses on the spiritual aspect. The institute held a commencement ceremony on July 10th. Representatives from various Chinese and Japanese related entities attended. The first group of trainees consisted of 28 people, who will be assigned to teach in various schools after completing the training.

### North China Food Public Corporation's Organizational Structure is Ready

Beiping, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The North China Food Public Corporation, as a comprehensive control organization for the main food crops in North China, has completed the establishment of its internal organization and the appointment of its staff since its establishment on May 20th. At the same time, the transfer of matters to the Public Corporation by the Food Administration Bureau has also been completed and will be canceled in June. In addition, the North China Wheat Flour Manufacturing Association, which was entrusted by the Food Administration Bureau to handle the collection of food, is also nearing completion of the transfer procedures. The Food Public Corporation has begun its activities in accordance with its established mission. As for the public corporations in various provinces at the local level, they have also launched activities with cooperatives and food trade associations as lower-level organizations. It is planned to establish three public corporations in the special municipalities of Beiping, Tianjin, and Qingdao. The plans will be determined based on the actual situation in each city. Qingdao is planning to open soon, while Tianjin will establish a branch of the Hebei Province Public Corporation. It is not planned to establish one in Beiping.

### Central Committee Holds Weekly Meeting

### Road Police Management Office Convenes Section Meeting

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The order at railway transportation stations has consistently been poor, and while there are many reasons for this, the low quality of the road police responsible for station order is the biggest issue. The Ministry of Construction, as its responsibility lies in safeguarding the legitimate transportation rights of passengers, has indirect responsibility and has repeatedly sought to rectify the road police. However, due to long-standing problems, it is not easy to achieve success at once. Therefore, the Road Police Management Office has specifically convened the section chiefs from various sections to Nanjing to hold a section meeting at its office at 10:00 AM on the 10th to discuss various issues such as rectifying police affairs in each section. The meeting achieved satisfactory results, and the order in military stations will definitely be improved in the future.

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The German News Agency reports: The battle west of Kozelsk is now developing into another focal point of the Eastern Front's defense war. On Saturday and Sunday, the Soviet army mobilized ten divisions of riflemen and three tank teams, attacking on a narrow front line, attempting to break through the German front line in the area to the west and southwest in order to reach Lublin and Limburg. In the fierce battles from early morning to late night, although the Soviet army had broken through several gaps, the German army maintained all its positions. On Saturday and Sunday, a new record of 172 tanks destroyed was achieved along a front line of only about ten kilometers. The battle in the Kovel area resumed on Sunday, and fierce battles continued in other strongholds in the central section. West of Baranovichi, the Soviet army attempted to encircle a German group, but the German army broke through and retreated to the defensive line west of Baranovichi with a large number of prisoners of war. After several hours of fighting, when the Soviet tank team suddenly penetrated behind the German grenadiers defending the town of Lida (south of Vilnius), the German army withdrew from the city of Lida. The Vilnius garrison engaged in fierce battles throughout Saturday and Sunday. The Soviet tank team broke through a gap in the front line and entered the southwest of the city, where street fighting is still ongoing.

Belarusian Region Guerrillas Assist in Battle

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Huitong News Agency Special Correspondent Trutmann claims: The Soviet victory in the central section of the Eastern Front was due to the use of an unprecedentedly large amount of tanks, artillery, and aircraft.

When the Soviet army entered from Russia, they were guided by thousands of guerrillas. Regular soldiers who fell behind were replenished by guerrillas. The German army retreating westward was often escorted by the vanguard of the German tank army to pass through the enemy's interior.

### A Report on Mr. Chen Youren

— Li Weichen

Four

What kind of person is it, "to finalize the assessment after the coffin is closed"?

To make a detailed and definitive assessment, to write a complete biography, is the work of historians and biographers in the future. Now I can only make a quick sketch based on what I can measure, what I know, what I have seen, and what I understand, hoping to outline his profile, especially the wrinkles of his later years.

As far as I understand, Mr. Chen's life is inseparable from the Chinese Revolution. He was conceived in the flames of the Wuchang Uprising of 1911. In his life, the 1911 Revolution is the most precious and meaningful symbol. Although he grew up in the family of a revolutionary who refused to bow to the Manchus and fled to a foreign country, this family filled his potential with revolutionary impulses, but the environment prevented him from resolving the suffering of life. But the flames of the Wuchang Uprising burned away his suffering, allowing him to be reborn and his struggle to merge with the torrent of history.

Before 1911, I dare say, perhaps my friends will object to me saying this, Mr. Chen was a foreigner of pure Chinese blood from a large and wealthy family, a very wealthy lawyer, and a typical gentleman with a "Cocoa" farm for his weekend recreation. But after 1911, he was a revolutionary fighter full of modern spirit, embracing infinite aspirations, always ready to dedicate his life to the motherland, and determined to break feudalism and lead the motherland into the ranks of modern nations. I say this, and I believe Mr. Chen would agree. He once told me such a story about himself:

"More than fifty years ago, when I was still a child," he recalled to me, "I loved to walk alone on moonlit nights, especially in coconut groves facing the sea. As I listened to the sound of the waves, I often thought, I always wanted to transcend the environment of this small island, I always thought that one day I would be able to make a meaningful contribution to this big world. I thought of China, but China was conquered by the Manchus. My parents refused to submit to foreign races, and of course I could not submit. I could not be a slave, a submissive citizen. There was no place for me to contribute. I often thought like that, but I could never solve my depression."

But in the year he turned thirty-seven, his childhood wishes began to come true. When he heard the news of the Chinese Revolution in London, he felt the revolutionary bugle calling him and attracting him. He could not restrain his impulse, so he abandoned everything, abandoned his years of established business, abandoned his comfortable and stable life, and hastily crossed the English Channel, embarking on a train eastward back to China, a strange land where he had no acquaintances and no friends. From that time on, he began his new life. From that time on, he never ceased to fight for the motherland. Even in the most difficult and dangerous environments, under the bayonets of warlords and the threats of imperialist cannons, he was always unyielding in his struggle. In the overwhelming torrent, he always stood firm, advancing, representing, and symbolizing the character of the Chinese nation, giving his all until his death.

My outlining of Mr. Chen is of course insufficient, but there is no exaggeration. Perhaps my writing is too abstract, which is unavoidable. Mr. Chen has run newspapers, been imprisoned, served as several foreign ministers, risked his life, and been in very difficult situations. Whether in the imperial court, in hardship, or in prison, he always attracted people's attention. To list his struggles, in this article now, it is of course impossible, nor is it necessary. Now, I will just cite two very ordinary things from his life experience:

1. During the time when Yuan Shikai was preparing for the imperial system, Mr. Chen happened to be running a newspaper in Beijing. He not only opposed the imperial system in his editorials, but also publicly published Liang Qichao's "Strange Thing Called the National System Question." During the time when Duan Qirui was in power, he also publicly exposed the secret agreement signed by Duan's government. This was well known to the people of the country at that time.

2. When he was imprisoned for the second time, Zhang Zuolin's order was to execute him, but a young military officer in charge of the case was unwilling to carry out the order. As long as Mr. Chen was willing to admit that he was a British citizen, he would have an excuse to release Mr. Chen. But Mr. Chen refused. He said to the officer, "Execute me, I am Chinese." He then told the jailer to prepare a coffin for him, and after his death, return the body to Guangzhou. Soon, Zhang Zuolin returned to Tianjin, and Mr. Chen regained his freedom. This was told to me by Mr. Xu Jilong, which is something unknown to the outside world.

Mr. Chen's words and deeds, as far as I understand, were all triggered by his aspirations and endowed character. As long as he believes it is morally right and reasonable, he does not avoid or compromise, and he faces unavoidable dangers, even challenging death. The above two examples can very well illustrate his character, and at the same time, from these two examples, one can imagine all his struggles and words and deeds. The ancients commented on Fang Xiaoru, "He achieved a 'right' with nine deaths, completing the world's myriad generations of selling one." Mr. Chen was full of this spirit. The more difficult the environment, the more Dynamic he was (full of forward momentum). "A single breath is hard to bear, a serious state of mind is heavy, and adversity makes his spirit even more heroic." This is his unique character.

A person with such a character may be thought to be reckless and impetuous by most people, but in reality, this is not the case.

Except for the most serious times when he struggled with life and death, Mr. Chen would shout angrily with great excitement. Usually, whether in the office or at home, he was very quiet, and it was rare to hear his voice. Whether in negotiations or receiving guests, he was courteous, sincere and gentle in his attitude, but gentleness contained an aura of inviolable severity. Whether in conversation or discussion, he did not speak loudly. His pupils often looked upwards, thinking and speaking at the same time, as if he was using logic to tightly connect the arguments and force them out. And his choice of words and sentences, due to his literary cultivation, often made listeners feel fresh, vibrant, rhythmic, and meaningful. He was very humble in his work and very diligent in his daily life. Not to mention major events, even for an article, as long as he thought the opinions criticized by his friends were correct, he often did not hesitate to revise it six or seven times, or even rewrite the entire article three or four times. From morning till night, he was either thinking, studying problems, reading books, or using a typewriter on his desk to write out his thoughts, even if he woke up in the middle of the night, if he thought of new problems or came up with new ideas, he would immediately get up and record his thoughts. When he lived in Hong Kong, there was a period when he would always run to the mountains in Sai Kung alone every afternoon at four o'clock to take a walk. While walking, he would meditate and think alone. This tireless life of his was wrong. In recent years, Mr. Yan Junren often advised him to learn some leisure activities, but he always felt that he did not have enough time. Liang Qichao was extremely diligent in the past, but he was more diligent than Ren Gong. I really doubt whether being so diligent is right.

Mr. Chen's daily life is also very orderly and regular. He does not smoke or drink. If he can avoid socializing, he does not socialize. He is also very organized in his affairs. Whether guests are close or distant, they must make an appointment in advance. Even a pen, a piece of paper, a pair of shoes, he places neatly in a certain position. As for his heart, it is even softer. He always has compassion for others and never wants to make others sad. Sometimes, he seems to be very intolerant of mediocrity in his heart, but he often comforts himself and advises others, saying: "China is full of broken bricks and tiles. Without broken bricks and tiles, there will be no materials." This is another side of Mr. Chen. If what was written before was his outline, what is painted here may be his face.

As I write, I am thinking that the outline of Mr. Chen needs to be carved with steel, but his face needs to be colored with a brush. This distinction symbolizes his clear distinction between public and private affairs. In public matters, he does not allow for any borrowing, and he does not allow his emotions to affect national policies and the interests of the nation. It is a purely rational state based on pure reason. Therefore, on the political and diplomatic stage, he is a sincere politician, a tough diplomat, a pungent political commentator, and a magnificent warrior, a typical Western gentleman.

The wrinkles of Mr. Chen's later years, I should add them now. But drawing wrinkles is the most difficult. A slight difference in depth is a thousand miles apart. To draw them appropriately, I am afraid it is beyond my clumsy skills. Now I can only make an attempt, starting from the last five or six years.

As far as I know, see, and understand, Mr. Chen has been suffocated by the air these past few years. Because he has great aspirations, his thoughts and feelings simply cannot leave the country for a moment. Because he is endowed with the character of a revolutionary fighter, he needs to participate in actual struggles, and the more difficult it is, the more he strives. But in these past few years, although the country has been in a situation of storm and fury, the environment does not allow him to be at the forefront, and the last two years have been even less so.

When Mr. Chen was in Hong Kong, he had contact with friends from various military and political circles. Mr. Chen often discussed the country's crises with them, and he often said without hesitation: "I have a right to the foreign office" (during this period, diplomacy should be presided over by me). But when it was rumored frequently in 1938 that he would be the foreign minister, he issued a statement without hesitation, denying this news. In one of his statements, he more firmly stated: "It is useless to replace the name of the foreign minister with Chen Youren." What he was fighting for was diplomatic policy, not the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. His policy was proactive, not passive, but the policy of the authorities was "to respond to all changes with constancy," which in essence was "people change, and I change accordingly." This fundamental difference in policy principles made it impossible for him to exert his strong skills for the country in politics and diplomacy.

When others encounter such an environment, they may retreat into seclusion or engage in other passive careers. But Mr. Chen's revolutionary fighter character and his strong aspirations made him proactively adopt a new style. From that time on, he frequently published powerful and challenging political commentaries, publicly advocating his proposed policies. He openly demanded that the government be reorganized into a modern wartime government. He openly demanded that the government adopt separate and special diplomatic policies towards various countries and strengthen the diplomatic lineup. After the outbreak of the European War, he was anxious about the "Munich of the East." He more actively demanded that the government adopt a proactive diplomatic policy that could "create the situation," and demanded that the government send a diplomatic envoy group, led by Madame Sun Yat-sen, a person with experience, to Washington and Moscow. This style of a modern Western politician was ultimately not suitable for our motherland, which is steeped in the study of Lao-Zhuang, so it aroused the authorities' disgust. And his voice became a "voice in the wilderness"!

But his strength still pushes him forward. Since the day he stepped into the mainland of the motherland thirty-three years ago, he has been tirelessly trying to make the motherland transcend the feudal environment and modernize the motherland. He often said: "I am old. As long as I can personally see the modernization of China beginning, I will die content." This grand aspiration made him unwilling to despair in any harsh environment. Therefore, he began to give speeches to Chinese youths. He encouraged and guided the young people at Lingnan University and other universities with all his heart and soul. He told the Chinese youth: "You are the enlightened leaders and workers of China. Your responsibility is to continue the past and open up the future, especially to clear the way for the country and the nation and open up a bright and modern future. You must aspire to make the people of the country have a 'new mind' in the future, a modern one with scientific thinking, and eradicate the feudal mind. You must aspire to make the people of the country have a 'new physique' in the future, a strong, hardworking, and eradicate the current sickly and weak physique. You must also aspire to make the farmers of the country cultivate 'new land' diligently, not to seize the land of other countries, but to develop China's wilderness, to universally instill farmers with scientific farming methods, so that the land that has only been cultivated four inches deep for thousands of years can be renewed and transformed into fertile new land." He firmly believed that the Chinese nation is an energetic nation, a nation that will not perish. On the other hand, he witnessed the horrors of the world war. He believed that one world war per generation was too cruel. He also believed that the previous peace was never real peace, but only a temporary truce. Therefore, he began to study the post-war solutions to world problems. He hoped to find a solution that could resolve international disputes and satisfy the reasonable aspirations of all nations and gradually lead mankind into a new stage of evolution from the viewpoint of evolution (Evoution). For the entire year after the outbreak of the European War, he devoted himself to studying this issue, forgetting food and sleep, and finally felt that he had gained some insight.

### The Myanmar Special Investigation Team Arrives in Shanghai, Receives a Warm Welcome From All Parties, Mayor Chen Gave a Banquet the Night Before, and the Atmosphere Was Harmonious

The Myanmar Special Investigation Team, to investigate the construction situation and cultural undertakings of our country, led by Dr. Ba Hian, a group of six people, made a special trip to China for sightseeing, and arrived in Shanghai by plane from Nanjing on the 9th of this month. In recent days, it has been warmly received by all parties in the city. The delegation was at the Shanghai official residence of Chairman Wang at 7:30 p.m. the night before (9th) and attended a public banquet hosted by the mayor. The mayor was unable to attend due to official business, so he was represented by Wu Songbi, the secretary-general of the municipal government. Liang Xiuyu, the director of the municipal propaganda office, and senior officials of the municipal government all attended to receive the guests. The representatives of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, the Army, the Navy, and the Consul General of Manchukuo were all present. The atmosphere was harmonious. Wu Songbi first delivered a welcome speech, followed by a reply from the head of the delegation, Ba Hian. The hosts and guests did not disperse until 9:00 p.m.

Mayor's Speech

Head of Delegation Ba Hian, distinguished members of the delegation, distinguished guests: Your country has been working hard all the way to investigate various countries in East Asia. Today, you have come to our city, and I, on behalf of Mayor Chen, would like to express my welcome. Now, within the Greater East Asia region, thanks to the efforts of the allied Japan and other related countries, the Anglo-American forces have been completely swept away. Taking this city as an example, the past concessions were recovered on August 1 last year, completing the integrity of China's territory and sovereignty. Therefore, we have designated August 1, which is coming soon, as China's Renaissance Day. This year's August 1 is the first Renaissance Day and the anniversary of the recovery of the concessions in this city. Coincidentally, that day is also your country's Independence Day and the anniversary of your country's independence. Before the most worthy anniversaries of our two countries, your delegation has come to Shanghai for investigation, which is even more gratifying and memorable.

In the past, the relationship between China and Myanmar was very close. China has worked hard to help your country in culture, and your country has also added assistance to China in material terms. Especially there are many overseas Chinese in your country, who have been treated favorably by your country in the past. Therefore, it can be said that the history of friendship between China and Myanmar is very long, and China and Myanmar can be said to have been united for a long time among the countries in East Asia, which is worthy of being called a friendly country. Now, our two countries are also the main members of Greater East Asia, which is really something to be thankful for. This time, your country sent your delegation to investigate various places. I believe that your country will bring the results of the investigation back to the country, and it will definitely make more contributions to your country and East Asia. Now the war of liberation in East Asia is proceeding extremely fiercely. I believe that the allied Japan will definitely achieve the final and complete victory. The victory of the allied Japan is also the victory of all countries in East Asia. The era of East Asia's liberation is not far away, and I hope everyone will work hard. Finally, I wish Head of Delegation Ba Hian and all members of the delegation and all guests good health.

Ba Hian's Reply

It roughly said: "This Greater East Asia War has awakened the national consciousness of the entire Burmese people. In the past, Myanmar's education policy was influenced by the United Kingdom, which was to divide the cooperation of the Myanmar people. As for now, it has been completely overturned. In the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, mutual cooperation between countries is the only way out for East Asia in the future. Regarding the Chinese expatriates in Myanmar, they have given Myanmar a lot of influence in culture, especially ancient Chinese culture, which has a great influence on Myanmar. I would like to express my gratitude here. As for the many Chinese who married Burmese in Myanmar, such Sino-Myanmar assimilation has produced very good results in culture."

Disclosure of Mission

The Myanmar Special Investigation Team, led by Ba Hian, came to China for a visit and arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday. In recent days, they attended various banquets in the city. The delegation also met with the Chinese Journalists Group at the 8th floor yesterday afternoon (10th) and disclosed the details of their mission to China. Ba Hian's speech is divided into the following:

Ba Hian first said: I have two missions on this trip. First, to study the contributions of the people in the rear of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere in the war. I have been ordered to study the various countries in East Asia and do my best to convey their strengths to our country after returning home to contribute to the Greater East Asia War. What needs to be done now is how Myanmar can cooperate in this war and strive for victory. We deeply realize that this Greater East Asia War is a matter of life and death for all East Asian nations. If they are defeated by the Anglo-American invaders, the East Asian nations will never be able to survive. Therefore, every East Asian people will never hope that the violent enemies of England and the United States will return to East Asia. Therefore, under this great era, the entire Myanmar, from the government to the people, are working hard to endure hardship and cooperate with the allied soldiers in Myanmar to jointly strive for final victory. The second is to seek the economic construction of our country and move towards the future of victory under the same goal. In addition, we will consider how to carry out construction after the war. These are the two major missions of our visit.

Thoughts on Visiting China

Then, the journalist group asked about their thoughts on this visit to China. Ba Hian was very gratified: (1) On this visit to China, they first went to Peiping. In Peiping, they met with important members of the North China Political Affairs Commission and saw that North China was struggling hard and achieving considerable progress. At the same time, they also visited the Palace Museum, which contains precious documents of China's five thousand years of history. Now, North China, from the government to the people, is working hard to contribute to the Greater East Asia War and has made the greatest contribution in the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. Regarding the economic situation in North China, Ba Hian expressed considerable satisfaction, and the North China Political Affairs Commission has made the greatest efforts to stabilize the economy in North China. (2) They then visited the capital of your country, Nanjing. When our delegation arrived in Nanjing, the most touching thing was that the people of the capital respected Dr. Sun Yat-sen. The whole country, from the government to the people, praised him as the father of the country, which was a great emotion for us. Dr. Sun is one of the world's great figures, and our delegation made a special trip to pay our respects to his mausoleum and lay wreaths to show our respect. When we were in Nanjing, we also met with important members of the National Government and talked with each other. The cooperation of the whole country, from the government to the people, is the greatest glory in the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. In addition, we also saw Chairman Chen Dai, who warmly welcomed our investigation. I believe that China and Myanmar will cooperate more closely in the future. (3) Shanghai is a gathering place for people from all over the world. In the past, it suffered from the occupation of Anglo-American forces. Now, under Mayor Chen's administration, expatriates from various countries have gradually come to know the policies of China. Our delegation has been in contact with various parties in Shanghai and has received a warm welcome, which is deeply appreciated. In the future, our East Asian compatriots will have closer ties and cooperation. I am very satisfied with this point of view. Finally, I hope that your country will also send personnel to Myanmar for investigation.

Entertaining in Shanghai

At 9:00 a.m. yesterday (10th), Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Wu Songbi went to the Washington Hotel on behalf of Mayor Chen to thank the Myanmar Special Investigation Team for visiting Mayor Chen the day before (9th). At 9:30 a.m., Minister Usami went to the hotel and was represented by Counselor Okazaki to thank the delegation. At 10:30 a.m., accompanied by Chen Gongzhan, a representative of the municipal government, the delegation went to the China United Film Company No. 1 Factory on Huashan Road to visit our country's film industry. General Manager Feng Jie, Deputy General Manager Zhang Shankun, Director of the Propaganda Department Ma Zongyao, and senior staff of the factory were all present to receive the guests. Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy in China, Kiichi Kishi, and Director of the Information Department of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy, ​​Matsudaira, also visited the factory and viewed "The Great Detective of the Dragon and the Tiger" and "Peking Man," which were being filmed at the factory. The delegation praised our country's film industry and did not leave until 11:30 a.m. Then, they returned to their residence at the Washington Hotel. At 1:00 p.m., they attended a luncheon hosted by Minister Usami, represented by Counselor Okazaki. Those present included Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Wu Songbi, Director of the Municipal Propaganda Department Liang Xiuyu, Japanese Naval Attaché Kondo, represented by Chief of the News Department Matsushima, Army Minister Kawamoto, represented by Chief of the News Department Debuchi, Information Minister Matsudaira, Investigator Ikenaga, German Consul General Feischer, and Consul General Ye Yaogong of Manchukuo. They had a pleasant conversation and raised their glasses in a warm atmosphere until they dispersed around 2:00 p.m.

### New Chat Society Tea Party Reception for the Burma Investigation Team

The Shanghai Press Association specially held a grand tea party yesterday (the 10th) at 5 PM on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, to receive the Burma Special Investigation Team. Dr. Ba Han arrived on time with all the members of the team. Under a warm reception, the atmosphere between the guests and hosts was extremely enthusiastic. Details are recorded as follows:

Tea Party Grand Occasion

Dr. Ba Han arrived on time with team members Su Nian, Ba Nian, and Nian Han, accompanied by Counselor Tanaka and Interpreter Otsubo. Also present were Secretary Morita from the Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy, Lieutenant Commander [blank space] from the Fleet Reporting Department, [blank space] Trustee, and others. From the Press Association, there were more than dozens of people, including directors Moriyama Takashi, Xu Liqiu (representing Yan Jiabao), Lu Guangjie, Hidaka [blank space] Ma, Lu Feng, Jiang [blank space] Guang (representing Wang Fu), and the association's general manager Ren [blank space] Peng, gathered together. First, Xu Liqiu, the chairman of the board for the month, delivered a welcome speech on behalf of Yan Jiabao, followed by Team Leader Ba Han's speech of thanks, expressing his boundless gratitude for the association's warm reception. Afterwards, refreshments were served, and the guests and hosts dispersed in joy after 6 PM.

Welcome Speech

Chairman Xu, representing Yan Jiabao, delivered a welcome speech, saying: The Burma Special Investigation Team, under the leadership of Dr. Ba Han, has honored our country with its presence. This trip has a very profound significance for the promotion of Sino-Burmese friendship and cooperation in the construction of the Greater East Asia. On behalf of all members of the Shanghai press, I extend my boundless welcome. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, various countries and nations that had long been oppressed by Britain and the United States have successively gained liberation. The Chinese people are extremely pleased to see your country regain its independence and freedom and assist Japan in carrying out the Greater East Asia War. Because what China wanted to do but could not do is now being undertaken by Japan and has been fully achieved. Another strong friend has been added to the path of Pan-Asianism that China has been pursuing. The Burma Special Investigation Team has brought the warmth and hope of the South to China, increasing our belief and determination in the Greater East Asia War. We deeply hope that Dr. Ba Han and his party will convey the situation here to the entire nation of Burma as our reciprocation. Finally, I wish good health to all members of the investigation team and the victorious completion of the Greater East Asia War.

Ba Han's Reply

Team Leader Ba Han replied with a speech, stating briefly: I am extremely grateful for the warm reception from your association today. Our team has visited various countries in the East, as well as visited your country, and arrived in Shanghai yesterday. You are all deeply aware of the past encroachment of British and American forces on East Asia. We, the people of East Asia, should unite from now on to overthrow the British and American aggressors. I express my infinite pleasure at today's reception. On this point, not only you gentlemen, but also our country and various countries in East Asia have such an understanding. From now on, we will work together to achieve the expected goals and strive for final victory under the goal of overthrowing British and American forces. However, there is still one situation that is the same in both our countries, that is, those who do not hesitate to curry favor with the enemy, Britain and the United States, to gain benefits, and [blank space] expect the restoration of British and American forces. However, the Burmese government will never allow such people with ulterior motives to exist and will severely eliminate and eradicate them.

### With the Rainy Season Approaching, Ways to Prevent Flooding in Western Shanghai

In recent years, every rainy season in western Shanghai has brought torrential water and mud, disrupting transportation. The municipal government and the former Public Works Department have tried to prevent this, but ultimately, due to limited funds, they have been unable to solve the problem thoroughly. Since the western Shanghai area was incorporated into the management of District One, the Public Works Office of District One has added detailed plans and spared no effort [blank space]. The reasons why accumulated water turns into floods after heavy rains are nothing more than [blank space] few roads, the diameter of the ditches is too small, and in the event of heavy rain, they cannot be discharged in time [blank space]. Relying on the riverbank flowing into the Suzhou River [blank space]. After the war, the number of residents increased sharply, and factories in the western district developed. All open spaces were mostly filled and houses were built, and riverbanks were also filled or thatched sheds were built, thus destroying the [blank space] water system of the riverbank [blank space]. Slum garbage and factory debris are dumped at will, causing the river [blank space] [blank space]. The water flow is not [blank space]. At present, the suitable cure belongs to the various roads [blank space]. Underneath, they are all replaced with new [blank space] types. Special water pumps are added at the main outlets, but due to economic materials [blank space] [blank space] fundraising, and the construction time is too long, affecting traffic is not easy to implement, so we have to retreat to the treatment [blank space] plan, and try to gradually reduce the flood area, and reduce the depth and time of water accumulation. The methods are [blank space] dredging the original ditch [blank space], [blank space] dredging the main riverbank, [blank space] burying ditches with larger diameters in areas with deeper flooding. This project is currently being actively carried out. It is thought that after half a year, the flooding in western Shanghai, although it cannot be completely eliminated, can be reduced to the minimum level.

### A Report on Mr. Chen Youren

— By Li Zhengchen

(Continued from the second page)

The political environment at the time did not allow him to devote himself to domestic affairs. "This won't work," he decided, "I'll drift on the sea," hoping to engage in "personal diplomacy" abroad as much as possible, to serve the motherland, and on the other hand, to exchange opinions with leaders from all sides and discuss post-war solutions. I still remember that three days before the outbreak of the Pacific War, Mr. Chen was still negotiating with Mr. Zheng, a representative sent by the authorities, regarding passport issues. The authorities not only intended to facilitate Mr. Chen's departure from the country but also expressed their best wishes. However, Mr. Chen's only aim was the passport, and he could only appreciate the good intentions. Therefore, the negotiations were delayed. Unexpectedly, the situation changed drastically, and the wish to drift on the sea became a vain hope. Instead, he was blown by the relentless wind and rain to Jiangnan.

Adversity easily makes people weary, but Mr. Chen has always been a revolutionary fighter with great aspirations. In these two years, not only has he not declined in the slightest, but he has also been 100% active. He is actively researching the future situation in the Far East; he is even more actively researching China's post-war political diplomacy; he is also actively researching the solutions to world post-war problems. And his thinking is still developing, still advancing. Once, when discussing his thoughts, he said to me with great joy: "I am at the height of my intellectual Power!"

I say that Mr. Chen has been active in these two years, and this is intellectual activity. This is a natural development in his environment. Since he is isolated from actual politics and has no political relationship with any party, he can only develop in thought and research.

Then, am I saying that Mr. Chen has no action? This depends on how people interpret the word "action." If saying words that can encourage and inspire people is action, I dare say that every conversation Mr. Chen has had with anyone can be called action. He has no political power, no soldiers, and no weapons. His only weapon is his thought. And what conveys his thought is his conversation.

Before "December 8th," Mr. Chen's conversations always resembled the style of a warrior in a struggle. But in these two years, he sometimes revealed the appearance of a seer, awakening people, moving them as if they were witnessing the final meeting between Bismarck and Wilhelm II, listening to Bismarck warning Wilhelm II. "December 8th" was a day to be rejoiced in Mr. Chen's historical concept. Before that, he was anxiously worried about the survival of the country. From that day on, he was relieved. The objective situation produced by "December 8th" made it unnecessary for him to worry about this issue anymore. But he had new worries. He worried about the drastically changing situation in the Far East in the future. For this reason, he could often transcend the flames of war and national hatred to speak. He could warn people as a seer.

Mr. Chen has always spoken without evasion. He would say whatever he wanted to say. After he returned to Shanghai the year before last, he published his opinions on the war situation based on this attitude, printed them in a small booklet, and distributed them to various parties. In this booklet, he objectively and frankly explained the meaning of "December 8th" for China's future and for Japan's future. While pointing out Japan's future destiny, he expected Japan's political figures to have the far-sightedness of the elder statesmen of the Meiji Restoration, resolutely abandon their past policies toward China, change their long-standing thinking toward China, and immediately end the Sino-Japanese war. For Japan's future, he believed that this was the only clear path. National hatred should be resolved rather than perpetuated, especially since the geographical situation of the Far East clearly indicates that the Chinese and Japanese nations should not be enemies in the future.

It is said that Mr. Chen's booklet has caused misunderstandings. It is said that some Japanese scholars have studied this booklet in detail and concluded that "Chen Youren is still pro-British and pro-American." This misunderstanding is just as unfounded as the misinterpretation that Mr. Chen was a communist because he had been to Moscow. I must tell those Japanese scholars that Mr. Chen will not be pro to anyone. He is only pro-China, and at the same time, he is concerned about Asia. If Japan were not an Asian country, he would never have published that booklet, he would never have spoken to you!

History is ruthless, and time is cruel. The path pointed out by Mr. Chen in that booklet the year before last is of course no longer applicable now, and it was not even applicable last year. I believe that those who misunderstood him will eventually become those who understand him the most. They will eventually weep bitterly and reread Mr. Chen's booklet!

I said above that Mr. Chen has been actively developing in thought and research during these two years. Since March of last year, because of certain rumors that made him feel unjustly accused, he has devoted himself more to research work. What he is researching is: first, China's post-war political and diplomatic problems; second, the solution to world post-war problems; and third, the theory and implementation of "Total democracy."

Mr. Chen has worked diligently and spent years studying these three issues. He is most anxious about China's post-war political problems. He hopes to find a solution that can allow all parties to coexist peacefully. Regarding post-war diplomacy, he is most anxious about the relationship between China and the Soviet Union. If the authorities do not handle it carefully, it may cause serious consequences. At the same time, he is deeply worried that the authorities have not properly cultivated up-and-coming talents in diplomacy, especially those who can preside over policy. He has unique insights on these issues, but unfortunately, he has not written them down yet.

Regarding the research on "Total democracy," he is very confident. He believes that the most powerful contribution to political thought in the West in recent decades is Marxism, and his "Total democracy" theory can make up for the shortcomings of the West's "limited democracy" and make up for the deficiencies of Marxism. During the discussion, he explained his entire theory in detail, but unfortunately, it has not been written into a book yet.

As for the solution to post-war problems, after five years of painstaking research, the theory has been completed, the principles are ready, and the title of the book has also been determined. The title is "The new dispensation." Unexpectedly, just as he was about to start writing, he fell ill. Although he dictated the theory of this book during his illness, which was recorded by Mrs. Chen, the recorded part is not much, and now only the outline remains.

Mr. Chen has always been "planning before acting" in his life and writing, and he is never hasty. When he writes an article, he first has a draft in his mind, so although he writes quickly, the time spent conceiving it is considerable. Among these three books, at least "The new dispensation" had a draft in his mind. If he could live for another three or four months, he would definitely be able to write it into a book. He often said: "Wait until I finish writing these three books, and then I can go and relax." He accumulated 70 years of experience, decades of accumulated thoughts, and five years of dedicated research, just to make a final contribution to the motherland and the world, but cruel fate made him die with his eyes closed. How cruel fate is!

Speaking of his learning and thought, a detailed explanation will have to wait for the future. Simply put, he is erudite and is known as a "living encyclopedia." He is extremely familiar with Western history and political geography. I am afraid that there is no second person in the country. In terms of learning, the strength of his life lies in his humility and seriousness. No matter who it is, if they have expertise in a certain field, he always welcomes in-depth discussions. For example, Mr. Zhang Min, a former professor at Jinan Guanghua University, wrote a paper on Marxism, which was a study of Das Kapital. Mr. Chen often had detailed discussions with Mr. Su Min even in his final illness. This example is enough to illustrate the rest. As for his thought, generally speaking, he is an evolutionist. The choice of all theories is based on whether there is Survival value. He is a studious and thoughtful person. He has his own unique opinions on everything and is never willing to parrot others. In terms of political theory, he also goes his own way, refusing to be attached to others. However, after his death, many people intended to praise him and said that he was a "follower of the Premier." Even Mr. Yan Junren said in his eulogy at the cremation ceremony that "Mr. Chen was a loyal follower of the Premier." As far as I know, if Mr. Chen could have heard this sentence in the coffin that day and stood up, I believe he would have stood up and smiled and made a very polite protest. He remembered that once I discussed Sun Yat-sen with Mr. Chen, and he said to me: "Regarding Mr. Sun, I am unwilling to criticize him, and I am also unwilling to comment on his political theory. Mr. Sun was a great revolutionary leader. Among the Chinese figures of his era, he can be said to be a relatively progressive and modern one." As for Mr. Chen's political thought, he believes that he is "between the middle and the left," not right, not left, and not un-moderate. He admires Sun Yat-sen, there is no doubt about that, but to say that he is a "follower of the Premier" seems quite unnecessary. (To be continued)

### List of Plague Hospitals

It is now summer, and epidemics are prevalent. Shanghai is a place where people from all directions gather, and there are many poor and sick people.

### Holy Mother's Orphanage Urgently Seeks Assistance

The Holy Mother's Orphanage in Xujiahui, Shanghai, has been established for more than 70 years. It takes in newborns, from breastfeeding to reading, learning skills, choosing a spouse, and making a living. It is all presided over by Catholic nuns from beginning to end. Currently, it houses 170 to 180 children from infancy to two or three years old, 150 children from four or five to fifteen years old, more than 100 people over fifteen years old, and more than 40 disabled people, totaling more than 500 people.

The orphanage's expenses have always relied on donations from overseas philanthropists. Since the outbreak of the war, donations have been cut off. There are no funds for daily expenses, and the cost of living is increasing day by day, so it has fallen into an unprecedented predicament. Children need the most nutrition. In the past, milk was the main food for babies, but now they can only fill their stomachs with porridge and milk powder. Children aged two or three are fed porridge by older orphans. The older children also have to mix sweet potatoes and corn into their three meals a day to fill their stomachs. This has reached the point where there is no more room for frugality, but monthly expenses still need to be met. At this difficult time, facing great difficulties in the future, we have no choice but to ask warm-hearted people to act with compassion, open their wallets generously, and hope to obtain support, so that we do not turn to ditches and strongholds. This is very fortunate. If you want to donate, you can send it directly to the orphanage on East Xujiahui Road, or call 70235, and we will send someone to collect it, or we can collect it on behalf of the orphanage. All benevolent men and women from all walks of life are very welcome to visit.

### Results of Children's Health Competition Announced the Day Before Yesterday

The Shanghai YWCA reported that many people participated in the competition to promote children's health to families across the city. The results were announced publicly in the YWCA auditorium the day before yesterday afternoon, and Mrs. Gu Huiquing gave the awards. The first place went to Ms. Qu Jingli, the beloved daughter of Dr. Qu Zude, a famous doctor in Shanghai, who is only nine and a half months old and the youngest competitor in this competition. Her weight is 23 pounds, and her height is 31 centimeters, both of which exceed the normal standard, and there are no defects in any part of her body.

### Providing Free Medical Treatment

Shanghai Plague Hospital No. 25 Xizang Road The Shanghai Plague Hospital's Plague Department started outpatient service on July 1. Gold needle medicine is free of charge. Seriously ill patients can also be hospitalized for free. The daily number of outpatients is about 300 or more, with acute gastroenteritis and dysentery being the most common. Yesterday, the weather was hot, and the number of people was even more crowded, with more than 400 outpatients. However, the hospital's expenses are huge. In terms of medicine, rice, and fuel alone, it costs nearly one million yuan per month, so we hope that the community will be enthusiastic, not shirk responsibility, and donate actively. If you want to donate, please send it directly to the hospital on Xizang Road, or we can collect it on behalf of the hospital.

Dr. Zhao Yuguang Dr. Zhao Guangyu, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, practices at Hongji Tang Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop at the intersection of Caojia Bridge in Laoximen. He has unique insights on typhoid fever, damp fever, and dysentery. Recently, due to the hot weather and rampant diseases, in order to relieve the poor and sick, he provides free medical treatment and medicine from 8:00 to 9:00 am every day.

### Donating Poverty Relief Funds

Poverty relief funds are the second of our services. All poor people who are unable to maintain their lives will be introduced to arts and crafts institutes and breeding gardens based on their circumstances and taught living skills to become productive members of society.

Donating poverty relief funds to relieve the poor is the spirit of human mutual assistance and a virtue of goodness.

— Written by Iwata Toyoo Translated by Ocean

Cherry Blossoms and Anchors (6)

——Congratulations on winning the championship——Masato.

When Longfu received such a telegram, he was truly surprised and overjoyed. To be honest, Longfu never thought that Masato would see such a small news report.

Looking at the sending address, it was Wu Town. So, I determined that the warship Masato was on had already entered the home port.

(I really want to go to Wu Town. And then stop by my hometown!)

The so-called stop by means that Longfu had nothing to say to his parents. But because Longfu became famous overnight, he had the qualifications to return home. Now, he didn't want to go home. When the painter Ichiki advised him, he certainly thought it was a good opportunity to go home, but when he saw his own paintings at the exhibition, they were full of flaws. So, he felt the need to work harder, and the idea of going home after becoming a famous painter disappeared.

But when he saw Masato's telegram, he suddenly wanted to go to Wu Town. He also wanted to see Masato's face and see the warships in Wu Town. So, he thought that going to Wu Town was a matter of course.

It seemed that his father and sister did not know that Longfu had received the Navy Minister's Award, and even after the exhibition ended, he did not receive any information. Longfu decided to go home, because he could tell his father about winning the award.

On the last day of the exhibition, the award ceremony was held at the headquarters of the Maritime Patriotic Association in the Harajuku district. In addition to Longfu, there were other winners, and their prizes were received from the examiners wearing full dress uniforms.

But Longfu's prize was received from the former staff member representing the Minister, wearing a staff officer badge. After the closing ceremony, there was a luncheon. The colonel turned to look at Longfu and said:

"You are very knowledgeable about warships. Have you ever served in the Navy?"

"No."

Longfu answered with a bit of embarrassment. But he didn't separate it out. He hated the fact that he became a naval painter because he hated the "Navy."

After the awards ceremony luncheon, he ran straight back to his apartment. When he opened the paper package, he saw that in addition to a certificate, it also contained a prize of 1,000 yuan.

(How did I get so much?)

Longfu was a little embarrassed to receive such a large reward for his debut work. But this money, in addition to buying some good souvenirs for his parents and sister, and setting aside money for going home, most of it can be used as research funds in the future, so he jumped up happily.

The next day, when he went to the department store to pick up his work, he firmly remembered to bring a photographer. This was because he wanted to send photos of the painting to Masato and his parents. After everything was taken care of, he ran to the Ichiki's house.

He returned the picture frame to Ichiki and said a lot of words of gratitude. Finally, he said:

"Following your advice, I will go back to my hometown!" (115)
