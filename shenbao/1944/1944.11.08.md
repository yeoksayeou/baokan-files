### Surprise Attack by Japanese Air Force: Saipan and Tinian Islands; Over 20 Enemy Large Aircraft Destroyed

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 6:00 PM on the 7th: Japanese air units attacked enemy airfields on Saipan and Tinian Islands in the early hours of the 7th. In the Saipan area, they bombed and strafed enemy large aircraft that were assembling, destroying or damaging more than twenty of them. At the same time, they bombed and set fire to several airfield facilities. In the Tinian Island area, all attacks hit the enemy airfield, but the results could not be confirmed due to cloud cover. One Japanese aircraft did not return to base in this operation.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – In order to check the Philippine operations and destroy the source of Japanese military strength, the enemy Americans have repeatedly considered strategic bombing of the Japanese mainland. Recently, they have been continuously assembling long-range B-29 bombers at the newly completed bases in the Mariana Islands. In response, the Japanese air force launched a preemptive strike on November 3rd. At dawn on the 7th, the Japanese air force again made a long-range attack on the enemy airfields on Saipan and Tinian, bravely launching a fierce assault. The Japanese air force's surprise attack on Saipan and Tinian Islands at dawn on the 7th surrounded forty B-29 aircraft that were gathering at Aslito Airfield in southern Saipan, dropping bombs with pinpoint accuracy and strafing them repeatedly at extremely low altitude, destroying or setting fire to more than twenty B-29 aircraft and destroying or setting fire to airfield facilities. The entire airfield was turned into a sea of fire. At the same time, a Japanese unit attacked the airfield at the northern end of Saipan, inflicting great damage. The Tinian attack force infiltrated the enemy airfield airspace under cover of dark clouds and heavily bombed all its facilities, but the results could not be confirmed due to the dark clouds. The suicide attack unit at extremely low altitude, although unable to clearly ascertain the results due to the enemy's chaotic searchlight fire, was certain that Tinian Island had been dealt the same heavy blow as Saipan Island. During this Japanese attack, forty B-29 aircraft were found assembled on Saipan, which indicates that the enemy is preparing a large air force on Saipan, attempting to attack the Japanese mainland. The Japanese attack can be said to have preempted the enemy's plans.

Southern Frontline Base, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Japanese air units bombed enemy aircraft on Morotai Island on the 6th, destroying more than twenty enemy aircraft. Several enemy air bases were hit and caught fire, with both the north and south of the airfield engulfed in flames.

Editorial

### Strengthening Sino-Japanese Cooperation

The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration have each reached their first anniversary on October 30th and November 6th respectively. It is during the autumn when the stubborn enemy is making a last-ditch effort and the allied forces have gained a victory in the Philippine Sea, that we welcome these two anniversaries at this important juncture. We deeply feel the need for closer cooperation between China and Japan. Only with greater cooperation between China and Japan can we achieve greater results in the continental war against the Chongqing communists and the Anglo-American naval and air war.

Since the Greater East Asia War, China and Japan have cooperated closely and jointly defeated the enemy, and the record is clear. However, in order to ensure victory, we need to make even greater efforts at present to make the cooperation between the two countries more perfect and flawless.

The first is to strengthen mutual trust. The Anglo-American-Chongqing faction is currently using various propaganda schemes, hoping to undermine our cooperation. Therefore, we need to thoroughly and sincerely trust each other, so as to use facts to shatter the alienation. On the Chinese side, it is not only necessary to fully believe in Japan's sincerity in liberating East Asia, but also to trust that Japan will eventually be able to eliminate the power of Britain and the United States, and should never be shaken or confused by the enemy's distorted propaganda or unfounded rumors. As for the Japanese side, it is not only necessary to absolutely believe in the National Government, but also to trust the various forces of the Chinese people. On the one hand, it should give the National Government greater power, and on the other hand, it should give the Chinese people more convenience, so that everyone can work together seamlessly.

The second is to correctly exert the power of China. China's material and human resources are abundant, and its importance in the Greater East Asia War is self-evident. However, to exert China's abundant power, it is necessary to specifically grasp China's actual environment. All policies of China and Japan related to exerting China's material and human resources should be in accordance with China's actual situation. Otherwise, the losses on both sides will definitely be great. For example, the current controlled economy, in some places, due to being too decisive, affects production, making China's material resources unable to be fully exerted as ideally, which is not the best policy. The above-mentioned National Government, trusting the Chinese people, and allowing the Chinese people to act without too many restrictions, is also a necessary condition for exerting China's power. And exerting China's power to contribute to the Greater East Asia War and strive for the liberation of the East Asian people is the basic goal of Sino-Japanese cooperation.

The third is to stabilize the livelihood of the Chinese people. All strength lies in the people. If the people cannot even stabilize their minimum standard of living, it is difficult to make them contribute great strength. Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the highest economic advisor of the National Government, also said in a speech in Shanghai after returning from Japan on the 4th of this month: "...Therefore, making China's resources a combat power, especially stabilizing the livelihood of the Chinese people, is the main focus:" and also said: "...The two things of making China's resources a combat power and building a new China still take stabilizing the livelihood of the people as a prerequisite:" (See the 5th Japanese newspaper). But undeniably, the current livelihood problem in China has reached an extremely serious stage. Therefore, how to find a way to stabilize the livelihood of the Chinese people is also one of the basic things to consolidate Sino-Japanese cooperation.

In short, in this urgent situation, China and Japan must strengthen cooperation. Under sincere mutual assistance, let the power of China be fully exerted, so as to strive for the victory of the war.

### Japanese New Submarine Fleet Threatens Enemy Sea Supply; U.S. Damage Repair Ships Carry Out Emergency Repairs

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese submarine fleet has launched a long-range attack on the Pacific coast of the United States, and then continued its elusive activities in the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. Therefore, there is no doubt that Japanese submarines are still active off the U.S. Pacific coast. On October 3rd, two enemy aircraft carriers were sunk in the waters east of Halmahera, and five enemy aircraft carriers and ships were sunk during the naval battle in the Philippine Sea. On November 3rd, one enemy Essex-class aircraft carrier was sunk in the waters east of Leyte. The achievements of the Japanese submarine fleet are increasing, and several transport ships have been sunk off the enemy U.S. Pacific coast. The fate of the Pacific war situation will gradually turn into a sea supply war, and the weaknesses of the United States have gradually increased. Today, the activities of submarines will make its supply more and more difficult. Therefore, although the threat of the enemy United States is great, the examples of the Japanese new submarine fleet will be able to break through all the enemy's vigilance.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The U.S. mobile unit is carrying out emergency repairs on the damaged and surviving fleets, so that they will reappear in the waters east of the Philippines. However, the enemy forces landing on Leyte Island are subjected to relentless attacks day and night by the Japanese Navy Air Force. Its connections with the sweeping forces are almost completely cut off. Land offensives have also failed to succeed. Three weeks have passed since the landing, and they have only fought isolated and helpless battles. Therefore, the enemy mobile unit does not hesitate to spend a long time to carry out only emergency repairs on the surviving fleet, and must urgently reinforce Leyte again. Since October 30th, not a single enemy aircraft has been seen in the entire city of the Philippines. Enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the Manila and Clark areas on the 5th, and the Japanese superior air units, waiting for the opportunity to move, suddenly intercepted them, annihilating more than ten of them and sinking three enemy aircraft carriers.

Recently, due to the sharp reduction in the allocation of various cigarettes, supply cannot meet demand, and supervision of designated merchants has become even stricter. It is reported that the association recently discovered that Renchang Tobacco Shop at 412 Guangdong Road was privately hoarding rationed cigarettes and reselling them on the black market. The shop was given a suspension of rationing as a punishment to serve as a warning to others, and citizens are urged to report illegal cigarette shops for investigation.

### Industrial Circles Plan to Restore the Inventors Association

At this decisive stage, the concentration of specialized technical personnel is urgently needed. The mobilization of materials for war and the improvement of production technology, research, and invention are of great importance.

Yu Binqi, the inventor of the Yu-style Chinese typewriter, and dozens of others have started to reorganize it. With the endorsement of the authorities, preparations are now actively underway. A consulting office has been set up at No. 108 Jiangning Road (Gordon Road). Anyone with technical expertise or who has made inventions, regardless of whether they are in science, engineering, or chemistry, can apply for membership. The association can also provide assistance with funding if needed.

### Life Is Difficult in Shanghai: Increasing Number of Residents Returning to Their Hometowns

Recently, prices in this city have risen, and the burden on small citizens is increasing day by day. Salary income is not enough to cover daily expenses. Due to the difficulty of living, many ordinary citizens are making plans to return to their hometowns. In the past ten days, the number of families returning to their hometowns has been quite large. Most of these residents leaving Shanghai are traveling by water on ships because it is convenient to carry luggage. On the direct Shanghai-Suzhou express ships, most of the passengers feel that life in Shanghai is difficult, and the personal luggage of each passenger often exceeds ten pieces, indicating that the burden of living in this city has reached a serious stage for residents, so they are leaving for their hometowns. In the inland areas around Suzhou and Changzhou, not only are prices lower, but the prices of basic food are several times lower than in Shanghai. The guilds of the banking and financial industries in this city will convene meetings in the coming days to discuss and decide on issues such as members' capital increases and improved business procedures to standardize operations.

### Recent Situation of Anhui Provincial Government

By Ruocheng

-- Interview with Provincial Governor Luo

Anhui Province is also a very important province in the peace zone. In terms of transportation, it has the Jinpu Railway, the Huainan Railway, and the Jiangnan Railway. In terms of economy, it has Wuhu rice and Huainan coal. Since Mr. Luo Junqiang took office as governor, according to word of mouth from various sources, he has indeed brought a refreshing spirit to the promotion of provincial administration. It is said that Governor Luo recently came to Shanghai on official business from Anhui. This newspaper, in order to understand the recent situation of Anhui provincial administration, sent a reporter to conduct an interview. We are grateful to Governor Luo for personally receiving us and providing much information about the overview of Anhui provincial administration.

Imagination Before the Interview

The reporter had not met Mr. Luo before, but before interviewing Mr. Luo, there seemed to be a contour of imagination in my mind, because from various rumors, I knew that Mr. Luo has the spirit of a young politician who dares to act and get things done quickly. He is a relatively capable member among the senior officials of the Nanjing National Government. The late Justice Zhang Leibo, who succeeded Mr. Luo as head of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, once publicly praised Mr. Luo for having several very solid achievements during his tenure. We believe that the first thing in serving as an official is to be willing to work. Whether it is done well or not, and whether there are achievements or not, is a secondary issue, because many environmental problems are involved. If you are willing to work and the environment is good, of course you will have satisfactory results. If you are willing to work and the environment is not good, you will at least have half the results. At the same time, you can learn from the experience of why you didn't do well. Only those who are perfunctory and unwilling to work, even if the environment is very good, have no possibility of doing well at all, and of course there is no possibility of talking about achievements. Because I first knew that Mr. Luo was willing to work, and after meeting and talking with him, it confirmed my imagination even more. Mr. Luo has an honest mind, enthusiastic emotions, and especially the spirit of being down-to-earth and willing to work. The following are the main points of Mr. Luo's speech.

A Glimpse of Public Security

The Anhui Provincial Government currently manages thirty-two units, which are thirty counties and two special districts. The special district office is equivalent to the county government. The area under its jurisdiction is about half of the entire Anhui Province. The other half is nothing more than the New Fourth Army and the labor force from Chongqing.

As for the strength of the New Fourth Army, it cannot be denied that it has an environment for its existence. They are good at using "border areas" for activities. For example, between several adjacent counties, they establish a border area or set up an office, or set up a border area government of a certain county. Our provincial government or county government guards the boundaries of the province or county and does its best within its own boundaries, while they use this point to divide a corner of several counties, establish a border area, and move back and forth to carry out activities in the border area, gradually expanding their sphere of influence. Therefore, it is difficult to calculate the number of the New Fourth Army. Currently, their military strength may be above the military strength of the Anhui provincial government. However, it is not concentrated but fragmented.

Currently, there are nearly 30,000 security teams and police in Anhui Province. The task of the police is the same as that of the security team in maintaining public security, and they have considerable combat power. In addition, there are about three divisions of the National Government's regular army, which are under the jurisdiction of the Pacification Director and are not under the command of the provincial governor. Our military strength ensures the peaceful life of most places within the jurisdiction. We certainly dare not boast, but there is no problem in several larger cities such as Bengbu, Wuhu, and Anqing.

Unfortunately, in the border areas occupied by the New Fourth Army, and in other remote places, the so-called Central Relief Army and Advance Army and other similar military organizations from Chongqing, some are related to Chongqing, and some are indigenous people who are not related at all. They have no political views and do not abide by order in their actions. The people in this area suffer the most.

The Effectiveness of Reorganizing Tax Revenue

When I first took office, the provincial government's financial revenue was only more than 2 million yuan per month. This amount could not maintain a government office at all. Political efficiency and clean governance were of course out of the question. Now, after reorganizing tax revenue, the six-month budget has reached 750 million yuan, and the monthly expenditure is more than 120 million yuan, which is sixty times more than when I took office. This budget includes county administrative expenses, police and security expenses, and part of military expenses, because the provincial government is responsible for 40% of the Pacification Commissioner's military expenses.

Reorganizing tax revenue was originally the source of increasing revenue. After the agency personnel and methods of collecting taxes were improved, tax revenue increased forty times. However, reorganizing taxes is not increasing taxes. Recently, since October 1, the tax system has been changed again, and tax revenue has improved even more. To date, revenue has increased tenfold, and the tax rate is still the same as before. This proves that the biggest problem with past tax revenue was rampant corruption. When corruption is reduced, tax revenue naturally increases.

Special attention is paid to the quality and treatment of tax personnel. The directors of tax collection in various places are publicly recruiting experts in newspapers. Three-quarters are university graduates, two-thirds of whom have served in the financial industry for many years, and many have come from Shanghai. They are given special high salaries in the hope that they will not be corrupt. Since the trial operation began on October 1, considerable results have been seen.

The Treatment of Civil Servants

Improving the treatment of civil servants is my consistent proposition. After taking office, the first step was to make it the same as the central government. Now, the treatment of general civil servants is higher than that of various agencies in Nanjing. Senior management officials, such as county magistrates and department heads, are given special increases. At the same time, special attention is paid to tax personnel and police personnel, because these people have the most opportunities to contact the public and are most likely to be corrupt and solicit bribes. For example, in larger cities such as Zhazhao, the treatment of tax and police personnel has increased up to fifty times compared to before. Since July, the provincial government has ensured that the ration rice for its subordinates is not delayed no matter what.

Difficulties in Local Administration

There are currently about two difficulties in feeling local administration: First, all facilities often cannot be done according to the intentions of the provincial government and are affected by other environments. Second, the current political organization and the politicians are, on the whole, really not enough to cope with the current situation. In other words, the current situation is a very extraordinary situation, and quick action and integrity are required. How can the current politicians be competent? When it comes to integrity, of course, we must first stabilize our lives. It is not enough for me to be well-fed and well-clothed. I also need my family to be well-fed and well-clothed. Although the government has this intention, it cannot do it absolutely. As far as Anhui Province is concerned, it can only do about 50%.

Secondly, from any perspective, the various forces in China are nothing more than mixing in the cracks. The successive victories of the allied Japanese against the enemy Anglo-American war were by no means a fluke. Decades of preparation and decades of self-improvement led to this. The peace movement has been struggling in difficulties for several years. In the future, we hope to get rid of mixing in the cracks, and we must make greater efforts and struggle more arduously!
