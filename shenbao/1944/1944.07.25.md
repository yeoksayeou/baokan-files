### Courageous Advance

Following the completion of his cabinet formation, Prime Minister Koiso Kuniaki of the Allied Nation delivered his first broadcast, demonstrating to the nation a resolute belief in courageously leaping forward to pioneer new horizons and achieving certain victory, which is of profound significance. A nation is a collective of its people, and the nation's achievements depend on the efforts of its people. If the people can all courageously leap forward and advance with vigor, how can the nation not prosper?

We have stated that the Greater East Asia War is a revolutionary war of liberation. Therefore, for the sake of maintaining their century-long exploitation of East Asia's interests, the Anglo-Americans will undoubtedly struggle with all their might. The Greater East Asia War is the result of a century of oppression, and the success of the Greater East Asia War is inevitable, like the inexorable spread of fire. No one can stop our victory in the Greater East Asia War. However, during the course of the war, and when the enemy is making a desperate last stand, we must use our utmost strength to control them. On the one hand, we must endure hardship and toil; on the other hand, we must exert all our strength to advance courageously and defeat the enemy in a single blow.

Former Prime Minister Tojo stated in his talk on the 18th, "Today is truly the best opportunity to annihilate our enemies and determine the final outcome. At this moment, to protect our Imperial nation, we have no choice but to advance. With no illusions in our hearts, and disregarding life and death, we must恪守战训,倾举全力,迅速灭敌 (恪守战训,倾举全力,迅速灭敌: adhere strictly to combat training, exert all our strength, and swiftly annihilate the enemy)". The statements of both former and current Prime Ministers demonstrate the Allied Nation's national policy, its thorough and unwavering commitment, and its consistency from beginning to end.

Courageous advance is not empty talk, but a manifestation of actual achievements. In this cabinet reshuffle, General Koiso Kuniaki, at the age of 65, was reinstated from reserve duty to active service, best representing the spirit of "挺身躍起 (挺身躍起: courageously leaping forward)," "老當益壯 (老當益壯: vigorous in old age)," and courageous advance. In this great era, all citizens should contribute to the nation. The resurgence of veteran and experienced leaders of the Allied Nation will further encourage the soldiers of the Greater East Asia War. This spiritual encouragement will further strengthen the "敵愾同仇 (敵愾同仇: common hatred of the enemy)" mentality of all the peoples of Greater East Asia. Everyone must realize that now is the best time, regardless of gender or age, to contribute to the nation, using the strength of the entire Greater East Asian peoples to exchange for the independence, freedom, and liberation of the entire Greater East Asian peoples, and exchanging temporary pain for permanent benefits. This is the responsibility of everyone at present.

The Allied Nation's cabinet has been reorganized and is ready. Over the past few years, the policies of the Allied Nation have truly been advancing moment by moment and striving step by step. The open acknowledgement of the Saipan Island incident without evasion strengthens the people's faith. The cabinet reshuffle without hesitation, resolutely implemented, further increases the people's courage. Everything indicates that the entire nation, from top to bottom, is determined to advance courageously on the road to the one and only final victory. No hardship can stop this determination, and no sacrifice can extinguish the strong progress. All the people are calmly awaiting the opportunity for the final blow, which is being prepared and carried out at every moment, concentrating and storing all the strength. This final blow can be fatal to Britain and the United States, and can turn the entire Greater East Asia around.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Kawashima, Director of the Information Department of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, stated on the 23rd, explaining the intention to support the new cabinet, that the birth of the new cabinet is a matter of great concern to the entire nation. The speed of its establishment and the strength of its structure have enlightened the nation's mood and can be said to have refreshed people's hearts. This refreshment of people's hearts lies in arousing the deep-seated loyalty in the people's hearts and planting a seed of national autonomy. It is not just government collaborators, but also the basis for warfare should be based on the people. Therefore, it is necessary for the people to absolutely trust the government and for the government to absolutely care for the people's politics. Furthermore, making the people understand the true situation of the times should not create timidity. It is hoped that the government will have a great and straightforward attitude of governing with the people. In the future, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association will cooperate with the new cabinet, but this cooperation will not be merely following blindly, like its partisans, but rather to support what should be supported, so that the people's national politics can advance grandly.

Xinjing, 24th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Zhang of Manchukuo met with reporters and issued a statement, the main points of which are as follows: At this decisive moment, the Allied Nation has changed its cabinet and formed a stronger war cabinet, to which Manchukuo is immensely excited. What is particularly gratifying is that I have known the new Prime Minister Koiso since the founding of Manchukuo, and in the early days of Manchukuo's establishment, much of the important foundational work depended on the strength of General Koiso. General Koiso is shouldering this extraordinary situation, gathering the total strength of Japan and Greater East Asia, and I am confident that he will be able to complete the Greater East Asia War and achieve final victory. Furthermore, Navy Minister Yonai is known for his political experience and is a respected elder statesman of the Japanese Navy. The ministers under these two generals are also powerful figures. I now declare that Manchukuo will at any time be one with Japan, complete the Greater East Asia liberation war, and advance towards the path of defeating the Anglo-Americans and building a new world. The responsibility that Manchukuo must bear to complete the war is becoming increasingly important, so we will exert all our strength to consolidate the defense of local border areas and enhance combat power.

Judging from the experience of General Koiso, he will not only inspire the war will of the Japanese people, but also inspire the people of Greater East Asia to gradually strive for progress. Moreover, many of the new cabinet members are his former acquaintances. Taking the case of Foreign Minister and Minister of Greater East Asia Shigemitsu as an example, we can know that Mr. Shigemitsu will continue to implement his future policies for Greater East Asia. This is a matter for rejoicing in the Greater East Asia. Here, in addition to doing our best to assist in the completion of the Greater East Asia War, we also place great trust in the unchanging policies of the new cabinet.

From the perspective of foreigners, the current Japanese system is a healthy period, and the future of the new cabinet is greatly anticipated.

### Implementation Plan for Increased Military Production to Be Actively Promoted

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - Before the formation of the new cabinet, the heavy industry sector paid unusual attention to the selection of the Minister of Munitions. When the Koiso cabinet was established and Ginjiro Fujiwara took office as Minister of Munitions, they expressed great trust. During the Tojo cabinet, the Munitions Ministry was established to enhance military production, aiming to rapidly plan production. The ministry adjusted the scheduled production and formed a Scheduled Production Adjustment Council, formulated the Council on Implementation Guidelines for Adjustment, and, in order to establish a responsible production system, formulated the Munitions Company Law, designated munitions companies, established a civil administration department system, clarified the production department labor system, and conducted administrative inspections by cabinet advisors. It has made great contributions to the production efforts of the mining sector. In order to plan and establish a domestic self-sufficiency system, the Tojo cabinet studied emergency development policies for domestic minerals such as iron ore, improved the treatment of workers in coal mines and other mines, and implemented various incentive systems. Although the Munitions Ministry has only been established for a short time, various policies and measures have been prepared, and it is expected that the new Minister of Munitions will strongly implement them.

After arriving in Fukuoka, Chen took a train to Tokyo. In addition to paying respects to the Chairman, he also visited the Ise Grand Shrine to pray for the Chairman's early recovery and the early victory of the Greater East Asia War. He arrived safely in Tokyo at 9:00 a.m. on the 23rd and stayed at the Imperial Hotel. When interviewed by reporters, he was asked about the Chairman's condition. He replied that the Chairman had been receiving treatment in Japan, following the doctor's treatment program, and his spirit and physical strength were improving daily. The progress was very good, and he would definitely recover within the scheduled period. This was all due to the careful treatment of the doctors of the Allied Nation and the concern of the authorities, for which the entire nation was extremely grateful. After returning to China, he would tell the people of Guangdong, who would be even more encouraged. He also said that in the past few days, he had observed that the Japanese people's war spirit was high, their lives were serious, and their spirits were tense, with a strong belief in winning the Greater East Asia War. He was very impressed. Chen is scheduled to visit the Meiji Shrine and the Yasukuni Shrine on the 25th, and then visit various authorities.

### Concentrate Strength to Increase Production, Break into Decisive Battle Posture; Discussions at Branches of Japanese Central Cooperation Council

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - At the branch discussion meetings of the Japanese Central Cooperation Council on the 23rd, members of the 3rd and 5th divisions, based on their past experience, frankly expressed their opinions on key issues such as current labor mobilization, production technology, military production increase, and opening up of bottlenecks. The government paid special attention to this and sent representatives to attend and explain in detail the government's views and future handling methods, which is highly anticipated. The situation of the two divisions is summarized below. Regarding the issue of mobilizing students, it was said that now is not the time to focus on facilities and mechanisms in factories. Everything should be abandoned to break into a decisive battle posture. The issue of students today should also be considered with equal emphasis on both learning and labor, that is, 学勤并重(学勤并重). In short, under today's situation, special attention should be paid to labor, and all strength should be concentrated on increasing production. However, most people have not been able to understand the current situation, so improvements and maintenance of factory mechanisms have still been problematic. However, the current period is extremely important, and students should not pursue the issue of factory facilities. Mr. Fujino, Director of the Vocational Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Education, expressed his opinion on this, saying that the mobilization of students should always be based on the national purpose and national needs. Efforts should be made to guide issues related to admission. From the next academic year, the Ministry of Education will supervise the examination plans of higher vocational schools to determine the current capabilities of students, set standards for future education, and make them the foundation of Japanese education. More attention will be paid to this point to make them standard Japanese citizens. Regarding the issue of conscription, it was decided to implement measures for conscripting industrial personnel. For military work, labor inspections will be carried out on both men and women after the age of 20, with the hope of forming an industrial reserve army. Furthermore, the conscription system is not limited to factories; it should also be implemented in mines. Therefore, various opinions were raised regarding the excessive reallocation of existing labor. It was also suggested that women's volunteer corps should be assigned specialized female instructors, and that the content of company management should be disclosed to laborers. Finally, it was suggested that a comprehensive association of Japanese industrial and technical experts should be organized to meet the needs of the war situation. Mr. Mizuno served as the chairman of the 5th division meeting. During the meeting, various opinions were raised on increasing military production, opening up bottlenecks, and mobile labor in factories, among other points. The councilors also expressed their opinions separately, emphasizing that the anti-aircraft measures in factories were not perfect. In today's situation where air raids are inevitable, the most important thing is the preparation of relocation sites and machinery supplements for factories. From the perspective of labor mobilization, the remnants of liberalism and the attitude of pursuing profits still exist in the corporate system, which is regrettable. It is hoped that Mr. Kitano, Head of the Documentation Section of the Ministry of Munitions, will thoroughly urge the implementation of the Munitions Company Law.

### U.S. Aggression Against China Exposes Ambition; Wallace's Remarks Worth Noting

Central News Agency Report - Wallace arrived in Seattle on July 9 via Canada, and had a meeting with U.S. President Roosevelt for about two hours. Wallace is Roosevelt's most trusted disciple, and his words fully reflect Roosevelt's thinking. However, he was not nominated during the U.S. Vice Presidential nomination on the 21st of this month, because Roosevelt believed that Wallace could succeed him, but now this idea has been shattered. The question is how Wallace will advise President Roosevelt after returning to the country, and how he will address the nation. Here is a special report: After visiting Chongqing, Wallace witnessed the living conditions and lifestyles of the local people and proposed that they should be the same as those in the United States. Wallace said that if the lifestyles of the two peoples can be the same, then the youth and trade of China should be developed as much as possible to change the new world of East Asia. Looking at Wallace's remarks, it can be imagined that the U.S. economic aggression against China has reached its final stage. Wallace also said, "It is necessary to develop and prosper the Pacific coast, because Seattle is a suitable place for economic development towards Asia, and it is planned to expand Washington greatly to develop culture towards Asia, especially the west coast of the United States, which is already highly developed, and now we should further develop Asia." If the above points can be implemented, then it can make trade with China and the Soviet Union in Asia more developed. In this way, the people of the western United States will become richer. The current economic development of the United States cannot be said to have reached its peak, and we should further actively contribute economically to Asia. Wallace also said, "Although my visit to China this time was very short, I felt this way after witnessing the underdeveloped state of agriculture and industry in China." Based on the above remarks, we can know Wallace's opinions and Roosevelt's ambition and dream of creating a "China Americanized". At the same time, we can understand the purpose of Wallace's main argument to Roosevelt.

### Night Battle Unfolds on Miyakojima Island; Japanese Garrison Inflicts Heavy Damage on Enemy; Enemy Landing Attempt on Tinian Island Foiled

A Certain Japanese Base in the Central Pacific, 24th (Central News Agency) - The enemy's counter-offensive against the Mariana Islands in the Central Pacific has intensified since the occupation of Saipan, with repeated bombings of Tinian, Rota, and Miyakojima. On the 21st, they finally invaded Miyakojima. At dawn on the 21st, dozens of enemy transport ships, under the cover of a mobile force off the coast of厚之(Atsushi), approached the west coast of Miyakojima. Dozens of boats were divided into two routes. One route, with 120 landing craft, landed in the Akash湾(Akashi Bay) area at 7:20 a.m., and the other route, with 20 boats, invaded 昭和湾(Showa Bay) at around 8:00 a.m. and began landing. The exact strength of the enemy has not been determined. According to what was determined that night, the American forces in the 明石湾(Akashi Bay) area consisted of one and a half divisions, with about 150 amphibious tanks. The enemy forces in the 昭和湾(Showa Bay) area were also more than half a division, with 50 tanks, totaling two divisions. The Japanese coastal defense forces intercepted the enemy near the coast. In the 昭和湾(Showa Bay) area alone, they destroyed 30 of the 50 attacking enemy tanks. In addition, many troop-laden boats were sunk or destroyed by the Japanese army, so the landing enemy was extremely shocked. However, enemy reinforcements arrived one after another and subjected the Japanese army to intense bombardment, so they were ultimately unable to prevent the enemy from landing. The Japanese army waited until sunset and then launched a magnificent night assault on the enemy landing sites, inflicting heavy damage. However, this battle was again hindered by the enemy's superior firepower, and in the end they were unable to force the enemy to retreat to the sea. The enemy then established weak bridgeheads in both areas. It is reported that the enemy mobile force appeared off the coast of the island on the evening of the 17th and subsequently subjected the island to unprecedentedly intense bombing, attempting to land during the gap. However, this was hindered by the Japanese army's excellent defensive battle, so the landing did not begin until the 21st. The U.S. Pacific Fleet Command declared on the occasion of this landing battle that the bombardment of the Japanese army positions on the island before the landing was the most intense since the beginning of the Pacific War, and the Japanese army's resistance battle was becoming increasingly stubborn. According to enemy rear reporters, the enemy fired more than 10,000 tons of shells and bombs before landing, which shows the fierceness of the battle between the Japanese and enemy armies on Miyakojima. The morale of the Japanese army garrison is high. They have continuously shelled during twilight, at night, and at dawn, and have used the terrain to launch continuous counterattacks based on the original fortifications, inflicting heavy damage.

A Certain Japanese Base in the Central Pacific, 24th (Central News Agency) - Enemy forces and transport ship convoys appeared off the southwest of Tinian, Mariana Islands, on the morning of the 24th, with dozens of landing craft, attempting to land on the island. At that time, the Japanese army garrison on Tinian was strictly defended and immediately opened fire, resulting in one enemy battleship and two destroyers being hit and catching fire. The landing craft were also severely damaged, so the enemy's landing attempt was foiled.

### Residents of Shaan County Return One After Another

Central News Agency dispatch from Shaan County, Henan, 24th: Shaan County, a strategic point on the Longhai Railway Line, has been under the control of the "Peace Zone" for two months, and the majority of the population has returned one after another. According to a resident who returned to Shaan County, when the Japanese army entered the city on May 18th, he said, "I am deeply grateful for the kindness of the Japanese army." The Chongqing side levied heavy taxes of 10,000 yuan per street and alley every year. Moreover, corrupt officials often violated the orders of the Chongqing side, prohibiting the manufacture of tobacco to obtain huge profits, and squeezing the people's wealth to enjoy a life of extravagance and debauchery. Therefore, all residents felt dissatisfied and suffered under the Chongqing side. Currently, slogans such as "Sino-Japanese Friendship, Down with Britain and America, Build a New China" are posted along the streets of the county. Furthermore, when the Shaan County Security Maintenance Association was established on June 1st, Zhang Xiangao, who bravely stood up for the construction of Shaan County, has seen the return of 20,000 residents to date, which is about one-tenth of the original population. In addition, the first phase of residents' return to their hometowns to work has been completed, and efforts are currently being made to organize various administrative agencies.

### Highways Opened in Zhengzhou, Xuchang and Other Places

Central News Agency dispatch from a Japanese army front-line base, 24th: As a result of the Henan campaign, a portion of the western section of the Longhai Railway Line from Zhengzhou to Baoji, and the southern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway Line (from the south bank of the Yellow River to Xinyang), which previously belonged to the Chongqing side, have been occupied by the Japanese army. The cities along these two major transportation routes have been freed from the heavy burden of the Chongqing regime for seven years and have regained their light. The construction of new Henan must first begin with the construction of highways, the arteries of transportation. Currently, the villagers in towns near Xuchang, south of Zhengzhou, have been holding shovels every day to work on road construction. Once the highway is completed, materials can be freely transported. At the same time, it will also make a great contribution to ensuring public security. The fall of Zhengzhou occurred on April 20th, Xuchang on May 1st, Yancheng on May 5th, and Luoyang on May 25th. Therefore, the recovery situation is best in Zhengzhou, where a telegraph and post office were established in July. Moreover, in various places, security maintenance associations, construction committees, and chambers of commerce were established one after another after the Japanese army entered the city, and they immediately began formal activities. Therefore, Henan is now on the path of construction.

Prime Minister产拉卓格鲁 and German Ambassador to Turkey Papen, as well as other Axis diplomatic corps, have also gone to Constantinople to avoid the heat. According to Ankara, the following ten points were raised regarding Turkey's attitude: The Turkish government skillfully uses the conflict of interest between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Temporarily observe the overall war situation, especially the Balkan situation, where the military has politically dominated. The lack of defense materials has been made clear to the military committees of the United States and Britain. German Ambassador Papen warned Turkey that any action providing enemy bases or allowing other military advantages would be an act of hostility, which has had a great effect. Judging from the above situation, the central issue for the current Turkish government is that the defense of the Dardanelles has become stricter. Although it has a supportive attitude towards the Axis camp, it still demands the supply of weapons from Britain and the United States. At the same time, it proposes to Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to guarantee Turkey's status as a supplement to the decisions of the Tehran Conference, and adopts a first-class delaying tactic. In addition, a major issue is what countermeasures the Soviet government will take in the Balkans in terms of politics and military affairs. Currently, the pro-Soviet faction in Ankara's political circles has raised its head and tends to fundamentally overthrow British primacy. The diplomatic war between Britain and the Soviet Union surrounding Turkey has reached a boiling point. Now the atmosphere of Turkey's participation in the war is gradually becoming stronger. Because the Turkish government is gradually making concessions to the demands of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, therefore, the recent possibility of severing relations with the Axis powers is quite high.

### British Prime Minister Churchill Returns Home from the Front Line

Central News Agency dispatch from the Swedish capital, 24th: London officials announced yesterday: British Prime Minister Churchill, accompanied by his Chief of Staff General Ismay and other staff members, visited Normandy and has now returned.

### Exchange of Nationals Between Germany and Britain

Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 24th: Huitong News Agency reports, British News Agency message: One thousand British nationals detained in Germany and France arrived here yesterday by train and will be exchanged with German nationals.

### The Battle of Myitkyina, Conflicting Enemy Propaganda

Central News Agency dispatch from the northern Burma front, 24th: At the beginning of last month, the enemy broadcast said that the city of Myitkyina had been occupied by the Chongqing British and American Allied Forces and that mopping-up operations were still underway. However, in the middle of the month, it was said that the Chongqing British and American Allied Forces were currently reducing the encirclement of Myitkyina under the cover of aircraft, exposing the contradictions in their propaganda about the occupation of Myitkyina. This month, it broadcasted that the Allied airfield suffered heavy losses due to the Japanese army's attack, acknowledging the bravery of the Japanese army. It is very obvious that the enemy army failed to seize Myitkyina. At the same time, the enemy further exposed its difficult fighting situation around the city, because the fact is that the enemy and our two armies fought fiercely around the city for days.

### Soviet Advance Troops Arrive on the Outskirts of Lviv, Another Unit Advances Towards the San River

Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 24th: German News Agency reports: The Soviet army's advance assault troops, after suffering heavy losses, arrived on the outskirts of Lviv (also known as Lvov) yesterday. Soviet troops northwest of Lviv advanced towards the San River and reached Rublin, west of the upper reaches of the Bug River. Powerful German troops and Soviet troops fought fiercely everywhere, and part of the front line has fallen into chaos. The German garrison in the central region fought fiercely with the Soviet army and blocked the Soviet army's offensive on the Brest-Litovsk to Grodno front line, sealing off the Soviet army's partial salient. German troops northwest of Grodno launched a fierce counterattack, driving the Soviet army east. German troops north of Kaunas also blocked the Soviet army's offensive.

Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 24th: German troops withdrew from Pskov and Ostrov in the northern sector of the Eastern Front on the 23rd.

### Stalemate on the Finnish Front

Central News Agency dispatch from Helsinki, 24th: German News Agency reports: "Uusi Suomi" wrote today that the stalemate in the fighting around Finland is a characteristic of defensive victory. Germany's economic and military assistance to us is sufficient to increase our chances of resisting successfully. This assistance strengthens ourself confidence because our army has obtained new tools for combat and a new motivation to fight for freedom. The newspaper continued, there is no doubt that the Soviet army will launch a new offensive, but the possibility of favorable defense and the resolute fighting spirit of the Finnish army guarantee that the enemy will encounter stronger resistance.

### Germany Transfers Reserve Troops to Reinforce, Major Battle in Northern France About to Break Out, German Troops Withdraw from Saint-Lô to Adjust Lines

Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 24th: German News Agency reports, military information: The German army has made full use of the recent lull in the European war zone and has transported reserve troops to the front line in order to strengthen its resistance against the British army under General Dempsey, who is apparently about to launch a large-scale offensive east of the Orne River. It is reported that the British army has assembled ten divisions there, including tank divisions.

Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 24th: General Dempsey has received reinforcements and replenished his arms. Once the weather improves, the British army will launch another offensive in the eastern part of the European front line. The British army's replenished strength is now not much different from the strength when it launched the offensive east of the Orne River last Tuesday. The local battles that have occurred in the past 24 hours seem to be forming a center of gravity for the battle. The British army is attempting to advance towards Martot, especially to seize the 72nd highland, Saint-Lô, and the two villages of Saint-Martin. It is reported that the British army on the eastern flank has heavily shelled the German front line on both the east and west wings of Troarn. Judging from its actions, it seems that the area southwest of Troarn and Caen will be the target of its next offensive. The German army in the eastern part of the European front line has been relatively quiet in recent days, taking the opportunity to gather reinforcements and stabilize the positions it holds, so it has abandoned the village of Saint-Lô and switched to defending new positions south of Martot. The American army is shelling fiercely in the area between Saint-Lô and Bérigny, and it seems that it will launch a new offensive. General Bradley has apparently transferred new troops to prepare for an offensive. The German army has now taken countermeasures there. The American army has not made any progress near La Haye-du-Puits.

### Symposium on Science and Technology

Reporter: Today's symposium is intended to allow everyone, based on their expertise, to offer guidance on the militarization of science and technology, meaning the various ways science and technology can become production technology. When it comes to the productionization of science and technology, the most important thing is the scientific mobilization that the government is enthusiastically considering. So, let's first invite Section Chief Hanada of the Technology Agency to give us an overview of the current situation.

From the Science and Technology Council to the Research Mobilization Conference

Hanada: The establishment of the Technology Agency has also led to the emergence of the term "science and technology." The founding of the Technology Agency and the widespread application of the term "science and technology" occurred around the same time. As this kind of emphasis and atmosphere grew stronger, the Science and Technology Council was established in January of last year. This is a consultative body that offers opinions to the government on important issues related to science and technology. The Research Mobilization Conference was established in November of last year. Its important research tasks are aimed at strengthening military capabilities and implementing national mobilization. The establishment of this kind of organization is coordinated with changes in various government organizations. Of course, everyone is working hard with a desire to serve the country, but because they are only maintaining contact, there is no progress. The current Research Mobilization Conference is integrating all these scattered organizations across the country into a centralized and unified form. If it is used flexibly, we all believe that miracles will happen. However, the term "research" may give others a feeling of detachment from the world, thus misunderstanding the meaning of research and assuming that when the war has reached such a critical point, there is time to conduct research slowly. Misunderstandings are commonplace. Originally, the entire nation understood that research is something close to home. Therefore, it is said that daily life is research, just as Confucianism says, "The Way does not need to be sought afar." If everything can get on track in this way, Japan's research capabilities will be maximized. Therefore, this kind of research is increasingly needed as the war situation becomes more severe, and the content of the research will inevitably evolve with the times. Work that started ten years ago but is now ignored is gradually decreasing. However, the fundamental spirit has not changed. Only the forms of expression have changed a lot. Just now, I said that a centralized system has been established? However, this does not refer to everything. Since the system of the Research Mobilization Conference has now been established, then the whole country will be controlled. This statement is not entirely true. Depending on the content of the research and the scope of the research, the organization is naturally divided into many stages. If the adaptation of this form and the various organizations for various research can be carried out smoothly, then the national institution will be satisfactory. That's what I think.

Unification of Research Mobilization

Ryusha: Within the Ministry of Education, the Academic Research Council and the Special Committee for Scientific Mobilization have been established. However, they are independent of the Research Mobilization Conference, creating a duality. It seems necessary to unify them. Which aspect are you referring to?

Hanada: This means that when the nation proposes a research question, it naturally needs to accept this question. If there is nothing within society, no matter how you ask, you will not get anything. When the nation orders a certain research to be conducted, there will naturally be people and organizations that conduct that research. Among them, the main form handled by the Research Mobilization Conference is naturally related in this respect.

Inamura: This is a mistake in the reporting. The purpose of the Academic Research Council and the Special Committee for Scientific Mobilization of the Ministry of Education is completely different from the purpose of the Research Mobilization Conference. To say that this is a confrontational sectarian organization, or to say that this is a conflict between science and art, is completely wrong. In fact, there is no point of conflict. If a researcher receives an appointment as a wartime researcher from the Research Mobilization Conference and is also a member of a research team of the Academic Research Council, he must first accept the appointment as a wartime researcher and resign from the Academic Research Council. The Research Mobilization Conference is an extraordinarily excellent research mobilization system. According to the necessary tasks, it finds the most suitable person to be the wartime research director, and then has several wartime researchers attached to form a research team, and implements the principle of "better to have none than to have bad ones." Only mobilize those who can truly take on the task, and try to mobilize materials and personnel as much as possible. Of course, everyone wants to serve the country, but there may be waste in the use of materials and labor. Therefore, mobilizing all scientists and technicians may look good in form, but in practice, there are many inconveniences, so it is not done that way. For a realistic research topic, only those who have the ability to solve it can be adopted. I believe that this form of research mobilization is even better than the scientific mobilization of Germany, France, and the United States. The Research Mobilization Conference is focused and partial; the Academic Research Council is universal. The former aims directly at wartime research, while the latter aims at enhancing research capabilities.

Research Mobilization System and General Mobilization of Science and Technology

Inamura: Although the research mobilization system is completely in place, there is still no sign of general mobilization of science and technology, which I think is regrettable. In short, integrating all the power of Japanese scientists and technicians into a unified form to create a war-fighting capability, I think there is still a problem, which is the issue of further reorganization of academic associations. In addition, since the Academic Research Council of the Ministry of Education is an organization affiliated with the Ministry of Education, it should further organize research institutions of various ministries and private research institutes that do not belong to the Research Mobilization Conference, so as to move towards production and increase production. At the same time, scientific and technological issues must also be organized and rationalized. Nowadays, people generally talk about high-speed production, that is, if you want to complete high-performance machinery and materials in a very short period of time, you need speed. If you want to achieve this kind of situation, you must expand the scale of previous research institutions by more than ten times. I believe that the current task is to adopt this method.

Hanada: I believe that we are about to move in this direction sequentially. For example, when it comes to testing metal fatigue, there is fatigue testing work. The so-called fatigue testing has a very large number of fatigue testing machines, and fatigue testing naturally requires a considerable amount of time. Therefore, if ten places research ten fatigue testing problems, assuming that it takes a year, then ten answers can be obtained all at once after a year. However, if one person does it, it will take ten years. If they are combined together, one can be done each month, and twelve will be completed after a year. Therefore, the answer to the first question can be obtained in one month. In this way, although the same answer is obtained after a year, looking at the intermediate stages, many problems are often solved by this. This is certainly an extreme example, but this kind of thing cannot be done without a centralized approach nationwide.

Inamura: Let's take another concrete example. On the research side, there is the Small Committee of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, as well as the Research Neighborhood Group of the National Federation of Technological Alliances, or the specialized committees of various academic associations. They now have a fairly powerful system, which is very different from before, and adopt a collective approach. The current tendency is not to be preoccupied with issues such as one's own creative rights and priority. It seems that the organs that adjust these committees or neighborhood groups, whether in the Ministry of Education or in the Technology Agency, have not yet been established. I don't know if this is right? In short, I believe that the mobilization of academic societies and associations has not yet been implemented. Even if the mobilization of individuals or private researchers is carried out, no matter how it is carried out, the mobilization of groups such as academic societies and associations has not yet begun, which cannot but be said to be a regret.

Hanada: I believe that the Research Mobilization Conference was created and grew in this way. Although it is an ideal system, it cannot become an ideal system today. If you ignore the past facts, problems will naturally occur. If no problems occur and it develops naturally, this may be the best method. However, the speed cannot be maximized. This is based on the facts. If the speed is too fast, and the new ones in the back have not yet emerged, while the old ones have already been completely destroyed, then problems will occur.

Inamura: The Ministry of Munitions has already been established. Previously, the mission of the Control Association has been completely taken over. Therefore, the Control Association must have another new character. In the field of scientific and technological research, I believe that there is also a need for a powerful organization that executes the mission of this Control Association, such as a mobilization organization established in accordance with the General Mobilization Law. Now, the Scientific Mobilization Association has completely no relationship with scientific mobilization, and the National Federation of Science and Technology Associations has not inherited this power. To some extent, it can undertake the entrustment of government authority and work. Therefore, it can be said that this is the Control Association in the industrial field. In this organization, five or six full-time scientists and technicians should be added. I believe that this kind of institution is needed now.

Hanada: We should support the vital parts of all our current institutions as much as possible. Although this is ideal, depending on the situation, new organizations may have to be created. However, the so-called creation of new organizations necessarily requires the passage of many unreasonable things. Therefore, we should avoid acting unreasonably as much as possible. However, unreasonable phenomena may not be able to be avoided.

Inamura: In short, based on what we currently have, we should cultivate its strength as much as possible and work together consistently in our respective positions.

Hanada: It is a positive plan to work together consistently in our respective positions.

The Process of Industrializing Research Results

Reporter: I don't know the order of this before and after. What problems are there in the process of industrializing and producing the research results in the laboratory? On this point, please ask Mr. Bito to give us some guidance.

Bito: Is it the results of the research?

Reporter: It is the process of the results reaching practical industrialization or industrialization. What kind of process does it go through to reach this point?

Bito: According to the past method, it is necessary to estimate whether it is worthwhile before proceeding. However, in the things that we are handling within the Control Association now, if it is an invention that is good for work, or a research result is published, it is immediately moved to the factory for production. Therefore, one of the many issues that are written about prominently in newspapers every day recently, the so-called wartime-type machine problem, if it is researched well, it must be put into practice immediately. This presents a necessary issue that needs to be resolved, that is, giving a topic, ordering it to be researched by a certain date and time, and after it is concretized, immediately ordering it to be used in production. When the experiment is completed, it is moved to production. Our work is very urgent, so we must consider the time factor. You can't do anything without time. No matter what the research is, no matter what the work is, it is related to time. However, this is a method done within a very limited time. For example, this time for the increased production of aircraft, the purpose, that is, the desired topic, must be completed by a certain time. For example, when to achieve it by what date and time, and handing it over to the production organization, it is already stipulated when the design must be completed and when the experiment must be completed during the preparation period. Therefore, they work actively day and night within a certain period.

Reporter: So, making science and technology into a business is the content of the research topic! (To be continued) (Translated from the April issue of Japanese Review)

### First Police Bureau Promotes Crime Prevention Work Invites the Press to Explain the Meaning of Crime Prevention

The Judicial Division of the First Police Bureau of this city has recently established a Crime Prevention Section in order to prevent crime, clarify social evils, ensure public security, and cooperate in the construction of Greater Shanghai, in order to achieve this profound ideal. Mr. Li Shiyu, the director of the division, realizing that crime prevention work is still in its initial stages in our country and that the general public does not have a deep understanding of it, urgently needs to use the power of propaganda to make all levels of society thoroughly understand the meaning of crime prevention and cooperate in unity. At the same time, he also hopes that members of the press will cooperate in promoting the work. Therefore, at 4:00 p.m. yesterday, he hosted a tea party at the Capital Hotel on the second floor to invite members of the press in this city. More than 40 representatives from the press in this city, including Chen Binhe, Cheng Zhongquan, and Lu Feng, attended. Director Li Shiyu, Deputy Director Guan Xian, and Section Chief Shi of the Crime Prevention Section personally hosted the event. During the meeting, Director Li Shiyu and Deputy Director Guan Xian delivered speeches successively, explaining the meaning of crime prevention. Then, Chen Binhe and Lu Feng delivered speeches on behalf of the press. The original text is recorded below:

Director Li's Speech

Director Li said: "It is hot today. I am honored to have all of you gentlemen come to give us your guidance. I have been working in the police judiciary since the recovery of the Shanghai concessions and have developed close relationships with all levels of society. I had intended to consult with you all earlier, but due to various reasons, it has been delayed until now that I am holding a simple tea party to invite everyone. I am deeply apologetic. This time, the police authorities are launching crime prevention work. There is a need to report to our colleagues in the press and a need to request your cooperation. However, before discussing how to cooperate, let me give a brief report on crime prevention work. I have already broadcasted about the meaning and prospects of crime prevention a few days ago, so I will not repeat it. However, the origin of the crime prevention issue is due to my previous service in the judiciary. Last year, after taking over the police judiciary, I conducted research on crime and punishment. The purpose of punishment is also to prevent crime, but it has evolved from the past retaliatory or suppressive doctrine to a doctrine of moral reform, which is equivalent to a patient taking medicine for treatment. But wouldn't it be even better if we could prevent it before the illness occurs? Therefore, we are determined to use new methods to achieve the purpose of crime prevention and reduce crime. At the same time, crime and social ills, and the increase in crime, have a negative impact on society. To put society on the right track, we must first abide by various laws and make it develop normally. Since taking up the position of judicial police after the recovery of the concessions, I have discovered various abnormal phenomena. The so-called punishment is only applied to ordinary people, while those who have committed truly heinous crimes remain at large. Social morality has declined, and there is no law or order. Even the common morality in the air has gone bankrupt. However, law enforcement officials themselves cannot be completely sound. The past practices of detectives in the patrol room, accepting bribes and surrounding the territory, and the people's lack of legal knowledge, have led to bribery and corruption. Even those with a little integrity are induced. Therefore, there is a real need for a controlling force to implement crime prevention work with the power of all levels of society. As for the purpose of crime prevention work, broadly speaking, it is to put national politics on the right track and implement the rule of law. From the standpoint of the judicial police, it is to unite people from all levels of society to organize and reasonably reduce and even eliminate crime. Regarding crime prevention methods, in addition to investigation, organization, and training, the most important thing is propaganda. The press is the mouthpiece of the people and the nation. It can exert the power of public opinion to prevent crime. I hope that colleagues in the press will stand on the side of justice, so that the general public knows the law and abides by the law, and instructs society to punish crime, so that people who want to do evil cannot do so, and at the same time, morally reform them. Unite colleagues to serve as a member of crime prevention, and cooperate in guiding crime prevention work. I am determined to follow the spirit indicated by Mayor Chen, 'Good things, we are determined to do. Bad things, we are determined not to do,' and work together with everyone."

Deputy Director's Speech

Judicial Division Deputy Director Guan Xianerlang said in his speech: "Shanghai is a Chinese city in the East and enjoys a high reputation in the world. In terms of crime, it is difficult to avoid in cities around the world. Therefore, in the world's format, more emphasis is placed on politics and economy. In terms of construction and equipment, Shanghai is second to none in the East. With these superior conditions, crime is difficult to avoid. I firmly believe that the reason is that the people do not cooperate with the police, and in the past, due to the existence of concessions, the people were unwilling to endure oppression, which caused criminal behavior. In the past, the British adopted a high-pressure policy. On August 1st of last year, after the National Government took over the concessions, the interim legal rights were given to every Chinese person, protecting them and punishing them. Therefore, there is a need for thorough reform to adopt a new legal policy. Regarding the nature of crime prevention work, it is like a citizen who is not yet sick, preventing them from getting sick. The phenomenon in the past was to prescribe medicine for citizens who were already sick. The effect of this prevention work, in terms of examples, is to prevent the occurrence of cholera in the summer. In terms of punishment, pre-vaccination is administered. Therefore, when Shanghai's epidemic prevention work began, a few Chinese people did not understand Japan's sincerity, causing unfounded rumors. This reaction may be unavoidable at the beginning of crime prevention work. Only when crime prevention work reaches its peak will the general public definitely be grateful to the authorities. In the former case, we have to rely on the advocacy and criticism of public opinion to make all parties deeply understand. I deeply hope that the reporting gentlemen present will give their full assistance and care. This is what this office deeply hopes for." Then, Chen Binhe, the president of this newspaper, delivered a speech, which can be seen in the comments column of this newspaper today. Finally, Director Li and Deputy Director expressed their adoption of opinions respectively, making them accurately correct. We hope that the press will use the cooperation of public opinion to thoroughly eliminate special forms [of crime]. In addition, Lu Feng, Yao Jichuan and others expressed their opinions on crime prevention and discussed them in detail. They dispersed at around 6 o'clock.

### Change of Cabinet in Japan National Will Unchanged Minister Matsudaira Refutes Slanders by Britain and the United States

The Shanghai office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held its regular press conference at the Fairmont Peace Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, yesterday (the 24th) at 2:30 p.m. On the embassy side, Minister of Information Matsudaira and Vice Consul Fukama attended, as well as reporters from various Chinese newspapers in this city. Minister of Information Matsudaira gave a speech on the recent formation of the new Japanese cabinet, as follows:

Fundamentally Unable to Understand

Minister of Information Matsudaira said that the recent establishment of the new cabinet in Japan has once again become a material for Britain and the United States to make reckless speculations and engage in trivial slanders. In the past, the general public in Britain and the United States had a superficial understanding of Japan. Their views of Japan often contained fallacies. The reason for this is that British and American politicians, whether in school education or social education, have never been willing to allow their own people to ask about the relationship between China and Japan and other countries in East Asia, as well as the feelings and hopes of the various ethnic groups in East Asia. Therefore, the general public has no fundamental understanding of East Asia. Fifty-four years ago, Japan promulgated a constitution adopting a system of representative government. Ten years ago, it revised the system of representative government to become a new form of system. This is the best system in Japan. The political source of Japan since ancient times has been further clarified and launched after the Meiji Restoration. The entire nation is united and consolidated with the emperor as the center. Therefore, the existence and change of the cabinet will never change the national will. Therefore, it is difficult for British and Americans to understand Japan.

Striking at the Ambitions of Britain and the United States

Minister Matsudaira continued: "After the establishment of the new cabinet this time, Prime Minister Koiso and the ministers expressed their opinions quite clearly. The military, officials, and civilians are united with the imperial family as the center. Therefore, the entire Japanese nation, both in the government and the public, will go all out to prevent Britain and the United States from returning to East Asia, strive to liberate Greater East Asia, and establish a new order based on national balance. The most meaningful thing is that Foreign Minister Shigemitsu also serves as Minister of Greater East Asia. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's concept of liberating Greater East Asia is not only the path of human evolution and development required by various countries in East Asia, but also seeks to make the world's people truly understand this original plan, which is of profound significance. Some members of the intellectual class in Britain and the United States understand this principle, such as Willkie and Lindbergh. There are also some leaders who lack complete understanding. The reason for this is that they cannot bear to interfere in the development of East Asia. However, based on their own selfish positions, they are unwilling to see the development of the East Asian nations. Therefore, we can only severely strike at this attitude of Britain and the United States to the end, making them suffer great pain. This is a prerequisite for the future of Greater East Asia's liberation."

### Common Sense of Air Raid Alarms

Alarm: Siren sounds a long tone continuously for two minutes

Air Raid Alarm: Siren sounds short tones continuously for seven or more tones, each tone lasting five seconds

Alarm Cancellation: Siren sounds two long tones continuously, each tone lasting fifteen seconds

### Economic Bureau Orders Each Guild to Contribute Iron

The Municipal Economic Bureau has been encouraging various trade guilds to donate scrap iron. Previously, Xu Dashen, the director of the bureau, first donated scrap iron from his private residence as an example. As a result, various guilds have enthusiastically contributed, achieving excellent results. As a small number of guilds have not yet reported, the bureau has ordered each of these guilds to report the total amount of scrap iron donated by their members within three days so that personnel can be sent to inspect and collect it.

### Noodle and Cooked Food Industry Association Ordered to Dissolve

Since the government authorities implemented the wartime materials control policy, they have been actively reorganizing the major commodity trade associations. The associations with unsound organizations will be absolutely improved or dissolved and suspended in order to cooperate in the task of materials control and achieve practical results. It is now known that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, after reporting on the Noodle and Cooked Food Industry Association of this city, has found that the association's business conflicts with other noodle product industries, and the organization is unsound and the content is corrupt. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce specifically instructed the Municipal Grain Bureau with Commercial Character No. 2451 to dissolve the Noodle and Cooked Food Industry Association immediately and merge the main business into the relevant departments of each related division to handle it. According to reports, the responsible persons of the association, Wang Bing Ziquan, etc., have committed the crime of collecting excessive amounts of money and embezzlement by taking advantage of their positions, and are still being detained in the District Prosecutor's Office.

Comments

### Crime Prevention Work

— Chen Bin

——Speech at the tea party of the Judicial Division

Shanghai is a breeding ground for crime. The biggest reason is that ordinary people—also known as big pavilions—have a special mentality. On the one hand, they commit crimes, but on the other hand, they are proud of not being punished by the law, leading to the law losing its power of punishment. Even the law cannot protect the people, but is used to deceive and oppress them. In this social situation, it naturally gradually becomes a breeding ground for crime.

In the past, the actions of the judicial department of the patrol room were the darkest, and the people were most afraid of them. Since the recovery of the concessions, through the efforts of the police and judicial authorities, they have gradually reformed and moved onto the right track. This is very gratifying. However, the police and judicial departments of various sub-bureaus still cannot fully satisfy people. The bad habits of the past patrol room have not been thoroughly changed. It is hoped that the authorities will continue to work hard.

As for crime prevention work, it is more meaningful because it is more proactive. From then on, society can be stabilized and crime incidents reduced. Our goal of running a newspaper is actually partly the same. Therefore, we are extremely willing to cooperate in promoting it so that citizens can understand. The actual situation of the reorganization and reform of the judicial departments of various bureaus, and how it is different from the past patrol room, should be published as much as possible in newspapers so that people can understand.

Now that the police bureau has organized a crime prevention section within the scope of the judiciary, we believe that the main thing is that for the ordinary people and big pavilions, those who engage in hoarding, speculation, and windfall profits, the law should be enforced with great courage. Otherwise, all reforms and crime prevention will be ineffective.

### Civil Air Defense Singing Contest Held Enthusiastically Last Night, with Over 50,000 Participants

The Civil Air Defense Headquarters of this city, in order to promote the will of civil air defense and instill air defense knowledge in the public, specially held a "Civil Air Defense Singing Contest" at the central square of the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse at 8:30 last night. The event was open to the public free of charge. Sun Lifu, the chief secretary of the headquarters, and officials from relevant authorities attended, as well as over 50,000 members of the public. The atmosphere was unprecedentedly warm. The Shanghai Symphony Orchestra first played the overture and the difficult dance music, followed by a speech by Chief Secretary Sun, who said: "The Air Defense Headquarters is holding this civil air defense singing contest, and I would like to express my deep gratitude for the presence of all sectors of society. Today, Shanghai is no longer a land of peace. Although Shanghai is far from the battlefield, it is not too far away. The enemy's surprise attacks are inevitable. Air defense work cannot be shouldered solely by the cadres of the Air Defense Headquarters. It must rely on the joint efforts of all citizens of Shanghai to make all-round air defense preparations to protect Shanghai," and so on. After the speech, news films and cultural films, as well as the first series of civil air defense films for citizens, were shown. Subsequently, Liang Leyin directed Li Leming to sing the Great Shanghai Air Defense Song, followed by film stars singing. Gu Ying sang "Annoying Morning," Wu Yong sang "Unchanging Heart," Liang Ping sang "Quit Smoking Song," and Zhang Hui, Zhang Yu, Huang Zhiguang, and Ouyang Feiying and Wu Yong and Liang Ping sang the "Great Shanghai Air Defense Song." The atmosphere throughout the event was very tense, and it did not end until about 10 o'clock.

### Cotton Allocation Prices Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Approval

After the reorganization and establishment of the Cotton Industry Control Committee of the Business Integration Council, the entire plan for cotton industry control (such as cotton purchase and allocation, centralized production of cotton products, and operational affairs such as the receipt and allocation of cotton products) has been studied and a draft has been prepared, which will be submitted to the Ministry and the Executive Yuan for review and approval to determine its implementation. It is learned that the committee began purchasing cotton last winter in eleven regions, including Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuxi, Haimen, Nantong, Qidong, Dongtai, Heyu Town, Anqing, Hangzhou, and Ningbo. To date, there has been considerable success in meeting civilian needs. All cotton allocation prices have been determined and are being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. Regarding the purchase price of new cotton this year, the committee will convene relevant parties in the middle of next month to discuss a reasonable purchase price that is suitable for the actual living conditions of farmers.

### Review of Grain Problems in Various Regions, Truth about Hoarding of Grain

Hoarding of rice and grain is not only happening in Shanghai, it has become widespread in various regions. In Shanghai, hoarding grain is not considered an illegal act; the Municipal Government's temporary rice policy has legally recognized it. That is, after the immigration population was established, in addition to the rice purchased by the Rice Control Committee, the Municipal Government purchased rice to allocate to the general public, but citizens were allowed to store three months' worth of rice. Regardless of whether it is recognized by the Municipal Government and the Rice Control Committee, it is probably unavoidable for rice merchants and the general public to hoard and store rice under the current circumstances of fluctuating rice prices. But what is the meaning of this mass hoarding? Those with financial resources hoard twelve shares of rice at rice prices that will not rise beyond this point, while those without financial resources cannot but continue to buy rice that is rising day by day. This situation means that the class that suffers the most from the high price of rice cannot but continue to buy high-priced rice; on the contrary, the class that does not suffer from the high price of rice can buy large quantities of cheaper rice. Those without financial resources are forced to hoard due to the necessity of living a life in which they cannot not hoard, and they hoard using the following method:

That is, they collect all their funds, buy rice, and resell most of it to others, using part of it for their own use for a certain period of time. They use the profits from the resale to buy rice that is cheaper as a result of this turnover.

Anyone who wants to understand the situation in operation only needs to go to the Shanghai military station to see the rice merchants buying rice. Under these circumstances, even if the amount of rice imported into Shanghai increases, it will be difficult for rice prices to fall. In other regions, restrictions on the amount of rice that each citizen can purchase, and the strengthening of flour rationing, have all begun to be implemented. But this is only the difference between buying a large amount of rice at one time and buying a small amount of rice in several installments. Preventing the deepening of mass hoarding, in which people exchange money for rice as soon as they have it, is the most necessary and extremely difficult problem. As a result, rice prices are rising madly day by day.

Future Countermeasures against Hoarding

Needless to say, future countermeasures against hoarding should immediately investigate and punish unscrupulous merchants. However, for those who hoard more rice than is necessary, a policy of equitable distribution of rice cannot but be implemented. Good farmers are not allowed to not sell rice because they cultivate it themselves, and the hoarding masses are also completely unable to have the qualification to purchase rice without restriction because it is their own money. The economic authorities should immediately investigate rice hoarding. The really meaningful hoarding merchants should be universally investigated throughout the city in the shortest possible time. When rice-producing areas are inspecting and registering rice, there is no reason why Shanghai, the base of speculative hoarding, should not implement the above countermeasures. In addition, a special branch of the court should be set up in Shanghai, and rice speculators should be sentenced to death without exception. When investigating rice speculators, do not release most of them without charge, as was the case when investigating gold bars. Instead, investigate their crimes as soon as possible, regard them as pests of the people's livelihood, and demand that they be executed by firing squad.

Given the increasingly serious problem of rice supply, allow me to report on the situation in a certain rice-producing area:

The call for increased production has indeed spread throughout intellectual circles, but the increased production movement has not yet been effective in agriculture. Farmers still use the old methods passed down from previous generations to grow crops. Due to factors that reduce production, such as fertilizer shortages, rampant pests, and local inefficiencies, it is difficult not only to maintain the original yield, but also a gradual decline is likely.

Currently, it takes a capital of 5,000 to 6,000 yuan to raise a pig. Ordinary farmers have long been unable to afford enough grain for themselves, so they don't have such a large capital to raise pigs. As a result, the most needed fertilizer for farmland—"pig manure"—is unavailable. As for bean cakes, the price is so shockingly expensive that of course they can't afford it. Therefore, they have to use water weeds and dredged river mud to serve as fertilizer. However, many people don't have boats. Even if someone has a boat, because the number of farmers collecting water weeds and dredging river mud has increased dramatically, grass is not easy to obtain, and mud is not easy to dredge. Due to the lack of fertilizer, the crops lack nutrition. Furthermore, there is a severe shortage of draught cattle in the countryside. Often, several families share one, resulting in delays in ploughing. When watering the fields, it is not always done in a timely manner, delaying the planting date. The crops are inherently deficient, creating early problems. In addition, the rice stem borer plagued us last autumn. Since there was no severe cold last winter, the stem borer is even more rampant this summer. The phenomenon of "hollow heart death" is very serious now, but the authorities have not been seen to advocate pest control, and the farmers only regard it as "heaven's will" and take no action. Everyone can imagine that in this situation, how can the rice harvest not decline?

The farmers laboriously harvested some rice, but in order to get cash to pay the land rent, repay debts, and meet taxes and levies, they were willing to accept the plummeting rice prices at the beginning of the new harvest season. They exchanged as much of the rice they had earned as possible for banknotes, under the pressure of rice merchants' price-cutting.

The lower the rice price, the more difficult the livelihood becomes. To solve the immediate crisis, they even sell the rice they should have saved for their own consumption. Even if some of the more astute farmers want to avoid the rice merchants' price-cutting and slowly sell the rice in the hope of exchanging it for more banknotes, reality tells them that once the authorities start buying food rice, rice merchants are absolutely prohibited from moving within the county area (not so according to law, but so in reality). Thus, they have to sell the rice with heartache.

Farmers should hand over a certain amount of food rice according to the price stipulated by the authorities. The Chinese farmers, who are very obedient, still transport the rice they are supposed to hand over to the designated collection agency, even though they know that the rice they need for themselves is not enough. When they get less cash than they were given by rice merchants, they often say with a forced smile: "They buy our rice at a low price, but they also sell farm tools, bean cakes, cotton cloth, soap, matches, and sugar to us at a low price."

In the previous peaceful times, ordinary farmers were already unable to make ends meet and were hard-pressed for money. Now, the number of fields cultivated has not increased, the harvest has declined, and under the rice merchants' price-cutting purchases and the authorities' fair-price purchases, the income in currency is even more insufficient to meet the necessary monetary expenditures. What's more, the population of each farm family is now larger than before, there are more extra donations and taxes than before, and the prices of daily necessities have skyrocketed. The multiple by which farmers' expenditures have increased exceeds the multiple by which their income has increased. It is unknown by how much. When the new harvest is not yet available, the poor farmers have no grain to last overnight. In order to survive, they have to borrow money or rice. Banks and money shops do not seem to treat farmers as customers, so farmers have to borrow money from local usurers at high interest rates of 100% to 300% per month and then buy the rice they need at prices that are several times higher than when they sold it. For example, this year they bought rice at a high price of several thousand yuan per stone, which they had sold last winter for 900 yuan per stone. Honest people borrow rice from those who have surplus rice in the local area. If they borrow one stone of rice in June or July, they have to return one stone and five dou of rice after the new harvest is available. In this way, the farmers naturally become poorer and poorer.

The shattered state of the countryside cannot be fully described in one or two thousand words. Even if it is described in detail, unless you have experienced it firsthand, you will never believe that there are such painful realities in the world. With the countryside so shattered, how can the rice supply avoid becoming the center of a serious problem!

We believe that the fundamental solution to the food problem in cities is still increased agricultural production. As for improving the purchase methods and the distribution system, they are only stopgap measures. Therefore, we hope: (1) The leaders and sponsors of the agricultural increased production movement will quickly take action, not just sit and manage, and immediately mobilize agricultural experts and students to guide farmers to improve their farming methods. (2) Establish rural financial institutions so that farmers can access capital at low interest rates and no longer be exploited by usurers. Urban idle capital may also be channeled into the right path through this. (3) When the authorities buy rice, it is best to adopt a system of advance rice payments. When the new harvest is not yet available and the farmers need cash most, pay a portion or all of the rice payment to the farmers in advance to adjust the seasonality of farmers' income and prevent farmers from relying on the whims of usurers. In this way, farmers will be more willing to obey the government's orders and sell the rice they have harvested at the stipulated price.

Proposal to Abolish Stamp Duty on Paper Money

### Supplementing the Education Fund

— Chen Qi-xiong

If national education is not widespread, it is difficult to imagine the country's prosperity. Today, the education authorities have insufficient funds, and teachers' salaries are meager, which has a profound and far-reaching impact on the future of education. Therefore, there is a proposal to abolish stamp duty on paper money to supplement the education fund. The reasons are described below:

(Reasons) After legal tender circulates in the market, it is inevitably damaged and recovered by the national bank. "Waste paper money" refers to the damaged paper money that is recovered and not re-issued, but destroyed. The amount is so large that it is alarming, but it has not been noticed by the outside world. It amounts to tens of thousands of yuan per day. Therefore, after the implementation of stamp duty on waste paper money, the tax revenue will also be considerable. In the current situation, it is quite necessary to use it as an education fund. According to the fact that paper money is easily torn, soiled, gnawed by rats, burned by fire, or damaged by insects after use, within the stipulated scope, the national bank can exchange new currency for unlimited amounts without collecting any fees, which is very convenient. Therefore, general users are used to not paying attention and place the legal tender they hold at will, which makes it easy to damage or deliberately damage, which is very regrettable. However, there are no explicit regulations on how to cherish it. Now, the printing cost is more expensive than before. The consumption of damaged paper money is also a major expenditure for the government, and it should not be borne by the people. Therefore, those who hold damaged paper money should pay a considerable stamp tax and affix it to the damaged paper money, otherwise the national bank will not exchange it, and the store will not accept it. It must be affixed. If this can be done, not only will the loss of paper money be reduced, but the holder will know to cherish it, and the government can also reduce an expenditure. The number of damaged paper money held by individuals is very small, and the tax to be paid will not affect the individual economy. It can be done in one fell swoop, and it is hoped that public opinion circles will pay attention to and promote it.

The points to be discussed are listed below for reference.

(1) Stamp: Should the original stamp tax be used, or should a new design be made?

(1) Tax rate: The stamp should be determined by the size of the denomination. How should the base number be determined?

(1) Effect: After the stamp is affixed, should the damaged paper money be allowed to circulate in the market?

(1) Payment: How should the banks that receive the damaged paper money in batches know whether the stamp has been fully affixed or not?

(1) Implementation: After this method is drafted, who should submit it to the competent government department for approval and implementation?

### Free Drug Addiction Rehabilitation Center First Batch of Rehabilitated Individuals Released; Second Phase of Application Registration Begins

The voluntary drug addiction rehabilitation center attached to the Zhong Jiao Dao Yi Society in Fengyu Lane, Nantong Road, has had its first batch of more than ten rehabilitated individuals, diligently treated by the doctors hired by the society, Yang Wei-wen, Sun Wei-rui, and Cai Da-ming. They were injected with "Sheng Kang Du Ping" injections produced by the Hua Sheng Pharmaceutical Research Institute, and various supplementary medicines were provided according to each person's illness. Since the implementation of the rehabilitation, the progress has been excellent. Not only has the addiction been broken, but also health has been restored. They were safely released yesterday. In order to express seriousness, the society notified the guarantors in advance to lead the rehabilitated individuals out of the center together. The Bishop and the two directors, Yang and Sun, and more than 30 guests jointly counseled them. The rehabilitated individuals gladly accepted. The ceremony ended and they dispersed. It is reported that the second phase of voluntary drug addiction rehabilitation has now begun registration. Any unemployed young people who are addicted to drugs and unable to reduce them can apply for registration at this office or the society in Fengyu Lane, Nantong Road.

### This Office Sells Two Major Beneficent Books

"Protecting Wealth Method," written by layman Sun Jing-feng, is a masterpiece written during his illness, with profound meaning, enough to improve people's hearts. Last year, it was printed as a separate book, which was popular for a while. The first edition has been sold out. It has now been reprinted. The cost of each book is ten yuan, and the income will be used to subsidize the poor.

"Bright Lamp of the Outer World," also known as "Explanation of the White-Spoken Guanzhu of the Treatise on Actions and Retributions." The Treatise on Actions and Retributions is the oldest book in China to encourage goodness. Since the Jin and Tang Dynasties, it has been widely circulated from officials to women and children. The number of evils and good deeds mentioned is no less than one hundred and dozens. It is truly a wonderful classic for seeking good fortune and avoiding misfortune, and it is also a remarkable book suitable for troubled times.

Now, using the Guanzhu method, it is presented in fluent vernacular, integrating the original text and explanation into one, with a novel compilation method and clear meaning. It is printed by the Yuezhong Printing Society, and this office also sells it for five yuan per copy.

### Full Month Celebration Helps Obstetrics

Mr. Zhu Chang-li, since it was his son's full month celebration yesterday, and he did not want to overspend, he specially donated the congratulatory gifts from relatives and friends, as well as the money saved from the full month celebration feast, to the student aid fund for 2,000 yuan, and also donated 1,000 yuan to this office for the obstetrics fund. Mr. Zhu's enthusiasm for public welfare is truly admirable. On behalf of the benefiting pregnant women, we extend our gratitude to him.

Also, Jin Ji Shang Ci Hui donated its February subsidy to this office's small loan fund. Now, it has once again donated the March subsidy of eighty yuan to benefit the poor and is deeply grateful.

### Student Sentry Duty Problem

Recently, the Lian Bao Office has always assigned student self-defense groups to stand guard during class time? Although several requests have been made, there has been no effect. The Bao chief always says: "I'm sorry, your son has already been assigned. There is no way to accommodate you, others will complain." If I go to stand guard myself, I will have to neglect my studies. If I have to spend 50 yuan each time, I am a poor unemployed person and cannot afford this expense. Moreover, according to the rules, the self-defense group should go to stand guard themselves, but the students have homework. They are the builders of the future motherland. Who can bear to sit by and watch them neglect their studies? I hereby request the Baojia authorities to be considerate of the students in the city and whether they can revoke the student sentry duty order? If it is impossible, please also notify the Lian Bao Offices to adjust the student sentry duty time as much as possible so that it does not conflict with class time. (Shen Qi-xian)

### Gift of Asthma Treatment Method

Asthma is also known as phlegm asthma, also known as cough asthma. It is named after the symptoms, because the occurrence of asthma is mostly accompanied by coughing and wheezing. If it is not treated in time, the root of the disease will deepen day by day, the attacks will become more frequent, and the condition will become more serious, often becoming asthma. Lu Kui-sheng, a physician of internal medicine, has compiled a book entitled "Special Effective Quick Treatment Method for Asthma," which details the radical cure for asthma, dietary knowledge, special effective quick treatment methods for asthma, etc. Treatment in hot weather is most suitable. You can go to Lu Kui-sheng Clinic, 4, Lane 563, Weihaiwei Road (west of Zhengyang Road) to request it in person, or attach a postal letter to request it.

Sanhe Elementary School Recruits Free Students

The Shanghai YWCA, in order to rescue out-of-school children this year, has opened Sanhe Elementary School at 23 Sanhe Lane, Haifang Road, Xiaoshadu Road. The tuition fee is only half that of ordinary schools. Classes are held all day. There are grades from first to sixth grade. Each grade recruits 50 new students. Those whose families are indeed poor can have their tuition fees waived entirely.

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Takeshi, Translated by Hong Yang

Blood and Tears (4)

"God is present in every military unit. It is even more necessary to worship God when sitting in a submarine, so of course there is one in the submarine."

The newly appointed Ensign said this, but in a room where even an inch of space cannot be easily spared, there is actually a tall, small white wooden shrine. A bottle of sake and blue poplar wood stand upright amidst the gray pipes and equipment.

Before firing a torpedo, one must first coat it with sake, and at the same time, it must be considered that submarines, which are often in danger, also rely on God for protection. And when I imagine the sailors who operate such complex and intricate machinery in front of the shrine, praying in a respectful posture, the husband says in his heart, it is truly a beautiful and powerful painting.

Sitting in the unmanned petty officer's room, the focus of the three people's conversation cannot but concentrate on submarines.

Concealment, range, independence - these are the characteristics of submarines, and at the same time these are the main factors of hardship and danger. If there is no concealment for submarines to approach the enemy, then such complex and intricate machinery and the training of people to become one, endurance and hard work, and the hardship of life in the submarine would not be necessary. If there is no long-distance voyage to the ocean, then there is no need to endure the rain-like humidity, ozone, and bland canned food in the submarine. In addition, when sailing with other ships, there is also the danger of early depth charges, which other friendly ships avoid. Submarines must bear all the hardships and dangers because they are submarines.

As for the tasks, there are patrols, breaking shipping lanes, shelling land, laying mines, etc., but the task itself lies in submarines stepping forward to fire torpedoes at enemy giant ships. In this case, isn't the submarine becoming an underwater torpedo boat? Doesn't the tradition of torpedo boats, which has shown the unique tactics of the Imperial Navy in Weihaiwei, Lushun, and the Sea of Japan, already extend to the bottom of the water?

The husband thought this over and over again in his heart.

"That's right, the spirit of torpedo boats and the spirit of submarines are fundamentally the same, but the form of expression may be different. In short, the spirit of Commander Sakuma is the pure spirit of the submarine fleet!"

Real person is publishing a theory that Longfu has never heard before.

Soon, the three did not leave the boat. The sunlight shot more fiercely and cruelly.

"Well, let's go to the colonel's place and listen to the various speeches!"

The newly appointed Ensign started walking towards the school dormitory, but Longfu went to see the cute little submarine used for underwater surveys again on the way, as a souvenir in his heart.

"Real person, it must be very interesting for such a small submarine to enter the enemy port with torpedoes."

Although Longfu was joking, the real person and Xintian suddenly faced each other dumbfounded, and could not speak for a while. (123)
