### ArouSE Common Sense of Air Defense

In recent months, our city has frequently issued alert warnings and air raid warnings. We believe that as soon as a warning sound is made, from the standpoint of citizens, regardless of whether it is a drill or a real air raid, they must abide by the air defense rules instructed by the air defense authorities and prepare all implementation work. Do not assume it is a drill and be careless; do not assume it is a real air raid and panic. When it is a drill, treat it as a real air raid, which can cultivate the habit of air defense. In case of a real air raid, one can calmly defend and reduce damage.

We are a participating country, and Shanghai is a city of a participating country, and an important city as an economic center in the rear. Therefore, Shanghai's objective status is undeniably a target for enemy air raids. Therefore, we believe that an enemy air raid on Shanghai is a possibility. Of course, it is not to say that enemy planes will attack sooner or later, shaking people's hearts. We are saying that given Shanghai's current situation and environment, being subjected to enemy air raids is something to be expected. In order to reduce the damage to life and property during air raids, we must accept the guidance of the authorities on air defense, abide by the air defense rules, and deal with it calmly.

However, judging from the results of previous air defense drills and the implementation of long-term blackout measures, most citizens have two types of psychology. One is superstition and also a fluke mentality. They believe that enemy planes have various "reasons" for not attacking Shanghai. This is superstition. Or blindly hoping that Shanghai will not be subjected to air raids, this is a fluke. Therefore, they are indifferent to air defense rules. One is a confused psychology. They simply do not know the nature of air raids? They simply do not know how paying attention to air defense is effective during air raids? Therefore, they are ignorant of air defense rules, and even when implementing air defense rules, they think that situations different from peacetime are inconvenient and curse them. These two types of psychology are really undesirable in a wartime city during the current decisive battle period.

Above, we have already pointed out Shanghai's current situation, and it is regrettable that some citizens still have undesirable mentalities. In order to arouse the general public to fully pay attention to air defense rules and do their best to abide by the air defense rules, we will restate the two basic conditions as follows:

The sound symbols of air raid alarms are the most basic common sense of air defense. Every citizen, regardless of age, must clearly understand them. Upon hearing the whistle, one can distinguish what kind of alarm it is and know what to do. Air defense training has been implemented in this city for some time, but the general public still does not know the common sense of distinguishing alarm sound symbols. Alert alarms are often confused with all-clear alarms. The "Common Sense of Air Raid Alarms" schematic table published by this newspaper starting yesterday will be serialized for a week. The table explains the different siren symbols for alert, air raid, and all-clear alarms. We hope that citizens will pay attention together, remember them clearly, parents will instruct their children, shopkeepers will inform their employees, and organizations will create large charts and post them in conspicuous places so that all subordinate employees will know them clearly.

Strictly preventing light leakage is the most basic condition for nighttime air defense. Every household, regardless of whether it is industrial, commercial, or residential, must absolutely abide by it. Even a slight leakage of light makes it easy for enemy planes to locate the target and the direction for attack. Therefore, light leakage during an air raid not only harms oneself but also harms others. On the other hand, preventing light leakage is not difficult, nor is it a major inconvenience. Whether it can be done depends only on whether one pays attention or not. During the control period, if light leaks, one will be subject to penalties such as electricity cuts and fines. Why suffer spiritual and material punishment for a small oversight! We hope that parents, shopkeepers, and responsible persons of organizations will always advise their family members and subordinates to pay attention together and prevent light leakage.

We know that the two air raids by enemy American planes on Kitakyushu, Japan, did not cause major damage, which was due to the thoroughness of air defense training by the local authorities and the strict compliance with air defense rules by the people. Therefore, we should train urgently in order to cope with the current and future environment.

### Fierce and Heroic Battle Unfolds on Saipan Island; Enemy's Deceptive Propaganda Self-Defeats

Central News Agency: Regarding the battle situation on Saipan Island, the enemy army broadcasted via radio that since the 9th of this month, it has been deceiving informed people around the world by fraudulent means, but even if a single soldier remains, the Japanese army will fight to the end and inflict the greatest possible blow on the enemy's offensive. In order to complete the strategic mission on Saipan Island, the island is now rapidly engaging in a fierce and tragic battle that shakes the heavens and moves the ghosts. The enemy side claims that this battle on Saipan Island is the largest and most shocking naval battle in the Pacific. On the 13th, they re-broadcasted Reuters' war report via radio, stating that fierce fighting on Saipan Island is still ongoing. Thus, the boast made by the enemy side to the world on the 9th about occupying the island has been completely forgotten. It is truly a deceptive means to deceive the world that self-defeats. According to the total number of damage announced by the enemy army since the start of the war, the total is 15,053 (including 2,367 killed in action, 11,481 wounded in action, and 1,205 missing), which is very different from the actual number. Another deceptive means can be imagined from this. The enemy American army paid a heavy price and suffered shocking losses for this special attack on the small island of Saipan, which is less than 30 miles in circumference, which fully demonstrates that the American army has no experience and strategy in combat. Our side once said the boast that "The successful capture of Saipan Island is a complete defeat in the Greater East Asia War", but the truth of its losses is kept secret in order to avoid the eyes and ears of the world. However, the skillful battle of the Japanese army will definitely not be shaken by its crazy words. It is firmly believed that in the future, the Japanese army's operations will surely cause the enemy American army on Saipan Island to suffer the same fate as the Battle of Guadalcanal.

### Cabinet Meeting Approves Outline for Mobilizing Scientific and Technical Personnel to Enhance Aircraft and Related Weaponry Combat Power

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency): In order to enhance the combat power centered on aircraft and related weaponry, the Japanese government will resolutely redeploy the active mobilization of scientific and technical personnel. Next, as part of the National Mobilization Plan, it formulated the "Outline for Mobilizing Scientific and Technical Personnel," which was submitted for discussion at the cabinet meeting on the 11th. After State Minister Kishi explained the reasons, it was resolved and passed. The Japanese Information Bureau announced the main points at 2:00 PM on the 13th as follows: The matter of formulating an annual supply and demand plan for scientific and technical personnel. In terms of demand, pay attention to the following matters: production, transportation, communication, construction, scientific medical care, and hygiene technical personnel. In terms of supply, pay attention to the following matters: science school graduates, short-term training of scientific and technical personnel, "targets of mobilization and redeployment" of scientific and technical personnel, and science students above specialized schools (students mobilized while still in school). When formulating the supply and demand plan, pay attention to the following points: Place emphasis on the aircraft industry and related industries, and ensure scientific and technical personnel in radio wave weaponry and other important industrial sectors. In order to adapt to the formulation of this plan, special requests are made for the following measures: (A) In important factories or research institutes, cultivate intermediate scientific and technical personnel in a short period of time. (B) Focus on redeploying existing scientific and technical personnel and utilize outstanding scientific and technical personnel in key areas. (C) Strive to increase the number of science school graduates and allocate them in a planned manner. The plan will be implemented immediately.

### Japanese Air Force Active; Achieves Great War Results; Attacks Zhijiang and Guilin Airfields

A Certain Japanese Army Base, 13th (Central News Agency): The Chongqing-American Air Force has been very active recently over Hunan. Although they hold great material strength and implement counterattacks, in just eight days, 106 planes were shot down by the Japanese army. After the loss of the Hengyang Airport, the Chongqing-American Air Force retreated to Lingling, but Lingling soon fell. Afterwards, they defended Guilin, attempting to stir up trouble. But on the 9th, Guilin was also bombed, losing 28 planes. Also, on the 8th, Suichuan and Liangshan airfields were severely damaged. Therefore, at present, Japanese planes have launched wave bombings at night, and continue to visit the Chongqing-American Air Force bases during the day. Therefore, the continued activity of the Japanese Air Force has achieved great results.

Japanese Army Frontline Base, 13th (Central News Agency): Japanese planes launched a surprise attack on the Zhijiang Airfield in western Hunan Province, the first-line base of the Chongqing-American Air Force (300 kilometers west of Hengyang) late at night on the 12th, destroying two large Chongqing planes and twenty-four small planes. In addition, twenty-five small planes were also destroyed. The Japanese planes safely returned to their base. Since the fall of the Hengyang Airfield, the Chongqing-American Air Force has used Zhijiang, Guilin, and Danzhu as their first-line bases, but the Japanese planes' bombing operations have not slackened. After attacking Guilin on the 9th, they bombed the Zhijiang Airfield at dawn on the 12th, causing heavy damage.

Japanese General Headquarters Announces Battle Situation

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency): The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 2:30 PM on July 13th that on the Chinese front, the Japanese Air Force squadron attacked the American Air Force airfield stationed in Chongqing in Zhijiang at dawn on July 12th, destroying or burning two large planes and forty-nine small planes parked on the ground. The Japanese planes returned safely to their defense.

A Certain Japanese Army Base in China, 13th (Central News Agency): On the 11th, when the Japanese Air Force squadron crossed the Lianjiang River, it used dive bombers to bomb the permanent positions of the Chongqing army on the opposite bank of the river. At the same time, it carried out search attacks on the second-line positions of the Chongqing army in front of Yingde, attempting to prevent the Chongqing army from attacking. The American Air Force, stubbornly attacking, launched an attack on the vicinity of Qingyuan with six bombers of the (豻) type at 9:30 AM on the 12th. The Japanese warplanes and personnel immediately took off and attacked the American planes bombing the area, definitely shooting down one and destroying two. The Japanese army suffered no damage.

Japanese Planes Bomb Guilin Airfield

A Certain Japanese Army Base in China, 13th (Central News Agency): The Japanese Air Force launched a surprise attack on Guilin, the most important forward base of the Chongqing-American Air Force, on the morning of the 10th, causing significant damage. Since the Japanese army arrived in Hengyang, Suichuan, Ganzhou, Lingling, and other bases near the Yuehan Line have been under serious threat. As a result, the Chongqing-American forces recently gathered considerable air force strength in Guilin, attempting to continue the counteroffensive. With Kunming as the headquarters of the Chongqing-American Air Force and Guilin as its heart, the Chongqing-American forces are determined not to lose this important stronghold. Therefore, the Chongqing-American armies have been building day and night in the area for several years. Today, Guilin can be described as a large air force fortress, and from the perspective of the terrain, it has the elements of an air force fortress. Guilin is surrounded by mountains and hills, which can be used to build a large airfield and to use the foothills to build anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine gun positions to defend against Japanese plane bombings. Moreover, the three airfields and various connecting roads are well-equipped, and the main runways can be arbitrarily taken off by even the super-heavy B29 bombers, which shows the completeness of the facilities. According to a certain captain of the Japanese army who has attacked Guilin several times, the bombing of Guilin this time revealed that the area had changed, which is really surprising. Now the enemy is doing its best to build, so Guilin has been turned into a base that cannot be ignored. On the other hand, the anti-aircraft artillery fire is also extremely fierce. Whenever planes bomb the area, they seem to be wrapped in a net of fire. But the Japanese Air Force is currently attacking this important air force fortress day and night. The night bombing on the morning of the 10th destroyed 28 more aircraft, and will continue to attack fiercely in the future.

### Chongqing Army on the Nu River Front Has Fallen Into a Difficult Situation

Japanese Army Base on the Nu River Front, 13th (Central News Agency): Although the Chongqing army on the front line has crossed the Nu River and launched several counterattacks, they have been repelled by the Japanese army. Since the 5th, under the cover of artillery and fighter-bomber squadrons, the Chongqing army attempted to seize Aola Meng, concentrating all its firepower to attack the Japanese army's positions, but after being severely attacked by the Japanese army, they all collapsed. In the five days since the 1st, the Chongqing army left 157 bodies behind. The Japanese army also seized many weapons and foreign drugs. The Chongqing army in Tengyue has also been taking a siege posture since the 5th, intending to advance the Japanese army's stronghold, but after being intercepted by the Japanese army and inflicting heavy damage on them, it has collapsed. Similarly, about 300 Chongqing troops approaching east of Lingling were also defeated. At present, the Chongqing army on the west bank of the Nu River is actually in a dilemma.

### Commander Umezu Hosts Ambassador Chen

Xinjing, 13th (Central News Agency): Commander of the Kwantung Army and Japanese Ambassador Plenipotentiary to Manchuria, Mr. Umezu, hosted a banquet at his official residence at 6:00 PM on the 12th for Mr. Chen Jicheng, Ambassador Plenipotentiary of our country to Manchuria, and Yang Counselor of the Embassy, Xiao Military Attache Assistant Officer, and all secretarial staff.

### Japanese Army Surprise Attack Occupies Songbai Pavilion; Southern Hunan Has Reached the Decisive Battle Stage

Hunan Frontline, 13th (Central News Agency): The left-wing attacking unit of the Japanese army occupied Laiyang, 40 kilometers south of Hengyang, without bloodshed on the 4th. They continued to advance south along the Yuehan Line, destroying the disorganized 62nd Army of the enemy everywhere. At dawn on the 11th, they occupied Songbai Pavilion, 60 kilometers south of Hengyang, and are currently continuing their fierce offensive. The Japanese army occupied Songbai Pavilion this time with surprise attack tactics, and captured it without bloodshed. The zinc factory and two lead smelters, and a 300-ton smelting plant for lead products, were completely taken over by the Japanese army. At the same time, none of the factory workers escaped, and they immediately began to assist the Japanese army in their work.

Hunan Frontline, 13th (Central News Agency): In order to echo the left-wing troops surrounding Hengyang and continuing their offensive, a unit of the Japanese army continued to advance fiercely along the western area of the Yuehan Road. They occupied Jinlan Temple on the 7th. The Chongqing 4th Army, 73rd Army, and 48th and 15th Divisions in the northeastern region of Hengyang have fallen into a state of disarray. The Japanese army suddenly launched an attack on them on the 10th, and a large-scale mopping-up operation is currently underway. Due to the rapid advance of the left-wing troops of the Japanese army and the skillful annihilation battle of the left-wing troops, the battle in the southern end of Hunan Province has reached a decisive stage. The Chongqing military leaders are extremely worried about the disastrous defeat in the Sixth War Zone. Jiang Jieshi issued a sad order to the commander of the Sixth War Zone on the 3rd, saying, "Future battles are related to the survival of China. It is hoped that all levels will unite and strive to achieve the final victory. Those who retreat without military orders will be severely punished in accordance with the joint and several liability system."

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency): According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing military authorities announced the battle situation in Hunan and Guangdong on the night of the 12th as follows: (1) In the Hunan front line, the external operations of Hengyang have been underway for ten days, and are still continuing. At dawn on the 11th, the Japanese army began shelling again. Although the ground troops repeatedly launched fierce offensives, the Chongqing defending troops fought hard under the cover of the air force, and fierce battles are currently underway. (2) On the Guangdong front, the Japanese army is advancing further eastward from the northeast of Qingyuan (70 kilometers north of Guangzhou), and has now reached the north bank of Lianjiang, 20 kilometers south of Yingde on the Yuehan Line, and is fighting with the intercepting Chongqing army.

American Newspapers Discuss the Chinese War Situation

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency): The Chongqing correspondent of the Chicago News recently discussed the war situation on the Chinese front as follows: "After the Japanese army controlled the southeastern Chinese transportation line and attacked Hengyang, it seems to have the intention of quickly advancing towards Guilin. The Japanese army is still continuing to fiercely attack Hengyang. Although the Chongqing defending troops have resisted fiercely, they are holding on to their death with the cover of the Chongqing remnant army. In addition, the Chongqing-American Air Force is attacking the Japanese army's gradually stretched supply lines and its rear bases, bombing and shooting at the front line, attempting to hinder the Japanese army's actions. However, the Japanese army's operations in southern Hunan Province aim to completely occupy most of the Chongqing-American Air Force in southeastern China, so the range of Japanese ship transportation from the air attack on the Chinese coast has been compressed. Also, whether the Chongqing-American Air Force in Guangxi Province can attack the Japanese transport ships passing through the South China Sea and bombing the country remains a question. In this way, where the true intention of the Japanese army lies will depend on how large a force the Japanese army still possesses. But all of this is unknown. Furthermore, this question also touches on whether the Japanese army has the intention of mobilizing its reserve forces to defend the railways it has obtained. According to the first meaning of the Japanese army's offensive, it is to destroy the effectiveness of the Chongqing-American Air Force operating from the southeastern Chinese bases. The second meaning is to obtain the railways and land supply lines reaching the Japanese-occupied territories in the South Seas."

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency): The Chongqing United Press special correspondent, regarding the war situation announced by the Chongqing military authorities on the night of the 12th, expressed his feelings as follows: The Japanese army has attacked to a point 40 kilometers away from Qingyuan, putting the key point of the Yuehan Line, Yingde, within the direct attack range. The Chongqing authorities believe that if the Japanese army can occupy Yingde, they can echo the Japanese army in Hunan from north to south, compressing the vast front line to less than 250 kilometers. On the Hunan front, the Chongqing army has attempted to implement a flanking counterattack against the Japanese army, implementing rear operations to restrain the Japanese army's operational plan, but to date, no changes have occurred. The Chongqing military authorities need to revise their view that the crisis in Hunan has passed, given the significant progress of the Japanese army's left wing on the Guangdong front. Furthermore, the report of the Japanese army's general retreat publicized by the Chongqing side last week has now been confirmed as false propaganda.

### War Results of Japanese Army in Mongolia in Mid-June

Zhangjiakou, 13th (Central News Agency): The war results obtained by the Japanese army and police force stationed in Mongolia in June are as follows: Number of engagements: 49; Communist army strength: 6,004; Destroyed facilities: 113; Captured: 71; Bodies abandoned: 336; Main seized items: 120 rifles, 3,055 rounds of various ammunition.

### Revised Organizational Regulations of the Economic Commission

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency): The main purpose of the establishment of the National Economic Commission is to review national economic policies and adjust economic missions. Recently, in order to effectively undertake this important mission, the commission has revised its organizational regulations, which have been approved and promulgated by the Central Political Committee. The organizational regulations stipulate that bureaus should be established to handle the affairs under the commission's jurisdiction. The reporter recently went to the commission to inquire, and was told that the commission originally planned to establish an investigation bureau and a statistics bureau. However, the commission had previously established the Economic Research Institute to handle investigation work. It is now planned to strengthen the investigation work of the institute, and three investigators have been recruited, so it is not planned to establish an investigation bureau again. As for the Statistics Bureau, it was originally planned to be established on July 1st, but it has been postponed due to insufficient preparation. The organizational regulations of the bureau are currently being drafted and will be submitted to the Central Political Committee for approval. The statistics office under the Accounting Office of the Executive Yuan will handle all the accounting work of the various ministries of the National Government.

### Southeast College Board of Directors Established

Hangzhou, 13th (Central News Agency): People in Zhejiang Province who are enthusiastic about education initiated the establishment of a private Southeast College in order to cultivate specialized talents. After active preparation, with the joint efforts of both Chinese and Japanese parties, the board of directors was established on the 10th of this month. The provincial government designated the former site of the Provincial Japanese Language Specialized School as the college's address. In addition to the fundraising by the directors, the provincial government will provide a monthly subsidy. Yesterday, the college held its first board meeting, and unanimously elected Director Xu of the Education Department as the chairman of the college's board of directors. The provincial governor, the communication minister, the general consul of Honno, and the original troop commander were invited as advisors. Chen Songqiu, the former principal of the Provincial Japanese Language Specialized School, is the honorary advisor. All of the college's organizational charter and recurring budget have been drafted and approved by the board of directors. As for the Provincial Japanese Language Specialized School, it has been ordered to be closed and is currently in the process of being shut down.

### The Impending Decisive Battle Between German Forces and the Enemy in Eastern and Western Europe: Authorities Firmly Believe They Are Fully Prepared

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – The decisive phase of the European war is rapidly approaching. Viewing the map alone, it appears extremely unfavorable for the German forces’ prospects. However, the German authorities have consistently maintained their conviction and believe they are fully prepared to guide the war situation. Acting Press Chief Tischner met with a group of international journalists at noon on the 10th and stated that recent propaganda from the anti-Axis camp claimed that German forces had suffered a major blow on the Eastern Front. The Soviet Information Bureau's news is extremely exaggerated, and the German side has repeatedly criticized it. The German authorities view the current retreat as the final stage of that operation. The Soviets have not gained any significant achievements besides acquiring some territory, and their own forces may face a major crisis. In addition, the "Late Evening Post," the official newspaper of Propaganda Minister Goebbels, also stated on the 11th that important battles in the west and east are imminent. As the enemy's resistance increases, they will do their best to inflict heavy casualties on the enemy, while using superior forces to prevent the enemy from advancing. Furthermore, judging from the editorials of the New York Times and other British and American newspapers, they also believe that if the Normandy battle turns into a protracted war, the anti-Axis side will not be able to bear the financial burden. Also, the effectiveness of the new weapon V-1 has now been significantly successful, causing great chaos in the anti-Axis camp, but the German High Command and the entire nation can appreciate the importance of the current situation and are becoming more invigorated.

Fierce Fighting Expected on Eastern Front Plains

Stockholm, 13th (Central News Agency) – According to front-line news, there are 145 Soviet divisions on the line from Latvia to Plibiya. This large force of Soviet troops is currently moving from a line 18 kilometers west of Dvinsk, 15 kilometers west of Kovno, 56 kilometers west of Grodno, 51 kilometers west of Bialystok, and 7 kilometers west of Minsk. It is rumored that fierce fighting will take place on a straight-line plain. The German authorities also pointed out that as the fighting becomes more intense, the Soviet advance is slowing down, while the German counterattacks are suddenly increasing. A Reuters dispatch on the 12th stated that German resistance near Kovno to Dvinsk is quite strong. The Associated Press also stated that German forces are heavily reinforcing their armored forces.

German Forces Participating in Fighting North of Vyborg

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – The German authorities announced on the 12th that German troops in the Lapland area have joined the fighting north of Vyborg.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency: The Soviets recently attempted to occupy many rocky islands in Vyborg Bay and Libau Bay. In this battle, German and Finnish coastal defense formations inflicted very heavy losses on the Soviets. The Soviets temporarily occupied the islands of Derkasaari and Merensaari at a heavy price, with over 2,000 casualties. Soviet landing fleets also suffered serious losses from German air force artillery and anti-tank guns.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency: German sources told our reporters on Wednesday that the Soviet Union's hopes of quickly defeating Finland have been dashed, as the Soviets have failed to cross the defensive line formed by the lakes north of Vyborg. Unable to break this line, the Soviets are now trying to bypass it and attempt to reach the coastal road to Helsinki by sea. The German assistance to the Finnish army in the battles in Vyborg Bay has proven to be valuable.

Heavy Fighting Continues on Northern French Front

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – The German authorities announced on the 13th that on the 12th, German forces again engaged American forces northeast of Saint-Lô and on the Cotentin Peninsula, completing their defensive objectives. Furthermore, they have retaken important territory south of Carentan.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Führer's Headquarters announced on the 12th that fighting on the Normandy front has expanded to several areas, and artillery fire has become more intense. East of the Orne River, German forces have repelled the anti-Axis forces that had broken into Colombelles back to their original positions. Southwest of Caumont-l'Éventé, German forces launched a counterattack and retook some territory. Fierce fighting is continuing in the area of Jurques. West and southwest of Tilly, German forces defeated strong anti-Axis forces attacking the Saint-Lô northeast and northern Axis forces, launching a breakthrough offensive on a wide front. German forces are determined to destroy their attempt and are still engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy. West of Juréel, German tank units have driven the anti-Axis forces north. Fierce offensive and defensive battles are taking place between Villy and Saint-Aignan, northwest of Rubercy, and in the La Haye area.

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) – According to the Associated Press: German forces in the area south of Caen launched a counterattack with elite mechanized units, resulting in the recapture of a village on the road from Cauvicourt to Chitot. Furthermore, to coordinate with friendly forces in the Saint-Lô area, German forces in that area are poised to launch a large-scale counteroffensive.

### Flour and Wheat Association Increases Special Flour Allocation: Striving to Find Ways to Allocate Flour to Households

At this time of serious food shortages, the household allocation of flour and special allocations to various industries are of great concern to all sectors of society. A Central News Agency reporter made a special visit to Sun Zhongli, chairman of the Flour and Wheat Control Committee, who said: "Since the Association began managing the unified allocation of flour and bran, it has been a year. Allocations to various benefit levels have been made on time without interruption. Even at this time between harvests, when rice and grain are in short supply, we are doing our best to find ways to allocate flour to households and are adding half a catty of corn flour per period to partially supplement the people's food supply. Recently, the demand from various noodle product industries has increased, and a small number of operators have not hesitated to lower prices to buy flour, resulting in a black market for flour. As the Flour and Wheat Control Committee, we should plan comprehensively and manage rationally to increase the quantity of allocated flour, with a particular focus on popular noodle products, such as flatbreads, fried dough sticks, and sliced noodles, to ensure that the allocation meets actual needs. Fortunately, this year's wheat harvest is stable, and wheat from producing areas has already entered the market. The Association's purchasing work has already begun, and all flour mills can start operating at full capacity. The production of flour and bran is expected to gradually increase thereafter, and there should be no shortage."

### Economic Section Officers of the Second Police Bureau to Wear Armbands

In order to strengthen economic policing, the Second Police Bureau of the Shanghai Special City has decided that economic section personnel of the Bureau's Second Division, who previously did not have clear identification when going out to investigate, making it easy for abuses to occur, will now be issued numbered and stamped armbands for wear, in order to provide identification and prevent imposters from taking advantage of the situation to harass the people.

### Stocks Falling Below Par Value to be Ordered into Liquidation: Thorough Investigation of Company Accounts to Prevent Speculation

Since the establishment of the Chinese stock market in Shanghai, the original intention was to promote the revival of investment enterprises and promote the development of industrial and commercial enterprises. Unexpectedly, some operators have turned investment into speculation, especially by falsely setting up companies to raise funds through the issuance of stocks. Since the beginning of this year, the stock market has been in decline, and stock prices have plummeted, becoming increasingly severe. Outsiders have suffered huge losses due to the stock market crash, and dozens of stocks have even fallen below their par value. Although this situation is due to tight credit, the biggest problem is caused by speculators, as well as companies with unsound internal organization and no actual business, leading to a lack of confidence among shareholders. Recently, Huacheng Industrial Co., Ltd., founded by Zhang Shanxian and others, noted that although the company's stock is not listed for trading, the black market price has also fallen to between four and five yuan, which has a significant impact on the company's reputation. Therefore, in order to protect the rights and interests of shareholders, the company decided to convene an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on July 31 to discuss voluntary liquidation, and after selling the company's assets separately, to fully recover the par value of the issued stocks in order to demonstrate its creditworthiness. A Central News Agency reporter made a special visit to Yang Changkang, the company's manager, who said that the company has been established for six months, with a capital of 50 million yuan. Its business scope includes real estate, a machine factory, and investment in China Electric Factory. Although it has not made much profit in the past six months, its assets are not in deficit. The company's original plan was to continue operating, but the recent severe decline in the black market value of the company's stock has affected the company's reputation. Therefore, in order to maintain the reputation of the founders and the interests of shareholders, it was decided to sell the company's assets and fully refund the par value of the stock. According to sources familiar with the matter, the government authorities, in view of the stock market decline and the special relationship with the company, conducted an investigation and found that many listed companies, especially those with stocks falling below par value, had unsound internal organization, empty assets, or no actual production. Allowing their stocks to continue to be listed would have a significant impact on the social economy and the interests of shareholders. Therefore, the authorities will conduct a thorough investigation of the accounts of the above-mentioned listed companies, and once any violations are found, they will be ordered to liquidate, recover the stocks, and refund the par value to avoid abuses and eliminate speculation.

### Review of Rice and Grain Problems in Various Regions

The Necessity of National Cooperation

The temporary rice and grain measures announced by the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Rice Control Committee were originally intended to encourage the transportation of rice and grain from the interior to Shanghai, and it was particularly declared that unlimited transportation would be permitted until the announcement of the completion of the moving-in preparations. However, as mentioned above, the county governments in the interior have taken the attitude of: "That won't work. If Shanghai adopts this policy, the interior will have to adopt a policy of completely restricting the outflow of rice from the interior." This is a serious problem that cannot be taken lightly. The tendency for Shanghai to become alienated from the rural areas of the interior is already concerning, and the conflict between the policies of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the county governments in the interior during the period between harvests must be resolved as soon as possible. Unlimited transportation is not unplanned transportation. Due to the defensive measures taken by the county governments, it is difficult to hope that individual carriers will bring in more rice and grain than they are currently bringing in. Therefore, the hope is that mass transportation with official passports can be successfully facilitated.

Rice merchants generally want to buy from regions with convenient access and low market prices and transport rice and grain to Shanghai. Therefore, without examining whether or not it is possible, they ask the Rice Control Committee to issue passports for the maximum amount.

As a result, this has fueled uncontrolled competition among rice merchants and threatened the amount of food available for local consumption in the interior. Those issuing passports cannot believe that the full amount will definitely be transported to Shanghai. The Rice Control Committee finds it difficult to plan the amount to be purchased from each county, taking into account the necessary amount for local consumption in each county and the necessary amount for consumption in Shanghai. As a result, restrictions are added when issuing passports, but these are only minor issues such as whether the rice merchants applying for passports are qualified. The needs of each county and the needs of Shanghai may not be comprehensively and systematically considered. If this is the case, it is not rice and grain control, but rice and grain uncontrolled.

Now is the period between harvests, and planned control during this period is absolutely necessary. The work of the Rice Control Committee has already shifted from working alone to working together with the municipal government. The situation has developed to the point where emergency countermeasures regarding rice and grain transportation must be agreed upon between the Rice Control Committee and the municipal government, as well as the provincial and county governments, and work must be promoted on the basis of complete consensus. The only way to solve the problems of quantity and price is not free movement, but planned action during the period between harvests.

As this reporter has already stated, all consumer cities are implementing rice and grain control. In each consumer city, the distribution responsibility of the county government during the period between harvests should at least be planned as part of the rice and grain policy. However, this proposal has not been implemented, reportedly because of the abstract theory that "rice and grain policy should be unified by the Rice Control Committee" and the concrete concern that "when each county government allows the distribution of rice, it will hinder the Rice Control Committee from ensuring the targeted purchase amount." A reporter who has witnessed the actual situation in various places during the period between harvests sees that the interior is encountering an unprecedented rice and grain shortage, and the Rice Control Committee office is doing nothing, only trying to overcome this difficulty by positioning itself as an administrative agency. We know that the abstract concept of "rice and grain control should be handled by the Rice Control Committee" at the beginning is no longer maintained. Leaders of rice and grain policy agencies should negotiate proper handling of concrete issues regarding rice and grain movement with provincial and county governments in the interior. The provisions and statements on free movement in rice and grain policy agencies, no matter how high-sounding they are, if rice and grain does not move, can the citizens of Shanghai survive by eating provisions? Those in charge of rice and grain policy, listen: Now is the time to make the greatest effort to adjust the rice and grain situation between Shanghai and the interior.

### Essentials of Air Raid Shelter Construction

Where Should It Be Built?

First, study the question of where it is best to build. Should it be built outdoors or indoors? It is generally believed that building it indoors eliminates the risk of rainwater flowing in, and it is also more convenient to use at night or in cold weather. Moreover, building it indoors makes it easier to see incendiary bombs falling on the building and to take action and carry out emergency fire prevention work.

Then, when building indoors, is it better on the floor or under the floor? Because it is lower, it is naturally safer under the floor than on the floor. Moreover, soil is a good covering material. Digging a hole under the floor and spreading a mat or bed board can immediately be used as a shelter. This is one of the most convenient methods.

What is said above is generally safe. Of course, there are also cases where it is better to build on the floor depending on the circumstances of each room, and there are also cases where it is better to build outdoors. These should all be based on the circumstances of each location.

Indoor Shelter

How should an indoor underground shelter be built? Here is a simple example: digging a hole under the floor that is just enough to hide the body will make a good shelter. The depth of the hole only needs to be enough to lie prone. Also, in the event that a bomb falls nearby, various objects may fall down due to the shock, and the floor becomes a natural covering, which is indeed very convenient.

At this time, the construction should not damage the building, so a hole should be dug about three centimeters from the foundation of the building.

Originally, sheltering does not have to be for a long time, so when building a shelter, due to the lack of materials, the use of a lot of materials and labor should be avoided. It doesn't matter if the slope is a little off in hard soil. The form does not have to be fixed. The simpler the better, so it depends on the situation of each family.

But if you have materials on hand, use them. Of course, it is better to use planks and earth, or to spread mats. When digging under the floor, if there is water underground, or if it is not possible to dig to a depth sufficient to lie prone because of gas pipes or water pipes underground, soil can be used around the hole to make up for the depth.

### National Mandatory Labor Corps to Depart for Work

The Shanghai National Mandatory Labor Corps is scheduled to gather 200 corps members at the corps headquarters at 8 a.m. on the 16th of this month. The corps members will be divided into four teams, each wearing an armband and carrying the necessary tools, and will depart for the seventh district to clear garbage, repair roads, and cultivate wasteland. It is reported that, in addition to the Second Police Bureau ordering the various branches of the Nanshi Yimiao Zhongbi Road and Xiqiao to dispatch sanitation officers and police to assist, China Film Culture Studio will also send personnel to shoot newsreels.

### Accounts of the North China Emergency Relief Fund Submitted for Record

The Shanghai All Circles North China Emergency Relief Association, which was established in June of last year to handle North China emergency relief matters, concluded its operations in February of this year. All income and expenditure accounts, account books, vouchers, and other related documents were transferred to Xu Shuizuo, Li Wenjie, and Wang Haifan, three accountants, for a joint audit. The audit has now been completed, and a report has been prepared and submitted to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government and the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau for record.

### Sports Competitions Subject to Entertainment Tax

A notice issued by the First District Public Office states: It has been found that various charitable organizations, groups, schools, etc., in this district often hold sports competitions or other performances in order to raise funds, and have repeatedly submitted requests to the office for exemption from entertainment tax. It has been found that this entertainment tax is paid by the audience and is not borne by the organizing body, so there is no need to request exemption. In order to adjust tax revenue, all sports competitions or other performances held in the future to raise funds will be subject to the entertainment tax as usual, and the entertainment tax will continue to be calculated together with the ticket price. If the organizing body has financial difficulties, it may submit a separate application to the office for a subsidy in order to show restriction and importance of tax revenue.

### Exhibition of Paintings by Disciples of Meijing Study Donated to Aid Education

More than 30 disciples of Meijing Study recently held a calligraphy and painting exhibition at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Xizang Road, which runs from yesterday to the 18th. The Meijing Study is another name for the famous Shanghai painter Wu Hufan. Wu's calligraphy and painting are well-known in his time. The disciples all have insights. The exhibition is enriched by the instructions of their master. Among the works, the four large screens of flowers painted jointly by all 34 disciples are the most precious. It was publicly agreed that the proceeds from the sale of the painting, after deducting advertising costs, would be donated in full to this newspaper's education fund to benefit the poor students. This is commendable. Readers are encouraged to visit and purchase the paintings, which will help the students and provide excellent enjoyment. It is reported that on the first day yesterday, Mr. Xia was willing to purchase it for 80,000 yuan, but stated that anyone willing to pay more than 80,000 yuan could bid for it.

### News of Readers' Aid to Education

Deadline for Collecting Registration Certificates Tomorrow

The registration certificates issued by the Readers' Aid to Education Office of this newspaper to each applicant student, totaling more than 600 schools, or more than 8,000 certificates, have been collected in succession on the previous two days. Currently, there are still more than 40 schools remaining, and they are limited to collecting their certificates by presenting their receipts to the office by today and tomorrow, after which they will be invalid. The registration certificates received by each school should be distributed to each student for safekeeping within two days, as the qualification examination will be held within ten days. Once the examination date and location are determined, they will be announced. It is hoped that all applicant students will pay attention to the "News of Readers' Aid to Education" published in this newspaper every day so as not to miss the opportunity.

Kunfan Girls' High School Raises Funds to Aid Education

The teachers and students of Kunfan Girls' High School launched a fund-raising campaign for education assistance during the school's anniversary. They donated 50,000 yuan to this newspaper's education fund. This is deeply meaningful and commendable. The letter is transcribed below: We are writing to inform you that May 28 of this year is the 26th anniversary of our school. Considering the difficult times, we dared not celebrate extravagantly. However, the teachers and students of our school, lamenting the decline of the social economy and the increasing number of poor children who are unable to attend school, launched a school-wide fundraising campaign to establish a loan fund for education, with the aim of caring for the school and cultivating talent. We went out in groups of four to solicit donations, and so far, we have accumulated 194,463 yuan. However, it seems that using this amount solely for our own school's purposes would be too limited in scope to be truly widespread. Therefore, we have decided to contribute 50,000 yuan from the aforementioned amount to your newspaper's education fund, and 50,000 yuan to the News Newspaper's office. The remaining 94,463 yuan will be used for the expenses of the Fuming Free School established by our school's high school students after school, and as loan fund for poor students at our school. We are sending a check for 50,000 yuan from the Far Eastern Bank, and we would be grateful if you could acknowledge receipt and provide a receipt. Sincerely, Kunfan Girls' High School, July 13.

Donations received yesterday: Kunfan Girls' High School, 50,000 yuan. Remaining balance: 6,826,524 yuan.

### The Significance of Increased Aircraft Production

— Iijima Masayoshi, Army Colonel

"Send as many aircraft to the front lines as possible, even one more is good." Because the people, in response to this slogan, have risen up, sacrificing their lives and dedicating their total strength to increasing aircraft production, the total number of new aircraft contributed by the entire nation with utmost sincerity has accumulated to over four thousand several hundred.

The people's cooperation in increasing aircraft production will naturally not fully achieve the purpose of increased production if it is merely lip service from those involved. In addition to having a correct understanding of the essence of aircraft, it is also necessary to be aware of the significance of increased production and to cooperate in increased production voluntarily. Only then will the term "increased production" be substantial rather than just empty words.

Aircraft Consumption is Huge

Currently, aircraft, like those of all countries, are not like the large cannons or rifles on land in past wars, which could be used for years and years. They are usually consumed in very short periods of time due to massive combat and natural attrition. The amount of combat attrition each month varies depending on the war situation, and the exact figures will have to wait for the statistics released by various countries after the war. However, the ratio of aircraft shot down by the British and American air forces in the bombing of Europe, and by the German air force, is often between five and seven percent per thousand aircraft, sometimes reaching fifteen percent. If the reports in newspapers and on the radio are true, then on the battle lines where we engage in fierce aerial combat with equal strength, the total damage from being shot down and destroyed will undoubtedly be significant in a single month, which is conceivable.

On the other hand, natural attrition includes not only those that can no longer be used due to the end of their lifespan, but also those that are involved in accidents during takeoff and landing, and those that have to make forced landings. Therefore, not only the front-line units, but also the education and training units in the country, often have varying attrition rates due to factors such as the quality of the airfields, the difficulty of the flying requirements, the frequency of use, the skills of the pilots, and the maintenance capabilities, and cannot be generalized. However, there are quite a few that cannot be ignored. Generally, the impact on domestic education and training units is small; while the impact on front-line units using poor airfields and those that cannot be controlled properly due to enemy fire is large. The aircraft of each aviation unit are being consumed in this way. Therefore, if we assume that there is no replenishment at all after days of fierce aerial combat, the number of aircraft dispatched will gradually decrease each time, and will soon become zero. In order to maintain combat strength during war, replenishment must be carried out rapidly at a rate that cannot be compared with land weapons.

Among the aircraft that are consumed daily, there are naturally many that reach the end of their lifespan without sudden accidents. The lifespan of aircraft, especially engines, is very short. After they are manufactured, they cannot be used for two or three years. Even warships and merchant ships, after being used for a certain period of time, must enter dry dock for major repairs, let alone sophisticated aircraft?

Engine Lifespan

The lifespan of an engine, that is, the question of how long it can be used, depends on the quality of the materials, the size of the reliability, and varies depending on the aircraft type and model. Generally, after each engine has a lifespan of five or six hundred hours and becomes unusable, in addition to being treated as waste, it is usually sent to a repair factory to use the reusable parts and remanufacture them.

Aircraft not only have such a short lifespan, but also often become ill and die young during their short existence. Therefore, in order to diagnose in advance to remove the source of the disease, during the period of use, the parts that are prone to failure must be inspected at certain intervals, and the weakened parts must be replaced to maintain health. The more frequent these regular inspections, and the longer each one takes, the fewer aircraft in the unit's inventory can be deployed. Therefore, in order to prevent the reduction in deployment rate due to regular inspections, ideally, it is naturally best to increase the reliability of the equipment so that such regular inspections are unnecessary. And to increase reliability, from the raw materials to the manufacturing process of the finished product, one must concentrate on every minute detail without any flaws or errors, and strictly check its quality. And aircraft composed of parts with greater reliability will inevitably have a longer lifespan. Endo, the director of the Army Air Weapons Bureau of the Ministry of Munitions, often advocated manufacturing "aircraft infused with soul," and half of the reason lies in this.

In addition, increasing the ease of handling of each part not only plays a significant role in shortening the working hours of regular inspections, but is also a necessary condition for shortening maintenance time. This improvement in reliability, the improvement of the assembly method, and the increase in ease of handling are increasing the deployment rate and advancing along the line of increased production. But whether it is regular inspection or daily maintenance, the prerequisite is that there must be sufficient spare parts and tools. Without this, simple repairs and adjustments cannot be implemented, and the aircraft will not be usable until it is replenished.

Calling for increased aircraft production and competing to manufacture perfect aircraft with all production capacity is common to human nature, regardless of the enemy or ourselves. Producing spare parts and producing perfect aircraft simultaneously is also increasing the number of aircraft deployed and advancing towards the goal of increased production.

As mentioned above, in order to maintain the combat strength of the front-line units, a large number of replenishment is necessary. And this replenishment is often urgently needed by the front-line units, and gradually extends to the rear. If, on the contrary, domestic production is used as the fan's eye and the front line as the fan's surface, and replenishment aircraft are deployed and supplied, then at a certain period of time, great combat strength may be exerted, but the result will eventually be a flash in the pan. Therefore, when the number of aircraft on the front line increases by one, the rear must increase several times the number of replenishment aircraft.

Increasing the Number of Aircraft to Replenish Units

Increased production aircraft are used in this way to maintain the combat strength of the first-line and rear training units, and only when there is surplus capacity can new units be created or expanded. These surplus aircraft are formed into new units and dispatched to the required battle lines.

However, the creation and addition of new units is not as simple as saying it, and requires a considerable amount of time. That is, newly established units must train the necessary unit commanders and air force personnel, and in order to deploy these units, it is necessary to set up the required battlefields and the required fuel and ammunition, and then the newly established units can be dispatched to the front line.

And the increase in newly established units, needless to say, the number of replenishment aircraft must increase accordingly, but the increased production must maintain an average. If the replenishment is not smooth and fluctuations in the combat strength of the front-line units occur, then when the combat strength is low, there is a risk of being taken advantage of by the enemy.

On the other hand, because increased production is hoped to increase the number of aircraft deployed on the front line, simply increasing the number of aircraft and creating aircraft that cannot fly cannot achieve its purpose. Improving reliability and ease of handling, and replenishing an appropriate amount of spare parts, are extremely related to increasing the number of aircraft deployed. Recognizing and considering this point, and seeking to increase the number of aircraft produced, is the real increase in production. Moreover, in today's world, where the number of aircraft produced in factories cannot be expanded infinitely due to the state of domestic resources in various countries, the need to re-examine the concept of increased production is increasingly felt.

### Bloody Battle Record of Japanese Submarine in the Waters of the Marshall Islands

According to the White Paper on April 16, near the Marshall Islands, a submarine commander, Major So-and-so, who bravely struck and destroyed an enemy large aircraft carrier, thus establishing a miraculous feat, wrote the following bloody record:

Month So-and-so, Day So-and-so "Dear wife and children! We are the bulwark of the Empire. Let's exchange our lives for merit!" At 11:00 am, the main engine was started. I came to the bridge and saw the majestic main engine, breathing out air. The loud "prepare to depart" sound of the horn had already resounded through the sky. The submarine quietly left the coast. Ah, what a beautiful sunny day with gentle breeze and warm sunshine!

It is the sea of the third expedition. Although the waves are high, submarines can be fearless.

Month So-and-so, Day So-and-so. Although today is also cloudy, the waves are small, so there is no need to submerge, which is a cause for celebration that is worth thanking God for. In such a celebratory atmosphere, I thought silently about "The Theory of Submarine Warfare Hunting."

Departing to Hunt

Submarines go out to disrupt traffic, just like going out to hunt. There are also large-scale hunts, so there must be sufficient armament and meticulous preparation plans. When implementing this plan, you have to climb mountains and cross ridges, cross rivers and enter places where no one has ever been. You have to set up camps and fight against wild beasts such as insects, wolves, tigers, etc. If large carnivores such as lions and tigers come, you immediately pounce on them and kill them. After killing them, you immediately prepare to deal with the attacks of other wild beasts. In this situation, we humans are not always the victors, and sometimes we often sacrifice some people. Of course, you have to endure hardship, hunger and thirst, but the moment you capture the spoils is very happy. This is the reason why you go hunting regardless of all the hardships. Submarine warfare is warfare for the sake of warfare. You often sneak to the vicinity of enemy aircraft, patrol boats, etc., and hit them with one blow. The bigger the target, the more enjoyable it is. To achieve this goal, you have to fight against the sweltering heat and severe cold, as well as the suffocating air inside the submarine, and you have to endure all kinds of inconveniences and constant pain for days on end. Just as there are hunters who lose their lives because of hunting beasts, submarines are of course sometimes unfortunately killed by the enemy. If you always pay attention to such things, you can't do anything. The opponents of us submarine crew members are just like wild beasts.

Preparing Torpedoes

Month So-and-so, Day So-and-so.

Before arriving at the operating waters, I ordered the preparation of torpedoes. It took three days and two nights to complete the preparation. I stared at the silver-white torpedo rays and thought: The torpedoes that have been manufactured solemnly must be launched solemnly to achieve the supreme combat results.

The operating waters are gradually approaching, and it is necessary to submerge during the day, so the meal times cannot be normal. When departing, breakfast is at 7:00 am, lunch is at 11:45 am, and dinner is at 5:15 pm. After 8:00 pm, you still have to eat a late-night snack. However, now breakfast is at 3:00 am, lunch is at 5:00 pm, and dinner is at 9:00 pm. The late-night snack like before has been changed to be eaten at 11:00 am. In addition, the sleeping time has been almost completely changed. I sleep when I submerge in the morning. I only get up to eat and go to the toilet. When I can't fall asleep, I read novels or something like that. Because I don't know when I will safely discover the enemy at night, I am of course not allowed to sleep. So when the dawn breaks, I can't hold on anymore, so I sleep. Night is my active stage. Now I must go and take a look.

Month So-and-so, Day So-and-so. After our submarine arrived at the operating waters, several days have passed, and I feel that it is also hindering me to meet the enemy. But the easterly wind has been very strong for days, and the wave height is about two meters. When our submarine is sailing sideways, it shakes very violently. If we encounter the enemy like this, the attack will be a little difficult, and everyone is worried about this. The fresh food has been used up, and we are only eating canned food every day.

Month So-and-so, Day So-and-so. As a result, we didn't meet the enemy today either. I am really unlucky, and some people are even unhappy. Of course, it is not driven by impatience and a desire for fame, but because I want to kill the enemy.

The torpedo tube room is filled with the blue-white color of fluorescent lamps. Many torpedoes have not yet obtained their spoils of war. I think in my heart that if these torpedoes do not hit the enemy, they will never return to base. The torpedo tube room is all configured very neatly.

Discovering the Enemy Ship

April 16

In the pre-dawn darkness, the lookout spotted something resembling an enemy aircraft. We immediately began to submerge. So we passed by without any danger. After noon, the radio operator said: "Piston sound detected at right ○○ degrees ○". So I ordered "Take your positions"! I ran to the command tower and looked through the periscope. Something faint appeared in my eyes. At azimuth left ninety degrees, there was a destroyer guarding, carefully drawing white waves, and at left one hundred and twenty degrees, an aircraft carrier was sailing. The distance was ○ kilometers.

In the stormy sea, the periscope immediately became ineffective. If I wanted to wait for calm, our submarine would float up due to the large waves. I, who was holding the periscope, was greatly frightened. At that time, I naturally had no time to measure the distance and speed of the enemy ship, and sweat even flowed into my eyes.

The enemy aircraft carrier seen through the periscope suddenly changed direction in front of me and went back. Ah, I knew in my heart that this was recovering aircraft back to base. The aircraft flying horizontally from the left to the right of the periscope's field of vision were preparing to land on the carrier. Suddenly, the aircraft carrier reduced its speed. I, who was carefully watching, decided to order a torpedo attack. The distance from the large aircraft carrier was already sufficient for a torpedo attack. So I ordered a torpedo attack through the speaking tube. I thought, "It's really God's blessing that we can carry out a successful attack."

The destroyer that had previously taken a considerable angle with our submarine suddenly changed direction. The azimuth was zero degrees, heading directly towards our submarine.

The distance was ○ kilometers. I felt as if cold water had been poured over my head. I felt that the enemy ship might have already discovered our submarine, and even wanted to escape, so I retracted the periscope into the water. But I thought of the pain and hardship I had endured before, and it would be meaningless to escape. So I thought that since we had been discovered, we had to attack with depth charges, otherwise there would be no way. My determination was made, and I issued another order to raise the periscope. But the destroyer's azimuth was still zero degrees. I thought in my heart that the enemy was finally coming. If I let go of this opportunity, the chance to attack would not come again.

Hitting the Enemy Ship

In the blink of an eye, I aimed at the aircraft carrier. Enemy aircraft carrier, please take our sanitary pill! Then go deep into the seabed and be buried in the belly of the fish. So I decided to order the launch of the torpedoes. After launching, we retreated to a deep sea ○○ meters away. We heard two torpedoes hitting. I saw the faces of all the crew members were joyous, and I, as the commander of the submarine, was even happier.

Later, the enemy ship's movements suddenly changed. Sometimes it stopped, sometimes it sailed at high speed, sometimes it carried out depth charge attacks on the distant sea, and sometimes it passed over our submarine with a shrill sound. In short, it continued to carry out all kinds of strange actions. So for four hours, we sat quietly and listened carefully to the enemy ship's movements. Later, I heard one warship leaving, and another warship gradually heading north. I did not think that we had completely escaped the enemy ship's pursuit when I saw night falling on the sea. We quickly replenished the electricity and put air into the submarine, and at the same time strictly ordered surveillance of the enemy ship, and began to submerge again.

### Situation on the Western European Battlefield

On the night of June 5, the anti-Axis forces concentrated about 1,000 bombers to bomb the Atlantic fortress area in northern France. The bombing became more intense at midnight, and the bombing range also expanded from coastal fortresses to the assembly points of the German army's reserve forces in the rear. At around 1:00 am on the morning of the 6th, the anti-Axis air and airborne troops began landing on the islands of Guessey and Jersey, in the area between the mouths of the Seine and Orne rivers, and on the eastern coast and tip of the Cotentin Peninsula. The German army immediately rose up to attack and sweep them away. Afterwards, the anti-Axis amphibious forces landed on the coastal area from Le Havre to Cherbourg and built a bridgehead in the lower reaches of the Orne River, but almost all of the British airborne troops who landed initially were wiped out in battle. On the 7th, under the fierce covering fire of naval guns, the anti-Axis forces established a second bridgehead in the Bayeux area and its western area. Afterwards, both sides mobilized reinforcements and launched a fierce offensive and defensive battle centered on the area between the Orne and Vire rivers and the base of the Cotentin Island.

According to German Ambassador to Japan Stahmer, the forces invading Europe under the command of Montgomery included approximately twenty-seven divisions, including ground troops and paratroopers. In addition, British Prime Minister Churchill announced after the start of the invasion of Europe that the anti-Axis forces had assembled more than 4,000 ships of all sizes in the waters of the English Channel, and thousands of small boats. However, since the British army retreated in disarray from Dunkirk in July 1940, Germany had already built strong fortresses in the northern coast of France with the most advanced technology and the latest designs, and stationed battle-hardened elite troops there. After landing, the anti-Axis forces were immediately pursued by the German army everywhere and suffered heavy losses. Although they have been fighting hard for more than a month, they still have not achieved much. Looking back at the North France battle situation over the past month, will the leaders of the anti-Axis forces also sigh "it's not worth the loss"?

In recent days, the German army has been conducting a successful counter-offensive on the European front, and each operation has been able to inflict heavy losses on the enemy and contain their advance. The places where the enemy has broken through are often quickly recovered by the German army. The German soldiers have excellent tactics. Yesterday, German armored grenadiers, in Caen's west, repelled the attacking British infantry, one against ten, and finally won the victory. A German isolated army northwest of Caen heroically fought and recovered the village of Epron, but the result was still taken away by the enemy. The enemy's successive offensives have been frustrated by the German army's counter-offensives. For example, between Vire and Taute, every time the British army wanted to launch an offensive, the German army would launch an attack in time, preventing it from succeeding. The British army suffered setbacks in the battles in Balleroy and other places. Montgomery currently has 32 well-equipped divisions conducting a large offensive, with thousands of aircraft assisting in the battle, fiercely bombing the German army's positions, but the German army is still able to hold its positions and has not wavered. Although the enemy made their best efforts yesterday, they made very little progress.

### Preparation for the Invasion War

After the British retreat from Dunkirk in 1940, they made a comeback and prepared to land. However, at that time, the British mainland only had one fully equipped division, which was insufficient to withstand a German attack. If the Germans had invaded the British mainland at that time, Britain would have undoubtedly been defeated. In June 1941, the German-Soviet war broke out, and the Germans concentrated all their efforts on the Eastern Front, which eased the crisis in the British mainland. At the end of that year, the United States also joined the war, and the dream of "invading Western Europe" began to feel realistic.

The British military authorities, in order to draft and implement a concrete plan, first ordered Mountbatten, General Blamey, and Air Vice-Marshal Douglas to study the general strategy against the Axis forces. However, they encountered various contradictions, especially the lack of materials, which prevented the plan from being finalized. Later, in the summer of 1942, Roosevelt and Churchill held talks in Washington and reached an agreement on the idea of "implementing the invasion."

At the Casablanca Conference in North Africa in January 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill tacitly decided to launch the invasion in mid-1944, and that year they would devote themselves to the Mediterranean campaign in order to destroy the main force of Italy. By the Quebec Conference in Australia in August of that year, the date of the invasion was largely decided, and the British and American military authorities studied the operational plan in detail at the conference.

In January of this year, General Eisenhower of the United States replaced the British general in command, and the plan was revised to make it more concrete, but the final decision on the landing date was still a very recent matter. (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, June 14)

Bai Mao

### Aunt Chen

— Yun Sheng

A few days ago, my cousin came out from our hometown and told me that Aunt Chen was very old and had become a grandmother. At the same time, her son, A Bao, had made much more progress than before. The mention of Aunt Chen made me think of her pitiful life.

Six years ago, when the flames of war reached my family's garden house, only Aunt Chen leaned on the bamboo garden fence behind the house and secretly shed a few tears.

Aunt Chen had a thin face, a pointed chin, a nose slightly like an eagle's claw, and a short stature. She was my family's old servant. If it weren't for the war, she would never have left my family, starting from my grandfather's generation. In her history of helping out, there was no second employer. No one in our family disliked her. Even when my grandfather divided the family property among his five sons, my uncles secretly argued over the right to inherit her. Each family seemed to have the ambition to protect her for themselves. Who knew that she would inform my grandfather and choose our eldest son's family (my father was my grandfather's eldest son).

Her wisdom and talent made her more trustworthy than other servants. She could guess the master's needs and arrange them early. She could remind the master of neglected trivial matters... Everything in the family, whether big or small, rough or fine, once it passed through her hands, was in good order and in its place. What powerful help this was to my father, who traveled far away, and my mother, who was frail and often ill!

"Look! Aunt Chen in the eldest son's family is worth three or four servants in other people's families. She is quick in her work, honest, and patient..." My aunts often cast envious and jealous glances at my family.

One cold winter noon, I came back from school (elementary school). Aunt Chen did not serve at lunch, which I found very strange. My mother told me that her husband, Chen Wenfu, had frozen to death in a straw shed by the East River, and Aunt Chen had gone to collect his body.

In the evening, Aunt Chen dragged her tired body back, showing an expression of frustration that was rarely seen on ordinary days. Her eyelids were a little red and swollen, and her eyes revealed a hesitant light. I wanted to ask her about the circumstances of her husband's death, but I didn't dare, because her expression, behavior, and conversation made it difficult for me to speak.

The next year, during the Qingming Festival, every household was busy going to the graves to sweep and pay respects. For the first time, I saw Aunt Chen also preparing tin foil and piling up what appeared to be grave goods. Unconsciously, I followed her. We stopped by a golden field, then walked into the field ridges. Finally, I discovered a coffin wrapped in straw, lying across the field near the small river. I thought this must be Chen Wenfu, Aunt Chen's husband. The fear of ghosts made me tremble. At this time, Aunt Chen put down the grass pile, lit a fire, knelt on the ground, kowtowed, and then cried sadly, crying very sadly and lingeringly.

"Won't ghosts appear? Aunt Chen has told me many times in stories that she must cry one out today."

"Ah! Ghost! I'm afraid!" I cried out loud.

Aunt Chen stopped crying, hugged me, and went home. My mother even performed a ritual to dispel bad luck for me, saying that I had encountered an evil spirit.

One summer vacation, we were cooling off on the threshing ground in front of the house. I lay on the rattan couch, biting on sorghum, and forced Aunt Chen to tell stories with my younger siblings!

"Once upon a time, there was a bitter woman who was married to Zhang She by her parents at the age of eighteen. Who knew that her husband was an opium addict and a gambler. She couldn't control her husband and had to sigh at her bad luck. At first, they had thirty or forty acres of their own land, and the family was still considered well-off. Later, Zhang She lost more and more in gambling, and his opium addiction also grew bigger and bigger. Slowly, he mortgaged the land, sold the furniture, and even stole clothes to pawn. At this time, there were two more mouths in the family, a son and a daughter... Finally, when he had no way out, he even demolished and sold the three-room tile house handed down from his ancestors. He became a vagrant... abandoning his bitter wife and lonely children... In desperation, the daughter became someone else's child bride, the son worked as a long-term worker for others, and his wife also went to help out in other people's homes. She was very diligent and worked non-stop, because whenever she had free time, she would think of her husband and children, and she would become extremely sad." Aunt Chen stopped here suddenly. Raising her head, I saw Aunt Chen wiping her tears with both hands. "She has a really good heart," I thought, "shedding tears for the characters in the story."

Once, Aunt Chen fell ill. My mother called me to visit her. By her lonely sickbed, she groaned and told me that all her joints were tight and painful because she had been beaten by Chen Wenfu and it had become a problem, which would flare up every time she was sick.

Later, I met her daughter, A Mei, who had escaped to my house because she couldn't bear her mother-in-law's abuse. Three days later, a stranger came to my house, claiming to be A Mei's father-in-law, and wanted to take her back. A Mei cried loudly and clung to the pillar in the hall, refusing to leave. Her father-in-law took a rope from his pocket and waved it at A Mei, threatening:

"Come with me! Don't make your dad angry, lest you suffer..."

A Mei seemed to be a born hero, stubbornly saying:

"No, I won't go with you. I never want to go to your house, see you... and my mother-in-law..."

The stranger angrily tied A Mei with the rope. Although A Mei resisted desperately, he carried her away after all. A Mei's cries and curses came from afar. At this time, Aunt Chen cried.

I was really surprised: the adults stared at their performance, not helping A Mei in the slightest! My mother, Aunt Zhou, and other servants.

Year after year, I watched Aunt Chen gradually age, and her worries became heavier and heavier. One winter vacation, when I returned home from school (middle school), my younger sister took my hand and stood under the big tree in front of the gate, pointing to the black and white walls of the building in Hedong, and told me that this was the new house built by Aunt Chen.

At night, I learned from my mother's conversation that Aunt Chen had spent most of her savings from more than a decade of wages, and with my mother's great help, she had built this house to prepare for her son A Bao to marry a wife because he was already in his twenties. They had already taken a fancy to Aunt Hong's maid A Dong and were asking a matchmaker to arrange it.

In the new year, Aunt Chen invited me to visit her new house, which was just three empty rooms. When I got home, I urged my mother to send some old furniture to her. It was regrettable that A Bao had inherited his father's legacy. Although he didn't smoke opium, he was also a gentleman who was old in the ways of gambling. I prayed silently that he would not inherit his father's mantle and destroy the hopes that his mother had worked hard for half her life.

After that, every time I returned home, I would hear news about A Bao's gambling, and it was easy to see that Aunt Chen's fervent concern for her son was permeated with keen anxiety. In my memory, the shadow of the frustrated Chen Wenfu often followed A Bao's name, flashing through my mind.

When the war swept through my hometown like a hurricane, Aunt Chen, unwilling to leave the house she had built for less than half a year, refused to join our wandering team and stayed alone to guard her hometown. When my family's house was cremated, Aunt Chen, who had lived there for nearly twenty years, served as the only coffin bearer.

Now I think, maybe God has changed his style and started to bless Aunt Chen, I hope so.

### Chinese Music in the Eyes of Foreigners The Soul of Chinese Music

— H. Swidalloff

Even Europeans who have lived in China are rarely able to have a correct understanding of Chinese musical art. Most people establish their concepts of Chinese music based on the rumbling harmonies that drift into the street from the windows of Chinese folk theaters and the heart-rending high-pitched voices from street radio broadcasts. This leads to a contempt for Chinese music, especially among Europeans.

However, we do not need to marvel that modern Chinese people do not appreciate their own national music much either. Among Chinese intellectuals, you can find countless people who know and understand Tchaikovsky, Debussy, and even Bach; however, they do not have a shred of understanding of the heritage of Chinese indigenous music. Therefore, what enjoys an advantage in modern China is still very elementary, self-generating folk music – which has a large number of folk musicians (self-taught) – or European composer's music, including jazz music.

Just like the theater, music in China can be said to have flourished in the emperor's court and in large-scale performances by the ruling class. The ruling class supported this art for its own entertainment, keeping musicians in their residences. Musicians and actors generally lived miserable lives, which could not promote the high development of music. However, individual geniuses could gradually rise above the general level, pushing national music forward and creating unique and wonderful ways of musical thinking, many of which are related to us for very long periods of time. The Tang Dynasty – the most prosperous period of Chinese art – was already more than a thousand years ago, when European culture was still in its infancy. Unfortunately, China still does not have its own scientifically studied history of music, and therefore Chinese music does not yet have a clear path for its future development. It either wanders along the original path or abandons its own national essence, loses its true value, and blindly imitates European archetypes.

But now it should also be mentioned that some modern historical materials of Chinese music clearly show that some representatives of Chinese music groups have begun to become self-aware. In recent times, individuals or groups specializing in the study of Chinese classical music have gradually appeared. About six years ago, the "Chinese National Music Research Association" was initiated in Shanghai. Its leader is Mr. Sun Yude, China's best Xiao (vertical bamboo flute) player and Pipa (Chinese lute) master. The purpose of the association is to study ancient classical music, enrich its orchestral pieces, bring it up to the level of modern musical art, and make national music more and more popular among the general public.

A few days ago, the Chinese National Music Association held its fifth public performance of Chinese classical music at the Lyceum Theatre in this city. The performance program was arranged very successfully, with orchestral pieces, music solos, sword dance, and vocal performances all interspersed appropriately!

This made the European prejudice against Chinese music disappear very quickly. All ears were chasing after the first harmonic sound of the orchestra from the very beginning. This group consists of ten people. In the string section, there is the Pipa, a Chinese rural instrument – which is reminiscent of our "guitar" in sound. The huge seven-stringed Pipa occupies a position of honor. A Xiao (bamboo flute) four Huqins (folk two-stringed fiddles "Erhu") – these instruments distantly remind people of our "balalaika" (lacking its high-pitched sound) – a big drum and other percussion instruments.

Among the many ensembles, the best was "Pan Lun Pao." As is generally thought, this was written by the famous poet Wang Wei of the Tang Dynasty. It describes the life of a heroic King Xiang Yu, a hero who lived in the third century BC. The melody of the music vividly conveys King Xiang's battles and vicissitudes, as well as his tragic defeat, his death, and his tearful farewell to his beloved concubine!

Mr. Sun Qide showed excellent artistic skill in playing the Pipa. He played "Huaiyin Ping Chu," a famous piece from the Song Dynasty, which also has a heroic theme. In the hands of the musician, the Pipa inserted countless variations into the sound melody.

It was very satisfying to listen to Miss Shen Shuhuan's solo, controlling her beautiful and powerful voice. Accompanied by the Huqin, she spiritedly sang "Autumn Thoughts," depicting the sad mood of an aging woman who has lost her beauty and youth.

It was very interesting to watch Mr. Ye Dazhang and Miss Pu Yu's collaborative "Sword Dance." The performance of this sword dance program seemed to be close to European dance art. However, combined with its own unique style, the eyes and footwork are all uniquely wonderful!

Chinese music has a unique melancholy and meditation, or the noise of war. These characteristics reflect the centuries of Chinese national history, which has struggled through endless civil wars and foreign troubles. These characteristics are also present in the tragedies of all ensembles.

It is difficult to say whether this ensemble music reflects the true soul of Chinese music, but one thing can be believed with certainty: a certain part of this complex soul has been imprisoned.

### Notes on a Chinese Classical Music Concert

— L. Arnotov

A Chinese classical music concert hosted by the "Chinese Music Research Association" was held at the Lyceum Theatre on June 28th and 29th.

Generally speaking, this performance by the National Music Research Association has moved the Chinese musical audience to pay close attention to what is displayed in front of them and to discover the priceless treasures of ancient melodies on these old instruments.

The president of the National Music Research Association and conductor of the orchestra is Mr. Sun Yude. For fifteen years, Mr. Sun has devoted himself to the revival of classical music, the ancient music that Confucius would use to teach his disciples. Mr. Sun is skilled in the Pipa and is also a famous Xiao player. Special mention should also be made of Mr. Han Zhenhan, the secretary-general of the association, who, in his spare time, has studied the violin with members of the Shanghai Municipal Council Symphony Orchestra. He is a player of the classical melodies of "Erhu" and "Drums." Mr. Han Zhenjia, the younger brother of Mr. Han Zhenhan, also showed his skills in Erhu, cymbals, and Suona in this performance. Others such as Mr. Cao Xuzhen's Erhu, Mr. Zhu Wenyi's Zither and Yangqin, and Mr. Chen's Dongxiao were all excellent.

Among the performers, Miss Shen Shuhuan's solo and Mr. Ye Dazhang and Miss Pu Yu's skilled sword dance added to the expression of the unique temperament of Chinese classical music.

In short, this concert gave everyone a deep and unforgettable impression, especially for those who want to know the secrets of Chinese classical music.

In tense listening, we did not regret spending two hours in the colorful and personalized melodies played on ancient instruments. (Translated by Ge Ruo Nian from the Russian Chira Daily, July 2, the author is the editor-in-chief of the newspaper.)

### Volleyball League Has Begun Progress in Skills Should Be Sought Performances of the Yuhua Green Team Were Quite Remarkable

— Mei Jie

The 33rd Annual Volleyball League kicked off last weekend at the Chinese Gymnasium, with matches every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday. The entire schedule is expected to conclude by the middle of August. After watching the Grade A men's and women's matches, this reporter feels that the standard of this year's league is even worse than in the past. Is it due to a lack of guidance or a lack of training among the players? Here, I sincerely hope that the situation at the beginning of the league will improve later on to please the audience. The reviews of the two matches are as follows:

Last Sunday (the 9th) was the opening match. The first match was in the women's division, with the strong Chinese team, the Three Provinces Team, facing the mediocre Lianhe women's team. The Three Provinces Team has strong strength, and victory was within their grasp. Unfortunately, the Soviet team unexpectedly retreated without a fight and deserted. As a result, the Three Provinces women's team had no opponent and won without effort, which was truly disappointing.

### Yuhua Was Not Outstanding, China Film Was Even More Depressed

Another match was in the Grade A division, with Yuhua playing China Film. Both teams are outstanding among the Chinese teams. This match was no different from resolving a clash between Chinese giants. Therefore, both sides were scheming and fighting for victory. In the end, Yuhua, with its average talent, defeated China Film three to one, but it was indeed a strenuous effort. Looking at the performances of both sides, although the situation was tight, the results were difficult to satisfy. The attack was weak, and the defense was lax. Guo Bingkun's smash of Yuhua was indeed fierce. However, it rarely succeeded in the match and often went out of bounds. China Film only relied on Tan Yonggang and Li Shizhong to maintain the team. The rest of the players were mostly mediocre. Therefore, they had to suffer a crushing defeat. Yuhua's victory was indeed deserved. However, the performance was disappointing. If they encounter the Russian Emigrant First and Second Teams in the Soviet League in the future, things will be more ominous than auspicious if they continue like this. I wonder what team leader Xiao Xigeng will use to train his soldiers to repel the "Huns" and compete for the championship?

On Wednesday (the 12th) of this week, there was also one match each in the women's and Grade A divisions, both between Chinese and Western teams. As a result, the Chinese team won in the women's division, while the foreign team won in the Grade A division.

### The Green Team Displayed Its Might for the First Time Overwhelming the Western Youth Champion

The first match was between the Yuan team and the Western Youth Red women's teams. The Western Youth Red is the championship team in the Western Youth League, having defeated strong Chinese teams such as Hua Peng and Three Provinces in the Western Youth League. Their strength is indeed considered strong. The Green Team was composed of basic members of the basketball team, plus two famous volleyball players, Huang Fufen and Xiang Yulin. At the beginning of their organization, many expected that they would not achieve good results. Most people thought that the Green Team would definitely lose before this match, because two of the Green Team's main players were sick. Unexpectedly, as soon as they made contact, the Green Team was full of momentum. Wang Yinlan's spike, Wang Weizhen's rescue, Huang Mingyuan's smash, and Yan Wei, Rong Shujian, and Xiang Yulin's serves were abnormally magical, causing the foreign women to be stunned and unable to resist. They washed away the female power in the Western Youth volleyball court and lost two games in a row. The Green Team won easily. The Green Team is new to volleyball, and this achievement is not easy. It is also gratifying that they vented their anger for the Chinese women. It is hoped that the Green Team women will continue their good work, so that their volleyball fame will not be difficult to match the basketball team's.

### The White Team Should Have Won But Didn't The Russian B Team Could Avoid Strict Discipline

Next was the Grade A match between the White Team and the Russian Emigrant B Team. The latter is the weakest among the foreign teams. With the White Team's qualifications and experience, it should not be difficult to capture them in one go. After losing the first game, the White Team was determined to make progress and won the second and third games. They also had the upper hand in the fourth game, leading twenty to seventeen. Victory was already within their grasp. Who knew that they would lose Jingzhou through carelessness, losing five points and allowing the Russian Emigrants to tie the score at two games each. In the last game, the White Team tried to recover, but they were unable to do so, and they suffered a tragic defeat by a score of twenty-four to twenty-six after several ties. It was truly unfortunate. As a result, the Russian Emigrant B Team won three to two. The White Team's talent and skills are indeed better than those of the Russian B Team. Their failure was only due to their momentary carelessness in the fourth game. From this, it can be seen that to win a volleyball match, no matter what the situation, you cannot relax even one step. The White Team's failure also taught them a lesson.

### Reflections on Emerging Stars of the Football and Basketball Season

— Bi Xian

This year's football and basketball season has swiftly passed, and all the wonderful performances have become a page in the history of sports. However, sports activities in Shanghai are still thriving. Only a small-scale football (soccer) is being used to provide players with opportunities to stretch their muscles, so as to maintain their skills and achieve further progress in preparation for the next season. Taking advantage of this respite, I will review the emerging stars of this year's football and basketball season and record their achievements, to encourage them to work even harder and to inspire the efforts of those who come after them.

### Emerging Football Talents: Two Stars Rise to Fame

Most football teams this season had many veteran players. Even among the newcomers, most were still somewhat lacking due to experience. However, the following two players are, in my opinion, outstanding among the newcomers and have indeed risen to fame.

Left Winger Li Yao

At the beginning of the season, Li Yao was appointed as the left winger for the Tung Wah team. His name was unfamiliar, and people expected him to achieve nothing. Indeed, in the initial matches, not only was his skill lacking, but he was also exceptionally nervous on the field. However, Mr. Li was very eager to improve and also received guidance from Sun Xishun. Therefore, he made significant progress in each match. By the end of the season, he had become truly impressive. His dribbling and hooking could be described as extremely skillful. Compared to Cao Qiuting, who was famous in Shanghai before, he was not much inferior. What is particularly commendable is that he could also use opportunities to shoot at goal from the wing, and his shooting was indeed successful. Li Yao has only had one season of competing against strong opponents and has already made such progress. His future prospects are immeasurable. I deeply hope that he will not be complacent, but continue to work hard with an open mind. Then his future achievements will be beyond what anyone can predict. Keep striving!

Forward Li Hua, the "Face Saver"

In the "Foreign" (one stroke) team, the names of the Yu brothers were initially unnoticed. Moreover, Li Hua was young and had little experience on the field, so he was not paid much attention to as a newcomer. However, in the match between Tung Wah and a police team, Li Hua took on a challenging role, tasked with guarding You Liang. Young Yu carefully responded and fought bravely. Although he didn't achieve any great success, he certainly restrained You Liang, thus attracting attention. As a result, he was selected as a representative of China and the Chinese League. Although he was on the list, he was not given important tasks by the authorities, so he had few opportunities to show his skills. Therefore, he never gained the trust of the public. However, in the last match, the Chinese League played against the Portuguese League at the Recreation Ground. That day, the Chinese League team was incomplete. In the first half, among the Tung Wah players, there was only Yu Li Hua. Before the match, after some guidance from Li Ning, it was as if a lock had been opened, and Li Hua performed flawlessly, completely stifling Fu En, who was dominant at the time. He also had good communication with the Tung Wah players, so it was difficult to distinguish him as belonging to two different teams. This initial cooperation showed that Li Hua is young and full of potential. If he can get guidance from veteran players, his achievements will not be limited to his current situation.

### Rising Basketball Stars: Only Two Worth Mentioning

In this year's basketball teams, there were many veteran players and also quite a few rising stars. Unfortunately, very few of them achieved success. Only the Chinese League and Ren Yu (Wei Ting) can be mentioned.

Center Wu Chengchang

Mr. Wu's nickname is "Ah Di," which shows his youth. He is highly appreciated by Zhang Hongxiang, the leader of the Chinese League team. Therefore, he played as a regular player from the beginning of the season. Mr. Zhang guided him carefully, believing that he was facing strong opponents for the first time, providing enlightenment in all aspects before and after the games. Ah Di listened and followed the instructions, so his skills improved day by day. Moreover, he was naturally well-proportioned and had good jumping ability, which complemented each other perfectly. By the end of the season, Ah Di's skills as a center were no worse than those of ordinary veteran players, and he became an indispensable member of the Chinese League team. His rapid progress is admirable. Moreover, Ah Di is not arrogant at all. It is expected that in the next season, Wu Chengchang will become even more famous in the basketball world.

Left Forward Lin Weicong

Xiao Lin is the left forward of the Ren Yu team. Since the Ren Yu team was established, they have felt a lack of forwards. At that time, Xiao Lin was still playing in a second-tier team. He was recruited by Xu of Ren Yu. Because he was very eager to improve, he was given a difficult task. However, there was talk of "No great generals in Shu, Liao Hua serves as a vanguard." But as the saying goes, "Where there's a will, there's a way." Xiao Lin worked hard to live up to the responsibility. He improved day by day. In the match between Ren Yu and Zhong Bei, Xiao Lin was energetic and scored the most points, making the opposing defenders suffer greatly. He became a well-known forward in the basketball world. Xiao Lin is still studying and has a good environment. His fame is just around the corner.

### Tidbits

The Youth Friendship Association's stadium has a beautiful environment and complete facilities. It has two volleyball courts, two basketball courts, and one small football field (which can also be used as a tennis court or a croquet court). Each court is surrounded by dense trees, suitable for spectators to stand and watch, making it a good place to play and watch sports. According to Mr. Peng, the president of the association, he is very willing to introduce it to the Shanghai sports community and welcomes rentals. This is good news for sports teams.

This year's football, basketball, and volleyball talents include Zhang Xianlun (football for the Wah Tung team, basketball for the Chinese League team, volleyball for the White team) and Li Zhenzhong (basketball for the Zhong Bei team, volleyball for the Wah Ying team, small football for the Zhong Chu team), etc. There are also foreigners such as Founik and Ivanov, etc. There are countless talents in both basketball and volleyball.

In recent years, sports activities have been booming. For example, this year's small football competition had as many as 180 teams, which is a good phenomenon.

In women's volleyball, veteran players who have played for more than ten years are still showing their prowess. For example, Huang Xingfen of the Green team is still the pillar of the team. Li Bo of the Three Provinces has many children but remains energetic, showing that middle-aged women are not inferior to young women. This makes one feel the difficulty of finding talents and the scarcity of those who come after them.
