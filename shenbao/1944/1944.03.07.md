### Can't Wait

Time is the most important factor in life, and agility is the only key to success. This is true in peacetime and wartime, both at the front and in the rear.

Napoleon said after the Battle of Austerlitz that he was able to defeat the Austrian army because it did not understand the value of "five minutes." Missing a minute gave "misfortune" an extra opportunity to seize. Because one side was behind in time, it allowed the other side to take the lead. War is like playing chess, sometimes "one wrong move can lead to the loss of the whole game."

We often say to seize the present and strive in the present, with the intention of telling everyone not to fantasize about the past or the future. Firstly, because fantasizing is useless, and the result of fantasizing is only to delay action, and the result of delaying action is messing things up. Secondly, the past creates causes, the present bears the consequences, and the present creates causes, which will be the consequences of the future. We hope that the country and society will reap good results in the future, so we must sow good seeds now. Our job is to sow seeds, and fantasizing is useless. As the saying goes, "The ancestors plant trees so that future generations can enjoy the shade." This is the true spirit of sustaining the country and the nation. Anyone who hopes that their descendants will be able to enjoy the shade in the future must work hard to plant trees now.

Striving in the present is a matter of practice, not just empty talk. If you talk about good ideals and good plans every day, but you don't have the courage to realize them, and you don't have the courage to execute them, then your ideals and plans are in vain. Furthermore, if you miss a moment, miss an opportunity, then good ideals and good plans have to be revised and adapted to the environment when they are implemented, so that they can be implemented more conveniently. Again, and most importantly, missing an opportunity may mean you will never have the chance to realize your good ideals or execute your good plans. Therefore, striving in the present must be done immediately, it cannot wait.

Modern warfare is a competition between countries, it's a relay race. On the racetrack, when you receive the baton, you must run forward immediately, you can't wait even a second, and you must run to the second station and hand the baton to someone else before you can rest. If you are running to the finish line, you must go all out, be brave and go forward, and you cannot relax one step until you reach the finish line. This year is the year of the decisive battle, it is precisely the time when everyone is running towards the finish line. The people of every country have already received the baton, and the government authorities are the first to receive it. They must lead a group of "national relay runners" towards the destination. Whoever reaches the finish line first wins. At a critical moment, you can't wait even a second, and you can't stop even one step. If you are a little late, the victory or defeat will be decided, the race will be over, and it will be too late even if you want to run again.

In this Greater East Asia War, China's fate is the best, because in this Greater East Asia race team, our ally Japan, the best athlete, is our vanguard, and has already taken the lead by many steps on the track, forcing the other side to spend a lot of effort to catch up. Because our ally's efforts have saved us a lot of energy and a lot of time. This is our good opportunity. Now we are approaching the finish line. Our ally Japan's efforts will enable all the athletes to reach the destination. Do we not even have the courage to run the last leg? Do we still have to wait? Are we still going to hold back our teammates?

A person's good opportunity is hard to come by, and a country's good opportunity is even rarer. It is most important to seize the opportunity and work hard. "Don't wait idly, turning your young head white, only to grieve in vain." We would like to offer Yue Wumu's words to the people of the country.

### British Army Suffers Heavy Blow, Attempt to Invade Burma Foiled; Japanese Army Achieves Great War Results in Mopping-Up Operations

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – Burma front, 6th: Since the Japanese army on the Burma-India front launched an annihilation battle to reduce the strength of the British 7th Division that had invaded in front of Buthidaung, after breaking through the enemy's position on the banks of the Mayu River on February 4th, it took only twenty days to encircle the remnants of the enemy's main force in the Sinzwea basin and launch a mopping-up operation, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. To date, the Japanese army has achieved extremely significant war results, including 7,000 enemy corpses (of which at least about 3,000 were British), 600 enemy prisoners, and a large number of Indian soldiers joining the Indian National Army. In addition, 10 enemy rapid-fire guns, 11 mortars, 96 heavy and light machine guns, as well as automatic rifles, pistol ammunition, clothing, horses, etc. were captured incalculable. Moreover, 21 10mm cannons and 15mm howitzers, 20 howitzers, 6 anti-aircraft guns, 45 tanks, 660 trucks, 17 boats, and a large amount of other military supplies were destroyed. According to this statistic, it only reflects what was confirmed by the Japanese army during the war. In addition, the number of enemy corpses and abandoned weapons not recovered by the Japanese army is often very large, so the actual enemy losses are bound to be greater than this. The results of this battle are comparable to the results obtained in the Arakan campaign last spring in terms of spoils of war. The number of enemy corpses is 1,800 more than in the previous Arakan campaign, and the number of prisoners has increased by 14. The situation encountered by the British 7th Division is somewhat similar to that encountered by the British-Indian 14th Division in the previous Arakan campaign. If the confirmed enemy damage is included, then the extent of the losses of the British 7th Division is even greater. The rout of the British 7th Division has dashed the enemy's attempt to counterattack Burma. At the same time, the tragic defeat suffered by the enemy this time makes it impossible for them to recover in the short term.

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – A certain base on the Arakan front: The Indian National Army is fighting alongside the Japanese army to win independence for their motherland, and their activities on the Arakan front have attracted much attention. The Indian National Army either charges at the British army with guns in hand, or endures the pain of shooting at their compatriots rushing towards the Japanese army's positions. In the Sinzwea basin battle, a unit of the Indian National Army, working with the Japanese army, circled to the rear of the enemy and cut off their retreat. They blew up the enemy's airfield north of Ngakyedauk and fiercely attacked the nearby enemy, capturing a large number of important secret documents. On the evening of the 17th, they made contact with the Japanese army, occupied the enemy's outpost six kilometers north of Ngakyedauk, and routed the enemy's motor vehicle unit. Recently, the army has assisted the Japanese army in undertaking the task of cutting off the retreat of the enemy on the front line, launching night attacks with the Japanese army and charging into the enemy's positions with bayonets, annihilating them. In short, the soldiers of the Indian National Army are continuing to strive for the independence of their motherland, and are adding a glorious page to the new history of a free India.

### Breakdown of Chongqing-Communist Negotiations; Serious Disputes Arise; Chongqing Believes the Communist Reductions Are Too Harsh

Central News Agency Report: The Chongqing-Communist dispute is becoming increasingly serious, and tensions are mounting. Recently, according to relevant authorities in this city, news of the Chongqing-Communist dispute has been obtained. This matter was published in the mouthpiece newspaper of the American Republican Party on the 5th of this month, which stated that Chongqing will announce the activities of the Chinese Communists at the Cairo Conference on New Year's Eve, which is not a good sign for China. Chiang himself believes that this situation is related to Chongqing's Soviet diplomacy, which further increased Chiang's unease, and he complained to US President Roosevelt. At the same time, the Chongqing side nominally listened to the advice of Britain and the United States and, in order to avoid a full-scale civil war, planned to seek a political solution to resolve the dispute. On January 4th of this year, special personnel were dispatched to Xi'an to negotiate with representatives of the Communist Party. At that time, the Communist Party put forward many conditions, including political, economic, cultural, and military issues. The Chongqing representatives believed that the conditions put forward by the Communist Party were too harsh and were greatly dissatisfied. The Chongqing representatives, He Yaobu and Shang Zhen, returned to Chongqing and resigned from their posts as representatives. They then made a statement to the Ta Kung Pao reporters, saying that the conditions put forward by Yan'an were intended to seize power under the guise of a united front. Especially in the military field, their ambition was evident. The Chongqing side would naturally not tolerate such an attitude from the Communist Party and refused to negotiate with them. They also said that this breakdown was the result of the Communist Party's lack of sincerity. Subsequently, the Communist Party also issued a statement, in which Chen Shaoyu spoke to reporters from TASS and the Associated Press, claiming that the Chongqing side had always been evasive and lacked concrete expressions, so they had to strive for a common goal and demand that Chongqing reflect. After the breakdown of the Chongqing-Communist negotiations, the Chongqing side immediately sent troops to surround Yan'an. It is said that three divisions of Hu Zongnan's troops were advancing from Xi'an, and two divisions of Fu Zuoyi's troops were pushing towards Wuyuan. In addition, three divisions were also surrounding Yulin. After the breakdown of the negotiations, the armies of both sides were in a state of confrontation, which was extremely serious. Inspections from Xi'an to Yan'an were very strict, as a countermeasure to block Yan'an. Therefore, the serious conflict between Chongqing and the Communists that occurred last August is about to happen again at the bottom.

### General Sends Personnel to Pay Respects to Chiang's Mother's Grave

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – Since Chiang Kai-shek's blind resistance against Japan has failed, his greatest distress is that he cannot pay respects to his late mother's grave in his hometown. General [Shunroku] Hata, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army, out of his deep samurai spirit, specially ordered the chief of the Political Trust Corps to pay respects at the end of last year. After receiving the order, the chief of the corps invited Lieutenant General Zhu Qingchuan of the National Government Army to the enemy-occupied Xikou Town, Fenghua County, Chiang's hometown. Xikou Town is located in the area closest to the Chongqing army. Many relatives attended the ceremony, including Chiang's nephew Wang Yiguo, and even a certain Buddhist monk, a cousin of Chiang who had already become a monk. In addition to offering a large wreath as a sacrificial offering, Commander-in-Chief Hata also left monks to chant scriptures in front of the grave for seven days. Chiang's relatives and friends were deeply grateful for the Japanese military authorities' generosity and kindness.

### Mountbatten's Poor Command

Subject to Criticism from the US

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – Haisheng News Agency reports that a US source said that a Washington official criticized Mountbatten's India-Burma campaign for not achieving any major success, only taking a defensive posture instead of an offensive one. The Japanese army controls the waterways in the area, and Britain has no hope of hindering their transport.

### Filipino Religious Followers Support the Government

Manila, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – In order to establish the foundation of the Philippine Republic, various religious groups in the country, such as Catholics and Protestants, have unanimously resolved to fully support the Laurel government. The Aglipayan Church, the Philippine Independent Church with 1.5 million followers, held a national representative conference and decided on the 2nd to support the policies of the Laurel government. Therefore, the system of cooperation between all Filipino Christians and the government is becoming more solid. After the religious groups and the government are integrated, they will make a great contribution to the promotion of various constructions in the new country.

### Grand Celebration of the Prophet Muhammad's Birthday in Syonan

Syonan, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – Today is the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad. All households here are flying both the Islamic flag and the Japanese flag to show their congratulations. The general Muslim population is celebrating this day with sincere reverence. This morning, about a thousand male Muslims gathered in two groups at Kay Guan Road and Malacca Road.

At 11:30 a.m., they entered the mosque to pray and wish the Greater East Asia War victory for Japan. After the prayers, they went to the Islamic Malay School to rest. A fast-breaking ceremony was held at 4:00 p.m., which was unprecedentedly grand and rare in Syonan after the war.

### Burmese Cabinet Approves Next Year's Budget; Will Increase Taxes and Purchase Rice

Rangoon, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – The Burmese government approved next year's budget at the cabinet meeting on the 4th, and passed the government's original proposal. After it is decided by the Privy Council, it will be formally decided soon. According to the budget proposal, the revenue is 69 million rupees, and the expenditure is 281 million rupees. The difference of 212 million rupees will be borrowed from the Bank of Burma to make up the deficit. The expenditure includes a special accounting of 17 million rupees for rice purchase funds. Compared with the current budget decided last October, the above budget proposal has an increase of 27 million rupees in revenue and an increase of 94 million rupees in expenditure. When compiling the next year's budget proposal, the Burmese government placed special emphasis on expanding national defense and security, as well as assisting Japan in various aspects. In terms of revenue, it is planned to raise the income tax by a certain amount, and special changes will also be made to the existing profit tax and other systems. The planned amount of revenue will be maintained within the possible limits of the existing institutions, and a reserve fund will be added to the Ministry of Finance's budget to give it flexibility when implementing the budget. As for the rice purchase funds, they are actually reduced compared with last year, and it has been decided to combine the temporary rice purchase expenses for this fiscal year with the new budget as funds for purchasing rice. This plan will greatly contribute to the self-sufficiency of rice.

### A General Overview of the European War Situation

The Soviet offensive on the military front is gradually reaching its climax. The Red Army, which initially began its attack in the southern Ukrainian region, has failed to capture the areas within the bend of the Dnieper River in one fell swoop. As for the central front, the thrust towards the Romanian border, although it broke through some points of the old Polish border in early January, was thwarted by German resistance, and the offensive was defeated. From this point on, the main battlefield on the eastern front shifted to the northern region from Leningrad to Lake Ilmen and Peipus. Its vanguard has already reached the Estonian border and is currently engaged in fierce fighting.

This serious situation on the eastern front is related to the Anglo-American attempts to land in Europe, and even to the trends of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, close attention must be paid to the future movements of the Soviet Union.

Limits of the Red Army's Advance

Will the Red Army take advantage of its momentum and continue to advance? The Soviet Union's position:

The Soviet Union has repeatedly declared that it is a defensive war.

It has been carrying out unprofitable wars for the past two and a half years, and is therefore unable to pursue the German army, and this is not a good strategy for the Soviet Union itself.

Instead of exhausting all its strength to completely defeat Germany, it is better to continuously strive to strengthen its national power in order to prepare for dealing with Britain and the United States in the future.

Conversely, when Germany's existence no longer poses a major threat to the Soviet Union at a certain time, it must preserve Germany's existence. Britain and the United States do not want the Soviet Union to have a monopoly in the southern Balkans, the three Baltic countries in the north, and Northern Europe.

Benefits of Shortening the Front

Looking at it from the German side, the German army has regarded the loss of each city and town as an accident. Since last year, according to the grand operational plan, it has reorganized the front line and completed the most advantageous posture. The retreat operation has come to an end. If the Soviet Union continues to pursue, it will be welcomed by Germany. Just as the anti-Axis forces in Southern Europe are making empty promises of landing without actually doing so, the Soviet Union may not necessarily want to engage in a decisive battle. Although everyone wants to exert their full strength and resolve the situation in one fell swoop with a decisive battle, the situation is too complex and there are too many future problems that are difficult to resolve.

Strategies of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union

From this perspective, the heavy pressure on the eastern front is only a threat on the map, and the key lies in the enemy's strategy of politically exploiting this situation. The first is the possibility of a new situation in the German-Soviet and German-British relations that is widely rumored in neutral countries. The second is the political situation in the southern Balkan countries, the three Baltic countries in the north, and Finland. The former is the strategy of Britain and the United States towards Bulgaria and Romania; the latter is the Soviet Union's strategy to politically compensate for its military weaknesses. However, the Balkan countries realize that there is no way to survive except by being united with Germany. Finland also criticizes the Soviet Union's new measures as merely wanting to gain more voting points in future international negotiations. What freedom, liberation, and respect for independence are just a disguised form of aggressive domination.

Offensive Against Neutral Countries

Echoing these Soviet political activities is the advance of the Anglo-American "offensive against neutral countries" and the bombing of Germany. That is, Britain and the United States, taking advantage of the momentum of pressuring Argentina, are attacking Spain and Portugal, and are active in Turkey and Sweden, planning to pull these countries over to the anti-Axis side. The reasons for this are:

1. Britain and the United States do not yet have the strength to launch a decisive second front in Europe.

2. Weakening Germany's war potential through air strikes, on the one hand, is to accommodate the Soviet Union's demands, and on the other hand, it is to exert retaliatory power.

3. The comprehensive strengthening of air strikes leads people to believe that the Anglo-American army's landing in Europe will begin.

4. Taking advantage of the lending background, before forming a decisive second front, in order to shape its political position and to supervise the Soviet Union's activities, it is constantly pulling neutral countries over to the anti-Axis side.

The political influence resulting from the new situation on the eastern front is being realized in various forms, but it all depends on the domestic situation in Germany. Today's situation in Germany is that it is fully exerting its strength to strengthen its national power in order to prepare for a future counter-offensive.

### Price of Nanjing Silk Falls

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – The cotton cloth merchants in Nanjing, because the authorities have prohibited the free trading of cotton cloth, have hoarded large quantities of silk and satin in order to manipulate market prices. Affected by this, the market price of silk and satin has gradually risen. However, since the authorities issued a decree allowing the free trading of cotton in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and Nanjing, except for Shanghai, people's morale has been low, and the market price of silk and satin has fallen. All the hoarders are anxious, truly what is called reaping what you sow.

### War Results of the Japanese Army Air Force over New Guinea; Eleven Enemy Aircraft Destroyed in Attack on Wewak

Two Japanese aircraft did not return to their original bases in the battle.

### The Anti-Axis Is Also Deeply Impressed by the Japanese Military's Strategy in the South Pacific

Zurich, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – According to a British weekly magazine's discussion of the overview of the Japanese military's counterattack in the Pacific: Considering the facts, it can be known that the Japanese military is invincible when attacking. When engaged in defensive warfare, it is also equally awe-inspiring. Moreover, the strategy of the Japanese military's supreme command is completely different from that of the military authorities of Western European countries. Although they sometimes shift their positions to shorten the front line, or retreat from difficult-to-defend areas, or transfer due to lack of food and supplies, they will never surrender as a result. The anti-Axis forces mostly expected the Japanese troops in Lae, Finschhafen, and Bougainville in New Guinea to be in a desperate predicament, but the blows they suffered when the anti-Axis forces attacked Lae and Finschhafen were indeed beyond their expectations.

### ### Chongqing Legal Tender Plummets - Recorded by Guilin Ta Kung Pao

Hanoi, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Chongqing has lost free foreign exchange markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong, and the legal tender market has plummeted. Later, the excessive use of US dollars by the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing further lowered the value of the legal tender, causing prices to soar. According to the recent Guilin Ta Kung Pao sent here, it stated the actual situation and pointed out the incompetence of the Chongqing authorities. The general idea is: In the past, the official exchange rate of legal tender to the US dollar was 20 yuan to 1 US dollar, but the Ministry of Finance, starting from January of this year, implemented a revised method, stipulating 40 yuan of legal tender to 1 US dollar, considering it a method of yielding to the US. But in reality, the black market price of the US dollar in Guilin recently is about 120 yuan per dollar, and in Kunming, it is more than 150 yuan, equivalent to six to seven times the official price, or three to four times the revised market price. According to the Chongqing Municipal Government's published commodity price index for the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), the average is 253 times that before the war. The purchasing power of the legal tender has plummeted to one two-hundred-and-fiftieth of what it was before the war. In Guilin, the minimum monthly living expenses per person require 2,000 yuan. This explains the failure of the authorities' foreign exchange policy using the US dollar.

At the same time, the name of the County Administration Personnel Training Institute will be changed to County Magistrate Training Institute.

### Regarding the Pacific Theater, British and American Opinions Diverge - The Military Employs the Wonders of Interior Operations

The nature of the American so-called "general counteroffensive against Japan" is to disregard the enormous sacrifices of one country, relying only on the quantitative advantage of its materials to promote "island-hopping warfare." However, the military commentator of the London Observer wrote in the newspaper:

The war resources of the anti-Axis alliance are not unlimited. Therefore, large-scale operations such as the current anti-Axis military's significant sacrifices in the Pacific will gradually deplete the anti-Axis alliance's resources and immediately affect the European theater, inflicting a significant blow on the anti-Axis military's operations against Germany.

The reporter also pointed out that the anti-Axis side's operational plans, whether for the war against Germany or the war against Japan, should be closely coordinated. However, when the United States conducted this large-scale war, it did not communicate with the British side in advance, so the British side expressed deep dissatisfaction. Furthermore, the United States has no "end game" in its war against Japan, and the British side is deeply concerned about the American war against Japan. The gist of his argument is as follows:

Covering the vast amount of ships for two divisions

We, the British, cannot regard the American war against Japan as insignificant. This can be understood by considering how the United States used a large number of ships in the landing operation on the Marshall Islands. That is, the amount of ships participating in the attack on the Marshall Islands could at least transport twenty US army divisions to Europe. During the North African campaign of the anti-Axis military, what efforts did we make to turn North Africa, only 150 miles from the European continent, into a springboard for operations against Europe? We spent several months of concentrated effort in forming the assault fleet used in the North African and Italian operations.

In order to turn the Marshall Islands into a springboard for operations against Truk Island, 1,300 miles away, and Guam, 1,800 miles away, what kind of effort and material resources should the anti-Axis side pay? That is far beyond what North Africa could be compared to. To transport the forces of two divisions and the materials they need to a location 3,000 miles from the base requires 2 million tons of cargo ships, and these ships themselves must also be supplied. Therefore, forward bases must be gradually built in preparation for the second step of the action. The vastness of the cargo ships needed to transport the materials is truly astounding. The amount of ships needed for operations in Europe is insignificant compared to the amount of ships needed for operations in the Marshall Islands. Moreover, the American troops who landed in the Marshall Islands are not enough to attack the most important base of the Japanese army in the Pacific, so more troops and more transport ships are needed. This demand for ships has shocked even the American shipbuilding tycoon Henry Kaiser.

Two-Front Warfare Without Prior Understanding

During the Quebec conference, the American side did not declare this scale of Pacific operations, and the anti-Axis side will feel surprised if the United States continues to do so in the future. The most difficult problem facing the anti-Axis side is the Second Front, but the Pacific operations are even more difficult than this. The assets and the spirit of sacrifice of the anti-Axis allies must be put to an even more terrible test. The current stage of the Pacific war resembles the Eastern Front. The places we reach are all Japanese bases. Spread across the entire Pacific, forming a deep battle line. Attacking the Marshall Islands is only the first test. Moreover, Japan still has many people who can be mobilized as soldiers and used as military supply workers, and its military strength is still extremely strong. The navy has almost maintained the same strength as it did at the start of the Greater East Asia War, and there are no signs of any decline in the strength of the army and navy air forces.

The Japanese Military's Strategic Posture is Solid

The military commentator of the Swedish capital's Dagens Nyheter also expressed the same view as follows:

Even if a decisive battle between Japan and the United States is inevitable in the future, Japan will seize the most favorable time to concentrate its fleet on the favorable waters near its central base for combat. Therefore, no matter how much the American navy boasts about its material superiority, "it is impossible to counter the Japanese military's advantageous strategic position." The Japanese military, which has shifted from an offensive to a defensive posture, is inflicting great damage on the American military through the resistance of small garrisons and small fleets, ambushing the American military's advance everywhere - the so-called bleeding tactics. Even if the American military obtains local victories, the large-scale American operations against Japan in the air seem to focus more on the central offensive route to the bases that Japan considers far away. However, the southwestern Pacific operations that correspond to this and are most desired by the United States have not been realized due to the Japanese military's strengthened defenses. Therefore, the Japanese military is employing the wonders of interior operations and has a chance of achieving piecemeal victories. Therefore, the future of the Pacific war is worth paying attention to. - (Zhi: Translated from the February 15th Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi)

### Fighting on the Old Polish Border - Soviet Union Deploys Fourteen Infantry Divisions

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to the Hai Tong News Agency: The Soviet attack on Shepetovka was anticipated by the German Command. Recently, German aircraft repeatedly bombed Soviet troop concentrations, inflicting heavy damage. However, the Soviets still attacked with approximately twelve to fourteen infantry divisions and three tank units, creating several gaps in the German lines. The intensity of the fighting is rare on the Eastern Front. Shepetovka is located on the Berdichev to Rovno railway line, suitably south of the Soviet fortified triangle of Lutsk, Rovno, and Dubno. The Soviet objective is not yet known, whether it is related to the fighting south of Krivoy Rog, or hard to say. The Eastern Front is unchanged except for Shepetovka. Fighting is more intense in the areas of Vitebsk, Narva, and Pskov.

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Soviet army penetrated the German defense line to a width of four kilometers. In order to conserve forces, the Germans retreated to positions under artillery cover.

Intense Fighting on Both North and South Routes

The Soviet's second offensive focus is between Lake Peipus and Finland, with the aim of returning the three Baltic states to its sphere of influence. On the other hand, they also want Finland to accept a truce at any cost. The Soviet army wants to capture the Narva passage in order to occupy the Finnish Baltic coast. South of Krivoy Rog, more reinforcements were sent into the breach created in the previous few days, launching fierce attacks all day. The Soviet army widened its breach by several hundred meters, but its breakthrough attempt ultimately failed.

German Air Force Active on Eastern Front Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) German military circles announced: The German Air Force was active on the Eastern Front on Saturday, despite poor weather conditions, bombing Soviet convoys and tanks, and areas where forward units were deployed. At Zhitomir, German aircraft destroyed Soviet artillery, silencing them. Between Lake Peipus and Finland, German aircraft bombed enemy fortifications and destroyed many of their artillery pieces.

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) The German Fuhrer's headquarters announced: American bomber squadrons carried out terror bombings on western Germany throughout the 4th. The damage to residential areas and civilian casualties were most severe in Cologne and Bonn. Several churches, hospitals, and public buildings were also hit. A small number of bomber formations, under the protection of fighter escorts, also entered the Berlin area. Because the German Air Force was extremely active, the American aircraft were unable to concentrate their bombing. As a result, 41 were shot down, including 21 four-engine bombers.

### Chile Recognizes Argentine Government

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to United Press news obtained in New York: The Chilean government has recognized the Farrell government of Argentina and declared that it considers the Farrell government a continuation of the Ramirez government. According to United Press news from Buenos Aires, several South American governments have notified Washington that they will suffer economic difficulties if they have further disputes with Argentina. Several South American countries have decided to abandon the mutual consultation method, which was initiated to clarify their attitude towards Argentina. The termination of this consultation method may also lead to a reconsideration of the attitude towards Bolivia. The South American governments have notified Washington that the refusal to recognize the new government of Bolivia lacks practical effect.

Geneva, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) The German News Agency reports, according to a United Press correspondent stationed in the capital of Uruguay: Uruguay and Paraguay are prepared to follow Chile and Bolivia in recognizing the new Argentine government. This move may create a rift in Pan-American common relations and lead to the formation of a South American bloc led by Argentina.

Argentina Implements Measures to Ensure Domestic Security

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to Reuters news, Argentine new government leader Farrell will declare at a reception: The Argentine government is determined to eradicate all elements within the country that could endanger the security of the continent. He will not rest until every trace of espionage is completely eliminated. Justice and the information possessed by Argentines lead Argentines to believe that Argentina plays an important role in the cooperation of the continent. Regarding the question of whether Argentina will strengthen cooperation with the countries of the Americas, Farrell said that the situation remains the same. Argentina supplies its sister countries with food and raw materials, which is enough to help solve their problems; otherwise, they will fall into difficult circumstances. If the situation returns to normal, the military leaders will hand over political power to the representatives of the people. He hopes this will be realized soon.

American Actions Do Not Consistitute an Ultimatum

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) The German News Agency reports: The severance of diplomatic relations between the US and Argentina is justified by the pretext of a German threat to the Western Hemisphere. The countries of the Americas unanimously recognize that the United States' "good neighbor" policy is merely a demand for unconditional surrender to American political and economic dictatorship. The economic prosperity that Argentina currently enjoys is entirely due to its policy of neutrality, but this conflicts with Washington's plans. Therefore, the United States is threatening Argentina with the blockade of the Rio de la Plata estuary, in order to force Argentina to sever relations with the Axis powers, and recently it has even wanted to make Argentina a member of the Allies. The propaganda war and psychological warfare launched by Washington, with their slogans of democratic principles and public interests, are forcing Argentina to surrender. The United States is now violating the Atlantic Charter, which is even worse than Churchill's recent speech.

### Soviet Army Replaces Commander on Ukrainian Front

### Military Exercises Held on Western Swedish Border - Diplomatic Support Depends on Military Strength

Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) The German News Agency reports: Swedish troops are currently holding military exercises in the western province of Dalsland, near the Norwegian border. The fundamental significance of this move is to defend against aggression from Norway. This morning's newspaper said that Sweden has repeatedly held similar exercises in the past few years, but they were all done in secret.

Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to the Hai Tong News Agency: Swedish Defense Minister Sköld gave a speech, forcefully arguing for the necessity of Swedish military preparations. He revealed that Sweden spends 6 million kronor per day on military preparations. The minister also said that the military is a prerequisite for foreign policy, so the foreign minister should know the power of the military as a support for diplomacy. The expansion of Swedish military power enables the country to implement a more forceful policy, but maintaining military preparations requires spending money and sacrificing other items of expenditure.

### Maintaining Territorial Integrity - Bulgaria Determined to Maintain Friendly Relations with Turkey

Sofia, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to Hai Tong News Agency: Bulgarian Minister of Public Works Vassilev gave a speech at a mass meeting in the Black Sea port of Varna yesterday, refuting the Allied demand that Bulgarian troops withdraw from Macedonia and Thrace, saying that this demand is completely contrary to the Atlantic Charter. According to him, both historically and ethnically, Bulgaria should be the master of the two provinces. Since its founding, Bulgaria has regarded the liberation of the two provinces as the goal of its foreign policy. The Atlantic Charter does recognize the principle of national self-determination, but the fact proves that the Atlantic Charter is just President Wilson's old tune. Demanding that Bulgarian troops withdraw from Macedonia and Thrace not only harms Bulgaria's honor but also destroys the work of national liberation. For the prosperity of the Balkans, Bulgaria deeply desires to maintain friendly relations with neighboring countries and hopes that the rights of all countries will be respected. Regarding the Allied desire to destroy Bulgaria's unity with air raids, Vassilev claimed: There are no foreigners in Bulgaria, and Bulgaria is determined to maintain national freedom and not allow foreigners to set foot on Bulgarian soil. Regarding relations with Turkey, there has never been a dispute between Bulgaria and Turkey since the Balkan Wars. The two countries are now working together to build a new order in Southeast Europe. The two countries have made considerable efforts in the construction of the railway bridge over the Danube River. The Allied powers are waging psychological warfare against Bulgaria, hoping to change its foreign policy, but Bulgarians do not trust them. Vassilev then briefly discussed the war situation, praising the fighting spirit of the Bulgarian army, saying that the Bulgarian army will fight to the end for the integrity of the country.

### Egypt to Implement Compulsory Military Service

Ankara, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to Hai Tong News Agency, news from Cairo: The Egyptian government is considering implementing a two-year compulsory military service system.

### Tense Soviet-Polish Relations

The Soviet Union's desires are increasing day by day without end. Poland, wanting to adapt to the Soviet Union's wishes, must sacrifice its independence.

### Marshall and Others Advocate Delaying the Establishment of a Jewish State

Based on Military Reasons

Geneva, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) The German News Agency reports, according to the exchange telegrams from Washington: At a closed-door meeting of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall strongly advocated postponing discussion of the bill related to Palestine. Secretary of War Stimson seconded the motion. If the bill is passed, it will result in a request for London to allow Jews to immigrate to Palestine. Based on military reasons, he apparently meant that the current military situation is critical, and the United States should avoid conflict with the Arab nations.

Ankara, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to Hai Tong News Agency, news from Jerusalem: "The Palestine Post" said that April 1, stipulated in the 1939 British White Paper, is the date after which, for several weeks, it will lodge protests.

### Unstable Situation in French Morocco

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) The conflict between Palestinian Arabs and Jews is intensifying, and its unstable situation has spread throughout the West Asia and has also frequently caused disturbances in French Morocco.

### British-Canadian Food Negotiations Reach a Deadlock

Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) The German News Agency reports, according to British newspapers: British requests for Canada to continue supplying food have reached a deadlock, but these newspapers are prohibited from explaining the reason. Most British people know that Canada is no longer prepared to supply food to England in the same quantity as before (England's food planting is entirely dependent on Canada's supply), but the reason is not entirely to be obtained in the current food negotiations. The newspapers reported that the focus of the negotiations was on extending the British-Canadian food agreement, and they initially did not expect difficulties to arise suddenly. For example, the Daily Express said that the problem is whether Canada will maintain its export volume according to previous precedents, and how Canada should price its large amount of grains and its political problems, but there were no results. It is widely believed that British-Canadian relations are poor, and for many years Canada has paid less attention to London's leadership.

### Mighty Generals on the German-Soviet Front

The Soviet Union has concentrated its firepower on the central and southern sections of the Eastern Front, launching a major offensive. Simultaneously, it has begun a counteroffensive in the northwestern region of Lake Ilmen and the northern area of Leningrad. The German-Soviet front extends from the vast plains of the West Orsha Gap, with its icy conditions, through the border of Belarus, the Vitebsk area west of Nevel, the western axis region, the upper reaches of the Velikaya River near the old Polish border, and the southwest of Velikiye Luki to the Krivoy Rog line in Crimea.

### Even the Most Beautiful Peony Needs Green Leaves to Support It.

Central News Agency reports: The Shanghai Commerce and Trade Association recently wrote to Director Yuan of the Rice Management Committee to improve the allocation of household rice rations for residents in this city. They suggested that the distribution of rice should be standardized as polished white rice and made public to prevent unscrupulous rice shops from taking advantage of loopholes and creating abuses. According to reporter inquiries, Director Yuan has responded favorably to the proposal, stating, "Your suggestions are insightful and greatly appreciated. However, the allocation of rice to residents of this city falls under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Rice Rationing Adjustment Committee. We have forwarded this matter to the committee to urge them to make corrections to alleviate the people's hardships."

The Rice Control Committee has become increasingly busy, and its current location near the Tianhou Temple Bridge is no longer sufficient. Therefore, it has moved its office on the 5th of this month to a new address at 305 Jing'an Temple Road, Section 1, Shanghai (at the intersection of Huangpi Road), inside the Racecourse (formerly the Cotton Industry Management Office). The switchboard telephone number is 60082, connecting to various departments. This information has been reported and distributed to relevant agencies, and a public notice has been placed in the newspaper to inform the public.

### Security Bureau Detective Team Cracks "Tian Ji" Case Principal Culprit Ling Weide and Accomplice Gu Changfa Arrested

Central News Agency reports: Recently, cases of child abduction, stripping, and murder have occurred frequently in this city, with extremely cruel and shocking methods. Gu Baolin, captain of the Security Bureau Detective Team, recognizing the serious nature of these robbery and murder cases, organized a special investigation team, sending detectives in all directions, with a deadline to solve the cases. They learned that the abducted children were always led away by people impersonating soldiers, so they focused their efforts on this aspect to uncover the truth. Until the 2nd of this month, detectives at the Great New World amusement park suddenly noticed a suspicious young man wearing military-style clothing

Acting Suspiciously

This aroused the attention of the detectives, who followed him closely. They later learned that the young man lived in a bungalow at 288 Lane, Er'erke Road, and his name was Ling Weide (nickname Shun'gen). They also found that children from the Ruitai Copper and Iron Shop at the entrance of the lane, as well as a child named Da A'er from number 40 in the lane, had disappeared one after another. Then, they were stripped and sent back, making the situation even more suspicious. The detectives determined that the young man was highly likely to be involved and dispatched officers to arrest Ling Weide the next day. After interrogation, he

Confessed Without Denial

He also confessed to his accomplice, Gu Changfa, who lived in Gujiazhai, Xin Hongzhen. The detectives rushed to that location and arrested Gu Changfa, who also confessed without denial. They confessed to luring the children from the Ruitai Copper Shop and Da A'er to a small stream behind the Dongyang Flower Garden Ice Factory on Feihong Road, Hongzhen, stripping off their wool sweaters, and then letting the children go back. Also, an eight-year-old nephew of a Lu surname living at number 20, Renxin Lane, Feihong Road, Hongzhen, was lured to the stream south of a small stone bridge in Beisha Port, Jiangwan, where his wool sweater and pants were stripped off, and the child was

Pushed Into the Stream

After the child was pushed into the stream, he cried loudly. A woman surnamed Ma passed by and called for help, rescuing the child and sending him home. Also, a child surnamed Shi from the cigarette shop opposite the Sanguo Restaurant on Tangshan Road was lured to a stream across from the Dongyang Middle School on Qimei Road, where his wool sweater and pants were stripped off and he was pushed into the stream,

Dying Immediately. In addition, Zhang Hou from Wenguang Primary School on Penglai Road was also taken by Ling to the stream around 2 PM on the 4th, who stripped him and pushed him into the stream. Later, twenty-seven wool sweaters and pants of the victimized schoolchildren were recovered from the Shunfeng Pawnshop on Linping Road. It was discovered that Ling Weide had a resident ID card. The suspect has been handed over to the military law department for investigation and prosecution to seek justice for the victimized families in the city.

At the same time, the families of the victims have been notified to come to the team to identify and claim their clothing. Some families came to claim the clothes, but the child had already been killed. Their sorrowful expressions were pitiful. The cruelty of this crime is ten times worse than the kidnapping and extortion of bandits. The team has already recovered twenty-seven wool sweaters of the abducted children, but no one has come to identify and claim them. The victimized families are urged to come to the team in Fahua West Town to investigate and claim their clothing as soon as possible. The time is from 10 AM to 4 PM.

### Smallpox Outbreak Discovered in Western Shanghai Health Bureau Actively Conducting Vaccinations

Central News Agency reports: Recently, cases of genuine smallpox have been discovered in Yongyuan Lane on Jing'an Temple Road, Caojia Lane in Daxi, and the Caojia Residence inside Kainal Road, Gisi Fei Road, in the Fourth District of Shanghai. A portion of the residents have already succumbed to the disease. Therefore, the Fourth Health Office of the First District Government, recognizing the rapid spread of smallpox in the district, is actively carrying out prevention work. In addition to disinfecting the areas where smallpox has been discovered, they have also notified the neighborhood leaders to inform the residents in the district to get vaccinated and issue certificates.

### The Largest Orphanage Shanghai Orphanage

Difficulties and Expectations

Precisely because it is so large, although it is managed quite well, and general expenses are kept to a minimum, the financial aspect still presents great difficulties. First, in terms of food, according to Director Lu, the orphanage can receive approximately twelve dan eight dou seven sheng of rationed rice per month, totaling 7,722 yuan (based on the old price of 6 yuan per sheng), and 1,809 jin of rationed flour, totaling 12,663 yuan (based on the old price of 7 yuan per jin). This is only enough for sixteen days. There is also a special allocation of ten sacks of rice per month, each sack totaling 6,240.5 yuan based on the old price of 891.8 yuan. This is enough for about seven days. The rest must be purchased from the black market, at least nine dan per month (enough for seven days), requiring another 14,400 yuan at the old price of 166 yuan per dan. Based on today's market prices, monthly food expenses alone total over 47,000 yuan. In addition, fuel, for economy, is mainly rice husks, totaling 120 loads per month, requiring approximately 4,800 yuan. Coal briquettes cost at least ten dan per month, totaling no less than 5,000 or 6,000 yuan. Meals for the teaching staff include seven tables for lunch and dinner, costing only 16 yuan per table, and three and a half tables of congee and vegetables, costing 3 yuan per table, totaling 320 yuan per day. For the 254 orphans, it costs 7.5 fen per person, totaling over 190 yuan per day; two staff members and three cooks cost 1.5 yuan per person, totaling 15 yuan. The total monthly food expense is approximately 10,000 yuan. Other daily necessities, books, stationery, salaries, miscellaneous items, repairs, water, and electricity total approximately 20,000 yuan. Therefore, current monthly expenses are over 70,000 yuan, and the cost of clothing and bedding for the orphans has not yet been included! (Editor's note: In recent months, the cost of living has doubled, and expenses far exceed this amount).

What is praiseworthy about the Shanghai Orphanage is that it does not have a large, fixed income. This New Year, it requested assistance from the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association. Committee member Rong Boyun went to investigate and suggested that efforts should be made to save costs, advising the reduction of cooks and assigning older children to rotate to save approximately 1,000 yuan per month. At the same time, he believed that the orphanage was well managed and faced financial difficulties and should be subsidized. The association decided to provide assistance, but the orphanage still faced difficulties due to rising prices and increasing expenses. It is said that ordinary donations are only slightly over 2,000 yuan per month from adoption donations and 6,000 to 7,000 yuan from orchestra performance donations. The remaining shortfall is covered by donations from enthusiastic members of society and fundraising by the director. Therefore, the orphanage is often in financial straits. Director Lu repeatedly expressed his hope that people from all walks of life would visit and provide guidance for improvement.

As we left the Shanghai Orphanage with a heart full of blessings for the 250 orphans, we caught sight of the "creed" of the orphanage, which seemed worth introducing here: Look at the suffering of the orphans and think about your own life. Those who care for the orphans in this orphanage are the saviors of the orphans. The effect of generosity is to reserve true talent for the country. Sincere relief of the orphanage is better than burning incense and eating vegetarian food. Mutual assistance and love can bring about a world of great harmony. The completion of charitable undertakings is based on all of humanity. (End)

### Military Propaganda Mission to Burma of Great Significance Press Counselor Matsudaira Delivers Remarks

Press Counselor Matsudaira of the Japanese Embassy spoke to our country's reporters on the 6th regarding the National Government's dispatch of a military propaganda mission to the India-Burma front. He expressed great respect for the mission, stating:

Safely Arrived at the Front

This National Government military propaganda mission to the India-Burma front, with the close cooperation of the Japanese army, the Burmese government, and the Free India Provisional Government, is actively promoting various policies. According to the National Government's Propaganda Department, the mission arrived safely at its destination in mid-February. This move has attracted significant attention from all sides. The Indian independence movement has long been a concern of the Chinese people, who have expressed sympathy. After last fall's Greater East Asia War, Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Free India Provisional Government, visited China. The National Government authorities have a deeper understanding of and sympathy for India's independence movement and decided to send a military propaganda mission to Burma.

Chongqing's Policy

Now, they are still sending troops to India to maintain the British's intended status quo in India and cooperating with the British to make Burma a colony again. This move has caused great disappointment among those pursuing Indian independence. However, the National Government is sending a military propaganda mission to Burma, cooperating with the Indian national independence movement, and maintaining Burma's independence. This move has greatly inspired the officials and people of Burma and those pursuing Indian independence.

Deeply Anticipate

Before the mission departed, I was invited to give a speech to the members during their training in Nanjing and had the opportunity to talk with them. The members are all intellectuals with experience and courage and have vowed to dedicate themselves with the spirit of "sharing life and death" on the front lines of the Greater East Asia War. The spirit of these members moved me deeply. Now that I know that the mission has safely arrived at the India-Burma front to cooperate in the Greater East Asia liberation war, I would like to express my deep respect to the members of the mission here and look forward to the progress of their work.

### Obituary

Our late father, Zeng Gongye (surnamed Zeng, given name Jun, courtesy name Zhigong), passed away at noon on February 8th of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, at the age of seventy-six. He was born at the hour of Hai on March 30th of the Tongzhi 8th year of the Qing Dynasty. The unfilial children and grandchildren have personally witnessed his passing, observed the rituals of mourning, and will be holding a memorial service at the Zhuangyan Temple at the intersection of Pubei Road and Beile Road on March 13th of the Western calendar. We hereby announce this news.

Please obtain the biography of the late father from the Tongde Hospital on Tongfu Road or the Shen Bao office on Third Horse Road.

### Biography of Mr. Zeng Gongye, Established Name Mingqun

Mr. Zeng Gongye served as the Director of the Auditing Department of this newspaper, with over twenty years of service, dedicated to his duties. He was sociable and harmonious with his colleagues. Unfortunately, he passed away on February 8th of this year at the age of seventy-six. All of us mourn his loss. Now, his son has written a biography, which we have excerpted to express our condolences. Editor's note:

Mr. Zeng (surnamed Zeng, given name Jun, courtesy name Zigong, also known as Gongye), his late grandfather had two sons, Shengxian and Bo, etc. Mr. Zeng was the younger son, born intelligent and blessed by nature. In the Gengzi year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, he traveled to the Yixiang Academy. Since the Jiawu year, Mr. Zeng felt that insufficient real learning could not be relied upon. He resolutely abandoned his studies to learn from Westerners, diligently studying mathematics, working tirelessly day and night. In a few years, he mastered the mysteries of arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus. He also used diagrams to explain the principles of abacus and turned them into a book. In the Xinchou year, Wu Gong Huaijiu established the Wuben Women's School in Shanghai South. He consulted with Mr. Zeng. At that time, the social atmosphere was not open, and there were many obstacles. Mr. Zeng overcame public opinion, and the school was finally established, opening up a new era of women's education in our country. The Sericulture Girls' School, China Public School, Longmen Normal School, and other schools also competed to hire Mr. Zeng as a professor. In his spare time, he also worked as an editor for the China Bookstore Company, using it as a means of education. After the establishment of the Republic of China, he served as the Principal of the Jiangsu Provincial Second Women's Normal School, then served as the Principal of the Shanghai County Wuben Women's Middle School, while concurrently holding a teaching position at the Provincial Second Normal School, and the Wuben Women's School was the longest. Mr. Zeng believed that women's education was the mother of national education, and he devoted himself to women's education, which was why he cultivated the foundation of the country. He was willing to work hard and was always happy even when he was in adverse circumstances. Mr. Zeng was skilled in calligraphy, following the style of Yushi Men, especially proficient in Zhongding inscriptions, and skilled in seal carving. He liked to paint bamboo, loving its elegance. During his spare time, he wielded his brush freely, fulfilling the requests of those who sought his work. When there was a need to raise money for disaster relief or education, he never refused, even in the cold of winter or the heat of summer. In his later years, Mr. Shi Gong Zicai hired him to serve as the Director of the Auditing Department of Shen Bao, where he was loyal and dedicated, working through wind and rain without interruption for more than twenty years. On the afternoon of February of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, he retired from his post. As he was leaving the office, he chatted happily with his colleagues as usual. When he arrived home, he still greeted his neighbors. When he entered the room, he was eating snacks and talking about peanuts, when suddenly, an unprecedented pain struck his heart. He cried out in pain three times, and his breathing gradually shortened. When the coffee was brought to him, he could no longer drink it himself. Soon after, his eyes closed, and he passed away. Mr. Zeng was physically strong and full of spirit, and he always lived a healthy life, rarely experiencing illness. He was also a devout Buddhist, getting up early every morning and attending classes with respect and sincerity. Could this be why he was invited to be with Buddha and be reborn in the Pure Land!

Economic Commentary

### What Should Not Exist in a Year of Increased Production

Since this year is designated as a "Year of Increased Production," and this designation comes from the highest government authority, then "what is spoken" should be "acted upon" so that it does not contradict the spirit of wartime governance and does not betray the expectations of the people during wartime. If pronouncements cannot be followed by action, and if the manifestations of various facts are in constant contradiction with the government's decrees, the consequences would be truly unimaginable.

In order to increase production, the government must eliminate anything that obstructs the path to increased production. The greatest obstacle to increased production is the rampant spread of production funds without being concentrated. "Therefore, before the Lunar New Year, the financial authorities first instructed the banking community in the city to be cautious in lending." The intention was to prevent hoarding and speculation after the Lunar New Year. However, since the Lunar New Year, not only has hoarding and speculation not been prevented, but even some unscrupulous members of the banking community have themselves participated in hoarding, euphemistically calling it tightened lending. In reality, there is still a so-called black market for loans, resulting in a situation of extreme scarcity of goods and soaring prices. This has even led everyone to abandon the fundamentals and chase after the non-essentials, selling off the industrial securities representing general companies and firms to fund hoarding, ultimately leading to the peculiar phenomenon of a slump in wartime industrial securities, a phenomenon unique to China and not found in other countries during wartime. This phenomenon should not exist in a year of increased production because the prosperity of the Chinese stock market is an important condition for the development of national industry, and probably no one can deny this.

Since we are against stock speculation, we naturally cannot sympathize with the frenzy of the stock market – the frenzied rise or frenzied fall – because both the rise and the fall are artificial and stem from the abuse of speculative behavior, which has a profound and far-reaching impact on the entire wartime finance. In view of yesterday's reports that the authorities will thoroughly investigate those involved in stock speculation and short selling, we are specifically expressing this opinion.

### Economic Department of the First District Actively Investigates Hoarding, Hopes for Citizen Cooperation in Reporting

The Economic Department of the First District Public Office of this city strictly manages the prices of various industries and sends personnel to conduct thorough investigations into hoarding and exceeding the price limits. It also investigates the inventory of various industries and firms, assigning the various sections to carry out the work. Because the original 130 investigators were insufficient to assign, additional personnel were added and trained before participating in the investigation work. On the one hand, they hope that citizens will cooperate and report all kinds of unscrupulous merchants such as hoarders in writing to the department (1st Floor, No. 29 Jiangxi Road), which will be accepted. Investigations will be conducted according to the address, and once verified, severe punishment will be imposed. Recently, several illegal commercial firms have been verified with the case and are being punished separately. The department will formally announce it within days to serve as a warning and to ensure the people's livelihood.

Concrete Measures to Suppress Prices

According to the relevant authorities, concrete measures to suppress prices have been drafted. The main points are as follows: In order to effectively implement price limits, closer contact will be established with the police authorities. Those who privately raise prices or hoard goods for speculation, if there is conclusive evidence, will be prosecuted in accordance with the regulations for punishing hoarding and the special wartime criminal law. Even those who are slightly suspected will be strictly investigated by the relevant authorities. The price management mechanism will be strengthened as much as possible, and unified steps will be taken with the relevant agencies. The main and secondary commodities are being urgently priced so that everything has its official price. The trade associations are responsible for supervising their members. If a member's illegal behavior is verified, the association must also bear corresponding responsibility. The authorities added that they would encounter a fatal blow.

### Cotton Merchants Collecting Cotton Must Register with the Cotton Control Commission

The authorities are currently actively purchasing cotton from the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. In order to prevent fraud in the collection and washing of cotton, the Cotton Control Committee has specifically stipulated that cotton merchants who wish to participate in cotton collection in the three provinces and two cities should submit a list prepared by the trade association to the Cotton Industry Federation for forwarding to the Cotton Control Committee for registration. Those who have not been registered and permitted are not allowed to purchase cotton. If a cotton merchant purchases cotton privately, they will be severely punished once discovered. When registered cotton merchants collect cotton, the quality inspection should be carried out in accordance with the inspection and acceptance regulations of the Cotton Control Committee. At the same time, cotton merchants should report the quantity of cotton purchased to the trade association on a ten-day basis, which should be reported to the federation for verification and forwarding to the Cotton Control Committee.

Storm (3)

Speaking of the dinner party, even a letter came from the family of a woman who had just given birth, urging him to come and have a chat. But Shinjiro was never really keen on going. He hadn't forgotten the discomfort he felt when he was invited to lunch on the day of the Emperor Jimmu Festival in his second year of junior high school. And the existence of that young girl, Shizuko, made him particularly uncomfortable.

Shizuko, whom he had never thought of once while at Etajima, floated back into Shinjiro's mind as he saw the deep blue summer sky of Kagoshima again.

(She certainly is a strange girl.)

When he visited Takao for the first time since returning home, it so happened that she and her brother, Takao, were both in the study. At that time, she stood up in a huff and went to the cloakroom. Her expression at that time, that nonchalant attitude, was like a theatrical mask made of perpetual ice, an indescribable affectation that set her apart from others. Even her brother, Takao, was left speechless.

She had once scolded him with harsh sarcasm, calling him a "coward!" or saying that "he was the only one who had made something of himself!" This time, however, she was silent, as calm as a Nara Buddha statue. It was really impossible to tell what she was thinking!

For some reason, Shinjiro felt uncomfortable around Shizuko. So when Shinjiro attended the alumni dinner, he didn't invite Takao.

In the evening, as he rode the bus to Taden, the scenery was still beautiful. From there to the Tatsubei Villa, they called it the coastal area. Along that road, there were small restaurants with excellent views. It had long been the custom to bring one's own beef and cook it in a pot at these small restaurants. When he arrived at the second floor of the small restaurant, almost all of the alumni were there, including Banda, Taniguchi, and Hitoshi.

"Oh..."

"Yo..."

The friends were all as usual, except for Shinjiro, Kumazawa, and Komori, who were not only wearing dress uniforms but also behaving differently from the others. Shinjiro was smiling with pursed lips and puffed cheeks.

After finishing the skewers of mochi, the old woman brought out the white furnace. After finishing the large pot of mochi, they still had to finish the mountain of beef. Although they weren't drinking alcohol, they were all talking like they were drunk, discussing their alma mater, the naval academy, and the army.

"Tomorrow is the day for the naval volunteer physical exams. Those taking the exam should eat more beef to build up their strength!" Someone said, and everyone burst out laughing. Takao, however, was very serious as he reached into the pot with his chopsticks.

(4)

That day, Shinjiro didn't have time to visit Takao during the day because he was delivering rice. He thought about going to encourage him during the physical exam, but there was no way to do so.

However, he was worried about the results. Fortunately, Takao safely passed the first day of the exam, which was considered problematic. In fact, the accounting school was different from the military academy, and mild nearsightedness was acceptable for admission. If he could pass this hurdle, then the second day's exam, which involved internal organs and other tests, could be predicted to be no problem. And last night, Takao's joy was as if he had ascended to heaven and was already enrolled in the accounting school. In fact, Takao's academic performance was better than Shinjiro's, so there was reason for him to be confident in the academic exam.

Because of this, although Shinjiro was thinking about it in his heart, he had no intention of going to the lecture hall of his alma mater, which was the examination venue.

"Please come to my house when you come back." Takao had said so himself!

It was a hot day. Although there was a light breeze blowing from the sea, the heat of Kagoshima was particularly intense.

Shinjiro was wearing only a singlet at the well, wiping his sweat, when Noriko called him.

"Shinjiro, a friend is looking for you!"

Wearing the summer uniform of their junior high school, Higashiyama and seven or eight other military group friends were standing in a row in front of the store entrance, looking a hundred times more courageous.

"Oh, congratulations!"

Shinjiro's face was beaming with joy from the bottom of his heart. "Gu-kun! There is an academic exam in December. You are confident in your physical exam and everything."

These little heroes laughed loudly, and Shinjiro suddenly realized that Takao was not among them.

"What's wrong with Murota?"

Hearing Shinjiro's question, they immediately stopped laughing.

"It's a real shame for him. I heard it's his respiratory system. Not good!"

Shinjiro's heart sank as if cold water had been poured over him. And although he felt sorry for his friends, he didn't invite them into the house. He just sent them away, quickly jumped on his bicycle,

And went to Takao's house without going in the main gate as before. He shouted loudly,

"Takao!"

As usual, there should have been an answer, but there was no response. When he shouted again, Shizuko's face appeared in the window of the study.

"My brother won't see anyone!"

National Forum

### Several Opinions on Improving the Distribution Mechanism

— Zhenqiang

The implementation of the rationing system in our country was originally prompted by the soaring prices after the war. However, although the time that has passed is short, many problems have already arisen. The suffering that the people have suffered due to rationing is by no means what was originally expected. The author believes that in order to improve people's livelihoods and stabilize prices, it is necessary to start with universal rationing. However, if the rationing mechanism is not sound, then there will be no rationality in rationing. Therefore, I would like to put forward several opinions on thoroughly improving the rationing mechanism:

First, adjust the rationing mechanism and strengthen the power of rationing. As the saying goes: If a workman wants to do a good job, he must first sharpen his tools. In the past, the rationing organs were too duplicated in quantity. Take the area of Shanghai alone. There are no less than four or five organs responsible for rice and grain rationing alone, passing the buck to each other, and ultimately causing a mess, with the general public directly suffering. Therefore, the author believes that in order to adjust the rationing mechanism, we must first unify the rationing organization, absolutely avoid duplication, and then the power can be concentrated, the operation can be flexible, and the work can be dedicated, and rationing can be expected to improve. However, the personnel issues in the rationing mechanism must not be ignored. China has always had only rule by men and not rule by law, so that all laws are equivalent to mere formalities. Therefore, in order to seek the perfection of the rationing machine, the staff in the mechanism must have a spirit of abiding by and respecting the law. In order to make the staff abide by and respect the law, the minimum condition must be to ensure that the staff's lives are protected, and then punish the lawbreakers severely, so that they dare not be illegal. Only then is there a possibility of rationing being reasonable.

Second, the expenses of the rationing mechanism must be allocated from the national government's expenditure budget. The current trade control associations, cotton control associations, rice control associations, and other control and rationing mechanisms are all similar to people's self-government mechanisms. Although the initial expenses were borrowed from the Central Reserve Bank by order of the national government, there are no clear regulations on how much each control and allocation mechanism actually needs for expenses and how much is needed for procurement capital. The control association itself has neither production nor a fixed source of funding, and the necessary daily expenses are unavoidable. It is inevitable that a little profit will be added in the process of procurement and distribution, which will leave an opportunity for employees to engage in illicit practices, making it impossible for the upper levels to control the lower levels. If this is the case, even if there is a sound rationing mechanism, it will be all in vain. Therefore, the author believes that the expenses of the rationing mechanism must be paid by the national government. Because the control and rationing mechanism is the cornerstone of the government's policy of stabilizing people's livelihoods, the national government should pay the regular expenses so that the rationing and control mechanism does not fall into a state.

Third, the control and allocation mechanism must periodically announce the quantity purchased and the quantity allocated. While implementing the above two points is essential for addressing the root cause, it is also essential for addressing the symptoms. Because the accumulated abuses in various agencies in China are already deep, and in a huge organization, there will inevitably be one or two corrupt elements. If we do not think about fundamentally preventing fraud in advance, then punishing them afterward will be too late.

Fourth, the government appoints commissioners to supervise. Although the working conditions of the control and rationing mechanism are announced to the public periodically, if there is no responsible supervisor, then in the event of false reports by the staff in the control and rationing mechanism, the public has no right to inspect the entry and exit books. How can they know whether the public announcement is accurate? Therefore, there must be fair supervisors to supervise from the sidelines so that the so-called public announcement does not become a deceptive document. As for the supervisors, the government may temporarily use the current supervisory members of the Supervisory Yuan. On the one hand, it can save the national government's expenses and avoid creating new titles.

Fifth, the ration amount must be based on the actual minimum consumption amount per person. In the past, the ration amount implemented by each rationing mechanism could not meet the actual consumption amount of the people, especially daily necessities such as rice and grain, and the amount of shortage was too large, forcing the people to buy from the black market. Therefore, the amount of rations should be determined according to the minimum consumption of the people in order to completely eliminate the black market and achieve the goal of stabilizing people's livelihoods and suppressing prices.

### Responding to the Punctuality Movement

The Chinese people were originally a nation that kept time. The so-called "cherish every inch of time, love every inch of light" is "a beautiful story in history books." Since the material civilization of the West was introduced into our country and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, the concept of time has disappeared invisibly, which is very regrettable. In order to actively promote time saving, Jie Yue specially awakened the people and completed the wartime system, initiated the punctuality movement, and noted that modern social interactions are frequent. In terms of gatherings and banquets, time should be strictly observed so that useful time is used for the total decisive battle, and not wasted. (Jing Yuan)

### A Poor State of Affairs After the Death of a Civilian School Employee

Mr. Tong Dingming, whose courtesy name was Xinpan, was an employee of the Minli Women's Middle and Primary School. He had served in education for more than 20 years. Since 1940, he had been the accountant of the school. Unfortunately, he became ill from overwork and died in February of this year. He lived a life of hardship and hard work. After his death, there was nothing to bury him with. The school temporarily paid for the coffin and other expenses, totaling more than 20,000 yuan, but there was no way to replenish it. Mr. Tong's surviving family includes his wife and five children. The family's livelihood and the children's education expenses are all without a source. Mr. Tong died for education. How can we stand by and watch his descendants starve and fill the ditches? Therefore, the teachers and students of the school have jointly organized a donation committee to comfort Mr. Tong's surviving family. In addition to the teachers and students of the school making their own donations, we respectfully appeal to people from all walks of life and kind people to show mutual aid and generously donate to collect money so that his descendants can barely survive. The committee of all teachers and students of Minli Women's Middle and Primary School is raising funds for the education and welfare of the descendants of Mr. Tong Xinpan.

Recent News from the Xihu Museum in Xizhou

The Hangzhou Xihu Museum is one of the leading museums in our country. Although it has inevitably suffered some losses since the Incident, it has generally restored its former appearance. Since the Ministry of Education of Zhejiang Province appointed Lu Zhonghuai as the curator of the museum last autumn, he has spared no effort in reorganizing and managing it. The internal displays have not only mostly restored their former appearance, but also the displays of new objects in the natural and humanistic museums have increased daily. Among them, there are two male and female mummies (commonly known as zombies), which are particularly outstanding, and the insect specimens in the natural science museum are especially rich.

Scholarship: The Shangqing Middle and Primary School has a Chongxian Hall, which donates funds to help 50 students of the Shangqing Middle and Primary School with half of their tuition fees in order to take care of poor children who are unable to study. Those who are truly poor and have aspirations for education can apply to the school at No. 66 Qingdao Road.

Lectures: The Chinese Confucius Society, No. 954 Dashanghai Road, today (Tuesday) from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM, has invited Mr. Wu Jiming to lecture on "Mencius" and Mr. Yang Zhongyi to lecture on "The Great Learning." All are welcome to attend.

Acknowledgment: Li Wenbiao of the Municipal Cake, Steamed Bun, and Fried Dough Twist Trade Association donated 1,000 yuan to the Old Age Home, and Peng Geng donated 100 yuan to the Young and Young Care Home. We have forwarded it on behalf of them. Liu Kaike donated 150 yuan to the Buddhist porridge factory. We hereby express our gratitude.
