### Weekly Review: A Plea for the Grain Issue - To the Chinese and Japanese Authorities - Chen Binhe

Yesterday, the "Continental New Daily" published an editorial entitled "The Deepening Grain Problem." It evoked many feelings afterward. The main points of the article were, first, to emphasize the seriousness of the grain problem, stating that other issues could be temporarily put on hold while all efforts should be focused on adjusting the grain issue. Second, it stated that speculative elements and farmers turned entrepreneurs should be eliminated using political power. These opinions are accurate in principle. However, further explanation is necessary. Since the government announced the "Temporary Measures Outline for Rice for Civilian Consumption in Beijing and Shanghai," until yesterday's municipal government announcement of free rice transportation, the jump in black market rice prices in this city during this short period was simply insane. The reasons for this are, of course, complex, but the use of price manipulation by speculative elements is a major cause. Fortunately, the municipal authorities made a decision and issued an announcement of free rice transportation, and yesterday the rice price actually fell sharply. However, the municipal government's announcement of free rice transportation is only a temporary measure pending the announcement of import management regulations, a measure of expediency. What will happen in the future, we will not speculate for now. We believe that whether it is the Ministry of Food or the Rice Control Committee, the only prerequisite is to do a good job. However, past facts have already told us that we have failed. However, why can't it be done well? It can be said with certainty that the focus is still on the unsoundness of personnel. Therefore, in the past, we did not advocate institutional adjustment as the first priority, but consistently advocated personnel soundness as the first priority. For example, the work of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee has been well received by both Chinese and Japanese personnel because the Chinese and Japanese responsible authorities and staff of the committee are willing to work hard, and naturally have credibility with the outside world. Similarly, the work of the Cotton Industry Control Committee, although without special achievements, has not been done badly, selecting people based on expertise and avoiding the appointment of personal connections. Admittedly, the scope and affairs of the Flour and Wheat and Cotton industries are simpler than those of the Rice Control Committee, making them objectively easier to handle. However, because grain is important, the objective requirement for personnel soundness in the Rice Control Committee is even more urgent. Unfortunately, the authorities of the Rice Control Committee have neglected their responsibilities, and the government authorities have also ignored and condoned this. Since the establishment of the committee, although cases of dereliction of duty by employees have been discovered, they have been tolerated and not punished, which is insufficient to gain the trust of the people, especially ashamed of the Ministry of Food's handling of corruption cases.

After the establishment of the Municipal Advisory Committee, it first focused on people's livelihood issues, and therefore organized a small committee on necessities of life to specialize in research, first making recommendations on the grain issue. However, it received two malicious reactions: It was said that the Advisory Committee intended to replace the Rice Control Committee. In reality, none of the members of the Advisory Committee were specialists in grain administration. At the same time, I personally advocate for the specialization of experts in handling affairs, especially the important grain administration. For example, Mr. Sun Zhongli has extensive connections in the flour industry; Mr. Wen Lanting has extensive connections in the cotton industry. The important cadres of these two committees should be selected as experts as much as possible. Honestly, while there are no grain administration experts in the Advisory Committee, even if one were to take a step back, those who are enthusiastic and have qualifications in grain administration, such as Mr. Li Sihao and Mr. Feng Bingnan, even if the government intended to extend an invitation to them, they would not be willing to take office. Therefore, saying that the Advisory Committee is replacing the Rice Control Committee is purely malicious rumor-mongering. It was said that after the government promulgated the "Temporary Measures Outline for Rice for Civilian Consumption" this time, the price of rice actually rose, perhaps prompted by the recommendations of the Advisory Committee. However, in reality, it is not difficult to verify which points the government adopted from the Advisory Committee's recommendations. Moreover, I can assert that the recommendations of the Advisory Committee are definitely not the personal opinions of the advisory committee members, but are based on the demands of the people's opinions.

In short, the importance of the grain issue to all aspects has long been discussed and recognized by all levels. We firmly believe that the Chinese and Japanese authorities can see it even more clearly. Here, we request that the central authorities must thoroughly and reasonably resolve the issue, and not solve it piecemeal, which would only increase its seriousness. Based on past experience, implementing control, every additional procedure is an additional opportunity for extortion. For example, why can't extortion along the way be completely eliminated, and why can't speculative merchants and farmers turned entrepreneurs be eliminated? If political power is used to eliminate them, it is certainly necessary. However, it is necessary to first use political power to make the personnel of the grain control mechanism sound, and to impose wartime extreme penalties on merchants who hoard rice and speculate, and then to eliminate extortion along the way, strengthen transportation convenience, reduce the suffering of farmers, and assist farmers in production. Only with the use of political power will everything be effective. This is the most obvious mission for the current use of political power.

At the same time, we hope that the Allied authorities will pay attention to the distant and the important, and assist the central government in fully resolving the issue of civilian food. They must listen to the voices of the broad masses of the Chinese people. Anything that suits China's national conditions and the feelings of the people will definitely work. For example, to assist Chinese farmers in production, more experts should be sent to the countryside to import modern agricultural technology; they should also work together to establish rural security. Special attention should be paid to the fact that those who are directly related to the Chinese people are often blinded by unscrupulous people, who create rumors and slanders, and increase misunderstandings among the people.

### The Japanese Wing Political Society Convened Yesterday - The Third Extraordinary General Meeting - Passed the Resolution on the People's Advance to the Front Line

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - In order to reorganize the organization, adapt to the situation, and launch support activities, the Japanese Wing Political Society held its third extraordinary general meeting at its headquarters here at 2 p.m. on the afternoon of the 3rd. More than 400 people attended, including President Abe, advisors, general affairs staff, and members. Government officials including Minister Ando attended. First, the heads of each department reported on the National General Uprising Movement and other items. Then, President Abe delivered a speech. Afterward, a resolution was passed and the meeting adjourned at around 3 p.m. The resolution is recorded below: At a time when the war situation is becoming increasingly tense, and also at a crucial moment for the rise and fall of the Empire, we hope that the people of the entire country will seize the opportunity as soon as possible and immediately step forward to the front line of the people's general advance, in order to destroy England and the United States as soon as possible, and to live up to the Emperor's hopes.

President Abe's Speech. President Abe's speech can be summarized as follows: Last year was a major period of change in world history. The most important event was the holding of the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo. Japan, based on a moral worldview, drove out the British and American forces from the South Seas, Borneo, and the Philippines. The cooperation between the nations and countries of Greater East Asia is a manifestation of confirming and completing the meaning of the Greater East Asia War. Based on the five major principles of coexistence and co-prosperity, independence and friendship, promotion of culture, economic prosperity, and world advancement, to build Greater East Asia and contribute to world peace, this is what the Greater East Asia Declaration declares to both domestic and foreign audiences. This, no matter what, is a painful blow to them, and it will leave a glory in human history that has never been seen before. Based on this declaration, the true independence and allied cooperation of the countries of Greater East Asia will have more significant achievements. On the other hand, the countries that oppose the Axis powers only care about anxious short-term decisive battles, such as the Cairo Conference or the Tehran Conference, and exaggerate their words in order to urgently seek to open the war situation. However, in terms of actual achievements, nothing has been achieved. The contradictory situation is often self-evident from this example. Due to the difference in moral views and the difference in concerns about interests, each harboring ambition, their attempts will inevitably lead to failure. World war has been going on for five years and has been continuing in an unprecedented war of attrition. Countries are pouring their material and combat power into this stage. Even the United States, which has boasted of its resources, has reached the peak of its productivity. Therefore, the anxiety of England and the United States is becoming more and more profound. Therefore, no matter what policies they implement to provoke a short-term decisive battle, the war situation itself will eventually fall into an inactive state. On the other hand, the recent increase in our productivity is clear evidence. In particular, the people of Greater East Asia can cooperate in destroying the construction operations of England and the United States without fear of difficulties, so endless resources can be developed step by step. Therefore, we must be confident that the final victory will be achieved, and that the total strength of 100 million people will be used in production, so as to destroy the enemy in one fell swoop. The enemy calls for the final victory due to a partial change in the war situation, which is a clear proof that the enemy has lost confidence in its own military power. Of course, the progress of the war will inevitably affect the lives of the people, but this is a common phenomenon for both the enemy and ourselves. At this time, the key to determining victory or defeat lies first in seeing which side's war will is stronger. We must keep in mind that whether or not a single person makes an effort is enough to affect the fate of the country's rise and fall. If all our people can be united as one, then I dare to believe that we will definitely achieve the goal of destroying the enemy.

### Greater East Asia Ethnic Groups Council Secretariat

The Asia General Headquarters of the Japanese Support Association has established the Greater East Asia Ethnic Groups Council Secretariat in Tokyo to maintain constant contact with these overseas residents and exchange opinions with them in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. It is said that preparations are currently underway, and it is expected that the bureau will make immense contributions to the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in the future.

### Japanese Painter's Masterpiece - Gifted to the Japanese-German Academy

Naval Admiral Prince Fushimi of the Imperial Family visited the academy yesterday afternoon and presented the gift on behalf of the court.

### Lieutenant General Katagiri Died in Battle - Specially Awarded Merit and Decorations

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Lieutenant General Katagiri Shigeru, commander of the Japanese Army's First Line Corps in New Guinea, had been commanding the front line since March of last year. He inflicted heavy damage on the American and Australian forces at Finschhafen, and then fought in the Mamu area, overcoming all difficulties. He finally died heroically on April 28. This time, he was given a reward by His Majesty the Emperor. The Army Ministry and the Decorations Bureau announced the following: Lieutenant General Katagiri Shigeru is awarded the Second Class Merit, awarded the Golden Kite Medal, promoted to First Class, and awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, Grand Cordon.

### A Japanese Military Unit Commander - Explains the Special Nature of the Henan Campaign - Thoroughly Crushing the Chongqing Forces' Combat Strength

Luoyang, 3rd (Central News Agency) - A certain unit commander of the North China Expeditionary Army of the Japanese Army arrived here the other day to inspect the people's livelihood in the area after the Japanese Army occupied Luoyang. He explained the special nature of the Henan campaign and the measures to stabilize the people's livelihood in the occupied areas as follows: The special nature of this campaign is not in the occupation of locations and areas, but in thoroughly crushing the combat strength of the Chongqing First War Zone and saving the people of Henan who have been oppressed by Chongqing for a long time. Therefore, when the Japanese army advanced on and captured Luoyang, it had to devote all its efforts to eliminate the Chongqing army stationed in the northern highlands of Luoyang, and at the same time, it had to make its greatest efforts to protect the streets of Luoyang and keep them away from the flames of war. Therefore, the security situation in the currently occupied area is quite good, and the residents of Luoyang, in particular, trust the Japanese army and are returning to their villages one after another. I believe that the authorities must pay attention to the stability of the people's livelihood in the future, and must guide the people of Luoyang to defend their homeland by themselves, so as to give full play to their high degree of autonomy and self-defense spirit. According to local farmers, this year's wheat harvest is abundant, and the amount harvested this time can actually feed them for three years. Therefore, if the water conservancy of the Yellow River can be used to free the area from water disasters, then its contribution to the stability of the people's livelihood will be by no means small. According to residents of Luoyang, they are very willing to restore traffic on the Longhai Railway and are willing to contribute all their labor. In addition, in the Luoyang area, the Luo River can be used, but we must not ignore the strengthening of land transport. Moreover, there are also wheat, cotton, coal, tung oil, and mercury resources produced here. Therefore, in terms of trade with North China and Central China, close consideration should be given to the enrichment of transportation agencies. The people under the rule of Chongqing are most painfully affected by heavy taxes and compulsory conscription, but the Japanese army has now sought appropriate measures in the newly occupied areas to clear up the above-mentioned evils of heavy taxes and compulsory conscription, so that the residents of various places can live in peace in their respective industries, and so on.

American Planes Attacked Zhengzhou, Four Shot Down

Luoyang, 3rd (Central News Agency) - At around 9 a.m. on the 2nd, eleven Chongqing (P240) type American fighter planes attacked the vicinity of Zhengzhou and carried out machine gun strafing. Afterward, they attempted to attack the Yellow River Railway Bridge. When they flew over the crossing point, the Japanese army immediately shot them down with fierce artillery fire. Japanese aircraft also mobilized to counterattack. As a result, four enemy planes were shot down, and the rest fled in panic. The Japanese army suffered very little damage. Several local Chinese laborers were killed and injured. This kind of blind bombing by the enemy planes only increases the resentment of the people.

American Missionary Describes the Air Raid Situation

Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing Associated Press report, thirteen British and American missionaries arrived in Chongqing on May 13 after enduring hardships during the Henan campaign. At that time, we were already taking a train to Xi'an. The train was moving very slowly, but Japanese planes were bombing day and night. The train we were on had to stop in a dark tunnel for two days. The coal smoke and the smell of breath in the car almost suffocated us. After two days and three nights, we arrived in Xi'an. After living there for two weeks, the fear and fatigue we felt had made us feel hopeless. After arriving in Chongqing, we learned that prices were so high. We thought that there was no way out except to return to our country. Japanese Planes Night Raids on Hengyang and Lingling

Hankou, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Air Force attacked Hengyang and Lingling Chongqing airfields in the deep of night of the 2nd, bombing the runway and auxiliary facilities of Lingling, and destroying a military facility in its parking area. A bomb hit and caused a huge explosion and fire.

Japanese Army Encirclements and Attacks the Chongqing Army at Yasaka

Luoyang, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army's left-wing pursuit teams, after destroying the enemy stronghold of Tancun on the 15th, advanced along the Xiyang Highway. When they reached the vicinity of Yasaka, they discovered 3,000 enemy troops with mortars and immediately took an encirclement and attack posture, achieving a great victory since the start of this campaign. The various units of the Japanese army received a report from scouts that there was an enemy in front of them, and secretly surrounded them from the left and right. At 1 p.m., when the Japanese army was only 300 meters away from the enemy's position on the hills, the enemy discovered that they had been surrounded and fired fiercely with Czech machine guns. The enemy was the 27th Division and the 35th Division of the 38th Army, led by Regiment Commander Zhang Huiming. The embarrassing situation of the Chongqing army fleeing from Shan County to Fushi and Xin'an after being pursued by the Japanese army was still vivid in their minds. After learning the truth, the Japanese army began to attack. While compressing the encirclement from the left and right, they captured 593 enemy troops, including Battalion Commander Chen Jiamou, after only four hours of fierce fighting. The results of this battle are as follows: More than 1,300 enemy bodies were abandoned, 593 prisoners were captured, 4 mortars, 11 heavy machine guns, 63 Czech machine guns, 520 rifles, 35 pistols, 7 telephones, and many other weapons and ammunition were seized.

Translated Review

### The Deepening Grain Problem

Although the "Temporary Measures Outline for Rice for Civilian Consumption" in Nanjing and Shanghai and the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Rice for Civilian Consumption in Shanghai" have been promulgated, the grain problem is becoming increasingly serious, and the situation has become unavoidable. The Municipal Advisory Committee, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and five other powerful groups have also submitted proposals, and public opinion has been discussing them for days. It is no exaggeration to say that in peacetime areas, social concern is concentrated on the food problem. Regarding the application of the "Temporary Measures Outline for Rice for Civilian Consumption," there are various opinions and suggestions, such as the need to clearly indicate the guidelines for the procurement price, that the transportation of rice within one stone should be free, that the drawbacks arising from the issuance of passports should be eliminated in order to achieve fairness and speed, and that all exorbitant taxes should be abolished. These are all based on practical considerations and can be adopted or used as references by the authorities. The suggestions of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other five groups also belong to the opinions of the people and should be listened to. But the most important point is whether the authorities have the determination to solve the grain problem according to the previously announced guidelines, and whether they have taken practical measures to implement this determination. If the authorities' guidelines are based only on the general requirement that certain measures must be taken, and they are announced without preparation, then speculators and farmers will certainly despise this decision and arbitrarily monopolize the market. Today is a time when clumsy action is better than slow action, and when even if the best plan cannot be expected, the second-best plan should be thoroughly implemented. If there is a lack of concrete preparation to implement the basic guidelines after they are announced, the temporary psychological benefits will soon disappear. At the same time, it must be understood that the grain problem cannot be solved by entrusting the determination of prices to the possible natural trends, even on the grounds of grain movement. It is undoubtedly true that the rise in prices promotes grain concentration and can self-regulate, but relying on this alone is already unknowable in peacetime, and it is impossible in the current environment. Not to mention speculative hoarders, most farmers who are producers also have an entrepreneurial mentality. In such a situation, it is natural for them to hope that rice prices will rise higher and higher. Although they slowly dispose of the rice they have in hand within the range of preventing market prices from weakening due to increased supply, they will not be tempted to quickly sell it off due to the freedom of movement and today's high prices. If such a situation is allowed to continue, the meaning is to entrust the grain market to speculative merchants and farmers who have already become entrepreneurs. In order to prevent this from happening, I think it is necessary to effectively use administrative power, but do the authorities have sufficient countermeasures? In short, the food problem has a seriousness that cannot be delayed for a day. The authorities should express their enthusiasm and practicality for solving this problem even if they have to handle everything else, and use their power to solve it.

### Japan's Policy Toward China Remains Unchanged - Determined to Provide All Possible Assistance - Ambassador Tani Returns to Nanjing and Speaks to the Press Corps

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to China Tani returned to Nanjing on June 1 after returning to Japan for important public instructions. At 5 p.m. on the 2nd, he met with the press corps at his official residence and made statements on various issues as follows: This time, I returned to the country at the end of last month to report on current issues and to seek instructions. The Guofang is launching a large-scale campaign in China, and it goes without saying that it is imperative to study measures to adapt to the local situation. New policies toward China have been consistent from beginning to end, and efforts are being made to implement them. For example, on the food issue, if China has any requests, Japan will do its best to provide assistance. Currently, thanks to the enthusiastic efforts of Chairman Chen and other leaders of the National Government, various measures are being promoted smoothly. It is said that salary increases for officials and civil servants at all levels can be realized from July 1. Regarding the food issue, preparations are currently underway to reorganize the Rice Control Committee and the Commerce Control Committee. This matter is closely related to the quality of public security. I believe that after various issues are adjusted, success will be seen in the near future. Regarding the location issue of the Shanghai Embassy Office, its mechanism is also being considered for strengthening and expansion as the war progresses.

Chairman Wang's Health is Recovering - Foreign Minister Chu Expresses Gratitude

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - National Government Foreign Minister Chu Minyi came to Japan the other day to visit Chairman Wang, who is recuperating.

Therefore, I was ordered to come to Japan this time and learned that the Chairman's illness is progressing very well under the careful treatment of renowned doctors from various departments of Japanese medicine. I was extremely pleased after meeting him. The concern of the Japanese Imperial Family and the assistance of all sectors are deeply appreciated by our country. I humbly convey the Chairman's gratitude to all related parties in Japan.

### Cooperating with the War Economy - The Current Focus - Japanese Minister Aoki Issues Statement

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Japanese Minister for Greater East Asia Aoki invited members of the press corps to his official residence on the afternoon of the 2nd for a tea party. He expressed his views on how to overcome various difficulties in the wartime economy of various regions of Greater East Asia, saying: The fundamental purpose of Japan's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere economic policy is twofold: one is a coexistence and co-prosperity economy, and the other is a cooperative war economy. However, the coexistence and co-prosperity economy is clearly a matter for after Japan's victory, so the current focus should still be on the cooperative war economy. If so, then today, the various cooperation of various regions of Greater East Asia with Japan in carrying out the war, whether in the form of materials or money, is extremely important. As Minister Aoki said, "familiar sincerity will lead to delivery," but how to focus on the cooperative war economy, the fundamental difference between Japan and Britain and the United States, is to absolutely exclude the power politics of Britain and the United States, which only care about themselves. In order to enable the economic strength of the Co-Prosperity Sphere to continue to cooperate in the war, it is certainly necessary to revitalize the economy. In order to stabilize the people's livelihood in various regions, it is even more necessary to revitalize the economy. Therefore, the rapid revitalization of local industries that meet local needs is a matter of urgency. Japan is making every effort to provide strong support to various regions in terms of technology, materials, etc. Regarding this, Minister Aoki said that what is possible to revitalize the economy of various regions of Greater East Asia will be implemented immediately, and what is not possible will be made possible in the future, and so on. This statement and this meaning are the fundamental attitude of Japan's Co-Prosperity Sphere economic policy under wartime conditions.

### American Troops in Biak - Many Killed and Wounded

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - After American troops landed in Biak, they were fiercely bombed by Japanese army and air force units. Among them, the losses suffered during the battle in Bosnek were the heaviest. The American troops were forced to gather at Bosnek from Harai and Bosnek. This is a narrow coastal area, which is easily attacked by Japanese sniper units, causing the enemy to be completely wiped out.

It is learned that the total number of deaths and injuries of the American troops from the start of the landing operation on the 27th to the next day has reached 1,356. MacArthur issued a statement during the landing operation saying, "What I am most pleased with is that our army suffered minor losses.

### The Spirit of New China

— Written by Yūmatsu Entai

Professor Yūmatsu Entai, a Japanese Buddhist scholar, was invited as a lecturer for the academic lecture series jointly organized by the Xinwen Bao and this newspaper. He arrived in Shanghai at the end of last month. Yesterday, he attended a welcome reception held by the Shanghai Buddhist Association and will be giving lectures in various places. Last night at 9:00 PM, he was invited by the Shanghai Broadcasting Station to give a radio lecture. The full text is recorded below:

As we stand on the streets of Shanghai, looking at the bustling crowds and towering buildings, we can't help but wonder where we really are. Is this the "New China" created by Dr. Sun Yat-sen? Of course, I cannot base this on what used to be an international port. That is a "pretend New China," not the real thing.

National Awakening

So, what is the "spirit of the new country"? It is the "Three Principles of the People" created by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. However, the new spirit of these "Three Principles of the People" is often understood in a very Westernized way, rather than from a Chinese standpoint. The first, "nationalism," is that the Chinese should have a Chinese national consciousness, that they should be inherently Chinese. Even if a Chinese person wears spectacles, smokes cigarettes, and frequents churches, they are still Chinese in the end. No matter how fluent a person is in English, they will still speak the language they were born speaking in their dreams or in times of crisis. Only on top of the inherent spirit can one see spiritual stability. The spirit flowing in the depths of the Chinese soul is connected to the classics of Confucius and Mencius. A classic such as the "Analects" uses the scenery and customs of China as its context, compiled on top of the customs and habits of the Chinese people, a great astronomy that has a permanent life. The way of the sages set by Confucius has truly become the content of the Chinese national consciousness. Such classics are really latent in the depths of your hearts and families. Whether it is Confucianism, Taoism, or Buddhism, it is not in the form of the classics or other remnants. If you deviate from its central spirit, where can you find the nationalism of the new China? Although I am a Buddhist scholar, I often keep a copy of the Analects by my side. But for today's college students and young people, if you talk about Confucius, it's simply not a match, and you will be considered corrupt, because they have no idea of its contents. Some people seem to think that by removing the classics, they can understand the Three Principles. That's because some of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's students were young and tinged with Western ideas. The church schools run by Christianity, which are engaged in China's educational undertaking, are forgetting their ancestors, obliterating the Chinese national consciousness, and creating theories that exclude other yellow races. If "nationalism" is truly profoundly implemented, it will be a revival of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhist classics, and it will lead to the common consciousness of the "Greater Asia" that Dr. Sun Yat-sen spoke of. National consciousness begins with the family, expands to the clan and village, and then expands to the nation and its co-prosperity sphere. It seems to be a kind of destiny. This is a co-prosperity sphere of thought. But China is unfortunate, because it has adopted the compromising path of "using barbarians to control barbarians." So while advocating nationalism, it depends on Britain and the United States. It is said that the leaders in Chongqing have recently felt this contradiction and are paying attention to the Chinese classics. Although they still rely on Britain and the United States for weapons, they have rejected their ideas. They are now in a state of not knowing what to do. But it is commendable that they have noticed this point. As citizens of an allied nation, we are extremely willing to help elevate the Chinese spirit. If it is something related to Chinese-Japanese cultural endeavors, even if it troubles "Japan," we want to do some work for the sake of China. Currently, in the hearts of all parties, one can see that China is restoring the spirit of the classics. This is something to be celebrated greatly. Selling China to Britain and the United States, contrary to the teachings of the Founding Father, is very obvious.

Stability of People's Livelihood

Secondly, when it comes to "the Principle of People's Livelihood," one can directly see the Founding Father's Eastern thought. The important thing for those in power is how to stabilize the lives of all the people. However, to mix this "people's livelihood" with the ideas of the French Revolution and to compare it with the social contract theory and socialism and communism, it seems to have a connection with leftist theories. But this is completely not in line with the Eastern spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. This "Principle of People's Livelihood" starts from the benevolence and righteousness of gentlemen and sages. There is a Buddhist magazine called "Jue You Qing" published in Shanghai, because the Sanskrit word "Bodhisattva" is a translation of those who seek the Tao with altruistic compassion. They are people who are perfect in both self-benefit and benefiting others. Willing to cut half of the bread in their hands to give to the poor, and willing to cut off their own flesh and blood to give to their brothers, this is a Bodhisattva. Sacrificing oneself for righteousness is the work of a gentleman. Putting oneself behind is "benefiting life," "aiding life," "saving life," and "people's livelihood." This is not advocating the equality of mankind. It is when one feels the great compassion of equality in their difference that there will naturally be an organic "people's livelihood." If a virtuous person such as Yan Hui is only concerned about himself, how can he feel that the people are starving? This "people's livelihood" was not invented by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. It is the virtue of "benevolence" of China's 5,000-year tradition. In particular, Chinese Buddhism teaches people to be compassionate and leads to the offering of blessings. Modern China has learned too much materialism and utilitarianism from Britain and the United States, and has been too infatuated with liberalism and hedonism. Therefore, even with regard to this "people's livelihood," it has forgotten the 5,000-year-old way of sages and wants to understand it with materialistic and ego-centric Anglo-American thinking. That is not "the spirit of new China." The spirit of new China is to realize the benevolence and kindness of ancient sages in the modern Chinese political organization. Here, one cannot but consider the revival of the classical spirit.

The Practice of People's Rights

Thirdly, "the Principle of People's Rights" has been distorted after being Westernized, and its thinking has become confused. Since the Republic of China, when has the Westernized "people's rights" been practiced? This matter has also been difficult for Japan. When the parliamentary system was implemented, because it started with Westernized ideas of people's rights, it caused national consciousness to fall into confusion. This kind of "people's rights" is not the theory of "democracy" or "people-based." It is to make the people and hundreds of millions of party members approve of the political will. The East has the politics of kingship and benevolence. It wants to popularize good governance and virtuous rule, and therefore, it is a unified top and bottom, with the upper ranks affecting the lower ranks. This is an organization that is consistent, not to be equated with Anglo-American rights and obligations. The so-called "people's rights" is not to advocate one's own power from the people and restrict the power of those in power. That is inconsistent with the tradition of Eastern politics. Eastern politics must be based on the principle of unity between ruler and minister, top and bottom. Those in power must constantly reflect on themselves, always be based on integrity, fairness, and poverty, always listen to the voice of the people, and strive to recruit talents so that there are no forgotten sages in the wilderness. Today, although much effort has been spent in this China, the complete realization of this politics of kingship has not yet been seen. One of the slogans of the Meiji Restoration was "Make the common people never slack off," and there was also "All matters are decided by public opinion." If the people do not rise up, national power cannot be produced. If Chinese people are met one by one, there are many people with excellent education, but the voice of the people has not been fully heard. The word "people's rights" has almost been used as a synonym for individualism and escapism. Those in power must first cleanse themselves with the way of the sages. What the superiors do, the subordinates will follow. Then, the new life movement of taking the lead will arise. In this way, public opinion will be unimpeded, and public opinion will be gathered. Then, China will unintentionally become a paradise of kingship. In this way, neighboring countries can be preserved, and a new order in Greater Asia can be established.

The above three principles of nationalism, people's livelihood, and people's rights must be divorced from the Anglo-American interpretation and reappear in the original classical spirit of China. Only in this way can the youthful appearance of China appear. How to reproduce the classical essence in modern times, I think this is a task given to China, Japan, and all the nations of East Asia.

### Rice and Grain Specially Approved for Free Transport to Shanghai; Rice Prices Already Dropped Yesterday; The Trend of Our City is Expected to Improve

The black market price of rice in the city has been soaring for days, greatly affecting the people's food. The municipal government authorities have taken necessary measures to curb the rising trend and stabilize people's livelihood. Before the promulgation of the management measures for the import of rice and grain, merchants and nearby farmers are allowed to transport rice and grain to Shanghai, freely entering various ports of entry, not only without needing to obtain passports and proof slips, but also without restrictions on quantity. It was officially announced yesterday, and the subordinate general agencies were ordered to instruct the police to facilitate it. Consequently, a large amount of rice and grain was transported into various ports of entry, and rice shops in all districts of the city also sold it one after another, and people's hearts were stabilized. Therefore, the black market price immediately fell sharply yesterday morning. With the source of supply unblocked, the rice and grain situation in the city has improved, the rice price is trending downward, and citizens can be free from worry.

In addition, according to Article 2 of the Provisional Measures for the Management of Food Rice for Citizens, the municipal government ordered the registered rice shops to convene an industry association as soon as possible, and to establish purchasing groups according to the distribution of rice shops in the administrative districts of the city. A reporter learned from relevant parties yesterday that rice shops in all districts of the city have been invited to actively organize and elect group leaders to handle rice and grain purchasing matters. As for the candidates, they will be announced after being submitted to the authorities for approval. At the same time, the issue of gold for purchasing rice and grain is also being planned, and it should be decided in the near future and purchasing work will begin. Therefore, in the future, the supply of food rice in the city will be abundant, and there is no need to worry.

### The Economic Bureau Bans the Sale of Coal Briquettes Mixed with Impurities

The city's Economic Bureau has recently reported that coal briquette merchants have been selling coal briquettes allocated to households mixed with impurities. However, after sending staff to investigate, they blamed the factory for producing inferior products, which is not true. Therefore, on the 1st of this month, all coal briquette merchants were ordered that if they encounter inferior factory goods in the future, they can refuse to accept them. Once they are accepted, it will no longer involve the manufacturer. The merchant in charge is fully responsible, and there must be no more mixed sales. If they dare to violate this, in addition to confiscating their deposit and revoking their qualification as a dealer, they will also be severely punished according to the law.

### The City Propaganda Office Convened the 15th Regular Press Conference Yesterday

At 2:30 PM yesterday (the 3rd), the City Propaganda Office convened the 15th regular press conference. Reporters from various newspapers and news agencies attended, and the answers from various agencies are recorded below:

The Municipal Government Strengthens Talent Organization

Xin Zhongguo Bao asked: Recently, the government has taken measures to strengthen the personnel organization. Does the municipal government have any adjustments to this? The Secretariat replied: Regarding the strengthening of the personnel organization, this government, since receiving the central government's order, has immediately actively planned to cut redundant personnel and adjust the organization on the one hand, and to raise funds to improve the treatment of employees on the other hand. It can be appreciated soon.

### Preventing Hoarding of Rice

The New China Newspaper asks: Since the National Government abolished the unified control over rice and allowed free transport and sale, the rice market will inevitably become active. Does the municipal government have specific measures to prevent and punish hoarding and profiteering? Black market rice prices are soaring repeatedly. How will the relevant authorities stop this? The Secretariat replied: Regarding this issue, since the Central Government announced the "Temporary Measures Outline for Food Supply of Residents in Beijing and Shanghai," this government issued a proclamation on May 25th, stating that those who take the opportunity to manipulate, exploit hoarding, and obstruct the people's food supply will be severely punished according to the law. At the same time, the "Temporary Measures for the Management of Rice for Shanghai Residents," jointly decided by this government and the Rice Management Committee, has also been promulgated. Various detailed rules are being discussed by the responsible personnel of both parties and will soon be implemented. The current trend of rising prices can be curbed. The Grain Bureau replied: The authorities will not tolerate any illegal acts of unscrupulous merchants hoarding rice and profiteering. The "Rice Management Measures" have been announced, and measures are being carefully planned to stop soaring prices. Starting today, rice can be freely transported in and sold freely in the market, which will eliminate the black market. At the same time, the rice purchased by the Rice Management Committee will also be shipped to Shanghai successively.

### Continued Rationing of Rice for Registered Households

The China Daily asks: Now that the restrictions on transporting food into Shanghai have been lifted, and free sale is implemented, will the original per capita rationing system continue to be implemented? The Grain Bureau replied: The rationing system is a necessary measure to stabilize people's livelihoods during wartime. Per capita rice rationing has always been undertaken by this government, and the source of rice for rationing is the responsibility of the Rice Management Committee to procure. According to the "Temporary Measures for the Management of Rice for Shanghai Residents," although the rationing system will be slightly revised in the future, it will continue to be implemented. The aim is to ensure that rice transported into Shanghai can be sold fairly to the general public through rice shops, thereby preventing large-scale purchases and hoarding for speculation.

### Preparing for Rationing of Daily Necessities

The New China asks: Regarding various daily necessities, it is heard that rationing will be implemented. How will the authorities proceed with this work? When will the rationing be implemented? The Economic Bureau replied: It is currently being planned.

### Coal Briquettes Will Be Rationed to Registered Households

The China Daily asks: The rationing of coal briquettes in the first district has been suspended for more than a month since the end of the fourth phase, and the fifth phase has not yet been distributed. With the summer approaching, citizens rely on coal for fuel. If this continues, it will not only lead to a continuous increase in the black market but also have a significant impact on the lives of citizens. Does the relevant authority have a careful plan for smoothing the source, fair distribution, and reducing the black market? The Economic Bureau replied: Due to discussions on adjusting the rationing price, it is expected that rationing will be possible around the 10th of this month.

### New Movement First District Branch Actively Promotes Work Establishes Four Major Work Outlines

The Shanghai Special City First District Branch of the New Citizen Movement Promotion Committee was established after the recovery of the Public Concession last year and its renaming as the First District. The committee has one director and several members. Under the committee, there is an administrative office, which is actually responsible for the work. The administrative office has one director, two deputy directors, and several group leaders, who handle matters in groups. Initially, the director was concurrently held by Mayor Chen. After Wu Songgao succeeded the head of the First District Office in March of this year, the director of the committee was also changed to be concurrently held by Director Wu. The director of the administrative office is Wang Yiyi, the deputy director of the General Affairs Office of the First District Office, and the district directors are Ling Dating and Lu Yiwei. The previous work of the committee focused on organizing school club departments for all teenagers in the district to establish the First District Branch Regiment Department. Great importance was also attached to promoting general new movement work and thrift propaganda. In the past, the placement of small slogans under the glass tabletops of major restaurants and cafes and the screening of slides in various movie theaters were particularly praised by the general public. Recently, five-color and six-lacquer propaganda signs have been installed in busy streets and alleys to spread the message widely. It is heard that the committee's future work will shift from propaganda to practical action. On the opening day of the conference, ten propaganda teams will be organized to conduct thorough propaganda in busy streets and alleys. Secondly, to encourage the organization of public and private groups in the district. The New Movement Practice Group has now formulated details on rewarding the eradication of undesirable children's reading materials and obscene songs and dramas. Fourth, to cooperate with the epidemic prevention movement, detailed measures have been formulated, which will be implemented separately soon.

### Health Exhibition Enthusiastic Visitors

The city's Health Movement Congress and Health Exhibition were enthusiastically visited. The city's Health Movement Congress and Health Exhibition both opened at 10:00 AM on the 1st of this month. The exhibition displayed various fly and mosquito eradication tools, as well as specimens of human physiology, pathology, and animal pathology, which were particularly valuable. The association was originally scheduled to be open as usual yesterday, but the Shanghai Sports Association happened to hold a competition yesterday afternoon, so the exhibition was closed in the afternoon. Several doctors and nurses were stationed at each exhibition site to provide citizens with inquiries at any time. It was originally scheduled to be closed today, but to meet the needs of citizens, it was still open in the morning and closed in the afternoon.

### Readers' Scholarship News

Methods for Schools to Collect Application Forms

The 7th session of scholarship funds for students have been announced at the 30th of May. Cooperation has been formally requested from the authorities, but due to recent problems with postal work the documents have yet to be sent and there have been so many inquiries that it is hard to keep up, this is why the school can collect the application forms on their behalf to redistribute. All students of university-level institutions and below, who: (A) are from a poor family, (B) are of good character and health, and (C) have excellent academic records, with an average score in the top third of their grade, or who have special expertise and are worthy of further study, may register with the school they are attending before June 10th. The school authorities must carefully review the registered students and refuse to recommend those who do not meet any of the three items under A, B, and C. Those who are indeed qualified and can be recommended should first be registered, and then a letter should be prepared listing the number of people in each grade to collect the application forms from the scholarship office and distribute them to the students to fill out. This letter must be delivered by June 15th at the latest. The number of application forms collected by each school should not exceed 5% of the number of students, but some flexibility can be granted to schools with more students receiving assistance from this company. This is a last resort restriction, and it is expected that even after this restriction, a large number of applicants may still not be approved. Rather than disappointing the majority of students later, it is better to impose some restrictions beforehand. It is hoped that the school authorities will understand this intention. The office is scheduled to start issuing application forms on June 12th. Due to the inevitable errors in mailing, it is best for each school to prepare a letter and send someone to pick them up.

Opening Ceremony Donation to Scholarship The China Silk Company will open on the 7th. It will first announce to all colleagues and friends in the industry that the congratulatory gifts will be converted into cash and used for scholarships to save costs. It turns uselessness into usefulness, which is very meaningful and admirable. The letter said: "Our company is scheduled to open on June 7th. In these extraordinary times, we should save costs. We hereby inform all colleagues and friends in the industry that we will accept cash gifts instead of congratulatory gifts and transport them to Shenbao and Xinwenbao for scholarships. Our company will no longer accept gifts. Furthermore, our company will not prepare refreshments on the opening day. All these expenses will be converted into 20,000 yuan of national currency, which will be donated to Shenbao Scholarship and Xinwenbao Loan Scholarship, 10,000 yuan each, to create benefits for all those who send congratulatory gifts. In addition to publishing another announcement, we are sending a silk industry check for 10,000 yuan in national currency. Please check and issue a receipt."

Gift Donated to Scholarship Mr. Cui Junyou's son, Zhao Guang, recently celebrated the joy of having a daughter. He used the congratulatory money from relatives and friends for charity and scholarships, which is commendable. The letter said: "Recently, my granddaughter turned one month old. I am grateful for the congratulatory gifts from all relatives and friends and should express my gratitude. However, considering the difficult times and the need to save materials, I will allocate the saved banquet funds to charity to create benefits for all relatives and friends. In addition to donating to the Guangdong Shanghai Native Place Association for distributing sauce and medicine and the Zhenjiang Yamen Nursery in Panyu Changrui Hall for distributing rice, I am now sending 10,000 yuan in national currency to your newspaper and Xinwenbao to be used for scholarships. Please check and give us a receipt, we will be grateful."

Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday China Silk Company (saved expenses from the opening ceremony) 10,000 yuan, Cui Junyou (saved banquet funds from the one-month celebration of his granddaughter) 10,000 yuan, Li Heqin (rewarded Mr. Mi's donation of redemption money) 3,000 yuan, Tang Chengde, Li Jingfan (saved banquet funds for his son's one-month celebration), Fu Ji Slaughter Company Lu Alin 1,000 yuan each, Tang Wenrong 100 yuan. A total of 26,100 yuan in savings bonds was received, and the balance is 2,337,642 yuan.

### Shanghai Special City Government Notice

Shanghai City No. 5575

Notice is hereby given that the "Temporary Measures for the Management of Rice for Shanghai Residents" have been promulgated. Before the promulgation of the "Measures for the Management of Rice Import into Shanghai," all procurement merchants and nearby farmers who transport rice to Shanghai are exempt from obtaining passports and certificates and are free to enter all import ports in the city.

June 2nd, 33rd year of the Republic of China Mayor Chen Gongbo

### Shanghai Special City Government Notice Shanghai City No. 5575

Notice is hereby given that in accordance with Article 2 of the "Temporary Measures for the Management of Rice for Shanghai Residents," "For the purpose of implementing this law, the municipal government orders the registered rice shops to establish procurement groups according to administrative districts. Each group shall have one leader designated by the rationing household rice agency." The rice shops registered in this city should immediately convene a meeting of the same industry to establish procurement groups separately according to the distribution of rice shops in each administrative district of this city. The candidates for group leaders shall first be recommended by the same industry, three to five people per group, and submitted to the Municipal Grain Bureau and the First District Public Relief Office for joint approval. As for the funds required for the procurement of rice, in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the aforementioned Management Temporary Measures, in principle, the procurement merchants and rice shops shall prepare their own funds. However, in order to encourage the righteous distribution of rice for the people and to consider the difficulties of merchants, if there is indeed insufficient capital, they may apply to the Municipal Government to negotiate with the bank for loans. All rice merchants should comply with this notice.

### National Forum A Thorough Solution to the Livelihood of Teachers and Staff

— Yang Ti

The poverty of teachers' lives is an undeniable fact. Recently, with soaring prices, the difficulty of their lives has become even more severe. The authorities are deeply aware of the situation, so they have launched this initiative to collect living allowance fees from students' parents. My fellow teachers are truly like receiving timely rain after a long drought and are all grateful.

But on closer thought, there are great difficulties in realizing this approach and achieving effective results. The biggest problem lies in the inability to arouse the sympathy of the general parents in practical action. They believe that the tuition fees collected by the schools are mostly already quite high. How can they still cry about the poverty of teachers' lives and want to solve this problem? Of course, they cannot plan on asking the parents for help again. One more point: eight or nine out of ten students' parents in general schools are salaried workers with limited income. At this time when everything is expensive, they may have the same lack of livelihood as the poor teachers. Then, it is unreasonable and unkind to ask them to help each other in their illness. Even if some parents can express deep sympathy, they are also limited. There is too little porridge and too many monks. How much can each person get? A drop in the bucket, I am afraid it will not help. Therefore, there are countless schools in the city, but only thirteen schools officially follow the authorities' approach (Lin Bureau Chief's conversation on the 23rd), and the others are still hesitating.

In short, the facts can tell us that although the authorities have good intentions, it is not easy to achieve the ideal goal. Moreover, this is just a temporary solution. To seek a fundamental solution, we still need the authorities to make further efforts. I hope that with political power, they will order each school's finances to be open and organize a school finance investigation committee to review the actual number of each school's financial income and expenditure budget, etc., and distribute the surplus equally to teachers and staff, so that the principal will not monopolize the profits. In this way, there will be no capitalist-style principals and slave-style teachers.

Furthermore, the current corruption of education is also an undeniable fact. The problem lies in the fact that most teachers have a fleeting thought of changing their minds because of the poverty of their lives, and they cannot regard education as a lifelong career. Therefore, they cannot concentrate on the development and improvement of education, and it is inevitable that it will gradually become corrupt. If the authorities can implement the above method and solve the teachers' living problems to a minimum, then the teachers can live in peace and devote their energy to the progress of their careers, and the development of education is also a matter of course. As for the solution to the living allowance fees for teachers and staff this semester, we can also refer to the above method, and evenly divide the number of economic surpluses of each school to teachers, and be sure to prevent teachers from being exploited and treated harshly by the principals. Finally, if the authorities issue a decree and there are schools that cannot comply with it, the authorities can send personnel to take over as an effective method. If this is the case, the problem of teachers' lives can be thoroughly resolved.

### Letter

To the Editor, I have read an article in the Citizen Forum of your newspaper on May 30, entitled "Give a Real Example." Our association has previously prepared a method for the allocation of glutinous rice for winemaking in various places, which has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation. On January 5 of this year, we telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau to transfer and summon winemakers from various places to come to the meeting to receive it. After that, glutinous rice was distributed successively, and the winemaking industry associations in Beijing, Hangzhou, and other places are on file. According to Article 8 of the above-mentioned method, "The Rice Control Committee shall allocate the rice to the associations according to the prescribed price, and the difference between the price sold by the association and the price sold by the public shall be transferred by the Rice Control Committee to the Executive Yuan for the purpose of rewarding increased production." It was found this time that the Wujiang Winemaking Industry Association procured glutinous rice by itself, which is obviously a violation of this regulation. It was sent to the Wujiang District Office to investigate and collect the difference. It is in accordance with the order that the office is handling the matter, if there is no other evidence of overstepping the war, it is inappropriate. Please correct your newspaper. Sincerely, Rice and Grain Control Committee.

### From Thrift Movement To Coarse Cloth Short Clothes

In this extraordinary period, many people have taken off their long gowns and put on short clothes in response to the thrift movement. This is indeed a very gratifying phenomenon! Originally, the materials used for long gowns accounted for about twice as much as those for short clothes. At this time of difficulty in obtaining half a thread or half a strand, it is an unnecessary waste, and it is not as easy to do things in long gowns as it is to walk lightly and move quickly in short clothes. However, I think that the best clothing material now is cotton cloth, which can be rationed, and it is best to use coarse cloth, because it is both economical and durable, and it meets the principles of thrift everywhere. If we can all wear coarse cloth short clothes, it will not only revitalize the domestic industry, prosper the rural economy, but also enrich the society. (Lu Ren)

### Letter to My Sister (7) Navy

— Written by Baoyan Kunio, Translated by Hong Yang

The cape on the left is deeply embedded in the shadows of the mountains, and there is a strip of blue sea in the middle. A strange thing appeared from this place. To use a mythological adjective, it is the Sumomo in the Nilielgen story. To use a prosaic analogy, it is like a factory in the Jiangdong area rushing into the sea during floods. Because it was moving, Longfu thought it must be a ship. While he was wondering what it was, the shadow left the cape and, with white waves, advanced towards the sea in front. Its speed was very fast - (like a warship.)

Fu saw the flag fluttering on the ship. In a short time, its posture under the sunlight could be seen clearly. A hull like a long iron bridge appeared. The turret of the main gun appeared.

(It's a heavy cruiser!)

Longfu also had some common sense and understood the difference between warships. In his mind, the knowledge he had gained from "Navy" magazine and the warship photo album of the Yushinkai naturally appeared.

(Oh, it seems to be a Takao-class warship!)

He felt like his spirit was exhausted. And in his heart, he wanted to dance and stomp his feet. Because he was still a student in the military group, only the Takao-class warship was the warship he had always dreamed of. The great and majestic appearance of the new heavy cruiser captured his heart more strongly than any warship photo. Its tonnage, armament, and speed, until now, are firmly remembered in his heart like the face of a lover.

(The Takao-class warship is speeding in front of my eyes.)

He forgot everything and was intoxicated with happiness. When the fleet entered the port of Kagoshima, even though his eyes were wide like eggs, he never saw the warship. Today, he finally saw it. "It's really dangerous... It's a good ship!"

Due to the intense emotion, he blurted out these words. This warship was completely like wearing dark blue armor and set off to the front line with great majesty. He stared blankly at this posture and was lost in thought. After a while, he unintentionally began to grope back and forth in the yukata bag he had rented from the inn. He was groping for his sketchbook, which he always carried with him.

However, despairing of painting, he had not even brought a pencil on this trip. At the same time, he clearly knew that even if he had brought a pencil, he could not sketch here because it was a fortress area. But, his hand still continued to grope in his pocket. The shadow of the giant ship floated on the horizontal line, until it was blocked by the shadow of the cape on the right. Longfu's fingers were moving, groping up and down his chest.
