### World Affairs Discourse

— Hu Lancheng

I divide this world war into three stages: the stage of blitzkrieg, the stage of material warfare, and the stage of political warfare.

The anti-Axis powers have an advantage in materials, but before the materials could be mobilized, the Axis powers took advantage with their blitzkrieg. Now, the Axis powers' materials have been mobilized. At the same time, the Axis powers' political warfare has also begun, especially with the publication of the Greater East Asia Declaration by the countries of Greater East Asia. Therefore, ending the war and determining victory or defeat still do not depend on materials.

The aspects of world political warfare are: first, the labor-management problems within Britain and the United States; second, the revolutionary problems within the Soviet Union; third, the vacillation of neutral and semi-neutral countries; fourth, the turmoil in Europe; and fifth, the problems of China and India.

The labor movement in the United States has not suffered any serious failures. Therefore, its vitality has always been very strong. The statistical figures for strikes in the United States during the war are greater than in any other country. Now, the government is using military administration to suppress them. Although this can have a temporary effect, the workers' struggle target is thus shifted from capitalists to the government, and the economic struggle of the labor movement will become more clearly a political struggle. The shock of this will be seen in this year's presidential election.

The statistical figures for strikes in Britain are not as high as in the United States, but the politicization of labor struggles in Britain is even further ahead than in the United States. This is because Britain's wartime industrial management system was established earlier and is stricter than that of the United States, and also because the British government is less healthy than the American government. Whenever a labor movement moves from an economic struggle to a political struggle, it often goes through a relatively quiet period before erupting with ten or a hundred times the force. The British Empire is going to collapse completely, regardless of whether the anti-Axis powers win or lose.

The Soviet Union's dissolution of the Third International was not only to reassure Britain and the United States, but also to strike at the remnants of Leninism within the Soviet Union. The fact that it is being forced to strike at these remnants shows that these remnants are already resurfacing and are detrimental to the Stalin regime. The Stalin regime is also afraid of communism, which is no surprise today. Furthermore, a few months ago, the Stalin regime announced that the Soviet republics had independent diplomatic rights. This was to decentralize the responsibility of the Kremlin and pass it on to the republics, not only externally but also internally. If the people are dissatisfied, they are dissatisfied with the republics, which does not involve the Stalin regime. The republics suppress the people's resistance, which also does not involve the Stalin regime. The Stalin regime has become an intermediary between the republics and the people, maintaining the balance of the political status quo in this intermediary capacity. However, such a balance is extremely unstable.

The semi-neutral and neutral countries on the anti-Axis side have not been damaged by the war, or have only suffered very slight damage. As the situation of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union gradually becomes more serious, they gradually become more stubborn. The pressure that Britain and the United States put on them is measured, regardless of whether you are happy or not. Argentina is an example. The United States does not have many ways to deal with it. Generally, many of these countries are semi-colonial countries, and their gradual stubbornness is gradually opposed to this war.

Europe is currently suffering from the intensification of communist unrest. This is a burden for Hitler, but also a burden for Roosevelt and Churchill. No matter how the war in Europe ends, the day it ends will also be the official beginning of the total outbreak and spread of this unrest. Britain and the United States should not think that they have the ability to put out this great fire. Even the Soviet Union will be shaken, because the stance of this unrest is outside the opposition between the Axis and anti-Axis powers, and it also conflicts with the Stalin regime. Therefore, once the war in Europe ends, the difficulties of Britain and the United States will suddenly increase.

In the East, I believe that the decisive point is not in the islands of the Pacific, but in India. There is currently famine and spontaneous unrest among the people in India, while the activities of the National Congress Party seem rather quiet in comparison. The reason for its quietness lies in Britain's increased pressure, and even more in the fact that the demands of the Indian era have surpassed the National Congress Party, causing the National Congress Party to also be at a loss. During this period, revolutionary parties within the National Congress Party are gradually being formed, rising, and brewing a new situation of struggle. Currently, Britain does not dare to trust the Indian army. The Greater East Asia War brings independence to India, but whether independence is realized before or after the end of the war has different and profound impacts on the overall world situation. The point to strive for lies in this.

The India problem and the China problem are almost inseparable. If China can complete the Greater East Asia War with maximum cooperation, the Indian independence movement will receive an incomparably strong impetus and achieve independence before the end of the Greater East Asia War. As for Sino-Japanese relations, only when China and Japan both reform at the same time can the two countries establish a new relationship.

The labor-management problems within Britain and the United States, the revolutionary problems within the Soviet Union, the vacillation of neutral and semi-neutral countries, the turmoil in Europe, and the problems of China and India are all interconnected and combined into one problem. Whoever can grasp the situation of this world political struggle will be the victor.

### The Japanese Army Attacks Dam in Two Routes, the British Indian Army Collapses; Fierce Fighting Also Breaks Out Near Imphal

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 25th – The annihilation battle launched by the Japanese army on the Indian border against part of the main force of the 20th Division of the British Indian Army in the area of ​​Rubo Valley has reached its climax. Since the 20th, the Japanese army, with the cooperation of tank units and heavy artillery units, has been rapidly pursuing the defeated British Indian army and inflicting heavy casualties on it. After capturing Whitekuh, the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on Pata, a key point one kilometer south of Dam, since the 21st. The Japanese vanguard units have attacked and inflicted heavy casualties on about 400 enemy soldiers carrying mortars north of the area. The Japanese army that went south arrived at a certain place four kilometers north of Dam at 8:00 a.m. on the 22nd, preparing to attack Dam, the base of the enemy's 20th Division, from the north and south. The enemy army had completely collapsed, fleeing along the Dam-Baleel Highway. The Japanese mechanized units followed and inflicted heavy casualties on them. The Japanese army, which also entered India, cooperated with the Indian National Army. Near a certain place twelve kilometers northwest of Dam, they blockaded the enemy's retreat route and launched a fierce attack, causing great confusion to the defeated enemy.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 24th – The news of the Japanese army breaking into Indian territory seems to have deeply shocked and worried British and American political circles. According to a United Press dispatch from New York, the Japanese army has broken through the Indian border at three locations and is currently engaged in fierce fighting near Imphal. It also admits that the current situation has reached a critical stage. It is also heard that a unit of the Japanese army is attacking Imphal, an important base of the anti-Axis forces, and is currently only ten miles away.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 24th – The battles in the northwestern border area of ​​Burma and India are unfolding in the upper reaches of the Mogawan Creek Valley. According to news from New Delhi, the current operational objective of the Japanese and Indian armies is to occupy Manipur, an important supply base for the anti-Axis forces. If this area falls, it would be tantamount to giving the Japanese and Indian armies an important base for attacking Assam. If Japan and India further launch a political offensive against Assam, the Stilwell troops and the anti-Axis forces' eastern Indian railway in the central region will be cut off, and they are deeply worried about the development of the current situation.

### The Japanese Cabinet Decides on Wartime Researchers

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th – The Japanese Research Mobilization Conference, in order to give full play to Japan's overall war science and technology capabilities and to establish a winning system for scientific weapons warfare and production enhancement warfare, has been carefully deliberating on the wartime research topics and the selection of wartime researchers submitted by the Army, Navy Technical Institute, and the Ministry of Munitions since October of last year. All the scheduled researchers have now been decided. Among the scheduled researchers, 43 people from universities, 11 government officials, and 12 civilians, a total of 66 people, were selected as the first batch of chief wartime researchers and were officially appointed by the Cabinet on the 24th. The second batch of candidates is also planned to be announced soon.

### The Third Session of the Privy Council Meeting Convened in Burma

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 25th – The Burmese government convened the third session of the Privy Council meeting starting on the 20th. First, government representatives explained the 14 policy measures implemented by the government and the important plans for the future since the second session convened last year. Among them, the most noteworthy of the recent measures and plans is the strengthening of the county administrative structure and the establishment of the Planning Institute. The whole of Burma, except for the two counties of Western County, etc., consists of thirty-four counties, and the grades of each county are divided into three grades, namely, fifteen counties of the first grade, fifteen counties of the second grade, and four counties of the third grade. In order to promote emergency wartime measures, the counties adjacent to the enemy areas have been designated as first-grade counties, and the other counties have been designated as second-grade or third-grade counties. In addition to setting up a governor in the first-grade counties, a deputy governor is also set up. Furthermore, the right to freely appoint and dismiss lower-level officials is given to the local districts. At the same time, in order to seek the renewal and strengthening of local administration and to carry out the war, reward methods are also established to reward county residents who cooperate in the war. Furthermore, the government will soon establish a Planning Institute directly under the Cabinet. With the assistance of Japanese advisors, it will implement the basic planning of national policies. It is expected that after the establishment of the Institute, Burma's national politics will make rapid progress, so all parties are looking forward to it with great anticipation.

### The 84th Session of the Japanese Diet Held a Closing Ceremony Yesterday; Prime Minister Tojo Read the Imperial Rescript

### Chairman Wang Cables Bose to Express Congratulations

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th – The Indian National Army is cooperating with the Japanese army in this operation and has recently broken through the Indian border and entered Indian territory. Our Chairman Wang cabled Chairman Bose to express his congratulations. The original cable is as follows: "To His Excellency Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India, I am delighted to learn that Your Excellency led the Indian National Army in cooperation with the allied Japanese army to break through the Indian border and enter your country's territory, driving out the enemy forces and achieving this glorious initiative. I admire you greatly and send this cable to express my congratulations and wish Your Excellency good health. Wang Zhaoming, Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China."

### Air Combat Continues in the South Pacific; A Japanese Major Describes the Actual Situation

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South, the decisive air battle on the South Pacific front is still continuing. This is a major war of attrition and also a fierce war of resupply. The naval and air battles in the waters off Bougainville Island totaled six times. Enemy ships have suffered heavy losses and a large consumption of aircraft. This has a significant impact on the enemy's resupply war. A certain major in a certain air unit of the Japanese army recently gave a talk on the actual situation of the air combat in the South Pacific. The gist of his talk was: The superiority of the air force on the front line is inherently related to the domestic aircraft production volume. However, the superiority or inferiority of the military force is not only controlled by this, but also by how to quickly replenish the force consumed in continuous decisive battles within the time limit and prepare the air force formation, which is also extremely important. This is the so-called resupply war of aircraft. The speed of preparing the air force formation has a significant impact on the war situation. Although the United States boasts of being the country with the largest aircraft production in the world, it feels greatly distressed about the long resupply route and continuous decisive battles. In particular, American aircraft are often shot down by the Axis forces, and pilots are either killed, captured, or missing, making replenishment extremely difficult. What is most noteworthy is that the quality of enemy pilots has gradually declined recently. Among the fighters, only the flight leader is capable of combat, and the rest belong to the accompaniment, and many are not familiar with driving methods. After our fighter planes launched a surprise attack on the enemy's formation, the enemy aircraft groups fled in droves. They were almost unable to act alone, and the enemy's tactics were not worth a glance. The enemy aircraft only accompanied the flight leader's aircraft and had no practical combat ability on their own.

### Mr. Taniguchi Succeeds as Vice President of the Bank of Japan

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th – After the Vice President of the Bank of Japan, Mr. Shibusawa, was promoted to President, the resulting vacancy was carefully weighed by Finance Minister Ishiwatari and President Shibusawa, and it has been decided that the vacancy will be filled by Mr. Taniguchi, Vice Minister of Finance. The vacancy of the Vice Minister of Finance has been decided to be filled by Mr. Matsukuma Hideo, Director of the Tax Bureau. The government announced the appointment on the 24th.

### Overview of the German-Soviet Spring Front

Since the vast wilderness of the Soviet European part is hidden by the territory, every year around April, the frozen earth cracks, the spring water melts the snow, and the ground becomes a sea of mud. This is the so-called "General Mud," which is about to arrive. Therefore, the third German-Soviet winter war has reached the final stage.

Since last July, the German army has adopted a strategy of shortening the front line in response to the Red Army's successive counter-offensives. The front line has been gradually shifting westward, and it is now in a state of offensive and defensive warfare, resembling the state after one month of the start of the war. The current front line starts from Narva in northeastern Estonia and extends south to the Kerch region of the Crimean Peninsula. The entire line is undulating and stretches for 2,300 kilometers. Driven by the war situation, it can be roughly divided into the central-northern and southern front lines:

### Central and Northern Front Lines

In the past two and a half years, the Soviet Union's second largest metropolis, Leningrad, whose status is second only to Moscow, has been continuously threatened by artillery bombardment as the German army's forward positions are connected to the south of the city. The Red Army has repeatedly surrounded and broken through the enemy's positions, repeatedly disappearing in defeat. However, since last summer, when the battles on the southern front line became fierce and the German army on the northern road under the jurisdiction of Field Marshal Küchler moved part of its forces and had no time to take care of it, the Red Army took the opportunity to launch a general counter-offensive in mid-January of this year from Oranienbaum (30 kilometers west of Leningrad) through the southern suburbs of the city along Lake Ilmen.

This Red Army, including the Leningrad Front Army led by General Govorov and the Volkhov Front Army led by General Meretskov, numbered 〇〇0,000, with national winter equipment. The main force of Govorov's army advanced along the Gulf of Finland towards Estonia, while Meretskov attempted to cut off the railway between Leningrad and Pskov. The newly formed 2nd Baltic Front Army (Commander-in-Chief General Popov) also echoed the previous two armies, starting from the southern part of Lake Ilmen and launching an offensive in the Novorzhev region (west of Velikiye Luki) on the southwest side, launching a three-pronged attack on the German army of the Küchler.

In the past month or so, Govorov's Red Army has crossed the Estonian border and reached the outskirts of the key town of Narva, but has encountered staunch resistance from the German army, and the two sides are still in a stalemate. The central Red Army of Meretskov captured Novgorod on the north side of Lake Ilmen and advanced to the Leningrad-Pskov railway, advancing towards Pskov from the north. At the same time, the Red Army of Popov sent its right-wing troops from the Dno area and moved towards Pskov, while attempting to break into Latvia with its left-wing troops.

According to this, the focus of the northern front line is on the two cities of Narva and Pskov. Narva is the northern gateway to Estonia, and Pskov is its southern gate and a key point connecting the main railway line to Latvia. The Red Army's attempt to recapture Estonia and Latvia along the Baltic coast is very obvious. Assuming that this move is partially realized, it is militarily painless for Germany, but it falls into the German army's guiding tactics, and it will take efforts in vain. From a political point of view, there are also very few places where Estonia and Latvia can be used. At this time, Field Marshal Küchler has received reinforcements of new troops and has deployed strong positions on the north and south sides of Lake Chudskoye (Lake Peipus). On the one hand, the volunteer armies of Estonia and Latvia are also participating in the defense war. It can be seen that the Red Army's supply line is extended, and there is a situation of striking down.

The central front line, which starts from the Nevel district, passes through Velikiye Luki, Loknya, and west of Mozyr, with Belarus as the stage, is also engaged in fierce fighting, corresponding to the northern front line. The defending army is the German Central Army under the command of Field Marshal Kluge, and the attacking army is the Belarusian Front Red Army under General Rokossovsky and the Baltic Front Army under General Bagramyan. The battlefield starts from the famous Pripyat marshes and is full of rivers and swamps. After these swamps freeze, they constitute favorable positions for the German army.

Bagramyan's army has been launching offensives in the Nevel and Velikiye Luki areas since November of last year, but it is still in a state of halt. At the same time, Rokossovsky's army also advanced westward from Gomel and entered and exited the Mozyr area, but could not break further west. Therefore, it turned its vanguard and started from Rogachev in the upper reaches of the Dnieper River in late February. The area is on the highway in the eastern part of the former Polish territory and can also pass through the city of Bobruisk to reach the Belarusian capital Minsk. Rokossovsky's army's attempt to enter Minsk and even the former Polish territory is obvious, but the future is still vague. In addition, with the arrival of spring, the melting snow and wading through the swamps will cause great difficulties. No matter what, the main axis of the central front line is none other than the so-called "Napoleon Road" from Orsha to Minsk, which is also the main trunk line connecting Moscow and Central Europe. Roughly speaking, as long as this trunk line is in the hands of the German army, the base of the German army will not be shaken for a day (to be continued).

### Person in Charge of the Ministry of Industry Talks About Company Registration Procedures; Matters Needing Attention When Applying for Establishment or Capital Increase

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th – The Ministry of Industry has found that cases of companies applying for establishment or capital increase registration are often delayed due to non-compliance with procedures and document exchanges. In order to make the merchants and people understand the various procedures, a person in charge of the Ministry of Industry made the following remarks: Company establishment registration is a certificate for the establishment of a company. If the registered matters are changed after the establishment of the company, and the registration of the change is not made, it cannot be used to oppose the relationship of third parties, which is very important. The most common applications for registration are the establishment registration and the capital increase change registration of a limited company. Now, the registration procedures for these items are briefly described as follows:

(A) Procedures to be completed before establishment: Those who establish a joint-stock limited company should first prepare a business plan, the names and experiences of the promoters, and the number of shares subscribed. Send it together with the prospectus, signed by all the promoters, and submit it to the competent authority for record (Article 23 of the Implementing Rules of the Company Law). If the shares of a joint-stock limited company are fully subscribed by the promoters, the directors should immediately apply to the competent authority to send personnel to verify the capital after taking office (Article 91 of the Company Law). (B) Procedures for establishment registration: The establishment registration should be made by all directors and supervisors, preparing a letter of application, together with two copies of each document to be submitted, and submitting it to the competent official for review and transfer to the Ministry for approval. When the application is submitted by an agent, a power of attorney should be added (Articles 3 and 28 of the Company Registration Rules). The documents to be submitted for establishment registration are as follows: (Article 29 of the same Rules) (A) If the shares are fully subscribed by the promoters, the company's articles of association, list of shareholders, list of directors and supervisors, capital verification certificate, business outline, and documents approved for record. (B) Those who have raised the full amount, the company's articles of association, shareholder register, investigation report of the supervisor or inspector, and its attached documents, resolutions of the founding meeting, business outline, and documents approved for record. (C) Matters needing attention for establishment registration: Companies in the real estate enterprise industry, etc., from January 22 of this year, except for special needs and those that have no speculative nature and are specially permitted to be established, are all suspended from new establishment. Companies engaged in financial, match, or pharmaceutical factory businesses should add the following documents when applying for establishment registration: a copy of the financial industry's business license from the Ministry of Finance, a copy of the proof document of the match industry joining the China National Match Production and Sales Joint Venture Corporation, and a copy of the pharmaceutical factory industry's license certificate from the Department of Health. (B) Capital increase change registration. (A) Procedures and documents to be submitted for capital increase change registration: The capital increase change registration should be made by all directors and supervisors, preparing a letter of application, together with the revised articles of association, and submitting it to the Ministry for review and approval (Articles 3, 28, and 31 of the Company Registration Rules). (B) Matters needing attention for company capital increase: The Ministry announced and implemented the Interim Measures for Restricting Company Capital Increase Registration on December 16 of last year. All companies that apply for capital increase registration after the implementation of these measures, except for those that have convened a shareholders' meeting and collected share payments before the implementation and have submitted proof documents, may be handled with flexibility, and should be subject to the restrictions of these measures. The main points are extracted as follows: Companies should first state the reasons for the capital increase and the method of subscribing to shares, and submit them to the competent authority for transfer to the Ministry for approval. Companies that have not been approved for registration and issued a license may not increase capital. Companies may not increase capital twice within one year (this one year is calculated from the date of implementation of these measures). Companies may not use the increased value of goods and raw materials as shares. Companies established for more than two years may use the increased value of houses, land, machinery, and productive assets used in business as shares. However, the increased value shall not exceed one time the original price, and proof documents of the original price, verification documents of the certified public accountant, balance sheets of previous years, and business reports shall be submitted together for approval. Companies may not use methods such as gifts and rewards as shares to increase capital.

Due to continuous attacks by Japanese aircraft, enemy air force activity has gradually become less aggressive. However, considering the number of enemy aircraft on the mainland and the enemy's call for a general counter-offensive, they are still not to be underestimated. Furthermore, the Japanese Army recently conducted mopping-up operations against the communist forces in the Hebei-Shandong border region, capturing 250 prisoners and seizing a large quantity of weapons and ammunition.

### German-Hungarian Military Cooperation to Defend the Carpathians – Hungarian Policy Inherits the Will of Former Leader

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: A German foreign ministry spokesman stated that the policy of the new Hungarian government is to implement the will of the late leader of the Hungarian National Party, Gömbös. Gömbös advocated German-Hungarian cooperation, but his social revitalization plan was often misinterpreted by later generations. The new Hungarian government will now implement it according to its original plan. The new Hungarian Prime Minister, Sztójay, was once sent to Berlin by Gömbös to serve as a liaison between the Hungarian and German governments. As for foreign reports that German troops have effectively occupied Hungary, that is completely inappropriate. The arrival of German troops in Hungary is no different from the arrival of American troops in Britain. The timely arrival of American troops in Britain to participate in the European war is similar to the timely arrival of German troops in Hungary. If the protection of the Carpathians is not strengthened, the Eastern Front will not be able to proceed.

Budapest, 25th (Central News Agency) – Hungarian newspapers have expressed unanimous satisfaction with the recent developments in Hungary, believing that it will enable Hungary and Germany to unify their efforts in jointly defending Europe.

### Heads of Southeastern European Countries Met with the German Leader

Zurich, 24th (Central News Agency) – Reliable sources: Romanian Prime Minister General Antonescu, Bulgarian Regent Prince Kirill, and the highest leaders of Croatia, Slovakia, and Serbia have all visited Hitler at his headquarters in succession over the past two weeks for important talks.

### Churchill Predicts the Imminent Invasion of Europe – US Paratroopers Practice in Britain

Stockholm, 24th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports from London: British Prime Minister Churchill, accompanied by American Generals Eisenhower, Bradley, and Brereton, today inspected the combat exercises of American paratroopers and glider troops in Britain. Churchill delivered a speech stating that the Second European Front is about to begin, and said that everyone will soon participate in a battle that will determine the outcome of the war, inflicting a major blow on Germany.

### US Navy Takes Over British Air Force Base

Geneva, 24th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: According to a telegram from British sources, the US Navy has "taken over" a British Air Force base in a certain European sea area yesterday, marking a precedent since the beginning of the war.

### British General's Conference Ends in Cairo

Ankara, 25th (Central News Agency) – General Maitland Wilson, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Mediterranean, and several senior British officials have concluded a conference in Cairo. Participants included General Paget, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Middle East; Macmillan, the British Cabinet Representative to the Allied Headquarters in the Mediterranean; Lord Moyne, the British Cabinet Representative to the Middle East; and representatives of various Allied governments. The content of the discussions was related to the Balkan region.

### Soviet Naval Officers Arrive in Haifa – Related to the Reception of Italian Warships

Stockholm, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to the Swiss Daily, a Soviet naval officer delegation has arrived at the port of Haifa in Palestine. It is said that this matter is related to the transfer of a part of the Italian fleet to the Soviet Navy.

### Fierce Battles in the Middle Reaches of the Dniester River – Pressure on Crimea Reduced

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: The pressure exerted by the Soviet army on the Crimean Peninsula from the north to the east has weakened. The enemy seems to have been temporarily forced to abandon its new offensive in that area, but judging from their various actions, fierce battles are likely to erupt again. There is less activity in the lower reaches of the Bug River. People in Berlin believe that this is because the Soviet army has transferred troops from that area to fight in the area between the middle reaches of the Bug River and the Dniester River. The Soviet army is exerting strong pressure on the south, and its goal is obviously to break through the German positions in the lower reaches of the Bug River with a flanking maneuver. There are fierce battles in the areas of Ochakiv and Sarata, both of which are located on the west bank of the Dniester River. There are also fierce battles north of Mogilev and in the area of Potash. The Soviet army launched eight attacks, which were repelled by our troops after fierce close combat.

### Citizens Should Bear the Responsibility of Improving the Lives of Wartime Police

— Chang Feng

Maintaining law and order and protecting the people are the responsibilities of the police, and also the demands of the people. Shanghai is a major commercial port with a population of five million, both Chinese and foreigners, under the scrutiny of all. Whether law and order can be maintained and whether the police can fulfill their duties is not only a matter of domestic affairs, but also related to international perception. However, if we demand good law and order and that the police fulfill their duties, then we should pay more attention to the current living problems of the police and try to solve them.

As far as we know, the income of the police is at most a little over 1,000 yuan per month per person. It is not even enough to maintain personal life with this meager income, let alone support a family. Humans must have reason and empathy. For every current event, they should conduct multi-faceted analysis and research, like the arguments in various aspects of society. They are all dissatisfied with the service spirit of the police, but they do not carefully study the major causes of the degradation of the spirit. This kind of argument is worthless, and the result will not only not help, but will only worsen things.

Recently, the authorities of a police station in one district initiated a police consumer cooperative with 40 million yuan. No matter how much this organization and this amount of funding can help improve the lives of more than 10,000 police officers, its intention is undoubtedly to solve the living problems of police officers and improve the spirit of service. Then, every citizen should not shirk their responsibility and do their best to support it, truly reaching the point of contributing money if they have money, and contributing effort if they have effort. Here, we hope that enlightened leaders from all sectors of society and the wealthy will compare their own lives with the lives of police officers, analyze the relationship between the future of their careers and local law and order, recognize the environment, broaden their horizons, and fully exert their sympathy. Do not make one's own body and career the target of public criticism. At the same time, we also have the following suggestions to contribute to the organizers of the cooperative:

The cooperative should include police officers from the entire city, not just one district.

The operating capital should be expanded to 100 million yuan. The police authorities should invite the financial community to organize a syndicate to provide low-interest loans, and request the Central Reserve Bank to approve half of it for discounting, using the purchase of goods as collateral, and the district office should bear the responsibility of guaranteeing repayment.

Requests should be made to the control agency to regularly allocate various daily necessities and should be given the convenience of procurement.

In addition, we also have a request to the Municipal Standing Committee. Since the implementation of the special consumption tax and the rising prices, the city's financial revenue has naturally increased a lot. What exactly is the total amount of the current municipal financial revenue? How is it being used? All taxpayers have the responsibility and obligation to understand. We advocate that finances should be absolutely open, and the use should be reviewed by taxpayer representatives. The establishment of a public opinion organization is not something that can be done immediately, but at least the municipal authorities should invite people from all walks of life and municipal experts to first organize a municipal financial expenditure review committee to deal with this issue. Perhaps some unnecessary expenses can be saved to help further improve the treatment of the police. This is the fundamental way to improve the service spirit of the police and rectify police discipline.

### Detailed Measures for Temporary Cloth Rationing Announced: Cloth Purchase Certificates to be Distributed Regionally Starting April 10th

The National General Chamber of Commerce held a reception for the press at the International Hotel yesterday (the 25th) at 3:00 PM. More than 20 reporters from Chinese and Japanese newspapers attended. Chairman Tang of the Chamber of Commerce, on behalf of Yu Langxi, reported on the Chamber's recent preparations for temporary cotton cloth rationing, strengthening the unified cotton control mechanism, ending the purchase of yarn and cloth, and preparing for the members' representative meeting. At the same time, reporters inquired in detail about the permanent yarn and cloth rationing plan and the problem of preventing malpractices by retailers receiving cotton cloth, which the Chamber of Commerce answered one by one. The details are as follows:

### Handling Temporary Cloth Rationing

It has been six months since the Chamber of Commerce was ordered to purchase yarn and cloth in the Shanghai area. The cotton cloth market in the city has been stagnant for a long time. The Chamber of Commerce is aware that the general public's need for cotton cloth is quite urgent, and has decided on a method of centralized allocation of cotton products. Before the implementation, the Chamber of Commerce will first handle a temporary rationing of cotton cloth in the city. The outside world has very high expectations for this temporary cotton cloth distribution work, and the Chamber of Commerce is also making its greatest efforts for this matter. I will now explain the relevant matters separately below, so that everyone can be informed.

### Things to Know Before Buying Cloth

The Shanghai Special Municipality will distribute "Cloth Purchase Certificates" printed by the Chamber of Commerce to the citizens within the control line according to the total population, one certificate per person. Each cloth purchase certificate is marked with the number of a cotton cloth retailer. The certificate holder must buy from the designated merchant. Each certificate is limited to buying one zhang five chi (approximately 5 meters) of cotton cloth. The type and color can be chosen from the various cotton cloths distributed and sold by the retailer. The prices of various cotton cloths sold by retailers will be determined and announced by the Chamber of Commerce in accordance with the standard price approved by the Executive Yuan. Citizens should surrender the "Cloth Purchase Certificate" when buying cotton cloth, which will be collected and canceled by the merchant, and should obtain an invoice, which they must carry with them for passage. The "Cloth Purchase Certificate" is valid for six months from the date of issue. The "Cloth Purchase Certificate" must not be damaged or altered. If lost, it will not be reissued.

### Cotton Cloth Prices

Calculated at double the original purchase price, plus a wholesale profit of 10% and a retail profit of 20%. For example, the original purchase price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth is 3.75 yuan per chi. Doubling it is 7.5 yuan, plus a wholesale and retail profit of 30%, it costs 9.75 yuan per chi. At that time, a detailed price list of various fabrics will be widely announced so that everyone knows.

### Retail Store Numbers

There are more than 700 cotton cloth retailers in the city. The Cloth Store Guild divides them into four grades: A, B, C, and D, according to the merchant's usual business volume. Each A-grade merchant can receive more than 6,000 cloth purchase certificates. Each B-grade merchant can receive 4,000 cloth purchase certificates. Each C-grade merchant can receive 2,000 cloth purchase certificates. Several D-grade merchants can jointly receive 2,000 cloth purchase certificates. The numbers of the retailers are arranged in order by route. In addition to the Cloth Store Guild preparing retail store number signs and distributing them to the retailers to be posted in conspicuous places on the facade, a list of retail store numbers, names, and addresses will be compiled and distributed and announced once printed.

### Cloth Purchase Certificates

The cloth purchase certificates for this temporary cotton cloth rationing are modeled after the rice purchase certificates and are currently being printed urgently. After printing, they will first be sent to the retailers who are to receive the distribution to be numbered and stamped, and then sent to the Chamber of Commerce for collection and then transferred to the Municipal Government for distribution in accordance with the rice ticket method. It is expected that they will be distributed regionally starting next month on the 10th. However, in order to prevent malpractices, it must be solemnly stated. The cotton cloth for this temporary distribution is the loose cloth currently stored in each retailer. Not only are there many varieties, but also in order to ensure that every citizen can receive satisfactory cloth, the Chamber of Commerce stipulates that retailers should display samples of the distributed cloth for selection, but only while supplies last.

### Permanent Cotton Cloth Rationing Problem

Finally, a reporter asked: Regarding the permanent cotton yarn and cloth rationing problem, it is said that: The Chamber of Commerce is giving it serious consideration according to Article 12 of the centralized allocation method of cotton products approved by the Executive Yuan. In the future, the Cotton Control Committee will be responsible for handling it, because its allocation task is complicated, it must be implemented after proper planning, so that malpractices will not occur during implementation. Then they discussed and studied how to prevent the retail merchants who receive the temporary distribution of cotton cloth from selling cotton cloth fraudulently. It is planned to note the color and date of the cloth on the back of the purchase certificate after each citizen has purchased the cotton cloth from the designated retailer, so that the Chamber of Commerce can verify it.

### First Wooden Boat in Central China Launched

Currently, Japan and various places in the South are rushing to build wooden boats in large quantities to enhance maritime transportation capacity. Central China is also responding to this initiative and actively building wooden boats. The first boat has been completed and a launching ceremony was held yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM. This is a standard ××-ton wooden boat, named ×× Maru. It will soon be deployed on the front line at sea. The second and third boats are also scheduled to be completed and launched within days. The construction of this wooden boat, from the laying of the keel to various finishing works, was entirely done by Chinese laborers.

### Youth League Sells Air Raid Lampshades for Charity

The New Life Movement Association of this city, based on its position of assisting air defense social services, has specially collaborated with the Air Defense Headquarters to produce two types of paper air raid lampshades, which are inexpensive and convenient to use, and will not affect work during peacetime. The Mayor has approved that starting from the Capital Relocation Anniversary Day (the 30th of this month), the Association will mobilize young people to hold charity sales and conduct air defense propaganda, so as to arouse public awareness of participation in the war. There are two types of styles, A and B. The charity price of each A-type is 23 yuan, and the price of each B-type is 18 yuan. The prices are printed on the lampshades. Letters have been sent to relevant agencies for assistance.

### One District's Residence Permits: Exchange Measures Set: Citizens Must Absolutely Comply

The Baojia Section of the First Police Bureau has decided to start exchanging the residence permits of citizens in the district starting from April 1st, and in order to streamline the procedures, it has repeatedly studied the exchange methods to make them perfect. Special instructions for citizens in the First District to exchange residence permits are hereby formulated. We hope that citizens will work together and absolutely comply with the measures promulgated by the authorities and handle them within the specified time, so as to avoid trouble for both parties. In addition, each Baojia chief in the district must understand the measures promulgated by the authorities during the period of residence permit exchange, and contact the Baojia section of the relevant sub-bureau at any time to provide detailed instructions to the citizens, and must not be hypercritical or deliberately make things difficult. In addition, in order to cooperate closely with the public, Mayor Chen, in his capacity as concurrent Chief of the First Police Bureau, has scheduled a grand tea party to be held this Monday at the Kang Le Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road to entertain relevant bureau chiefs, dignitaries, and all levels of Baojia committee members above the rank of Lian Bao Chang. In addition, the various laws and regulations regarding Baojia formulated by the authorities will be announced soon.

### At a Grand Farewell Party Minister Tajiri Gives a Speech Japan Determined to Cooperate in Building a New Shanghai

Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association, Federation of Industry and Commerce, China National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association, News Federation and other four organizations are giving a grand farewell tea party at 4 pm yesterday (25th) at the Xingya Building on the Bund Industrial and Commercial Federation Hall because Minister Tajiri of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy in China has been in office for more than a year and has made great contributions to the promotion of cooperation between China and Japan and the implementation of Japan's new policy towards China. People from all walks of life in Shanghai and Japan actively participated in the event. The details are as follows:

### List of Attendees

The guests of honor included Minister Tajiri, Matsudaira, Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, Secretary Nakata, Vice Consul Fukuma, Akahoshi, representative of the Japanese Army, Sakazume, representative of the Fleet News Department, Kawasaki of the Domei News Agency, Wen Guanting, Chairman of the Civil Welfare Association, Funatsu, Chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association, and Yuan Shu, the Chairman of the News Federation. The allies included President Takashima. Aoki Section. Osaka and City. Washio Isoichi. Ichihashi Hikoji. Hidaka Qingmosasa, etc., from the Chinese side included Zhao Jinqing. Ren Xiaoshan. Wang Haibo. Chen Shaoai. Chen Riping. Xu Xiaochu. Gu Nanqun. Xiang Kangyuan. Shen Siliang. Xu Guanqun. Jin Zongcheng. Zhou Mengbai. Lei Xianzhe. Song Zhuozai. Liu Yunfang. Chen Binhe. Yan Jiabao. Cheng Zhongquan. Zong Jingze. Jiang Xiaoguang. Lu Feng. Ren Yunpeng, not less than a hundred people. After all the guests were seated, Chairman Wen Lanshi gave a speech on behalf of the chairman, followed by a thank-you speech by Minister Tajiri. Finally, a speech was given by Tatsichiro Funatsu, chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. The mood was enthusiastic, and the tea party lasted for two hours before everyone dispersed happily.

### Chairman's Speech

Chairman Wen Guanting's speech is as follows: Your Excellency Minister Tajiri, Distinguished Guests, Today, the Civil Welfare Association, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the News Federation, and the China National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association are holding a grand tea party to bid farewell to Minister Tajiri, who is being promoted to an important position. I am honored to deliver a speech on behalf of everyone.

Minister Tajiri has been in China for more than a year and has achieved remarkable political achievements. He has devoted much effort to the Greater East Asia Construction and the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations, especially in various aspects of Shanghai, and has always been respected by all walks of life. He has provided much practical assistance to the establishment and development of our associations, which is unforgettable for our colleagues. Now that Minister Tajiri is about to leave Shanghai, we sincerely hope that Minister Tajiri will not forget us even when he is far away, and will continue to guide us with his past enthusiasm. I believe that Minister Tajiri will definitely agree to this.

Finally, I wish Minister Tajiri good health and look forward to your continued guidance as a farewell message.

### Tajiri's Speech

I am very happy to be invited to this grand event today, and I am also grateful for the Chairman's presentation. I have been in office for more than a year. During this period, the Greater East Asia War has become increasingly fierce. Regarding the outcome of the war in the Pacific, some of you may have doubts. However, I believe that the gains and losses of islands in the Pacific will not have a decisive impact on the overall war situation. The defenses of the Japanese military in the Pacific are very thorough and solid. In the near future, you will all receive very pleasant news.

Secondly, on the mainland front, the Indian National Army has risen up to cooperate with the Japanese army and has crossed the Sino-Indian border and entered its homeland. This is very exciting news. The liberation of India is also the liberation of Greater East Asia. I believe that the 300 million people of India will unite to fight for the liberation of their homeland, achieve independence, and from this, the liberation of all East Asian nations can be achieved at the same time.

The Greater East Asia War, from the standpoint of Shanghai, is a war to liberate Shanghai and a war to build a new Shanghai. The cooperation that Japan gives to Shanghai is to build a new Shanghai, not to replace the British and Americans. Since the return of the concessions, the highest institutions established by the British and Americans in the past, such as the board of directors, have been abolished. This proves that Japan is cooperating in building a new Shanghai and is completely different from the British and American treatment of Shanghai.

From an economic point of view, Japan has used all its active forces to assist Shanghai's leading economic figures, such as the organization of the Commercial Control Association, and has done many things. From a cultural point of view, in the past year, it has promoted Chinese culture. In order to build a new Shanghai, a new China, and a new East Asia, its practical ideas are being promoted day by day.

In the past year, everyone has worked very hard to build a new Shanghai. Although I feel my strength is weak, I have asked myself to do my best to assist. Looking back at the achievements of the past year, although all parties have worked hard, I am still not satisfied. What is the reason? I think the main reason is the oppression of the war, the oppression of the Greater East Asia War. Although this will continue in the future, if you can continue to work hard, I believe that the construction of a new Shanghai will definitely be successful.

The oppression of the war is increasing and will become more intense in the future. This is a pessimistic factor. However, there are also optimistic factors that can dispel pessimistic factors. In recent months, we have seen three optimistic factors:

First, the political factor. Every country should have a clean government, and so should China. If it can be popularized throughout the country from top to bottom, it will definitely have good results. Without my explanation, you all understand that there has recently been a tendency for clean government in Chinese politics. This is the first optimistic factor.

Second, the economic factor. The Greater East Asia War has been going on for more than two years, and China has participated in the war for more than a year. Now is wartime, and the wartime economic situation is not completely free. Since it is wartime, it is not allowed to have no wartime emotions. Now people in China and Japan have gradually understood this meaning. This is the second optimistic factor.

Third, the implementation steps of Japan's new policy towards China. In the past, there were also inconsistencies on the Japanese side, especially regarding the concept of Japan's new policy towards China. The inability of China and Japan to agree on this was most regrettable. Now, whether it is in terms of concepts or implementation steps, they are gradually becoming consistent. This is the third optimistic factor.

If these three optimistic conditions can be utilized well and developed, then the construction of a new Shanghai and a new China will not be difficult.

Recalling President Sun's legacy, the revolution has not yet succeeded, and he earnestly advocated the abolition of unequal treaties, which is also an external revolution. Now that unequal treaties have been abolished, China's external revolution has been completed. However, the domestic revolution has not yet been completed. It is especially important that during this Greater East Asia War, the Chinese people bear the responsibility of building a greater Shanghai and a new China, which is a daunting task. Japan also hopes that you will complete this important mission under the leadership of the national government and work harder, and that the Japanese residents in China will also cooperate with China. Finally, I hope that the relationship between China and Japan will become closer and express my infinite gratitude for the grand invitation.

### Funatsu's Speech

Briefly stated: Although Minister Tajiri has been in office for more than a year, it is not a long time, but during this period, the East Asia Institute was abolished and the Greater East Asia Ministry was established. The minister happened to be the first minister to take office in Shanghai at this time. At the same time, Japan's new policy towards China also began to be implemented at this time. Therefore, during the minister's term of office, the responsibility was particularly difficult.

Economic Circles

### Trade Associations Assist in Suppressing Prices The Authorities Are Drafting Reward and Punishment Measures

The Shanghai Municipal Government believes that since the formal establishment of the various trade associations in the city, they have mostly been engaged in the struggle for rights, and have rarely cooperated in the implementation of the government's wartime economic policies, which is not appropriate. In order to promote the understanding of the mission that each trade association should bear and to effectively suppress prices, the government has, in accordance with the public, provisional regulations and the resolution of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's price suppression conference, ordered its affiliated Food and Economic Bureaus to negotiate and draft assistance measures for suppressing prices and rewards and punishments by a certain date. After receiving the order, the two bureaus are now actively working on consultations. Once a decision is made, it will be submitted to the municipal government for approval and implementation.

### China Industrial Association Established Yesterday

The China Industrial Association held its inaugural meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 25th) on the ninth floor of the Jinmen Hotel. In addition to the presence of Chen, Minister of Industry and Commerce, Jiang, Vice Minister, Zuo Xuan, and Mai Jingming, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, there were also Lin Kanghou, Wen Guanting, Yuan Ludeng, Zhang Deqin, Zhang Dasu, Ma Runfang, Zhou Mengbai, Le Fenglin, Shi Menglong, and others from the Chinese side. From the allied Japanese side, there were Lieutenant Colonel Kumagai, Director of the Shanghai Liaison Department, Aoki Section, Director of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and hundreds of others. First, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the Board, delivered an opening speech, followed by Ma Runfang's report on the preparations. Chen, Minister of Industry and Commerce, Jiang, Vice Minister Zuo Xuan, and Feng You, Director of the Economic Office of the First District Public Office, gave instructions one after another, encouraging them in many ways. Then, Kumagai, Director of the Allied Liaison Department, Aoki, Director of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the City Chamber of Commerce, and Zhou Mengbai, representing Tang, Director of the Commercial Control Association, delivered speeches one after another. The articles of association were then passed, and directors and supervisors were elected. A motion was temporarily moved to send a telegram of respect to the chairman, which was unanimously passed. Finally, Yuan Ludeng gave a closing speech before adjourning at around 5:00 PM.

### North-South Grocery Industry Requests Adjustment of Selling Prices

The Shanghai North-South Grocery Industry Association applied for price adjustments yesterday (the 25th). Representatives of the industry, Wang Buxin and Song Zhuozai, went to the First District Public Office to petition. That evening, they hosted members of the local press, and made a statement explaining the reasons for their application. Industry representatives Wang Buxin, Zhu Zhuozai, Yu Rupin, Li Jinzhang, Xu Boliang, and others attended. Their remarks were as follows: At a time when prices must be suppressed, our association has suddenly requested an adjustment of selling prices. At first glance, this may seem unusual, but in reality, our association has no choice but to do so. There are more than 500 North-South goods stores in Shanghai. They mainly rely on retail sales with small profits. The source of goods is wholesale from large households. The price of goods is determined by the large households, without invoices or proof. The retail prices were announced by the Economic Office of the First District last year in January and February, which are several times different from the current selling prices. If they are not sold according to the official prices, they will be punished everywhere. If they are not sold at a small profit on top of the wholesale price, there is no way to maintain their capital. This is the common pain of all retailers at present. As a last resort, we urge the competent authorities to re-adjust the selling prices and announce the prices that should be increased or decreased so that we can follow them. In the future, our industry will strictly implement the following two points: We will never purchase goods from non-industry members, strictly implement self-discipline, and put an end to hoarding goods by industry members. We will do our best to understand the authorities' intention to suppress prices. We would rather be responsible for a shortage of goods in the market than sell goods at prices exceeding the official prices.

### East Asian League Plan Problems after the Greater East Asia War

— Jiang Kanghu

After the First World War, US President Wilson proposed the League of Nations plan. Was his intention not also good? Unfortunately, it only had principles and no provisions, only an abstract outline and no concrete measures. Even more unfortunately, it was not fully prepared after extensive discussion. As a result, when the war ended, this great term was exploited by ambitious British and French figures. Although the organization was subsequently realized, it was exclusively controlled by the victors, equivalent to an instrument of imperialism for partitioning weak nations. It could be predicted from the beginning that it would be nominal and end without substance.

Now, the year of final decision is approaching for the Second World War. Although no one can determine when it will end or how it will end, the war must end eventually. It is difficult to guarantee that it will not end unexpectedly, quickly, and suddenly. Leaving the European situation aside for the moment, regarding the aftermath of East Asia, although there has been propaganda about the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and the new order and the East Asian League, no practical plan has been proposed to date. Some say that it is too early to talk about it today. Little do they know that the occurrence of the Second World War was precisely due to the inappropriate disposal of the aftermath of the Tenth World War. The inappropriate disposal of the aftermath of the First World War was due to the lack of extensive discussion and full preparation for the League of Nations before the war ended. Therefore, learning from the mistakes of the past, shouldn’t we first deploy and plan the structure of the East Asian League? If the war ends one day and we are caught unprepared, mistakes made in haste will leave endless worries. How can we not be afraid?

The name East Asian League is righteous and grand, and its purpose is simple. Its four principles, namely political independence, military alliance, economic cooperation, and cultural communication, are also comprehensive and meticulous, encompassing everything. What urgently needs discussion now is the form and method of the organization. I have previously provided many opinions and criticisms on the League of Nations. Now, I intend to refer to old drafts and draft a new plan separately. I will first publish a few key points as the beginning of the East Asian League plan and as a prerequisite for the aftermath of the Greater East Asia War.

The East Asian League (hereinafter referred to as the League) is jointly organized by the existing countries in East Asia as units.

The countries in the League, such as China, Japan, Manchuria, Thailand, India, Burma, and the Philippines, are independent states. Malaya, Java, Sumatra, Celebes, Borneo, and New Guinea are autonomous territories. Tibet, Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Vietnam are still subject to adjustment. All their political systems will remain the same, but those who voluntarily reform will be allowed to do so.

Special ethnic groups in the League countries should be recognized for their right to self-government.

The League should designate a region in the central zone to organize and establish itself as permanently neutral.

The League should be divided into two chambers, the upper chamber representing countries and ethnic groups, with each country or ethnic group represented by one person. The lower chamber represents the population, with approximately one representative elected for every ten million people. The ten hundred million people of East Asia should have approximately one hundred representatives, with the ratio determined by the size of each ethnic group's population.

In addition to deliberating on political affairs, the upper chamber should also establish an administrative committee, which is organized by mutual election of the upper chamber representatives. The speaker of the upper chamber also serves as the chairman of the administrative committee. In addition to deliberating on political affairs, the lower chamber should also establish a judicial committee, which is organized by mutual election of the lower chamber representatives. The speaker of the lower chamber also serves as the chairman of the judicial committee.

Each of the two chambers should form international military police agencies for common defense and security and for the forceful execution of judgments, and be directly under the command of the League.

Representatives of both chambers should maintain their original nationalities, but the personnel of the administrative and judicial committees and the international military police agencies must renounce their original nationalities and adopt the neutral nationality of the League.

The League designates Chinese, Japanese, and Indian as the common languages and scripts. All documents must be listed in all three, and all speeches must be translated into all three.

The League specially manufactures a common currency and stipulates the exchange rates of each country's currency.

Postal services, telecommunications, travel permits, tariffs, etc. between the countries of the League must be unified.

The League is open year-round, and its representatives are re-appointed once every three years. The upper chamber representatives are appointed by the governments of each country and the leaders of each ethnic group, and the lower chamber representatives are freely and publicly elected by each ethnic group. The speakers of both chambers each serve a term of one year and may be re-elected, with a limit of three years.

Sky and Sea Wide (2)

In any case, the biggest festive day in the life at Etajima. One could say it was this day. Amidst the incessant playing of music by the military band, that grand dining hall was opened. That vast student dining hall still couldn't accommodate so many people. School officials and the fathers and brothers of graduates all participated in the banquet. But not a single person related to [Commander] Makoto came.

"Cadet Tani, you can have a drink today!"

"Ah, thank you very much."

Makoto reached his chopsticks into the dishes of red rice and grilled copper bream, joyfully picking up his sake cup. During their studies, drinking was strictly forbidden in the student hall, but only at the graduation ceremony were sake and beer allowed. However, the taste of the sake reaching his lips was not as delicious as that of a forbidden fruit.

"Instructor S, thank you for your guidance."

Instructor S, who had given him guidance from the beginning, was the one Makoto most respected.

The dining hall was filled with cheers and was very lively, but there was always a hint of haste. The graduates did not have the luxury of returning home or quietly awaiting employment. After this celebratory banquet, they would board training ships and sail out to the vast ocean. The warships Yakumo and Iwate were waiting for them in the Inland Sea near Etajima. Graduation and service were held on the same day, with no room for delay. This was also a subtle aspect of the Navy's arrangements.

After leaving the dining hall, Makoto bid farewell to all the instructors, starting with the school principal, as well as Mrs. S, the hostess of the club.

"Congratulations, Tani-kun, — this is just a small token, —" Mrs. S said, handing him a colored piece of paper.

"Well then, I wish you good health."

"Good health — don't forget to write."

Saying goodbye to the lowerclassmen was the hardest.

The training ship's launch had already arrived at the pier, and the students were loading their belongings onto it. The cadets, holding their white-gloved hands, saluted and continued to board the ship. Handshakes at departure, cheers, farewells.

Makoto was assigned to board the Iwate warship. Immediately after boarding, the "Prepare to Depart" trumpet sounded. The ship was also weighing anchor.

Today's handshake and conversation,

Tomorrow, separated by waters and clouds, —

The farewell song was sung from the departing launch. It was the tune of "Auld Lang Syne." The cadets lined up on the ship's railing, half-dreaming, half-awake, saluting. Soon, the women wiping their tears with handkerchiefs could also be seen. The launch that had brought them to the school near the Tsukumo coast performed a "salute," conducting a final farewell, —.

### New Public Charity Hall Receives Further Donation of Two Million Yuan; Good Samaritan Volunteers to Donate Half

Last spring, this newspaper reported to the public about the difficult and pressing situation of the New Public Charity Hall. At that time, thanks to the enthusiastic donations from all sectors of society, hundreds of thousands of yuan were collected, which made it possible to maintain life. Recently, rice prices have risen sharply. This newspaper was informed yesterday by Mr. Lu Yinggeng that the newspaper has already raised three million [yuan], which is somewhat comforting, but there is still a shortfall of two million [yuan]. Moreover, a Good Samaritan has volunteered to donate half of the amount, to encourage the readers of this newspaper. According to the matron of the hall, the rice ration has not been received since August of last year. The entire hall requires five dan of grain per day, and sixty dan of rice per month. At the current price, this will amount to 300,000 [yuan], at least 500,000 yuan per month. By June, three [months'] worth will be needed. According to this budget, storing half a year's worth of food will be necessary to safely get through the provision of food for 900 people. Today, the hall is open for visits. The address is on Guohuo Road in the South City, and there are departments for infants, orphans, the disabled, and the elderly, which will be introduced in succession. Starting today, the business department of this newspaper will collect donations on behalf of the hall.

### Accumulation of Garbage on J'An Road

— Ji Ren

The accumulation of garbage in Yongyu Lane on the former Rue Chapsal, now J'An Road, is causing a foul and unbearable stench. The tenants have already written to the Health Bureau and the landlord, Xie Jinji, to find a way to clear it, but it has been many days, and the trend is that the entire lane will be filled and increase day by day. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this to emphasize hygiene.

◎ Lecture: At 3:00 PM today, the Foguang Sanatorium, located at 123 Route Massenet, will invite Mr. Sun Deyu, a expert in national studies, to give a lecture on "Fundamentals of National Studies." All are welcome to attend.
