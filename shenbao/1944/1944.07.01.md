### After the Reorganization of the Commercial Control Association

The National Commercial Control Association has reorganized its structure and personnel. The new chairman, Mr. Wen Lanting, and all directors and supervisors will officially assume their positions today. According to reports, the new and former directors and supervisors of the association held a joint provisional meeting the day before yesterday and mutually elected Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Sun Zhongli, Chen Ziyi, and Luo Naqi as executive directors. Lin Kanghou was also appointed as Secretary-General of the Association. In effect, the executive directors of the Commercial Control Association are also the executive directors of the various control committees for rice, cotton, flour and wheat, oil, and daily necessities. In other words, the executive directors of the Commercial Control Association are the highest responsible persons of the various control committees and the actual responsible persons of the Association. This personnel arrangement objectively aligns with the ideal of unified authority.

The Commercial Control Association was established on March 15th of last year. In our editorial on April 14th of last year, on the occasion of the Association's one-month anniversary, we made six expectations for the Association, especially emphasizing the four words "integrity and honesty." We said, "In today's degenerate world, people mistakenly believe that 'control' is a 'way to make money.' This is of course the petty mentality of the general public, but precisely because of this, those in charge should be extra careful, prudent in recruitment, and strict in investigation to set an example. Those who have used control opportunities for personal gain in the past must not be allowed to set foot in the organization to maintain the advantages of refreshing personnel."

This time, the government decided to reorganize the structure, and we also raised four points of hope in our editorial on June 16th. We said, "Personnel issues are the most important issue in any organization. The reason why the various control agencies in the past could not avoid social criticism is largely due to personnel problems. Therefore, the various control agencies should pay special attention to integrity in addition to talent in the future when employing people... We sincerely hope that the industrial and commercial circles will recognize that the current wartime situation is by no means comparable to peacetime. Those who have previously prioritized their own interests should abandon them immediately, and 'reducing self-interest and serving the public' should be the spirit adopted jointly by the authorities and all industries in the future."

We believe that the two paragraphs quoted above are still worth the attention of the General Commercial Association in the future. Today, we again offer the four words "serving the public and abiding by the law" to the Commercial Control Association and its affiliated responsible authorities and all staff. The most unreasonable habit of Chinese people is to only care about private interests and not public interests, to only seek private gain and not abide by the law, and to favor personal connections over legal principles. The lack of law enforcers has led to a lack of law abiders, which has become a widespread phenomenon. Especially in wartime, the general environment is special, and those who violate public interests and the law achieve windfall profits, while those who serve the public and abide by the law lead a difficult life. Therefore, the former regards the latter as being unpromising and useless, and gradually the general social concept also considers illegal profiteering as talented and capable, thus blurring right and wrong. The main reason for the failure of control work in the past lies in this.

Although the Commercial Control Association will now be a comprehensive supervisory and guiding agency, and the various control committees will handle the implementation of control work, the working pace of the various control committees should naturally tend to be consistent, and the personnel selection should naturally tend to be sound. If there is any impropriety, the Commercial Control Association has the absolute responsibility to correct it at any time. As for the current important issues: (1) The cotton cloth purchase work should be concluded as soon as possible, and a special cotton industry management office management committee should be established to be responsible for it. The temporary allocation is chaotic and complex and should be adjusted as soon as possible. (2) The reorganization of the rice control association's structure and personnel adjustment should be realized as soon as possible, especially before the autumn harvest of rice, all methods and procedures for procurement should be reasonably determined and properly arranged as soon as possible. The methods and regulations announced by the Rice Control Association in the past were generally felt to be inconsistent with the actual environment and unreasonable, thus often leading to adverse consequences. (3) Control work values ​​agility in handling affairs and must first take into account the importance of the wartime economy in order to enhance combat effectiveness. Secondly, for legitimate requests, treat everyone equally, regardless of whether they are known or unknown, and handle them quickly in accordance with the prescribed procedures and formalities, and show sympathy for the difficulties of merchants. Moreover, the Commercial Control Association is an organization with the spirit of merchant autonomy and is by no means a bureaucratic organization. It should especially eliminate the sluggish bureaucratic habits. On the day of the inauguration of the new personnel of the Commercial Control Association, we briefly presented our views on the principles as a humble offering.

### Japanese Planes Raid Saipan Island at Night, Bombing Enemy Remnant Troops; Enemy Cruisers Heavily Damaged in the Mariana Sea

On the same day, the Associated Press Pearl Harbor reported that the resistance of the Japanese garrison on Saipan Island was still fierce, and the advance of the American troops was stopped on the 28th. The San Francisco radio station also broadcast that the battle of Saipan was one of the fierce battles in the Pacific, all acknowledging that the American troops were fighting hard. The Associated Press reported that the US Marines and infantry troops arriving in southern Saipan were divided into four groups due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese troops and were fighting hard.

### The Third War Area Launches an Offensive, Japanese Elite Occupies Quzhou

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 30th that Japanese troops in the Shanghai area, in response to the Hunan operation, launched an offensive against the Third War Area troops of Chongqing on the 10th of this month, and captured Quzhou, an important stronghold of the Chongqing troops in that area, on the 26th, and are continuing to fight fiercely. The main results achieved since the start of this operation until the 26th are as follows: 3,591 enemy bodies were recovered, 589 prisoners were captured, and 24 artillery pieces and approximately 900 firearms were seized.

Central News Agency, Japanese Military Base on the Zhejiang Front Line, 30th - Japanese aircraft, in order to cover the Japanese ground troops, advanced westward along the old Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Line, hoping to destroy the Chongqing troops in that area, and are constantly actively engaged on the Zhejiang Front Line. On the 24th, they launched a sudden attack on Quzhou, a strategic location of the Chongqing troops in Zhejiang Province, and heavily bombed the Chongqing troops' positions and military facilities, inflicting heavy losses on the Chongqing troops. Another unit of the Japanese army discovered approximately 1,000 Chongqing troops crossing the Qujiang River northwest of Quzhou to rescue Quzhou. Japanese aircraft strafed them with machine guns, causing the corpses of Chongqing troops to be scattered on the Lijiang River (a tributary of the Qujiang River), creating a chaotic situation. The Japanese aircraft safely returned to their original defense after completing their mission.

Central News Agency, Japanese Military Base on the Front Line, 30th - The Chongqing military stronghold of Quzhou City in western Zhejiang Province was captured by the Japanese army on the morning of the 26th. Elite Japanese troops, which were advancing along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Line, in order to destroy the enemy troops in the Third War Area, broke through the encirclement formation of the Third War Area under Gu Shitong's command on the Quzhou Plain on the 23rd and launched annihilation battles everywhere. The main force of the Japanese army, under the environment of being attacked from the front and rear, launched an attack operation on Quzhou City with strategically rare tactics. Each unit aimed for the dawn of the 20th and rushed to the southeast corner and east gate of the enemy city. In addition, the Japanese Air Force also coordinated with the elite troops on the ground and launched fierce bombing. At 5:00 AM, they broke into the south gate from the southeast corner of the city and immediately launched a street battle, forcing the enemy to retreat to the northwest corner of the city, and then completely annihilated them. At 7:00 AM, the entire city was occupied. Currently, the Japanese army is carrying out mopping-up operations in the vicinity of the city to expand the results of the battle.

Central News Agency, Japanese Military Base on the Front Line, 30th - Quzhou has fallen. The following is a description of the process of its fall: The main force of the Chongqing army and a part of the 145th Division were in Quzhou County. On the 21st of this month, the 49th Army was stationed there, and enemy aircraft harassed the rear of the Japanese army. In addition to the field army, the Japanese army also used a part of its powerful troops to attack Quzhou from the north and south. On the 19th, they secretly advanced and arrived near the county seat. After launching a fierce battle on the front of Quzhou, the Chongqing army mistakenly believed that it had surrounded the Japanese army and did not realize the Japanese ambush. After the Japanese army defeated most of the Chongqing army, it used a part of its troops to monitor the enemy southwest of Quzhou and urgently mobilized its main force to move to the front of Quzhou. From the 25th to the 26th, they took advantage of the enemy's weakness and launched a surprise attack. At this time, the morale of the Chongqing army was quite strong, and the military ships in the river west of the city were moved to the opposite bank, forming a defensive formation with their backs to the river. However, contact within the city was cut off, and they were not even aware of the whereabouts of the main force of the Japanese army. On the 25th, Japanese aircraft scattered surrender leaflets over the city, and the Chongqing army mistakenly believed that the Japanese offensive power had weakened. Under these circumstances, the Japanese army advanced to the outside of the city under the cover of darkness and launched a simultaneous attack when it was barely light. The air force also dropped bombs from the air to assist the ground troops, completely annihilating more than 2,000 Chongqing troops. The capture of Quzhou this time can be said to be a surprise annihilation battle.

### Fierce Fighting in the Suburbs of Hengyang

Another unit of the Japanese army advanced south on the west bank of the Xiangjiang River and also surrounded Hengyang City, opposite the Hengyang Airport, from the north, west, and south. The main force of the Chongqing Reserve 10th Division and the 196th Division in the city relied on their bunkers and hidden gun emplacements to put up a stubborn resistance. Therefore, fierce fighting is currently underway in that area.

According to reports, after the Japanese army occupied Hengshan on the Xiang-Gan Railway Line, they divided their forces into several teams and went south, attempting to jointly attack Hengyang. The Chongqing army intercepted them at a location 20 kilometers northwest of Hengyang. Although Hengyang City has become the center of the war, the city is still as calm as ever. According to the Associated Press Chongqing correspondent, the Chongqing military authorities said that the Japanese army's attempt to encircle Hengyang from the east may be to cut off the Yuehan Railway Line on the direct side of Hengyang. The Japanese army is now advancing to Ren'an.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 30th - According to the Associated Press correspondent in Chongqing, the situation in Hunan is as follows: The Chongqing military authorities announced that a unit of the Japanese army has occupied the eastern suburbs of Hengyang City, three kilometers away, and other Japanese army units are pressing hard from the north and northwest and have now arrived at a location eight kilometers away from Hengyang.

The Japanese army in the west is cutting off the Xiang-Gui Railway (between Hengyang and Guilin) at Xitang, 20 kilometers away from Hengyang. The Japanese troops advancing to Sitang are attacking other locations on the Xiang-Gui Railway Line from Xiangxiang.

### People's Hearts Wavering in Guilin and Other Places

Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 30th - As the Southwest War situation is gradually unfolding, the turmoil in the southwest region of Chongqing is also intensifying as a result. According to an Associated Press report from Chongqing, Guilin, the capital of Guangxi Province, has felt the threat of a Japanese offensive. Banks have closed one after another, and pawnshops have fled to the interior one after another. The wavering of the people's hearts has fallen into an unmanageable state. Li Jishen, director of the Guilin Office of the Chongqing Military Commission, even broadcast that the six southwestern provinces are the most densely populated and fertile areas in the country. A quarter of China's 400 million people live here. The leaders of China's modern revolution were all born here. The essence of the Chinese nation is concentrated here. The people of the abundant six provinces should not flee, but stay here. Those who evade danger are criminals who destroy the people's awareness of resistance.

### Chongqing Troops in Shaoguan Attempt to Breach the Beijiang River

Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 30th - After the Japanese troops in Hunan attacked Changsha, they continued to advance south and recently captured the Hengyang Airport and surrounded Hengyang City, causing the Chongqing troops to be extremely embarrassed. The Chongqing military authorities in Shaoguan are also trembling with fear and spreading rumors, expanding the use of the flood season to breach the Beijiang River dam, attempting to hinder the development of the peaceful area. It was found that during the Hunan operation five years ago, the Chongqing army once breached the Yellow River levee in an attempt to hinder the Japanese army's actions, but the result had no effect on the Japanese army's operations. The sufferers were the people in the vicinity, and now the Chongqing army is attempting to breach the Beijiang River again, which will only put the people of Guangdong Province in misery.

Ambassador Stahmer also stated the current military and political situation in Germany. Japan and Germany, under this major international situation, have such opinions, which can express the determination of Japan and Germany to closely cooperate and complete the holy war. The meeting between the Prime Minister and the German Ambassador is scheduled to be held in the future.

### County Administrative Organization Reform Plan Approved by the Supreme National Defense Council

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th - In order to further adapt to the decisive battle system and strengthen administrative efficiency, the authorities have repeatedly reformed the centralization of power and the simplification of institutions in local administration, which has been quite effective in strengthening administrative efficiency.

(E) The county government should formulate central work, based on the four standards of time, manpower, and financial resources, which should be formulated by the county and approved by the province for effective implementation. The provincial government should take this as the county magistrate's performance evaluation.

(2) Improving the Status and Treatment of County Magistrates and County Assistants, (A) The county magistrate should be a senior or recommended appointment, and the county government secretary, bureau chief, department chief, and district chief should be a recommended appointment or delegated appointment.

(D) The provincial government must not extract county funds for provincial use, nor may it designate certain income for special purposes. (E) The administrative expenses of the county government shall be paid by the provincial treasury. (F) The administrative expenses of the district, township, and town shall be paid by the county in a unified manner. (G) Township and town temporary fees and professional fees should be independently allocated with the township and town as a unit to cope with them, and detailed methods will be determined separately.

### Third Anniversary of the Rural Pacification Campaign: Premier of the Executive Yuan's Letter to Comrades: Cooperate to Strive for the Permanent Security of Greater East Asia

Central News Agency Report: For the third anniversary of the Rural Pacification Campaign, the Premier of the Executive Yuan respectfully addressed a letter to the comrades in the Rural Pacification work and compatriots from all walks of life, saying:

The Rural Pacification work began in July of the 30th year, and was presided over by the Rural Pacification Committee established by the National Government. In May of last year, the central government decided to dissolve the Rural Pacification Committee and transfer its powers to the Executive Yuan, thereby simplifying the organization and making progress more active. In the past three years, witnessing the unremitting struggle of the comrades in the Rural Pacification work and the unity of the compatriots from all walks of life in the Rural Pacification areas, the entire Rural Pacification plan has been implemented step by step, which is truly admirable, and the various cooperation from the allied countries has made the Rural Pacification work progress smoothly, which is deeply appreciated. Taking advantage of this anniversary of the Rural Pacification Campaign, I would like to briefly state my thoughts to my comrades in the Rural Pacification work and the people from all walks of life:

First, we should seek unlimited development with a non-complacent attitude. Complacency is the evil cause of failure. The main purposes of the Rural Pacification work are: first, to correct ideology; second, to eliminate bandits and communists; third, to ensure social order; and fourth, to increase production. Although this kind of work has been successful in the past three years, it is not allowed to be complacent. Correcting ideology focuses on depth; eliminating bandits and communists focuses on thoroughness; ensuring social order focuses on strength; and increasing production focuses on density. How to eradicate feudal consciousness and Anglo-American thoughts; how to prevent the recurrence of bandits coming and going after bandits are eliminated; how to enable the people in various places to have the ability to self-govern and self-defend; how to enable compatriots to live and work in peace, and rural areas to have abundant harvests; the smooth exchange of materials between urban and rural areas; there are many things that need to be worked hard on in the future, and we can only move forward if we want to seek unlimited development in the future.

### Never Compromise

Second, we should fight against evil and corrupt forces with a non-compromising spirit. Compromise is a poisonous vegetable that hinders the revolution. The Chongqing puppet bandits and communists, who are harming the country and the people, must be thoroughly eliminated, which goes without saying. In addition, bad troops, unworthy officials, and illegal merchants, who only extort and exploit, engage in fraud for personal gain, and hoard and speculate, using the blood and sweat of agricultural and industrial producers to fatten their pockets, are all thieves who harm the people's livelihood. They are also the enemies of the Rural Pacification work comrades and the people from all walks of life. They must be crushed and eliminated, and there must be no compromise. If they are allowed to be a scourge, it will only lead to regret in the future. If this is the case, then even if the evil and corrupt forces have many tricks and tricks, they will eventually be defeated and destroyed.

### Unceasing Effort

Third, we must have the determination not to be discouraged and make unceasing efforts. Self-discouragement is a bad habit of defeatists. The pacification campaign is not only limited to weaving security in one province or one county, but also bears the mission of a new era. What is the mission of the new era? It is to revive China and defend East Asia. Since the mission is so important, the arduousness of the task is self-evident. However, if we can grasp the correct path and make unremitting efforts to overcome the obstacles on the way, then everything in the course and environment will not be obstacles to us. The significance of the pacification campaign lies in guaranteeing peace and expanding peace. It aims to eradicate Anglo-American opium and restore China and East Asia. From a domestic perspective, it is to revive China and lay an unshakable foundation. From a foreign perspective, it is to cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War and achieve permanent security in East Asia. Therefore, every achievement of the pacification campaign brings the mission of the new era one step closer to completion. Our responsibility lies in seeking gradual progress through persistent efforts. If we can make efforts, we will surely make progress. If there is progress, there will be achievements. Everything else is not worth considering. As the fourth year of the pacification campaign begins, it is a new and decisive stage in the Greater East Asia War and even the world war. As fierce battles unfold and victory is in sight, this is the most difficult time. Our survival and security depend on it. We must have the determination not to be discouraged and make unceasing efforts, so that the past efforts can be completed with the final and most difficult struggle. Saving China and protecting East Asia, this is the way.

The above three points have been stated many times before, but today they seem even more urgent. I do not hesitate to repeat them, and I hope we can encourage each other.

### Governor Su Chen Issues Statement

Central News Agency, Suzhou, 30th – July 1st is the third anniversary of the pacification campaign. This reporter recently visited Governor Chen to inquire about his thoughts. He kindly issued the following statement: "Regarding the importance of the pacification campaign, I would like to tell my fellow compatriots my personal thoughts: I recall that in the 30th year of the Republic [1941], the Pacification Committee of the National Government established a military office in Jiangsu. At that time, I was the Minister of War and Interior and was ordered to represent the central government in assisting with the supervision. Later, I also came to Jiangsu to inspect the party affairs work in the pacification zone. I deeply felt that before and after the pacification campaign, Jiangsu Province had made significant progress in people's livelihood and security. It was not only the efforts and dedication of the authorities, but also the guidance and assistance of the compatriots and the unity and support of the people that made it possible. Now, I am responsible for the political affairs, and all administrative matters are inevitably difficult, but it is also due to human effort. Now, I can only do my best, but it is still far from ideal. This is not only a matter of shame in my heart. The pacification campaign and provincial administration are even more integrated and inseparable. The Greater East Asia War has now entered a decisive stage, and the promotion of the pacification campaign brooks no delay. We are particularly inspired by the spirit of unity, hard work, and perseverance of the Allied nations in striving for victory. Today, we should be more proactive, strive harder, and complete the pacification mission to fulfill China's commitment to participate in the war, and faithfully follow Chairman Wang's instructions to share weal and woe, and live and die together with the Allied nations, to complete the revival of China and the construction of East Asia. All officials and people of Jiangsu Province should carry out their duties diligently in their respective positions. I offer these three points to encourage my fellow compatriots."

### Japanese Contributors to Savings Recognized by Government

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th – Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese national savings campaign has exceeded the huge sum of 100 billion yen by March of this year. To encourage savings, the Japanese government specifically announced the names of those recognized on the 29th. According to reports, the Japanese people's savings campaign began in the early Meiji era. Before the Sino-Japanese War, the total savings in the 70 years reached 44.6 billion yen. However, from the start of the war to March of this year, the period was only six years and nine months, about one-tenth of the former, but the increase in savings reached more than 100 billion yen, about twice as much as the former. This time, 35 groups and 25 individuals were recognized by the Prime Minister, 285 groups and 234 individuals were recognized by the Minister of Finance, and 1,095 groups and 904 individuals were recognized by the National Savings Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, totaling 2,578 cases.

### Enemy Forces Besiege Caen, Tank Battle Unfolds

Rommel Ordered to Transfer Reinforcements to the Front

Central News Agency, Supreme Headquarters of Marshal Montgomery, 30th – Reuters war correspondent Bo reports: The fierce tank battle between German and British forces southwest of Caen continued unabated yesterday. The British offensive against the city was halted by a German counterattack on the Caen-Viller Bocage line. However, the British are poised to attempt another attack on Caen from the southwest. According to informed sources, the German counterattack southwest of Caen was the most powerful operation by German tank forces. The British attempted to defend their narrow positions with the help of Avenger anti-tank guns. However, German Tiger and Panther tanks broke into the center of the British lines, destroying their defensive tank fortifications. In the past twelve hours, the Germans destroyed more than twenty British defensive tank fortifications. The British used Savoy cannons for the first time on the Caen front.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 30th – Reuters reports: General Rommel has transferred reinforcements to the Northern France theater in preparation for an emergency. The armored forces are commanded by General Heinrich Eberbach. Eberbach was formerly the military attaché at the German embassy in London. General Hans Speidel is also in the Northern France theater.

### Allied Ships Shell Cherbourg Harbor

Central News Agency, Berlin, 30th – A naval correspondent for the German News Agency reported that Allied landing craft entered Cherbourg harbor last night, but heavy warships were prevented from approaching by German artillery.

### German Predictions of New Landing Sites

Central News Agency, Berlin – Reuters reports: Major General Goettau, a military commentator for the Berliner Börsen-Zeitung, said that the Allied forces may use Sardinia and Corsica as bases for a second landing in the Mediterranean region. However, the mountainous west coast of Italy is not conducive to airborne troops, and a landing in northern Italy is more convenient. The German army is prepared. The Montpelier area in southern France is also suitable for landing.

### French Cabinet Holds Emergency Meeting in Paris

### Roundtable Discussion with Japanese Press Corps at Military Headquarters

Farmers Express Gratitude

Oshima: I departed from a certain place by plane on the 21st and passed over Yuezhou. Because the plane was flying very low, the ground conditions were clearly visible. I saw many Chinese people working with the Japanese army. I heard that they voluntarily came out to help the Japanese army. Now is the time when peaches and apricots are ripe in the Hunan area. Everywhere we passed, peaches and apricots were abundant. Local farmers picked these fruits and sent them to Japanese soldiers, so we are also grateful to the Chinese people. In the past, there were rumors that the Japanese army committed atrocities in the occupied areas, so this time, the North China Front issued the Three Nos policy, which is "No burning, no violation, no killing." This order was thoroughly conveyed to every soldier, so no matter where they are stationed, military discipline is strict and orderly. Therefore, after the fall of Zhengzhou, within four or five days, the number of returning residents reached two to three thousand every day, and now it has completely returned to its original state. The military vehicles used by the Japanese army also hire Chinese drivers, and their treatment is exactly the same as that of soldiers, without any distinction.

Nishijima: Since the Japanese army has so carefully considered the safety of the Chinese people and their property, its actions must be subject to considerable restrictions. Will this not affect the combat operations?

Umino: If there are fields or other agricultural products in the front where the unit is conducting operations, regardless of the disadvantages to the operation, it will detour elsewhere to avoid damaging the villages. The unit is willing to accept a 2% loss in combat effectiveness due to taking such detours, and will certainly work harder in combat to compensate for this 2% loss.

Nishijima: Has the message from the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in Henan, the "Message to the Soldiers of the Japanese Army," been thoroughly conveyed to every soldier?

Umino: Most of it has been thoroughly conveyed, but there is still a small portion who do not know.

### Proclamation of the Japanese Army

Nishijima: There is also the proclamation of the Japanese Army Commander to the Chinese people. May I ask the military officer to express some opinions.

Military Officer: Any war should have a righteous cause. If this point is not clear, the war will continue for a long time, and it will inevitably lose its tension. From the China Incident until the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the righteous cause of the war was clearly revealed. Until the time of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Expeditionary Force was conducting the war under various adverse conditions. However, this time the operation is very different. If we look at the fundamental spirit of the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, we will understand it even more clearly. If we look at the "Message to the Soldiers of the Japanese Army" issued by the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army this time, we will understand its spirit.

(The military officer then presented the "Message to the Soldiers of the Japanese Army" and the proclamation to the Chinese people. The "Message to the Soldiers of the Japanese Army" roughly stated:

"The purpose of this operation is to destroy the United Kingdom and the United States and to strike at the anti-Japanese regime in Chongqing, which is willing to be a running dog of the United Kingdom and the United States, and to save the Chinese people from the scourge of war. Soldiers on the front line should treat the Chinese people with the greatest compassion, and all actions should be worthy of heaven and earth.

It is forbidden to harm or commit violence against the Chinese people. It is forbidden to burn down residents' houses. Unless there is official business, it is forbidden to enter the homes of ordinary people at will, and it is forbidden to loot or destroy furniture. All purchases of Chinese goods must be paid for. It is forbidden to forcibly recruit laborers. When hiring Chinese coolies, the necessary procedures must be carried out, and Chinese people should be asked to introduce the coolies. All hired coolies must be paid wages."

Another proclamation was to the Chinese people, the text of which is as follows:

"For the purpose of proclamation, the purpose of the Japanese army's attack and stationing in this area is to break the traditional ambition of the United Kingdom and the United States to sacrifice China and invade East Asia, to assist China in establishing sovereignty and achieving freedom, and to promote the promotion and realization of friendly relations between China and Japan. The righteous army is invincible and will defeat the United Kingdom and the United States and its vassals, and implement the policy of protecting the territory and the people. Residents are requested to live and work in peace and contentment, and do not believe in rumors and disturb each other. The following points should be made known to all, so that the great righteousness of our army may be understood: The Japanese army will temporarily station troops until the complete realization of the protection of the territory and the people. The Japanese army solemnly guarantees the lives, property, and all other natural and human rights of the people in the garrison area. There will be no collection of taxes or conscription of soldiers in the Japanese army's garrison area. All people in the area who cooperate with our army in providing materials or labor will be paid full compensation. The Japanese army recognizes the current new currency and the Central Reserve Certificates in circulation at the same time. The Japanese army respects rural customs and assists the people in implementing the system of self-government, but the military administration will be temporarily implemented until the security is determined." A certain official continued to speak and said:

We know from these two documents that the war consciousness of this attack on Changsha does not lie in the three previous captures of Changsha, but in the war to destroy the United Kingdom and the United States. When soldiers on the front line see American planes such as the (B24) type, they cannot help but gnash their teeth, and the Japanese army believes that the Chongqing army in front of them are brothers, because their leaders have gone the wrong way and driven them to the battlefield. This war is indeed a war with a great righteous cause. Another thing I want to tell you is that His Imperial Highness Prince Mikasa of Japan has served in important positions in the Chinese army from January of the year before last to January of this year. He often taught his staff members, "The fundamental purpose of the Japanese Expeditionary Force to China is to enable the 400 million Chinese people to live and work in peace and contentment, and to enable China to realize unification and establish a modern country as soon as possible." When His Imperial Highness Mikasa inspects various places, he often approaches the Chinese people when there is an opportunity, and shows compassion. The Japanese Imperial Family takes the lead in practicing the example of loving the Chinese people, and this fact is the fundamental reason why the Chinese army everywhere shows an attitude of benevolence and love towards the Chinese people in this operation. Therefore, whether in Henan or Hunan, the most important thing is the affairs of the Chinese people. In order to avoid the Chinese people suffering from the scourge of war, although a part of the Japanese army's operations is hindered, it is still endured.

Umino: The Zhengzhou area

There are more than 300 large and small rivers. In previous operations, the doors of the people's houses were dismantled and erected on the river to cross over. If we crossed over 300 rivers, I don't know how many doors of the people's houses would be dismantled. But this time, such a situation will never happen. It can be seen that it is very different from before.

Nishijima: Today, listening to the discussions of the reporters and military officers who went to the army, we all know how kind and protective the Japanese army is to the Chinese people in the occupied areas, and it is also very pleasant for us people in the rear to hear about the lives of Chinese farmers. If the Chinese people can all understand this fact, then the goal of China and Japan jointly destroying the United Kingdom and the United States will surely be achieved. (End)

### German Army Adopts Mobile Defense in Central Eastern Front

Soviet Forces Announce Capture of Two Important Cities

Central News Agency, Berlin, 30th – Reuters reports: There are fierce battles day and night in the central part of the Eastern Front. The enemy's deployed forces and materials are very large. Stalin's purpose in attacking with this large army is obviously to seize Minsk, the capital of Belarus. In order to achieve this goal, the Soviet army is now advancing from Vitebsk, Mogilev, and Rogachev in three directions. After being encircled by the enemy from the direction of Vitebsk and Orsha, the German defenders, except for a few remnants, were safely able to retreat into the main defensive positions. The German army is currently fighting for control of the outskirts of Mogilev and Bobruisk. The German army is adopting a mobile strategy to avoid the Soviet offensive. The battle between Vitebsk and Orsha has now shifted to the forests and lakes south of Lepel, that is, the center of the battle is now in the central and upper reaches of the Berezina.

Central News Agency, Ankara, 30th – Reuters reports that it is learned here that the Soviet authorities stated in a document on Thursday that the Soviet army had captured Bobruisk, 87 miles southeast of Minsk. Another Soviet document stated that the Soviet army had captured Petrozavodsk, the capital of the "Finnish Karelia Republic," located west of Lake Onega, 300 miles northeast of Leningrad, and 200 miles northeast of Vyborg.

### German Troops Arrive at Finnish Front

Central News Agency, Berlin, 30th – The German Foreign Ministry announced on the 29th that, according to the German-Finnish agreement and at the request of the Finnish government, the German army has begun to provide assistance to the Allied nations. The rescue force has passed through Helsinki and is now deployed on the Karelian front.

### Germany is at a Critical Juncture, Hoping the People Will Strive Hard – Goebbels Publishes an Article

Central News Agency, Berlin, 30th – Reuters reports: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels recently published an article in the "Germany Magazine" stating that the more we work hard today, the greater the harvest will be tomorrow. Therefore, I hope that all people in the province will work hard for the country. The enemy is now attacking Germany with all its strength, attempting to fundamentally destroy Germany and solve the German problem in one fell swoop. A part of the German people is now making great sacrifices, and another part of the people can still work hard for the country. Every German should remember that helping in the war is to preserve his life and the survival of the country, which is the meaning of a war of life and death. Every citizen should bear difficult responsibilities and fulfill their obligations. If we do not do our best, the war will be prolonged. The enemy's material situation may be better than Germany's, but if everyone in our country can do their best, we can also offset it. I hope that the people of the whole country can show their patriotism and be loyal to the country.

### Sixth New Enemy Assets Transfer Ceremony Held, Including Six Major Public Utility Companies in the City

The transfer ceremony of the sixth batch of new enemy assets was held at the Astor House Hotel at 4:30 pm the day before yesterday (the 29th). Mr. Zhang Sumin, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Enemy Assets Management Committee of the National Government, Japanese Minister Usami, representatives of the Army and Navy, and personnel from the Zhenxing Company attended. First, Japanese representative Minister Usami delivered a speech and handed over the list of enemy assets. Then, Director Zhang, the representative of the National Government, gave a thank-you speech, and the ceremony ended. After the transfer ceremony, the ceremony for the release of the entrustment management of enemy assets was continued. After Minister Usami's speech, he conveyed the release instruction. Lieutenant Commander Higo of the Navy read the speech of the Supreme Commander of the Army and Navy. Finally, Aoki Setsu, Vice Chairman of the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company and representative of the managers, gave a reply. The original texts of the speeches of the Chinese and Japanese representatives are recorded as follows:

### Speech by Minister Usami

The Japanese government previously issued a statement to the people that it would transfer enemy assets in China to the National Government. Since then, based on this statement, the enemy assets have been transferred step by step. This time, the preparations for the transfer of six new enemy assets companies, including Shanghai Telephone Company, Shanghai Electric Power Company, Huxi Electric Power Company, Shanghai Tram Company, Shanghai Water Company, and Shanghai Gas Company, have been completed. Today, entrusted by the Supreme Commander of the Army and Navy in Shanghai, I will transfer these enemy assets to the National Government. Therefore, today, as a representative of the Empire, I am very honored to hand over the list of enemy assets to the representative of your government. The purpose of the enemy government in transferring enemy assets to the National Government is, of course, to strengthen the political power of the returning government, and to hope that the returning government and the people will benefit from these enemy assets and contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. I sincerely hope that China will consider the purpose of Japan's policies and cooperate with the Empire's government to make full use of these transferred enemy assets. In particular, the industries transferred this time are all public utilities, which are different from the previous transfers. Whether their operation is appropriate or not has a great impact on the well-being of the people. Therefore, after the National Government takes over, it should strive to manage them properly, so as to contribute to the stability of people's livelihood and the completion of the Greater East Asia War.

### Thank-you Speech by Director Zhang

Today, the friendly authorities are transferring six public utility enemy assets companies in the Huazhong area to the National Government. On behalf of the Central Authorities, I express my sincere gratitude. The enemy assets handed over this time are all public utilities, which are enterprises that have an important relationship with the general public. After being handed over to our country, they should be carefully managed. These enemy assets have already achieved remarkable results during the military control era. In the future, we plan to put more effort into the management, so that the public utilities in Shanghai will be no less inferior than the major cities of our ally, Japan. Today, at this historic transfer ceremony, in addition to expressing my sincere gratitude to the friendly authorities, I am also determined to work hard so as not to disappoint the expectations of the allied authorities.

### Speeches by Representatives from Various Parties

The Supreme Commander of the Army and Navy in Shanghai said: The six new enemy assets related to public utilities under the management of the Japanese army are transferred to the National Government today. Shanghai has been the largest base for the United Kingdom and the United States to control East Asia for a hundred years. Public utilities such as electricity and gas in Shanghai are actually the arteries of their economic aggression in East Asia. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, they have been taken over by the Japanese army and placed under military management, and their nature has completely changed, completing the important task of enhancing combat power and ensuring security. During this period, the managers entrusted by the military have been able to overcome all difficulties and have devoted themselves to management and joint operations, and I express my gratitude for this. After the new enemy assets are transferred to the National Government, the National Government will contribute these enemy assets to the Sino-Japanese joint venture companies as in-kind investment.

Aoki, Vice Chairman of the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company and representative of the managers, replied that this time the new enemy assets are transferred to the National Government based on the great spirit of Japan's new policy towards China and the basic principles of adjusting Sino-Japanese joint venture companies, and in the future, the National Government will use the transportation enemy assets as in-kind investment in the Sino-Japanese joint venture companies. However, the intention of the authorities is to enable China and Japan to cooperate in operating Shanghai's public utilities and to move towards the mission of completing public utilities. I feel that the responsibility in the future will be even greater, and I sincerely hope that Chinese talents will cooperate to implement the reorganization of the organization in order to rationalize the enterprise.

### Minister Matsushima Discusses the Situation on Saipan Island - Landing US Forces Suffer Heavy Losses

Minister Matsushima of the Allied Forces in China Reporting Department met with the Shanghai Chinese press corps as usual yesterday (30th) afternoon to discuss the war situation in the Pacific, Burma, and Europe. Minister Matsushima gave a detailed explanation of the situation in the Pacific theater, saying:

### Unable to Advance

The Saipan Island line is in the midst of a fierce battle. The enemy Americans falsely claimed that the American army had gradually advanced to Mount Tapochau in the east and Garapan in the west of the island. This false propaganda has no factual basis. Mount Tapochau and Garapan are still in fierce fighting. The Japanese army on Mount Tapochau has built solid positions in the rugged high mountains, commanding a view from above, and cursing at the enemy army with heavy artillery and other firearms. The heavy losses of the enemy army are beyond words, so the enemy army is really unable to advance. In Garapan, the Japanese army is bravely annihilating the invading enemy army in the suburbs. However, tens of thousands of local Japanese people, regardless of gender, are unanimously assisting the Japanese army in fighting, so the Japanese army fighting on Saipan Island has gradually wiped out the enemy army. From a strategic point of view, the enemy army has suffered unprecedented heavy losses, and its operations can be called a "bleeding operation," while the Japanese army's operations can be called a "gradual reduction operation."

### Enemy in Disarray

Also, near the sea near the island, the enemy has no trace of the main fleet, only a few small cruisers, which shows that the enemy is in a panic. The enemy's air force activity is even worse, with only one or two planes. The enemy army has two divisions on Saipan Island. In fact, the Japanese army's clever strategy is to lure the enemy fish to take the bait, and the enemy ships supplying the enemy army can be destroyed one by one. Nimitz, the commander of the enemy's Pacific column, said on the 26th in a statement on the Pacific war situation that the US army can win on Saipan Island if the supplies are abundant. In other words, if the US army's supplies are cut off, then the US army will not be able to fight. Now the US army's supplies have a serious problem, which is self-evident for the future of the US army's operations. However, the Japanese army is always able to maintain its fighting spirit and can be brave at any time.

### False Propaganda

Now, I will refute the enemy Americans' false propaganda again. If the enemy's propaganda is true, then the enemy army will not need to fight for the mere Saipan Island. Why does the enemy army not directly attack the Japanese mainland, and can even attack the Chinese mainland? What is even more ridiculous is that the enemy's American experts do not understand modern naval tactics. The Japanese army base air force on the islands around Saipan Island can destroy the fleet at any time, and the Japanese combined fleet is always ready to move. This is what Sun Tzu's Art of War calls the "superior strategy." The enemy navy has not encountered a naval battle since the Spanish-American War. The Japanese navy has been training at any time since the Russo-Japanese Naval Battle, and is always ready for battle. According to the situation on Saipan Island, it is purely a miscalculation for the enemy army to attack the island, and in the Japanese air base encirclement, it has deeply fallen into the Japanese army's operational plan.

### Burma War Situation

Following the report on the Burmese war situation, it stated: Due to the rainy season, there has been no significant progress. However, the Japanese army is still gradually advancing, aiming to thwart the American attempt to open the Ledo Road from India through Burma to Kunming, supplying Chongqing. Regarding the European war, it was mentioned that the center of the European war situation in the past was at [?]. Recently, there has been no progress in the Anglo-American military efforts. The subtle relationship between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union regarding this war situation, as well as the Soviet Union's lack of emphasis on the war and its refusal to acknowledge the opening of a second front, as hoped for by the United Kingdom and the United States for the Soviet Union to attack Germany in the east, while the Soviet Union does not implement it, indicates that the alliance between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union can be described as "sharing the same bed but dreaming different dreams" or "sailing in the same boat but with different purposes," which is a very obvious fact.

### First Police Bureau Judicial Office - Adjustment of Organization

In order to promote judicial affairs, the First Police Bureau of this city has strengthened its internal organization, merging the Needle and Cold Interrogation Sections into a single Investigation Section. The position of Section Chief will be held by Liu Shao-kui, the former Chief of the Detective Section. In addition, a Narcotics Investigation Section and a Crime Prevention Section have been established. The personnel for the heads of these sections have also been announced: Narcotic Investigation Section Chief Dao Cheng-nuo, Crime Prevention Section Chief Shi Yu-xiang. The aforementioned sections will be officially established and begin operations today (the 1st). As for the personnel for each section and division chief, they will also be formally announced within the next few days.

### Adjustment of Division Chiefs in Various Branch Bureaus

Furthermore, the Judicial Office of the said state has also adjusted the division chiefs of the judicial divisions in various branch bureaus. Liu Jun-qing, Chief of the Judicial Division of the Lao Zha Branch Bureau, has been transferred to serve as Chief of the Zi Shu Branch Bureau Judicial Division, with the vacancy filled by Deng Zhuang-jin, the former Chief of the Interrogation Section. Shang Wu, Chief of the Judicial Division of the Jiang Ning Road Branch Bureau, has been transferred to serve as Chief of the Judicial Division of the Hua Shan Road Branch Bureau. Huang Ying-bao, Detective of the Zhai Shan Branch Bureau Judicial Division, has been transferred to serve as Deputy Chief of the said Branch Bureau. Li Shi-zhong, Chief of the Judicial Division of the Pu Tuo Road Branch Bureau, has been transferred to serve as Chief of the Judicial Division of the Jiang Ning Road Branch Bureau, with the vacancy filled by Ye Yu-si, Deputy Chief of the Judicial Division of the Yang Shu Pu Branch Bureau. Wang Run-he, former Detective of the Detective Section, has been transferred to serve as Deputy Chief of the Judicial Division of the Yang Shu Pu Branch Bureau. There have also been movements among the detectives and officers. The aforementioned personnel are all required to report to the bureau for duty today (the 1st).

### Measures to Suppress Hoarding of Rice for Civil Consumption in this City

Since the Executive Yuan authorities promulgated the "Temporary Measures for Rice for Civil Consumption in Beijing and Shanghai" and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, together with the Rice and Grain Control Committee, formulated and implemented the "Shanghai Measures for the Management of Rice for Civil Consumption," the influx of rice has become increasingly smooth, and prices have been trending downward. The issue of rice for civil consumption has been alleviated. Now that the Rice Control Committee has completed preparations for the twelve temporary licensing offices, which are scheduled to be established today (July 1st), the Municipal Government has specifically promulgated the "Shanghai Temporary Measures for Suppressing Hoarding of Rice for Civil Consumption" to suppress hoarding.

### Naval Painter – The Navy

— By Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

Although the hour of Chen Guangrong had reached midnight, the two of them were still talking.

"I stayed in Xiapu for a short time, but I was told I couldn't fly."

Makoto didn't seem particularly upset, and said this with a smile.

"Before becoming a Lieutenant, the Aviation, Gunnery, and Naval Mine Warfare schools must be entered in order. Only after specialized research and determination can one become an advanced science student."

"Then, what is Makoto's specialty?"

"It hasn't reached that stage yet."

"There must be a department you like?"

"Hmm?..."

Makoto seemed shy and smiled. "What?"

"Serving on submarines. That suits your temperament. I had the nickname 'Sea Turtle' during my time at Etajima." Makoto laughed and began to explain the meaning of "Sea Turtle" and the characteristics of submarines.

According to him, the mission on a submarine is the most monotonous in the world, and the hardship is not much. It's also not a glamorous job. If the aviation officer is the protagonist on the stage, then the submarine officer is the supporting actor. Concealment is the only life-saver for submarines. This warrior of endurance requires great patience and sacrifice before launching a torpedo. But the submarines of the Japanese Empire have not yet fired a torpedo at the enemy. The result of forty years of accumulated strength is that no one has seen it. There are even extremists who believe that submarines are useless.

"But, in any case, I like submarines. I'm not very smart, and I don't have any special courage, but in terms of tenacity, I always feel that I will never lose to others even if I serve on submarines."

Makoto revealed his inner secrets without much excitement. Ryuufu, who had known Makoto's monotonous personality since childhood, felt that Makoto's temperament was closely aligned with his submarine aspirations.

When the clock struck once, the two of them were a little tired of talking. Just as they were about to go to sleep, Ryuufu suddenly tapped his forehead and said:

"Oh dear, that's terrible! There's only one quilt."

"It doesn't matter. Didn't we sleep under one quilt when we traveled in the Second Middle School?"

Makoto smiled as he began to take off his suit. (109)
