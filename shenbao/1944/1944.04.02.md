### Advancing into India

— Wei Shan

Q: Recently, all eyes have been focused on the India-Burma war situation. What is the actual significance?

A: Before observing the India-Burma war situation, we must pay special attention to three points: First, in the near future, due to the continued advancement of the Soviet offensive, general military observers believe that the United States and Britain may transfer their war efforts from Europe to the Pacific; second, the US air and naval forces once carried out surprise attacks on the Marshall and Caroline Islands, and some mistakenly believed that Japan would be forced to adopt a defensive posture as a result; third, the joint efforts of Britain, the United States, and Chongqing in military activities in Burma were exaggerated by the enemy as a counteroffensive against Burma. From these three points, people inevitably have various speculations. The fact that the Japanese army, together with the Indian National Army, is advancing towards the Indian border thoroughly shattered the enemy's strategic propaganda and the general public's illusions about the current situation. The Japanese side's initiative, advantage, and certainty of victory in the Greater East Asia War are therefore even more clarified.

Q: This is an explanation of the new India-Burma war situation from a military perspective. So, what is the actual situation since the Japanese-Indian troops launched an offensive against India?

A: The Japanese troops in Burma are advancing into India in three routes. The first route, on March 8th, together with the Indian National Army, launched an offensive against the British-Indian army near the Chin Hills and advanced towards the border. The second route, on March 15th, together with the Indian National Army, crossed the Gander River near Remalin and rushed across the border. The third route is the Japanese Air Force cooperating to launch a new offensive against India. Each route is advancing rapidly. Some are only 80 kilometers away from the border, approaching the enemy's important defense line based on the Tamu airport, and some have penetrated dozens of kilometers into India. Currently, the Japanese-Indian army is using mechanized units as the vanguard, advancing fiercely along the Tamu and Imphal roads.

Q: It is said that this offensive by the Japanese-Indian army came as a surprise to the British and American authorities, resulting in extreme disarray. It must have a significant impact on their overall war situation and international position, right?

A: How could it not? According to a Reuters dispatch from New York on March 24th, news of the Japanese army's attack on India has been published in a prominent position in newspapers for days. The New York Times' military commentator, Holdridge, stated decisively: "The army's attack on India has seized an excellent opportunity, with full certainty both strategically and politically." The NBC radio station in New York also trembled, warning its countrymen: the Allied forces have now encountered a situation similar to the second Singapore, and the seriousness of the Japanese army's attack on India is beyond general imagination! In Britain, the London Times also stated on March 24th that the Allied forces in the Chin Hills area are in danger of being forced to retreat. This kind of pessimistic tone in British and American public opinion did not exist a month ago!

Q: This new offensive by the Japanese army is clearly related to helping India drive out the British and American invading forces and realize independence. What special impact will it have on the future situation in India and Chongqing?

A: The Greater East Asia War was originally a war to liberate the East Asian nations. Japan has long made a public declaration that it does not regard the Indian people as enemies, and expresses sympathy and support for the Indian national independence movement. The establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India and the organization of the Indian National Army owe the most to Japan's support. Now, the Indian National Army, with the assistance of the Japanese army, is advancing towards the border, fulfilling the declaration of armed liberation of India last year. This will surely intensify the national movement within India, uniting both internally and externally to wage a decisive battle against the common enemy, the British and American invaders, for the liberation of the motherland. As for Chongqing, they originally hoped to counterattack Burma and open the Burma Road to transport supplies and reverse the decline. They did not hesitate to send a large number of expeditionary forces to Burma and India. Now, the Japanese-Indian army is advancing into India, and the aforementioned plan has failed again. Moreover, as the New York NBC radio station stated on March 27th: Once the Japanese army reaches Imphal, not only will the Allied forces' extensive supply lines be completely cut off, but also the newly opened highway to Chongqing (the Chongqing-India Highway) will completely lose its value. It is not difficult to imagine the impact of this.

### Important Transportation Lines in the Manipur Plain Cut Off; Enemy Troops in Imphal Ensnared in a Net

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from a certain base on the Burma front on the 1st reports that the highway between Imphal and Kohima is the retreat route for the main force of the enemy's 4th Army Corps in the Imphal area, but on the night of the 28th of last month, in the dense forest 40 kilometers north of Imphal, northwest of Ukhrul, the Japanese-Indian army completely cut off the enemy's retreat route. There are two highways connecting Imphal to the Assam Plain: one from Imphal to Kohima, and the other from Imphal to Silchar. The highway from Imphal to Silchar is four meters wide, with winding roads and many slopes. The bridges built over the valleys are mostly suspension bridges, and the transportation capacity is extremely limited, making it impractical to use. The enemy has not utilized this highway, resulting in the road surface being overgrown with grass. Currently, the enemy army relies solely on the highway from Imphal to Kohima, which connects to the Bengal Railway as the main transportation line. Now that the highway between Imphal and Kohima has been cut off by the Japanese-Indian allied forces, the enemy's 4th Army Corps' transportation line has been severed, and its main force has been locked on the Imphal Highlands, strategically completely isolated. The enemy's 4th Army Corps is currently under fierce pressure from the Japanese army from all directions and has fallen into an encirclement, and is about to collapse completely.

Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – A United Press dispatch from a special correspondent in New Delhi reports that the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces Command announced a war report on the 31st, admitting that the Japanese jungle warfare units have expanded their battle lines by approximately 200 miles and broken into the British-Indian army's eastern Indian defensive positions. Important transportation routes in the Manipur Plain have been cut off. The news of this has deeply shaken and unsettled the entire land of India. According to a broadcast from the San Francisco radio station, after the Japanese army cut off the Ledo Road north of Imphal, the British-Indian army, seeing the situation deteriorating, was in a state of panic and was reportedly hastily mobilizing reinforcements to come to their rescue.

Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from New Delhi reports that the British-Indian army commander, Auchinleck, stated for the first time in a meeting of the Central Legislative Assembly of India on the 31st that Tiddim had fallen.

### Relations Between Japan and the Soviet Union Strengthen After Successful Negotiations; Significant Gains Made in a Spirit of Mutual Concession

Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) – The fishery negotiations and the transfer of Sakhalin rights negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union have now been completely concluded. In terms of significance, this not only proves the strengthening of friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, but also has a significant impact on the international situation for people from all countries involved in the war. From Japan's standpoint, these negotiations are merely a continuation of past negotiations, and there is little significance to be particularly emphasized. However, the fishery and oil rights issues have been a long-standing issue between Japan and the Soviet Union for many years. Now that they have been resolved, this proves that the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union is based on a spirit of mutual concession and is becoming more and more consolidated. At the same time, with the resolution of these outstanding issues, relations between the two countries have become clearer, which is indeed a major gain. When negotiating the fishery treaty, a Japan-Soviet fishery protocol was signed, stipulating that its validity period be extended for five years, and its content is the same as the fishery protocol signed in the past. As for the decision on the transfer of rights, in light of the changes in the international situation since Showa 3 (1928), the development of Soviet power, the German-Soviet war, and the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the significance of maintaining neutral relations between Japan and the Soviet Union is that being able to resolve the long-standing issues between Japan and the Soviet Union and extend the term of the fishery treaty has consolidated the foundation of Japan-Soviet relations. At the same time, it is sufficient to prove the strict existence of the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact, which is of great significance in stabilizing Japan-Soviet relations.

### The Complete Course of the Satisfactory Resolution of the Two Major Outstanding Issues Between Japan and the Soviet Union

Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) – The extension of the fishery treaty period and the transfer of rights in northern Sakhalin (i.e., northern Karafuto), two important diplomatic issues that have now been satisfactorily resolved between Japan and the Soviet Union, have gradually moved onto the right track since the conclusion of the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact in Showa 16 (1941), breaking through subtle and difficult international political situations. This has epoch-making significance in Japan-Soviet friendly relations. Moreover, what is most noteworthy about the current Japan-Soviet negotiations is that although the two issues are related, they are essentially different. At the same time, in terms of establishing friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, their nature is similar, but in fact they are negotiated in parallel. Regarding the negotiations on the fishery treaty, from the principles of the Treaty of Portsmouth and the Japan-Soviet Basic Treaty, Japan has the right to conclude a treaty, so negotiating the conclusion of a treaty is a matter of course. Therefore, after the expiration of the Japan-Soviet Fishery Treaty in Showa 11 (1936), the two countries entered into a temporary agreement, and negotiations on the conclusion of this treaty continued. Since the fifth temporary agreement at the end of Showa 14 (1939), the Soviet Union has issued a social statement explaining the preparations for concluding this treaty, but it has not been realized due to the influence of the international situation. As a result of the current negotiations, a new fishery treaty was not concluded. In principle, it was stipulated that the Lu Treaty, which expired in Showa 11 (1936), would be extended for another five years, and the points that needed to be revised were listed in the form of a protocol. The details were stipulated in the exchange of official documents. Regarding the negotiations on Japan's transfer of rights in northern Sakhalin, since Showa 3 (1928), the Soviet government, in its policy of recovering Soviet rights, had hinted at the hope of recovering this. Until Showa 16 (1941), the only Japanese rights in northern Sakhalin that the Soviet Union had not recovered were these. These rights were different from other foreign rights because they were based on the provision in Item B of the Protocol to the Japan-Soviet Basic Treaty. They were treaty rights. Therefore, the Japanese government changed its past attitude based on this. In Showa 16 (1941), due to the need for Japan-Soviet diplomatic relations to be adjusted, there was a trend towards the conclusion of a neutrality treaty. At that time, the two governments reached a consensus in principle. The transfer of these rights was the realization of the planned scheme at that time. When the current negotiations began, the Soviet Union hoped to resolve the power issue and the fishery issue at the same time. As a result, the two negotiations proceeded simultaneously. Therefore, the above two issues, which were the biggest outstanding issues in the past in the diplomatic relations between the two countries, have been completely and satisfactorily resolved. This is due to the impartiality of the Japanese side's attitude and the Soviet Union's adherence to the spirit of friendship in theory.

### Output of Oil and Coal Gradually Decreasing

Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) – This time, Japan is transferring its rights in the Sakhalin Islands to the Soviet Union, mainly oil and coal mining. The past performance of these two undertakings is recorded as follows: In Showa 8 (1933), the oil production was 190,000 tons, which was the highest record. After that, it decreased year by year, and only 16,000 tons last year. The coal production was also the same. In Showa 10 (1935), the production was 240,000 tons, which was the highest peak. After that, it gradually decreased to only 5,000 tons last year. The reason for the decrease is that Japan has abundant coal mines in various parts of the Greater East Asia and they are easy to mine. Moreover, due to the occupation of the southern territories and the acquisition of oil fields, the oil is inexhaustible. Therefore, Japan's transfer of the oil and coal rights in the Sakhalin Islands to the Soviet Union is actually of no concern to Japan.

### Enemy Planes Attacking Truk; 13 Aircraft Shot Down

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from a certain base of the Japanese army in the South Pacific reports that more than 20 enemy large bombers attacked Truk Island three times on the 29th, and 30 enemy planes attacked the island twice on the 30th. The Japanese naval fighters immediately met them and shot down three B-24 type enemy planes and destroyed seven. The damage to the Japanese ground facilities was minimal. In addition, 14 enemy small planes and 6 medium planes attacked Ponape Island on the morning of the 30th. The Japanese air force shot down three of them, and the Japanese side suffered no damage. The attack on several hundred remaining enemies, until 3:00 pm on the 27th, and launched a fierce attack on them,展开自刃战, Therefore, under the rising morale of the Indian National Army, the annihilation of the enemy army is just around the corner.

### British Brigadier General Wingate Dies in Northern Burma

Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – A United Press dispatch from London reports that the British War Office announced yesterday that Brigadier General Wingate, commander of the British army jungle warfare units on the Burma front, recently died in a plane crash. The announcement was extremely simple, and it is difficult to determine the details, but Wingate recently commanded the "Air Train" units to land behind the Japanese army on the northern Burma battlefield. These units have been surrounded by the Japanese army, so it is certain that Brigadier General Wingate died at that time. In order to cover up the truth, the British government announced that it was due to a plane crash.

### Japanese Navy Ministry Adjusts Personnel

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Navy Ministry announced the following at 1:00 pm on the 1st: Vice Admiral Kakuzaburo Makita, commander of the Osaka Garrison, was appointed commander of the Maizuru Naval District. Vice Admiral Ichiro Ono was appointed commander of the Osaka Garrison. Former Maizuru Naval District Commander Vice Admiral Denhichi Okawauchi has been ordered to serve in the Naval General Staff and the Navy Ministry.

### Deploying Along the Entire Coastline; Burmese Army Participates in the War; Defending National Territory and Securing Supply Lines

Rangoon, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese and Indian armies are currently engaged in large-scale operations within Indian territory, and the Burmese National Army is also participating in these operations. Their mission is to defend Burmese territory and secure the supply lines for the Japanese-Indian allied forces. Enemy airborne commando units previously landed near Kalewa and began to stir up trouble. The defense units in that area immediately began to take action and took the lead in launching attacks, and are still actively suppressing the enemy forces. Furthermore, the Burmese National Army has overcome geographical difficulties to prevent enemy aircraft from stirring up trouble. They have deployed anti-aircraft surveillance posts and communication outposts in key areas along the entire Burmese coastline, hoping to achieve close contact throughout Burma at any time. Although they are defense units, they can be transformed into offensive units when necessary. This characteristic is most evident on the coastline facing the Bay of Bengal. For example, in a certain place, the defense officer is a graduate of the annual military academy, and 70 of the 100 non-commissioned officers have studied in Japan.

### Battle Results of the Indian National Army

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from the Indian front on the 1st reports that the Indian National Army, fighting alongside the Japanese army to attack the enemy's stronghold around Imphal, had crushed the enemy army near Sangak (40 kilometers northeast of Imphal) on the 24th. In this battle, the enemy abandoned 60 corpses, 20 were captured, and the spoils of war included 19 mortars, 2 heavy machine guns, and many other weapons. Later, they urgently pursued the defeated enemy in the areas on both sides of the Imphal Highway, and at a height 20 kilometers northeast of Imphal, they surrounded

### Japanese Women's Association Launches Aircraft Donation Campaign; Manufacturing 1,500 Heavy Bombers

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – In order to echo the soldiers on the front lines, the Great Japan Women's Association launched a women's total mobilization campaign to manufacture 1,500 heavy bombers to destroy the United States and Britain, calling on 30 million members to cooperate fully. As for the source of funds, it has now been decided that housewives and women from family factories or joint factories will donate. Detailed methods for donation have been notified to local branches throughout the country. As for the number of aircraft to be contributed, it has been stipulated that Tokyo is 210, Osaka is 100, Hokkaido is 86, Hyogo Prefecture is 75, Fukuoka Prefecture is 72, Aichi Prefecture is 67, and other prefectures, except for Okinawa Prefecture with 20, have a minimum limit of 10 aircraft.

### Note

This week, we have received letters from readers, all asking why Mr. Toshisuke Yoshida's weekly commentary has not continued. We are grateful for the concern and enthusiasm of our readers. Mr. Yoshida has been working on writing a book, "The Destiny of Asia," which has taken a lot of energy. He has taken a temporary leave of absence for a few weeks. We hope that our readers will understand.

### Japanese-Indian Troops Advance to Attack Delhi

The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 2:00 pm on March 21st: Japanese troops in Burma, in cooperation with the Indian National Army, launched an attack on the British-Indian army near the Chin Hills on March 8th and are currently engaged in annihilation battles near the border. Another powerful Japanese unit, along with the Indian National Army, crossed the Gander River near Homalin on March 15th and are currently advancing towards the Burma-India border.

The elite of the Japanese forces stationed in Burma annihilated the British-Indian 7th Division on the Buiteton front in early March. The enemy hastily shifted its forces and began to provide assistance to that area. In the midst of fierce battles between the two sides, one part of the Japanese forces, in cooperation with the Indian National Army, took the opportunity to attack the British-Indian army in the Chin Hills area of the central Burma-India border and almost completely annihilated them. Another powerful unit, along with the Indian National Army, crossed the Gander River near Homalin (about 200 kilometers north of Donzai) in the north and rushed directly into the enemy's rear, beginning an attack towards the Burma-India border.

### Launching a Surprise Attack Operation

In the previous Arakan campaign, the Japanese army suddenly launched a surprise attack operation against the main force of the Han-Indian army in the Chin Hills on March 8th. In cooperation with the Indian National Army, they quickly cut off the enemy's retreat route. After four days of fighting, they completely surrounded the main force of the British-Indian 17th Division (about 10,000 men from two brigades, 48 and 63) in Donzai, their key point. Since the morning of the 14th, they have launched a magnificent annihilation battle integrating land and air.

The British-Indian 23rd Division north of Mindatmi also collapsed before the elite Japanese troops. A part of the Indian National Army and the Japanese vanguard, with the force of wind sweeping away fallen leaves, crossed the Gander River and launched an attack into India. In this annihilation battle, the enemy was caught off guard due to the skillful strategy of the Japanese army at the beginning of the operation, and the entire army collapsed.

The Burma-India border, from the northern Yunnan border to the coast of the Bay of Bengal in the south, is entirely composed of steep mountains, with elevations ranging from 7,000 to 8,000 meters. There are many hardwoods and lush bamboo forests. The enemy, who built fortifications on the mountaintops, resisted stubbornly relying on the natural barriers. However, the elite Japanese troops overcame all the difficulties in replenishing ammunition and water and achieved the results of the annihilation battle. The battles on the Burma-India border have now reached their climax. The elite Japanese troops and the Indian National Army are cooperating closely and advancing on Delhi. On the border lines of northern Burma, central, and southern,

### Battle Reaches Climax

Unfolding a successful annihilation battle. In the northern Fuzhi area, three divisions of the British, American, and Chongqing Allied forces were destroyed, and the Chongqing army in the Fuzhi area, equipped and trained in the American style, displayed an offensive posture along with the British-American mixed forces. But they will personally experience that their fate will be the same as that of the 7th and 17th Divisions, only tending towards a tragic path (Translated by Xiang from the March 22nd Western Daily News)

### Yesterday, the Prime Minister Held a Grand Celebration Ceremony for Navy Day, Hoping to Emulate the Spirit of Allied Navies and Advance

Central News Agency, Beijing – Today (the 1st) is the first Navy Day in our country. All naval bases and units across the country will hold grand celebration ceremonies. At the Navy Department, the ceremony will be held at 10:00 am in the Department's auditorium. A tea party will be held at 11:00 am. From 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm, naval students and soldiers will parade in the city. At 7:30 pm, a lecture, music, and film convention will be held in the National Assembly Hall. It is learned that in order to expand publicity and promote a deep understanding of the navy among the people, the department has printed commemorative booklets and propaganda slogans, which will be distributed to various agencies and posted on major thoroughfares. The following are recorded: China has a vast territorial sea and must have a strong navy. With a navy, there is command of the sea. A new China should build a new navy. The navy is an essential element of national defense strength. Building a navy is the implementation of national policy. Consolidate our defenses through military buildup. Rely on each other, and strive to advance together with the navies of our allies. To complete the defensive power in the Pacific, the Chinese and Japanese navies should cooperate to take responsibility. Maintaining the security of our territorial waters is the sole responsibility of our navy. Let us all work together to build our maritime Great Wall. Celebrate Navy Day and always commemorate the revival of the navy. Long live the Republic of China, long live the new navy.

### Commander Ren Delivers a Speech at the Concert

Nanjing, 31st (Central News Agency) – April is the first Navy Day in our country. At 7:00 pm, the Navy Department held a celebration music and film convention in the National Assembly Hall. Navy Commander Ren Yuandao delivered a speech at the meeting as follows:

Today is Navy Day. On April 8, 1942, the Navy Department convened a National Naval Conference in Nanjing. The following year, it requested the government to designate April 1st of each year as Navy Day. Today is the first time we are holding a celebration ceremony. Under the leadership of our Supreme Leader Chairman Wang, and with the assistance of the Allied Navies, and the enthusiastic participation of all of you, we are holding a grand gathering. I am truly excited and grateful. The Chinese Navy has a considerable history of several decades, from the late Qing Dynasty to the occurrence of incidents. However, the country was in turmoil, with internal wars breaking out one after another, causing division and disintegration, and failing to achieve national unity. All the strength was roughly divided into the Changsheng Fleet, the Guangdong Fleet, the Bohai Fleet, etc. Each had its own interests and divergent views, which had a negative impact on the future development of the Navy. The National Naval Conference on April 1, 1942, brought naval personnel from the north and south together, breaking the previous bad obstacles of separate interests and divergent views, and advancing on the path of sincere unity and shared hardships. This can truly be said to be

### Building a New Navy

The foundation for the event, and also the sole wish for holding today's Navy Day celebration. When I think back to the Chinese Navy, which has been running for nearly 70 years, the predecessors such as Li Wenzhong and Shen Wensu have also made a lot of efforts. However, the navy of our ally Japan has only been running for 100 years. In the ninth year of Tenpo in Japan, which was the 18th year of Daoguang in our country, the Lord of the Togo Domain ordered his retainers to emulate the European style and create a ship, named the "Hitachi Maru," with watchtowers, flags, and a solid and precise structure. At the same time, Grand Secretary Abe Ise-no-kami also had the order to build a ship. This was the beginning of the Japanese Navy. Subsequently, in the sixth year of Yongjia in Japan, the Dutch ship "Sumisu" was purchased, and Dutch teachers were invited to teach naval skills. The following year, a Russian ship in the Port of Shimoda happened to run aground and sink. The Russians wanted to build two new ships to return to the north, so they hired Japanese craftsmen to help them. Shipbuilding methods were transmitted to Japan through this. By the third year of Ansei, they were able to build ships themselves and sail in nearby waters. In the sixth year of Ansei, Japan's intimidating ships made their first

### A Groundbreaking Feat in Navigation by Japan

At that time, the largest vessel in the Zhili Viceroy's fleet, the "Kaiten," and the "Fuji-san," had a meager horsepower of only 400, with a carrying capacity of 710 tons. The "Fuji-san" had a horsepower of only 350, with a carrying capacity of 1,000 tons. Between the years of Bunkyu and Keio (1861-1868), tireless efforts were made, gradually establishing the Edo Naval Training Center, the Kobe Naval Academy, founding the Yokohama and Yokosuka Ironworks, and developing the Ogasawara Islands. Regarding naval construction, research, and expansion in areas such as surveying, coastal defense, instruments, and artillery, no effort was spared in the arduous process of creation. After the Meiji Restoration, progress accelerated rapidly. In the Russo-Japanese War, they shattered the Russian Baltic Fleet with a single blow, establishing a miracle in world naval warfare. Today, Japan possesses a powerful and magnificent navy, sailing through the Pacific Ocean, causing the naval prowess of Britain, once known as the "King of the Sea," to wither and crumble, afraid to look eastward.

### This Great Spirit

Such great victories could not have been achieved without the unity of the court and the people, and the solidarity of the officers and soldiers. In contrast, consider the Chinese navy, blessed with vast lands and abundant resources. Geographically, it is a neighbor to Japan; chronologically, it is a brother to Japan. Yet, in everything, it lags behind and fails repeatedly. Towards its close neighbor and advanced brother, it truly feels a great sense of shame. Today, as we celebrate Navy Day, we briefly recount the history of the founding of the Japanese navy to inform all officers and soldiers of our navy. We deeply hope that all officers and soldiers of our navy will take the traditional spirit of our allied nation, Japan, in building their navy as a guiding principle, strive to catch up quickly, be even more diligent, and even more united, to fulfill the mission of China's new navy and pray for the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia Holy War.

### Japan's Exchange Rate Policy Towards China Approved by Cabinet Meeting the Day Before Yesterday

Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese government approved the "Exchange Rate Policy Towards China Plan" in the Cabinet meeting on the 31st. The Japanese Information Bureau issued the following statement at 2 PM on the same day: Regarding Japan's exchange rate policy towards China, there have been various discussions. Therefore, in today's cabinet meeting, we clarified the policy of adhering to the current exchange rate for various currencies of the Republic of China. At the same time, we will explore various measures to resolutely support the currency policy of the Republic of China. We hope that you will not delay and bring losses upon yourselves.

### Embassy Statement

The circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes in Huaihai Province has been quite smooth since the cessation of the issuance of new notes by the United Reserve Bank of China. In major cities, exchange is mostly conducted using Central Reserve notes. The National Government, based on its established policy, has decided to exchange all United Reserve Bank notes within the province for Central Reserve notes at a rate of 18 yuan of United Reserve notes for 100 yuan of Central Reserve notes, from April 10th to the 20th. After the complete exchange, starting from May 1st, all public taxes, including central and local taxes, and all receipts from public utility companies in the province will be limited to Central Reserve notes, and United Reserve notes will no longer be accepted. Furthermore, United Reserve notes deposits and loans in financial institutions (including banks, money shops, and post offices) will also be converted to Central Reserve notes at a rate of 18 yuan of United Reserve notes for 100 yuan of Central Reserve notes. Other general United Reserve notes debts and claims will also be converted to Central Reserve notes debts and claims at the same rate. As for the exchange rate between Central Reserve notes and United Reserve notes in North China and Central China, the authorities in Central China and North China will cooperate to maintain a rate of 18 yuan of United Reserve notes for 100 yuan of Central Reserve notes. As a result of this measure, the currency circulating in the Huaihai Province region will be unified with Central Reserve notes. It is hoped that the general overseas Chinese will understand the intentions of the National Government and exchange all their United Reserve notes for Central Reserve notes to cooperate.

### Jianbu Convenes Third Central Liaison Meeting and Approves This Year's Work Plan

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since Minister Chen Chunpu took office at the Ministry of Construction, he has attached great importance to the work of protecting traffic routes. Considering that this work is related to military transportation and the safety of travelers, it should be actively strengthened, especially during wartime. Therefore, the third Central Liaison Meeting was convened at the Ministry at 3 PM on March 31st. Representatives from the Allied side, including the Japanese Embassy, the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, the General Staff of the Japanese Army, and the Deng Force, all sent key personnel to attend. Relevant section chiefs from the Central China Railway Company and the Central China Heavy Communication Company, as well as members of the road protection work committee, including Chairman Wu Wenwei, Vice Chairman Zhang E, and all group leaders, also participated. Minister Chen personally presided over the meeting, and the "Implementation Plan for This Year's Work" was approved on the spot. It included detailed regulations for organization and training, official propaganda, and welfare work. The "Joint Measures for Protecting Traffic Routes" clearly stipulated the organizational system of the central and local liaison committees and the liaison between the China Railway Company, the Central China Electric Company, and governments at all levels. Opinions were also fully exchanged on topics such as the welfare of people in the areas protected by the road and fundraising methods. The meeting concluded at 7:30 PM, and Minister Chen hosted a banquet at the Ministry that evening to entertain the attendees.

### War Situation of the Expeditionary Army to China in One Week

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Expeditionary Army to China announced the war situation for the week on the 31st as follows: The Japanese Army Air Force continues to carry out proactive operations to preemptively strike the enemy, posing a great threat to the enemy's air force. On the 24th, it launched a surprise attack on the Jian'ou and Yushan airfields, and on the 27th, it attacked the Jian'ou airfield again, destroying its runways and thwarting the enemy's plans. Although the airfield had been subjected to intense bombing by our air force more than 50 times in the past, on the 29th, the enemy used several P40 and P41 aircraft to attack the Nanchang area, but they were intercepted by the Japanese air force, one of which was shot down, and the others fled.

### Ministry of Finance Revises Method for Transporting Banknotes

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Ministry of Finance, considering that the method for transporting banknotes has been in effect since its promulgation on March 1st of last year, and is no longer fully suited to the current situation, recently revised it and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval and filing. It has been learned that the original method stipulated that those transporting new legal tender in amounts exceeding 50,000 yuan could apply for a passport and pay a passport fee of 10 yuan. The revision now stipulates that those transporting 100,000 yuan or more can apply for a passport and pay a passport fee of 20 yuan and a stamp duty of 2 yuan.

### Those Holding Residence Permits May Travel to Various Places, Except for North China and Guangdong

Nanjing, 31st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The implementation of issuing residence permits by police agencies in various provinces and cities will soon reach its third year. In the past, due to different situations in North China and Guangdong provinces, there were regulations for travel permits when people traveled. Recently, considering that the security in various places has gradually become consolidated, the Central Government, for the convenience of the people, has consulted with the Allied authorities. With the cooperation of the Allies, a unified method has been realized. After April 1st, people with residence permits may travel freely. However, in North China and Guangdong, people traveling must exchange for new residence permits. This new permit will be handled according to the methods of the Ministry of Interior, so that it gradually aligns with the Central Government. In order to adapt to the wartime system, all third-country nationals residing in China should have legal identity documents from their own country. If they travel from their place of residence, they must still obtain a travel permit. From now on, people's travel will be more convenient, and the effectiveness of residence permits will also tend to be unified.

### Unifying the Currency System of Huai'an Province: Full Exchange of Central Reserve Notes and United Reserve Bank Notes; Statements Issued by Minister Zhou and the Japanese Embassy

Nanjing, 31st (Central News Agency dispatch) - In order to unify the currency system and expand the circulation area of Central Reserve Notes, the authorities have previously decided to further adjust the currency system of Huai'an Province. Since January 1st, the new issuance of United Reserve Bank Notes in the area has been stopped, and it has been stipulated that all treasury expenditures and bank payments, etc., will be limited to Central Reserve Notes. Now, in order to fully implement the unified circulation of Central Reserve Notes, the Central Reserve Bank offices in various important areas of the province will conduct a full exchange of Central Reserve Notes and United Reserve Bank Notes from April 10th to the 20th. Minister Zhou and the Japanese Embassy have issued statements as follows:

### Statement by Minister Zhou

Regarding the adjustment of the currency system in Huai'an Province, the government has gradually implemented it in accordance with its established policy. Since the joint use of Central Reserve Notes and United Reserve Bank Notes began on December 1st of last year, financial circulation and material regulation in the province have become more convenient. On February 21st of this year, the Xuzhou branch of the Central Reserve Bank officially opened. In order to adapt to the needs of the environment, further adjustments have been made. That is, starting from March 1st of this year, the new issuance of notes by the United Reserve Bank of China in Huai'an Province will be stopped. All treasury expenditures and bank deposits, loans, remittances, and other payments in Huai'an Province will no longer use United Reserve Notes and will be limited to Central Reserve Notes. Now that Central Reserve Bank offices have been widely established in important areas of the province, it has been decided that from April 10th to the 20th of this year, a full exchange of Central Reserve Notes and United Reserve Notes will be implemented in Huai'an Province. The methods are as follows: Central Reserve Notes and United Reserve Notes will be exchanged at a rate of 100 yuan to 18 yuan. The detailed methods of exchange and the establishment of exchange offices will be planned and implemented by the Finance Department of the Huai'an Provincial Government and the Central Reserve Bank. After the full exchange period, all United Reserve Bank of China notes that have been used in Huai'an Province should be restricted according to the following methods: Starting from May 1st, 1944, all receipts and expenditures of central and local agencies and state-owned enterprises in Huai'an Province will be in Central Reserve Notes and will no longer use United Reserve Notes. Financial institutions (including banks, money shops, post offices, etc.) in Huai'an Province, whose deposits and loans were originally in United Reserve Notes, should be converted to Central Reserve Notes at a rate of 18 yuan to 100 yuan. General debts and claims originally contracted in United Reserve Notes should also be handled in accordance with the above method. All our national affairs officials

### New Significance of Japanese-Soviet Relations

— Bu Daolin

Yesterday, newspapers around the world reported that the agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union to extend the fisheries treaty for five years and to transfer the rights to oil and coal in northern Sakhalin has been signed separately.

For countries that constantly hope for the deterioration of Japanese-Soviet relations and the outbreak of conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union, this news is a true fact in the history of world diplomacy. Looking back, especially since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, various malicious rumors have been fabricated and all kinds of unfounded rumors have been spread around the world regarding the relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. However, Japan and the Soviet Union have always adhered to the spirit of the treaty signed in April 1941, and the peaceful relations between the two countries have not been shaken in the slightest. This relationship has gained substantial content due to the establishment of this protocol and should naturally become more solid. This is indeed an unpleasant thing for the United States, but it has important significance from the perspective of East Asian stability.

Furthermore, considering the Japanese-Soviet relations since the outbreak of this Greater East Asia War, the calm minds and moral attitude of the authorities of the two countries have shattered countless plots attempting to provoke relations between the two countries. Here are a few examples:

We know that in late May 1942, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov visited London and Washington successively, concluding a twenty-year alliance treaty with the United Kingdom and signing a US-Soviet economic agreement with the United States. Molotov, using the alias "Bravin," secretly went to the White House. When Roosevelt agreed to provide material assistance worth 3 billion yuan annually, what price did he ask for in return? This is something everyone can imagine. At that time, the United States, which was suffering a strong military defeat from Japan in the Pacific, in order to retaliate, "using Shangri-La as a base" in April, launched an air raid on Japan with only a few bombers, but suffered a disastrous defeat. For the United States, which had such experience, the Soviet Maritime Province and Kamchatka had obvious meaning. However, before Molotov's departure, the Soviet newspaper Pravda published a remarkable article on April 13, the anniversary of the establishment of the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Treaty. The article praised the significance of the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Treaty for peace and emphasized that the relations between Japan and the Soviet Union should be strictly in accordance with the provisions of this treaty. This is a very interesting example.

The United States, which used millions of Soviet people to build a Great Wall to resist the powerful German army in order to maintain and expand its imperialist world domination, actually wanted the Soviet people to shed more blood for the war in the Pacific! This hope of simply taking advantage of others is, of course, doomed to fail.

Secondly, in October 1943, the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom held talks in Moscow. Before this meeting, the well-known Soviet bi-monthly magazine "War and the Working Class" discussed the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Treaty and clarified the reasons why it should be respected. Later, the Cairo Conference, which hoped for Stalin's participation, was just a dream of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang; and at the Tehran Conference attended by Stalin, Yu Chiang was excluded. But the issues discussed were more realistic than those of the Cairo Conference.

Regarding this meeting, the British and Americans also exaggerated in the news, saying that due to the British and American assurances to open a second front in Europe, the Soviet Union would also provide military bases in the East to the United States as a reward. However, this "jazz music" was completely overwhelmed by the reality of the world policy march played by "War and the Working Class." The American and John Bull who wanted to ride on the Soviet bear and proceed in the direction they wanted have now completely lost the power to control the bear, and have no choice but to look at the bear's steps on its back in fear. This is the actual situation today! As for Chongqing, which is clinging to the leg of the American, it is, of course, extremely afraid.

The Soviet Union and Japan, which excluded all conspiracies of provocation and strictly adhered to the Neutrality Treaty, continued negotiations in parallel with the Cairo Conference and the Tehran Conference, in accordance with the understanding reached at the time of the signing of the treaty, and finally had the results of today. Regarding this negotiation, the Soviet government organ newspaper Izvestia said: "The establishment of these agreements is proof of the stability of Soviet diplomacy, and it also shows that the Allies in the Pacific have reached mutual understanding."

From this, it can be seen that the northern border of Asia is becoming increasingly clear. What does the clarification of the northern border of Asia mean for Japan's enemies? It is probably unnecessary to say more at present.

### Meningitis in Nanshi Becomes More Rampant

Since the outbreak of epidemic meningitis in Nanshi, the epidemic has not shown any signs of abating, and it is becoming more rampant today. More than 30 cases occurred in the entire district in one day recently. According to the Nanshi Health Office, it was previously only chronic meningitis, and the affected were initially limited to children. Now the epidemic has changed, and acute meningitis has occurred. Both adults and children are infected. If not treated quickly, life is at stake within an hour. Six of the more than 30 cases are adult acute meningitis. Therefore, it is urgently hoped that all citizens in the district, regardless of men or women, should wear masks when going out and get vaccinations to prevent the epidemic.

Short Commentary

### The Precursor to Shanghai's Innovation

Shanghai is the economic and cultural center of the entire country, and besides the capital, it is also a political center. Its superior politics, economy, and culture are sufficient to lead and influence various regions of the country. Therefore, we have consistently advocated that Shanghai should become a model area for politics and a model area for Sino-Japanese cooperation. Recently, we have discussed the necessity and steps of Shanghai's innovation three times. We also believe that the prerequisite for achieving this goal is to improve personnel.

It is very gratifying that at the end of last month, the municipal government appointed Mr. Wu Songgao as the head of the First District Office, and now Mr. Wu has also been appointed as a secretary of the municipal government. At the same time, Mr. Xiong Jiandong has been appointed as the head of the Security Department and the head of the Qingxiang Affairs Bureau. This is the first sound of the municipal government's efforts to improve personnel. If the municipal government can thoroughly implement the policy of employing people based on their talents, then the future of Shanghai's innovation is promising. We, standing in the position of the citizens, are very pleased and grateful to the mayor.

Mr. Wu Songgao is an outstanding talent in China's diplomatic circles in the past ten years. He has real knowledge, upright character, and integrity. He is kind and sincere to others, meticulous in handling affairs, and has organizational and planning skills. In the process of innovating Shanghai, Mr. Wu is an ideal talent to assist the mayor. In the past, he worked hard and achieved considerable results in the establishment of the First District Office and the merger of the two districts.

Mr. Xiong Jiandong is a typical modern Chinese soldier with modern military knowledge. He has an upright character and works hard and practically. He has great ambitions and a strong sense of responsibility. Shanghai is a rear base, and public security is very important. Mr. Xiong's assumption of this important task will surely promote the unification of security forces, which is very gratifying.

With sound talents in the government, there will surely be good political achievements, which can be predicted. The citizens now have high expectations and should give the greatest support. However, the improvement of personnel needs to be comprehensive. Therefore, it is hoped that experts will be employed from top to bottom for the personnel of various bureaus. Secondly, financial transparency, streamlining tax collection, strengthening the economic strength of the municipal government, and improving the treatment of civil servants are needed.

Finally, it must be admitted that the biggest shortcoming in the past was the gap between the municipal government and the citizens. In the future, close ties should be established with the people. Therefore, the prompt establishment of a public opinion organ is an urgent task, so that the municipal government and the citizens can work together to innovate Shanghai and build a new Shanghai.

### Acceptance and Discount System: Banks and Firms Implement Universally; All Industries May Request Contracts

The banks and firms in the silver industry, recognizing that bill acceptance and discount are the main businesses of the financial industry and can make market funds circulate in an orderly manner, have universally implemented the implementation measures established by the silver industry. For example, they have signed acceptance bill discount contracts with the Flour and Wheat Industry Committee and the Grain Control Committee, abolishing fixed-term credit loans and credit overdrafts. Since the trial implementation, it has been quite effective. It is heard that they have decided to further promote it in the future, each contacting and imitating the wheat discount acceptance method and striving to promote it on their own. It is stipulated that all industries may sign a contract with the bank to entrust the bank to accept bills and a bill discount contract, divided into mortgage and credit, for legitimate business needs such as purchasing raw materials. Regarding the issue of the Central Reserve Bank focusing on bill discounts, an agreement has been reached to accept it. Therefore, in addition to being used to adjust positions among various banks and firms, the bills can also be applied to the Central Reserve Bank for rediscount. The accepted and discounted bills are divided into bank acceptance bills, commercial acceptance bills, and commercial promissory notes in two types, A and B. As for the discount rate, it is particularly low to encourage it.

### Insurance Company Capital Increase: Payment Methods

The shareholders of each insurance company shall pay the increased share capital in cash as the standard. It is heard that the payment method is: Each insurance company shall print a three-part payment slip, one for notification, one for bank receipt, and one for record. After each company pays the increased capital to the bank, the bank shall issue a certificate, and the company shall request the Insurance Supervision Bureau to verify the capital with the certificate. The Insurance Supervision Bureau shall use the bank certificate as a verification document and forward it to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for the issuance of a license. The bank shall first issue a certificate to the companies that pay the capital in full first, and the Insurance Supervision Bureau and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce shall also issue licenses accordingly first.

### Yesterday's 11th Regular Press Conference: Discussion of Municipal Issues

The Municipal Propaganda Office held the 11th regular press conference at the Municipal Government yesterday. The questions raised by reporters from various newspapers and the answers from various agencies are recorded as follows:

### Matches to be Distributed Next Week

China Daily asked: "Why have soap and matches not been distributed for a long time? It is reported that a comprehensive distribution method will be implemented from May. In the future, will all allocated items be sold by one designated store?"

Economic Office of the First District Office replied: "The fourth-period household matches have already been received by the designated retail stores and will be sold within next week. The fourth-period household soaps will also be distributed soon. Both matches and soaps of this period have been delayed due to price adjustments. The retail outlets for various allocated items using the new joint-ticket distribution certificates to be implemented from May will be given the same number, based on the number of the retail rice outlet near the residence, so that the residents can also purchase various allocated items at the retail outlets near their residences. However, it does not designate one store to sell them all."

### Nighttime Security Issues

China Daily and New China Daily asked: "The city has implemented permanent light control. Although the provincial government is actively improving the street lights, recent incidents are mostly caused by unscrupulous elements taking advantage of the inspection name to accumulate illegal actions. Does the police authority have any special countermeasures?"

The First Police Bureau replied: "Since the implementation of wartime light control on March 3, some unscrupulous elements have taken the opportunity to commit various illegal acts in the dark, causing citizens to feel uneasy. The Bureau has been actively improving the street lights, and the entire project will soon be completed. Regarding the security aspect, the Bureau has already ordered all subordinate branches to handle it in the following ways: 1. Maintain close contact with relevant agencies such as military police and police of friendly nations, jointly maintain local order, and strengthen public security. 2. Each branch shall increase police presence at night. If necessary, it may transfer staff who work during the day to work at night. 3. All branch chiefs and branch cadres below shall devote their full efforts, day and night, to strengthen on-duty supervision. 4. Order each branch to make full use of the self-defense organization of Baojia District to supplement the lack of nighttime police force.

In addition, strengthen on-duty supervision, and strive to dismiss corrupt police officers. Do your best to assist the police authorities in order to complete the security tasks during wartime light control, so that citizens can live and work in peace.

The Second Police Bureau also replied: "Since the war, most of the residents in the Nanshi area have moved out, and large-scale businesses have not yet recovered. Few of the houses that were destroyed have been rebuilt. The China Water and Electricity Company has not been able to universally install street lights along the Minguo Road and Zhonghua Road due to material reasons. Although there were street lights installed near the entertainment venues in Nanshi when they existed, they were only near that section. Now that they have been closed, the security in Nanshi is reinforced with patrol police every day from 6:00 PM. Special teams are distributed in key areas to check pedestrians, led by branch patrol officers, and not just plainclothes police. Therefore, incidents of taking advantage of the name to carry out illegal activities have not yet occurred."

### Nanshi Air Defense Street Lights

Pingbao asked: "Since the city has implemented permanent light control, there is very little activity at night. The First District Office has increased the reduced street lights. The Nanshi area has very few street lights. Now they have all been turned off, making it very dark at night, which is worrying for public security. Will the air defense street lights be installed in that area?"

The Second Police Bureau replied: "The reason why there are few street lights in Nanshi is due to the China Water and Electricity Company's material issues, which have not been universally installed. The plan for air defense dimming is currently underway. On the one hand, we are advising businesses along the street to implement dimming and continue to operate as usual. For the street lights set up in the alleys, we are also advising them to convert them into air defense lights. As for the security aspect, since the iron gates were opened and the entertainment venues were closed, we are afraid that unfortunate incidents will occur. Therefore, we have increased the police force in the Nanshi Third Branch by more than 100 officers, distributing them in key areas to protect pedestrians at night."

### Cleaning up Nanshi Garbage

Pingbao and Xinwenbao asked: "The garbage in Nanshi is still piled up as before. As the weather gets warmer, the cleanliness of the streets is related to the health of the residents. I hope the authorities will express their practical plans for the future."

The Health Bureau replied: "The Health Bureau is currently ordering the Nanshi District Health Office to actively find ways to clear the accumulated garbage in Nanshi."

### Talking about the Cotton Cloth Rationing for Infants and Children

— Yang Jinzhao

Since the government's purchase of cotton cloth, sales in the market have stopped. The most difficult situation is faced by those in the low-salary class. Adults can still get by temporarily by wearing old clothes and mending them. However, the clothing for infants or children has become a serious problem.

For a newborn infant, if his mother has plenty of milk, he will not have to worry about "being fed." Speaking of warmth, according to traditional customs, old clothes can be used to make baby clothes, swaddling clothes, diapers, etc., which are relatively soft and warm. However, in the current urgent environment, can parents bear to change large pieces of old cloth into small ones when they are busy sewing and mending their own clothes? Therefore, they can only hastily make baby clothes, putting aside the lack of cloth and whether it is suitable for the baby's body. Recently, I often see dead infants abandoned on the road. It is difficult to guarantee that some of them have not frozen to death. I hope that the officials in charge of the unification association will think about the next generation of citizens and the future masters of the country. Whether before or after cotton cloth rationing, they should try to set up special rations for newborn infants, welcome our new people, and facilitate poor parents and pitiful children. I would like to offer a few suggestions regarding this cotton cloth rationing for newborn infants and children:

The cotton cloth rationing for newborn infants should include not only essential clothing, but also swaddling clothes, diapers, etc., in order to meet their needs. Children should be divided into several age groups, and the amount of cloth rationed should be based on their height and size. Within a certain age range, the height and waist circumference of normally developing children should be used as the standard.

Children are not adults; they are little angels whose bodies and minds are continuously developing. Therefore, the material of the rationed cloth should be soft. It should not hinder development and should adapt to natural growth. Secondly, children are naturally active. The rationed cloth should be strong and durable. Also, because of their activity, the color of the cotton cloth should be dirt-resistant.

### Navy

Sky and Sea (4)

I rather unfortunately joined. From Shanghai to Ryojun, to Makung, to Miemo, etc., the inland navigation patrols continued until mid-September. Then it was changed to a navigation that crossed the ocean. However, in the two months before the voyage across the ocean, the candidates had to practice getting used to life on the ship and life at sea.

Regarding this point, it reminds one of the benefits of life at the naval academy. Everything in the ship's life was learned at Etajima. Saturday's cleaning and Monday's inspection were all the same. However, the real people not only learned from the instructors, but also ordered the sailors to implement what they had learned in order to make each of them capable of taking on their own responsibilities.

The candidates in the group were not regarded as students, let alone guests. Although their work was divided into the watchkeeping department and the operations department, the former was no different from the junior officers. From the work of the adjutant, the navigator, the artillery officer, etc., to the work of the deck officer, they had to memorize everything in order. After completing the work from beginning to end, they could be independent like little birds leaving the nest.

Having said that, they still did not have enough courage to order the sailors. The subordinates were subordinates, but the other party was always a senior.

"Attention!" Although they gave such orders, because the sound did not come from the dantian, they could not help but pay attention to themselves. Even if the orders were given without vigor, they were still serious and obeyed neatly. Only such disciplined model soldiers could be assigned to serve on the training team. This point may not have been noticed by most of the candidates.

When they started duty and operations, they felt that what they had learned at Etajima was immediately useful, which really surprised them.

Only the point of surveying the sky was something that was practiced on land at the naval academy. On warships, it was swaying, and it was vastly different from the fixed ground of the campus.

Using a sextant to align with the sun was no longer an easy task. As for the faint stars at night, even a slight sway of the ship would cause them to escape from the field of view of the sextant like flying birds.

After spending a lot of effort to align with it, they would then specify the height to a few degrees, a few minutes, and a few seconds at a few minutes and seconds. They would then repeatedly turn it three or four times to obtain an average. They would then use this to know the position of the warship. However, this calculation was very difficult to do. During the period of unfamiliarity, even if they spent three hours, there would still be errors.

Although the real person was not confident in issuing orders, he was outstanding in surveying the sky. He was skillful and precise in aligning with celestial bodies, and he was also very quick with calculations. This could be proven by his special mathematics since his days as a second middle school student. His operation was completed in about an hour, and his face revealed

"Gu, you fellow, go to the weather station to serve!" The other candidates cursed him with troubled mouths.

I have seen the yellow and turbid ocean. I have also seen the deep blue sea at the entrance to the South Seas. I have also seen the battlefields of Shanghai and Ryojun, as well as the unique scenery of Taiwan. I have also become accustomed to the soda taste of the merchants, the sweaty smell of four people in a room. As for finding many rats and cockroaches on warships, I am not surprised.

"I am not afraid of ordinary storms now," said the candidate Nakano, who lived in the same room, pretending to be an old sea traveler.

"Nonsense! You haven't encountered a serious one yet!" Candidate Kato gave him a head-on rebuttal. Although it was the season of giant storms at sea, they were really lucky.

"Even veteran sailors sometimes vomit!" Candidate Okayama said this because he had already experienced seasickness once or twice.

"That's ridiculous? Whether you are seasick or not, it all comes down to whether you are calm or not," Nakano said, waving a bamboo sword.

"No, it's a physiological phenomenon. In short, there is no good way, you have to get used to it."

Although Okayama said this quietly, Nakano was not convinced. Finally, Kato shouted loudly.

"Nakano! I'm telling you! When you go on a long voyage, you'll cry."

### Hospital Doctors Respond to Providing Free Medical Care

The National Medical Clinic at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Mahou Road is a joint clinic of traditional Chinese medicine that has a good reputation for its achievements. It also provides free medical care and medicine without charging any fees. It is open every day from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM. All poor patients are welcome to come to the clinic for diagnosis and medication. It is particularly good at treating various internal medicine ailments. Dr. Chen Zhichao is specially appointed to be in charge of the free clinic, and Mr. Xin Anzhai is in charge of the free medicine. This is held all year round. In addition, because the number of people in Shanghai suffering from hemorrhoids and anal fistulas is increasing, and fistulas often lead to tuberculosis, free examinations of various anal diseases are offered every morning. In order to benefit the poor, Chen Jinong, a traditional Chinese medicine physician specializing in internal medicine, has specially increased the number of free consultations. Free tickets are issued by this clinic. The limit is ten people every morning from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. The clinic is located at 46 Marang Road, telephone 88448. The Zhonghua Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic at 12 Liucun Street, Jiucang Street, Laobeimen, Nanshi, aims to provide free medical care and medicine to help the poor. In view of the rampant epidemics in Shanghai recently, the people of the clinic have specially set up free injections of meningitis vaccine and vaccinations every day from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, starting from today. Citizens are welcome to go for free vaccinations. Dr. Guan Suishuang's clinic at 4 Shengbao Lane, Wenjianshi Road, will offer free vaccinations for one month starting from today. Poor people can go completely free of charge, without the need for an introduction.

### Free Enrollment in Vocational Training Classes
