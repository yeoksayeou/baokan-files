### Opening of the Medical Congress

The Third East Asia Medical Congress held its opening ceremony in Beijing today, with special lectures to be held in Shanghai starting on the 26th. Over a hundred representatives are attending, bringing together the elite of the medical community from the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to discuss ways to improve the health of all nations within the sphere and to contribute to the Greater East Asia War effort. This will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the future of East Asian medicine. China, as the host of this congress, extends a particularly warm welcome to the attendees. At the same time, from the perspective of the Chinese people, we hope that the distinguished representatives will offer special guidance on two points.

How to advance Chinese medical education and the health of the nation depends on both physical training and disease prevention and treatment. Physical training is promoted through sports. Disease prevention and treatment are the responsibility of physicians, and the institutions that train physicians are medical education facilities. China's modern medical education has a very short history, and after the recent events, many hospitals and medical schools have unfortunately been forced to close. Therefore, in the past, we merely felt the inadequacy of physicians, but now there is a real shortage. On January 31st of this year, the Japanese House of Representatives proposed establishing more medical schools and enrolling more medical students. We further advocate that enemy-property hospitals returned to Chinese management should be immediately used to establish medical colleges, taking the form of independent institutions without large organizations, making them places of education and practice (see the February 5th editorial). The equipment of a medical college is naturally more than that of a single hospital, and basic medical courses are closely related to biology, physics, and chemistry, but it would be easier to improve an existing institution by seeking assistance from all parties to add various facilities. At the same time, we further advocate that allied Japan transfer schools to China, not only in medical education but also in other fields, and medical education is even more crucial to national health. The representatives at this medical congress are all leaders in the medical field and pioneers in medical education, and we hope for their fullest cooperation and support in promoting Chinese medical education.

How to develop public health in China. Historically, wars invariably lead to population decline and increased mortality rates. The highest mortality rates are often not due to direct combat but to diseases indirectly influenced by the war. Among disease-related deaths, the most are often caused by infectious diseases. As the saying goes, "After a great war, there will be epidemics." Therefore, epidemics are a fatal threat to the nation. In recent years, epidemics such as cholera and meningitis have been prevalent, sometimes to the point of being uncontrollable. The people are the foundation of the nation, and the reduction in the number of citizens inflicts the greatest damage on national strength. How to prevent, treat, and isolate these diseases requires immediate planning and implementation. After the war, China's domestic public health research facilities, experimental equipment, specialized personnel, and supplies are all inadequate, and close assistance from friendly nations is needed to promote success.

A Chinese proverb says, "If not a good prime minister, then a good doctor." A good prime minister and a good doctor have different roles but share the same goal of saving the people. Comparing a prime minister and a doctor shows the traditional Chinese emphasis on good doctors. Now that "good doctors" from the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere are gathered together, they will surely save the people of Greater East Asia, and the Chinese people offer their heartfelt blessings.

### Japanese Army Prepares for Major Offensive Against Imphal; Western Heights of Kohima Captured

Central News Agency dispatch from the Burma Front, 24th: Since the start of the operations in Burma and India, time has quickly passed. The Japanese forces approaching the Imphal plain are now reorganizing their formations and preparing to launch a major offensive against Imphal. The Japanese forces south of Imphal are currently compressing the enemy's ring-shaped defensive formation. The enemy troops, concentrated in an area 60 kilometers long and 40 kilometers wide, are launching fierce counterattacks, but the Japanese forces are repelling them each time. When the opportunity arises, they will annihilate them in one fell swoop. The 1st, 49th, and 37th Brigades of the 23rd Division, the 20th Division, the 23rd Division, the 80th, the 100th Divisions and Brigades, the remnants of the 17th Division, part of the 48th, 24th, and 63rd Brigades, and 4,000 enemy reinforcements and armored brigades supplied by air, totaling tens of thousands of troops under the enemy's Fourth Corps, are making extreme efforts to reverse the decline, trying to avoid the annihilation attack of the Japanese forces in the Loktak Lake wetland area. The key roads in Imphal City are fortified with Tretre-style fortresses and multiple layers of fortifications. The rear of the positions in front of the city are filled with barracks for reserve troops. On the 23rd, in front of the Japanese forces advancing from the southern direction of Tinsongkhong and Bishenpur, a brigade of the enemy's 23rd Division and several thousand troops actively prepared for battle in the rear position of Tekchou Nopal under air cover. The formation they constructed was almost entirely a ring-shaped defensive formation like those used in the Arakan campaign, to facilitate aerial resupply in the rear. However, no matter how strong the positions are, they cannot withstand a single attack by the Japanese army.

Central News Agency dispatch from Rangoon, 24th: The five hundred stubborn enemies on the western heights of Kohima were completely defeated by the fierce attacks of the Japanese-Indian Allied Forces by dawn on the 21st. They set fire to the dense forest, trying to escape the encirclement of the Japanese-Indian forces under the cover of the confusion. However, the Japanese-Indian troops disregarded everything and pursued the defeated enemy. By noon that day, they had completely occupied the high ground and were now pursuing and killing the defeated enemy everywhere, launching a major annihilation battle. Thus, after ten days of fierce fighting day and night since the 9th, the enemy's strongholds were also captured, and the battle to annihilate the remaining enemies around Kohima has come to an end. The high ground was the enemy's only position around Kohima. Although the enemy lost the high ground, they deny that the Japanese-Indian Allied Forces completely captured Kohima in order to prevent the morale of their domestic population from being shaken.

### Japanese Offensive in Central and Southern Border Areas of Burma and India Intensified; Enemy Troops Retreating from Mayu Mountains

Central News Agency dispatch from Rangoon, 24th: The Japanese offensive in the southern border area of India and Burma is being launched in coordination with the battle to capture Imphal, and is unfolding step by step. In particular, since the fall of Paletwa, a key point in the Kaladan River valley, on the afternoon of the 20th, the Japanese offensive operations against India have suddenly intensified. The enemy troops in the southern border area of India and Burma deployed the British-Indian 7th and 5th Divisions in the Mayu Mountains at the beginning of this spring as the vanguard for retaking Burma. However, since February 4th, the Japanese army has switched to the offensive, annihilating the main force of the British-Indian 7th Division and containing the 26th Brigade of the British-Indian 5th Division within the Mayu Mountains, inflicting annihilation strikes on them at every opportunity. After entering March, they further attacked the West African 81st Division coming to aid from the south in the Kaladan River valley, and then launched an offensive into India in the central border area of India and Burma. As a result, the enemy, who had repeatedly lost the initiative, panicked. In the first ten days of March, they could only send parachute troops to land in the northern area of Kyauktaw to carry out guerrilla warfare, but these stopgap measures were of no avail. Now, the Imphal plain has become a major bridgehead for the Japanese army to conduct offensive operations against India. The fortress of Paletwa in the Kaladan River valley is also in the hands of the Japanese army, so that not only is the rear of the Mayu Mountains, which was initially relied upon as a base for counterattacking Burma, threatened by the Japanese army, but also the 26th Division of the British-Indian army and the remnants of the 7th Division in the Arakan area are all controlled by the Japanese army, and even the strategic posture of eyeing the Bengal plains and attacking Chittagong is about to be completed. Judging from the recent situation of the enemy, since the Arakan offensive operation this spring, the 5th Division of the British-Indian army, which had been active in the Mayu Mountains, has also been gradually retreating due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese army in the Buthidaung-Maungdaw area. The entire southern front is showing signs of wavering, and the battle situation in that area is becoming even more active.

Central News Agency dispatch from Rangoon, 24th: The Japanese army launched an offensive against the semi-permanent deep positions of the enemy's 20th Division, ten kilometers east of Palel. The fighting was fierce, and finally, the main stronghold of Dankokhar, a key point of the Palel Fortress, was captured, and the enemy troops in the other positions were cleared out. The fortress was completely occupied on the 20th. Since breaking through the central front on the 10th of this month, the Japanese army fought through the night and finally captured the Dankokhar Fortress within ten days. The fortress, like Moréh and Kanglatongbi, is one of the three fortresses of Manipur. After losing Dankokhar, the main force of the enemy's 20th Division in Palel successively assembled their main force in the second-line positions near Seibom, eight kilometers southeast of Palel, attempting to defend the last line of Palel. However, after occupying the high ground of Dankokhar, the Japanese army was able to overlook the enemy's positions and control the fate of the enemy in Palel.

### Southeast Asia Command Issues Statement, Reveals Complete Distress

Central News Agency dispatch from Guangzhou, 24th: The fact that the war correspondents of the anti-Axis Southeast Asian Army were dissatisfied with the authorities' censorship and announced that they would stop writing war reports in the future has completely exposed the enemy's distress and deeply embarrassed the Southeast Asian Army authorities. According to a broadcast from Chongqing, the Southeast Asian Army Command issued a statement on the 22nd in response to the protests from the press, the gist of which is as follows: Five war correspondents have protested to this command regarding the issue of censoring articles. At that time, this command explained that the censorship of articles was an order from our superiors, and that anything that contradicted the current situation was not allowed to be published. The reporters were deeply dissatisfied with this explanation, and this command feels extremely apologetic. Since its establishment, this command has done its best to facilitate the work of journalists. Both this command and the 14th Army Command have established press sections, and the front-line commands have also provided recreational facilities for journalists. Therefore, Major General Wingate also sought special conveniences for journalists during secret operations. Recently, this command moved to Ceylon Island, and the censorship of news articles is now carried out at this command. Therefore, the department has specifically set up two dedicated telegraph machines for journalists. From this, it can be seen that this command has always considered the convenience of journalists in the midst of its difficulties.

### Various Constructions on the Philippine Islands are Progressing Rapidly; Agricultural Production Increases and Mining Restored to Original State

Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 24th: Under the leadership of President Laurel of the Philippines, various constructions have made considerable progress, and efforts are now being made to complete a self-sufficient economy, process specialty products, and enhance strategic materials. The current status of construction in various regions is as follows: The fertile fields of the Cagayan Plain in northern Luzon are still in the process of being developed. Due to transportation difficulties since the outbreak of the war, at least hundreds of thousands of tons of rice, tobacco, corn, and peanuts have been stored there. It is reported that before developing the area, a certain company is making every effort to transport out the stored materials and expects to complete the transport soon. At the same time, cotton production in the area is also quite good. Luzon is also being developed. Abaca and coconut trees are the representative products of southern Luzon. Manila hemp is growing everywhere. After the independence of the Philippines, the purchase price of coconuts was adjusted, and the production of essential goods was increased, with exceptionally good results. The development of mineral products in the Bicol region of northern Luzon is also proceeding smoothly. Because it is very easy to import timber to Manila, a large amount of timber has recently been exported. Large-scale shipyards in various places are also working hard day and night. The Bicol region has actively launched a food self-sufficiency campaign, so there is no problem with food. In the Visayas region, before the war, agricultural specialties such as sugarcane accounted for 70% of the total production of the entire Philippines. Rice and other agricultural products are mostly from the islands of Samar and Leyte, which are also making every effort to increase food production, so the Visayas region is expected to achieve food self-sufficiency this year. The mineral facilities in various places have almost completely restored their original appearance. Before the war, industry in the Visayas region had operated various factories such as Surigao coconut oil and sugar manufacturing. After the war, they actively implemented plans to increase alcohol production and gradually revived industries such as burlap sacks, soap, and coconut charcoal. Recently, the textile and tobacco industries have also begun local production. At the same time, sawmills are being added to the Bicol region to expand the shipbuilding industry. The Mindanao region, known as the "Philippine Treasure House," is exceptionally rich in various natural resources such as coal, steel, and other mineral products, Manila hemp, cotton yarn materials, other agricultural resources, timber, and aquatic products. Recently, given that Manila hemp is an important military supply resource, a large-scale increase plan has been formulated for this. Several oil tankers were launched this year. The manufacture of wooden ships is also expected to increase several times this year. In addition, aquatic products centered on Tabasam is more prosperous than before the war. The processing of soy sauce, dried fish, and other foodstuffs is an important part of the Southern Army base industry. Recently, a thorough food production increase campaign was launched, so a considerable increase in harvest is expected this year. In addition, a certain coal mine has been started for excavation by a certain mining company, which will surely make a major contribution to the industrial world of the Philippines in the future.

### Air Raid on New Ireland, Eight Enemy Planes Shot Down

Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 24th: On the 22nd, a fleet of 50 enemy fighter-bombers attacked Kabienge, New Ireland. As a result of the Japanese military's interception, six were shot down and two were destroyed. Japanese losses were minor.

### Burma Commemorates Martyrs, Hopes to Spark National Patriotic Thought

Central News Agency dispatch from Rangoon, 24th: In order to elevate the national consciousness of the Burmese National Army, the Burmese authorities have launched a hero recognition campaign throughout the country. On the 22nd, a hero recognition ceremony was held in Rangoon to commemorate the martyrs who engaged in the Burmese independence movement. During the ceremony, Defense Minister Major General Aung San swore an oath, stating his determination to carry on the legacy of the martyrs, establish the Burmese National Army, and honor the patriots who died in prison for resisting the British, the soldiers who died in the India-Burma War, and the generals who defended Burma during the Konbaung Dynasty, in order to spark the patriotic thought of the entire Burmese people.

The Japanese Army's Fierce Battle Record on the India-Burma Front

The Japanese army's elite troops have been attacking into India for several days, pressing the enemy in the mountain pass at the entrance to the Imphal Plain south of Manipur, engaging in fierce battles, and gradually breaking down the strong resistance of the British-Indian army with a spirit of courage and advance regardless of fatigue. The hardships are difficult to describe. At the start of the operation, each unit filled bamboo tubes with several days' worth of rations and set off with water. Not to mention weapons and ammunition, they carried more than usual, as they had long anticipated the difficulties of the advance. In the dry season, water is extremely scarce in the Chin Hills. The cavalry units used up all the water prepared in the bamboo tubes for the horses and were forced to trek several kilometers to mountain valleys to draw water, exhausted from marching. To avoid enemy aircraft, the march was always carried out at night, making the dark, densely forested mountain paths extremely difficult to navigate.

Packhorses and cattle often lost their footing and fell into the valleys due to excessive fatigue, and enemy aircraft often appeared at dawn and dusk when cooking. Extinguishing the cooking fire due to the sound of airplanes was commonplace. There were seven instances of cooking half-cooked rice. The Chin Hills, at altitudes of 6,000 to 8,000 feet, are very cold, yet the peaks of Kennedy Peak, Tiddim, Tonhe, and Sanguelchega were all captured.

Clothing and Provisions Piled Up Like Mountains

In the enemy positions, there were winter overcoats stained with blood, tattered uniforms, and coarse wool blankets. The soldiers advancing in summer uniforms had to battle the severe cold. Aside from ammunition and rations, the only defense against the cold was a tent. In addition, they could only use winter items abandoned in the enemy positions. These were all abandoned due to the advance. The soldiers, filled with burning fighting spirit, gnawed on hard bread, endured the cold and dryness, overcame all difficulties, and pressed on the enemy.

The main enemy positions captured with such great difficulty had piles of abandoned clothing and provisions like mountains. Canned cheese, butter, dried beef, jam, fruit, vegetables, flour, potato flour, etc., were all made in America and Australia. The attacking troops, running out of supplies, were greatly delighted to receive these gifts from Churchill and Roosevelt. However, they still had to pursue, continuing the arduous and lacking march.

The battle results continued to expand, and the fate of the British-Indian army grew shorter day by day. (Translated from the April 17th issue of the Western Asahi Shimbun)

Indian National Army Carries Out Surprise Attack

Under the sudden rain in the Chin Hills, the Indian National Army and the local Chin hillmen they were leading passed through the dense forest and launched a surprise attack on the enemy brigade headquarters. This was a surprise attack to advance toward the Kabaw Valley. The Indian National Army unit, with only a few members, dared to engage in such a brave surprise attack, which shows the flaws in the enemy's appeasement policy. The various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia are now recognizing the path they should take through their own experiences. At dawn on March 26, the enemy brigade headquarters was preparing to move from its campsite in the village of Khaikoi, 30 kilometers southwest of Tamu, but was discovered by local tribesmen in the vicinity.

The disciplined and lean Chin people, familiar with the dense forests of the Kabaw Valley, detoured around the enemy brigade headquarters, traversing mountains and wading through rivers. The Indian National Army followed behind, secretly waiting for an opportunity, when a sudden rain fell. The entire force took the opportunity to launch a surprise attack. The caught-off-guard enemy, completely unprepared, scattered and fled. They seized 38 hand grenades hidden in the dense forest, 5 large landmines buried underground, 420,000 rounds of large automatic rifle ammunition, 6 rifles, 200 large landmines, 50 bundles of canned food (60 cans per bundle), and many other rations. Securing the key points of the Kabaw Valley made it easier for the Japanese army to advance without hindrance. The only casualty was one Chin hillman killed by an enemy patrol.

### Chongqing Currency Problem Becoming Increasingly Serious; Launching Savings Program to Absorb Floating Capital

Central News Agency Report: According to reliable sources, Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance of Chongqing and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China, has been working frequently to digest government bonds, encourage national savings, attempt to absorb floating capital, and tighten the currency supply. However, based on past experience and inferences, it is extremely difficult to achieve. This year, Chongqing issued 100 trillion yuan in government bonds, and the total amount of government bonds issued before was 98 trillion yuan. In addition, there were 20 billion yuan in US dollar bonds and 17 billion yuan in local government bonds transferred to Chongqing. However, the amount digested only reached 20%, so the only option is to increase the amount of legal tender issued to maintain operations. Therefore, even though every year

Paper Money Gradually Increases

The amount issued is extremely alarming. According to the amount of paper money issued by Chongqing in 1940, it was 39.62 billion yuan. There has been no official announcement since then. However, occasional disclosures have been made in Chongqing magazines and newspapers. Based on this combined statistics, the currency issued in Chongqing increased by about 280 billion yuan by 1942, and then increased by another 200 billion yuan by April 1943. Based on this ratio, it is estimated that the current amount of paper money in Chongqing has increased to about 1 trillion yuan. The Chongqing authorities, recognizing that the impact of currency inflation on industry and commerce is extremely large, have recently made every effort to enable the general public to

Implement Savings

The national savings target for this year has been set at 229 billion, in order to implement monetary tightening. The measures are as follows: Compulsory savings will be implemented in each province, with quotas set at 40 billion yuan for Sichuan Province, 20 billion yuan for Chongqing City, 30 billion yuan for Yunnan Province, 12 billion yuan each for Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Shaanxi, and Gansu Provinces, and varying amounts of 6 billion, 8 billion, and 50 million yuan for other regions. The largest amount is for Sichuan, totaling 60 billion yuan. Taking Chongqing City as an example, with a population of 600,000, it would be required to save 20 billion yuan, which means that each person would have to save an average of 3,200 yuan per year. Achieving this goal

Will Be Difficult

The National Savings Movement in Chongqing began in 1941, and by August 1943, the total amount of national savings in two and a half years was 60 billion yuan, of which Chongqing City accounted for 20 billion yuan, with the remainder being national savings from other provinces and cities. However, it is now required to achieve the total amount of national savings from the past two and a half years within one year, which will certainly be fraught with difficulties. Amid these difficulties, the phenomenon of currency inflation will occur as a result. Furthermore, the increased presence of the US military in Chongqing has resulted in most of the US dollars being converted into local currency for use. Therefore, Chongqing is maintaining operations through currency inflation. In view of this, the currency problem in Chongqing will become increasingly serious.

The German Air Force also launched intense bombing raids on England. The German aircraft shot down a total of 113 enemy aircraft in defensive air combat last night. The Allied side believes that the current aerial bombing is a "attrition warfare phase" before the offensive. German personnel are silent on this issue but believe that the Allied plan will suffer a second defeat like Cassino and can maintain composure in the face of the calm before the storm.

The transmission results are excellent, and it has been decided to manufacture five receiving machines in late July to be placed in various newspaper offices in Tokyo and begin using them in early August. In addition, the scope of use will be expanded to various locations at home and abroad. The characteristics of the "text telephoto machine" are introduced as follows: The principle of the machine is similar to the current photo telephoto, the difference being that it cannot transmit light. A single line can be used simultaneously for transmitting text and communication, and even the most complex characters can be clearly transmitted to various locations. Its purpose is to enable news to be quickly transmitted to various newspaper offices and government offices.

### Japanese Matsumoto Library Discovers Song Edition of Former Han Dynasty History

In the book depository of the Matsumoto Municipal Library, a 100-volume "Song Edition of the Former Han Dynasty History" (the last volume is missing), which is not available in China and only exists in one copy in Japan, was discovered.

In addition, there are also the Yuanhe movable type edition of "Zhenguan Zhengyao" in ten volumes, the Takamatsu edition of "Sui Shu" in twenty-five volumes, and 115 valuable books brought from China. The "Song Edition of the Former Han Dynasty History" is a rare book worth 10,000 yen at current prices, and the Yuanhe movable type edition is a rare book worth 1,000 yen at market prices. According to the director of the Sanzai Pavilion, the origin of this rare treasure in the Matsumoto Library is as follows:

Origin of the Treasure

The discovered "Song Edition of the Former Han Dynasty History" was published in the fourth year of Emperor Lizong of the Southern Song Dynasty, making it a rare book from 740 years ago. It is feared that there are only one or two copies in Japan. The book has a inscription indicating that it was collected in the Cheng'en Temple. Cheng'en Temple is located in Yamazaki, Yamashiro Province, and its founder was the teacher of the temple's founder, Kizan Ennen. The founder of Tofuku Temple, Saint Ichikokushi, entered the Song Dynasty in the first year of Kajo and returned to the country in the second year of Ninsei (703 years ago), bringing back 10,000 volumes of books. This book may have been among those brought back at that time. As for its arrival in Matsumoto, according to the record in the "Jingji Fangu Zhi," it was collected by Kariya Ekisai, a modern collector of Han books. Judging from the style of the binding, it also seems to be a collection of Ekisai. At the end of the Edo period, Matsubara Hosai, a Confucian scholar of the Matsumoto domain, obtained this book while studying in Edo and donated it to the library. The book is of particular importance in bibliography and can be truly regarded as a national treasure. (Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, April 14th)

### Course of the Mutiny of Three Greek Warships

Ankara, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency, a Cairo dispatch: The mutiny of three Greek warships serving on the Allied side was a demonstration in favor of organizing a leftist new Greek government in exile. According to news from Cairo, after the message of the resignation of the Tsouderos cabinet was issued, the Greek destroyers "Apostolis," "Lelas," and "Souktoris" mutinied. On April 7, the three ships refused to depart. When a British liaison officer boarded the ships, he saw that they were controlled by a committee. The committee members stated that they would carry out orders once a new government was formed. On the same day, 200 Greek sailors ashore locked themselves in a military prison, blocked it with objects, and refused to leave. According to the latest news, the Greek mutineers have been disarmed.

### No Hope for Peace Between Finland and the Soviet Union - Finland Announces Course of Negotiations

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Helsinki, the Finnish government announced on the 23rd that it had rejected the Soviet government's armistice terms. The communiqué first clarified the facts that Finnish President Paasikivi and Foreign Minister Enckell visited the Soviet Union on March 27 and considered the armistice terms of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. It then stated that the Finnish government had unanimously acknowledged the attitude expressed by the Finnish government in the message of April 11 with the above conditions at the National Assembly on April 12. The contents of the reply to the Soviet government were as follows: After careful consideration of the Soviet government's conditions, the Finnish government realized that some of the conditions were technically impossible to implement, and if these conditions were accepted, then the conditions proposed by the government regarding the preservation of Finnish independence. After reviewing the conditions, the Finnish government determined that there was no hope of concluding permanent peace conditions between the Soviet Union and Finland, which was regrettable.

Stockholm, 24th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: According to the Associated Press news carried by the local newspapers, Moscow expects the US government to take diplomatic action on the Finnish issue soon. It is said that this move will be warmly welcomed by the Soviet side. The Soviet side believes that the maintenance of diplomatic relations between the US and Finland does not provide Finland with spiritual support. Therefore, it demands a change in US-Finnish relations.

Contents of the Terms Include Six Points

Helsinki, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to reports: The Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov submitted the armistice conditions to the Finnish delegation, Paasikivi and Enckell, which contained six points: 1. Break off relations with Germany, detain German troops and vehicles in Finland, or send the troops and vehicles out of the country by the end of April at the latest. To implement the above two measures, the Soviet Union can provide Finland with military assistance. 2. Restore the Soviet-Finnish Treaty of 1940 and withdraw Finnish troops to the border of 1940 in stages, with the withdrawal completed by April. 3. Immediately release Soviet and anti-Axis prisoners of war and detained civilians. If a peace treaty rather than an armistice treaty is signed, then an exchange of prisoners of war will be held. 4. Restore 50% of Finnish troops in the middle of May, and then reduce the Finnish military strength to pre-war levels in June and July. This article will be added to the peace treaty, or a separate special agreement will be signed in addition to the peace and armistice treaties. 5. Compensation for damages and occupation of Soviet territory caused by Finnish military operations must be paid at 600 million yuan within five years. This compensation will be paid in goods, such as paper, cellulose, and seagoing vessels. 6. According to the peace treaties of 1920 and 1940, the Soviet Union will return to Finland the Petsamo region and its jurisdiction. If Finland accepts the above six conditions, the Soviet Union can unconditionally waive the right to lease Hanko and its surrounding areas.

### German, Hungarian, and Romanian Forces Make Progress in Counteroffensive - Soviet Attempt to Cross the Upper Dniester River Fails

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports: According to responsible sources, the German troops now fighting west of Stanislav and Ternopil, that is, the troops that the Soviet Union recently claimed were completely surrounded, the activities of the German, Romanian, and Hungarian troops have significantly improved the situation on the southern route of the Eastern Front. The armies of the three countries have continued to advance east in the upper reaches of the Prut River and between the Dniester and in the Bukovina region. The Soviet attempt to cross the flooded Dniester River at Tiraspol failed. The Soviet cavalry and infantry surrounded between Brody and Kovel are about to be annihilated. The German army suddenly attacked the upper Styr River in the Pripyat area and achieved considerable gains. The German army advanced 15 kilometers to the south and occupied many populated areas. German war correspondent Trudel described the fighting in the Pripyat marshland, saying that there was no clear front line in the area, only a series of strongholds. The Soviet army had to attack head-on if it wanted to advance. The German army fighting in the forests and swamps of the area was constantly on guard against the enemy and was better at guerrilla tactics.

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: It has recently been learned from the German military that the Hungarian army occupied the city of Kuty (west of Chernovitz in northern Romania) on the 23rd and then advanced from the Kolomyia region (border between the old Polish border and the Romanian border). South of the Dniester River, the German army repelled the stubborn Soviet army and gained further expansion, thwarting the enemy's counterattack supported by tanks.

Another report: The Soviet army launched an offensive on several locations in the Sevastopol war zone on the same day, with the protection of a large number of tanks and fighter aircraft. The German army won a complete victory in the offensive and defensive battle and destroyed 57 enemy tanks.

### National Essence Revolutionary Movement in Central and South American Countries

— Gao Ming

Since Argentina's declaration of war against the Axis powers on January 16, the United States has been self-satisfied and confident that it has completed the domination of the entire Americas. However, how do we explain the political changes that have taken place in Central and South American countries one after another? Starting with the success of the national essence faction of young military officers' revolution in Argentina, followed by the armed revolution of the "violent coup" by the Paraguayan renovationist officers' corps, the unsuccessful revolutionary incident in Colombia, and the occupation of the capital by the revolutionary army in El Salvador, etc., all indicate the continuous occurrence of armed revolutions initiated by the national essence party and the renovationist officers' corps. Prior to this, Bolivia had the successful anti-government revolution in which the National Revolutionary Party and the military jointly conspired, and Peru also discovered an unfulfilled revolutionary incident. The tide of national essence revolution is now spreading throughout the Americas, and the political situation is extremely turbulent.

1. Opposition to the United States

We believe that these national essence revolutions that have attacked Central and South American countries are entirely consistent in their opposition to the United States using覇道 to dominate the Americas. The immediate cause of the rise of revolutionary factions in various countries is the government's blind following of the United States, the loss of diplomatic autonomy, and the US monopoly of the domestic economy leading to social instability. These situations have caused the people of South American countries to harbor full resentment towards the United States. Even judging from the current demands of the revolutionary groups in various countries to dismiss pro-British and pro-American cabinet members and suppress pro-British and pro-American political parties and other elements in the country, this fact can be clearly understood. Moreover, taking Argentina as an example, the establishment of the Farrell government meant rejecting the US demand for a declaration of war against the Axis powers and striving to restore diplomatic autonomy. At this time, it was rumored that Argentina was the first to promote the progress of the customs union movement among Chile, Uruguay, Bolivia, and other countries, which is a development of the economic autonomy movement of South American countries and is worthy of attention. How bitterly the United States is watching these national essence revolutions! What despicable retaliatory measures are taken against the new governments of Argentina and Bolivia! There is undeniable evidence for these things. At a time when the United States believed that it had completed the domination of the Americas, Central and South American countries even quickly launched an anti-American movement. It seems that the depth of anti-American sentiment in the American countries is unexpected. However, those who know the reality of the pro-Central and South American policies promoted by the United States under the 美各 of "Good Neighbor Policy" and "Joint Defense" believe that the anti-American sentiment in the American countries is not surprising. Everyone knows that the United States, in the political field, disrupts and destroys the party politics of various countries, seizes the opportunity to interfere in internal affairs, and in the military field, occupies the strategic points of various countries and obtains the right for the US military to station at any time, using all means to infringe on the sovereignty of the American countries. To explain these facts, for example, the United States has rapidly and massively absorbed all strategic materials and engaged in economic plunder of the entire Americas, but the weapons lending law and economic assistance that the United States guarantees to the American countries are completely empty checks. This is clearly manifested in the trade between the American countries and the United States. In 1942, the trade surplus of South American countries with the United States reached a huge amount of 271.1 million yuan, but in 1943, it reached 290 million US dollars in the first half of the year alone. Central and South American countries actually bear more than 60% of the US war 　resources, but the materials supplied by the Jiang country, only fuel, are only 40% of the normal needs. The result of this unilateral plunder by the United States has fueled inflation in Central and South American countries, worsened the general economic situation, seriously affected the food problem, and even sown the seeds of oppressing the lives of the people and causing social unrest.

Demand for National Autonomy

The resistance aroused by this economic plunder and the pressure of political sovereignty by the United States is a manifestation of the unavoidable demand of Central and South American countries for national independence. If the Central and South American countries succumb to the US霸道 and blindly follow, the domestic political friction will inevitably intensify, and the domestic economic system will inevitably collapse. The increase in social unrest, even the development of social revolution, will be an inevitable result. Therefore, in order to maintain the life of the country and hope for future development, Central and South American countries should quickly change their attitude of dependence on the United States and restore an autonomous and independent national policy. The current national essence movement clearly has this meaning and deserves our respect.

### Non-Staple Foods Will Have Restricted Flour Rationing - Flour and Wheat Special Committee is Drafting Measures

Since the Flour and Wheat Special Committee of the Commercial and Trade Association implemented the unified purchase and distribution of flour and wheat, the purchase and distribution work has been proceeding very smoothly, because the unified system is perfect and flour and wheat merchants can operate under a　　scheme. In addition to granting household flour rations on a regular basis, the committee also handles special flour rations for industries such as cut noodle, flatbread, and fried dough cake industries in order to take into account the business of the relevant food industries in various regions. The Commercial and Trade Association has now approved the plan of the former Ministry of Food to strictly regulate the method of flour rationing for cakes and non-staple food raw materials in order to conserve them. The Commercial and Trade Association has transferred this to the Flour and Wheat Special Committee for verification and handling. It is reported that the Flour and Wheat Special Committee has already studied and stipulated the method of restricting the raw materials for cake and non-staple food rationing. Flour used for fancy pastries will not be rationed, while flour required for biscuits consumed by ordinary people will be rationed in an appropriate manner. Once the method is drafted and submitted to the Commercial and Trade Association for approval, the relevant canned food industries will be notified to comply.

### Sino-Communication and Other Banks Form Syndicate to Buy Spring Cocoons - Total Amount Approximately 100 Million Yuan

The spring silkworms in various regions of Central China and Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have all begun to be raised, and new cocoons will soon be on the market.

In order to support the development of the silk industry, the banking community in the city has consulted with silk manufacturers and other parties on joint loans for cocoon purchase, and the principles have been determined. The total amount of loans is approximately 100 million yuan, and dozens of banks, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Xinghua Bank, Huaxing Bank, Dalu Bank, Jincheng Bank, Yanye Bank, Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, and Zhejiang Industrial Bank, will participate in the joint organization of the syndicate, allocating the loan amount to be undertaken. The borrowing silk factories include China Silk Industry Co., Ltd., Dali Silk Industry Co., Ltd., and other general small silk factories. All members of the Silk Industry Association have the right to borrow, but the association must provide proof and guarantee. It is reported that this syndicate loan will be made in the form of acceptance drafts, and the Central Bank of China has allowed the handling of this loan's actual discount.

### Director Matsudaira Discusses - Opening a Second Front - Germany Prepared and Unafraid

Mr. Matsudaira, Director of Information at the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, met with reporters from various Chinese newspapers in the city at the Hua Mao Hotel at 3 PM yesterday (the 24th). Regarding the question of opening a second front, he expressed the following views: The reasons why Britain and the United States have not yet opened a second front are as follows:

The Soviet Union demands that the Curzon Line be the border between Russia and Poland. This line was proposed by the British Foreign Secretary during World War I, so Britain and the United States have no choice but to agree to the Soviet Union's request. However, the Soviet Union's attitude is strong, and Britain and the United States are somewhat fearful.

Recently, an Italian Communist who had resided in the Soviet Union for more than 20 years returned to his country and is active in the Badoglio government. As a result, Soviet Russia's influence in the Badoglio government has greatly increased.

Yugoslavia has two governments, one leaning towards Britain and the United States, and the other leaning towards the Soviet Union. Recently, the government leaning towards the Soviet Union has greatly increased in power as a result of the activities of its leader, Tito.

Britain and the United States have suffered military setbacks in India and Italy, and the situation in the Near East is becoming increasingly unstable. The British government's ability to open a second front is therefore greatly constrained. Germany is prepared to cope with the second front, and has dispatched a large army to the possible areas where the British might open a front, awaiting the enemy's forces. The German military is adept at land warfare, so the Germans are unafraid of the opening of a second front. U.S. Secretary of War Stimson recently warned the American people that the losses from the American opening of a second front would be incomparable to previous losses, and that the people must be fully prepared. British Prime Minister Churchill also gave a speech, forcefully stating that the overall air force remains as strong as ever, and that the second front will not appear in the shortest period.

### Post Office Issues New Fixed-Denomination Postal Money Orders

The Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has noted that the highest denomination of the various fixed-denomination postal money orders currently sold is only 100 yuan, which is insufficient to meet public demand. Therefore, it has specifically printed two new fixed-denomination postal money orders of 200 yuan and 300 yuan, which are distributed to various post offices for sale. The bureau's announcement is recorded below: "In order to meet public needs, two new fixed-denomination postal money orders of 200 yuan and 300 yuan have been printed and are being sold at the same time as the existing fixed-denomination postal money orders of 5, 10, 15, 20, 50, and 100 yuan. The remittance fee for these fixed-denomination postal money orders is lower than the remittance fee for ordinary postal money orders, and the procedures for application and payment are also simpler than for ordinary postal money orders. When applying for a postal money order, the remitter only needs to verbally state to the issuing clerk the amount of the postal money order and where it is to be remitted. After the issuing clerk hands the postal money order to the remitter, the remitter writes the name of the payee on the postal money order and then seals and mails it to the payee. If there is an airmail route in between, the letter containing the fixed-denomination postal money order can also be sent by airmail so that the payee can receive the remittance as soon as possible, without having to pay extra for airmail postage as when applying for an ordinary postal money order. After the payee receives the fixed-denomination postal money order, they only need to sign and stamp it on the back of the postal money order, and they can immediately go to the paying office to collect the remittance. Unlike the procedure for ordinary postal money orders, there is no need to wait for the paying office to receive the verification slip (i.e., the stub) sent by the issuing office before the remittance can be paid. For other details, please inquire at the post office.

### Zhang Jinhai Case - Appeals of All Defendants Announced - Sentences Reduced According to Amnesty Ordinance

The Zhang Jinhai tragedy, since the trial by the former Special First and Second Court, resulted in Guo Shiyuan, Wang Shu, and Zhang Guiqing being sentenced to life imprisonment, and Zhu Songcheng and Li Hongda being sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment. All defendants expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict and appealed to the High Court, which held three hearings. Yesterday (the 24th) at 3 PM, the case was announced by the presiding judge of the High Court's Criminal Division, Du Fuyue, and Lu Fei Sheng. Police officer Chen Jingyi also attended the court to perform his duties. The presiding judge immediately announced that the original trial verdict was overturned. According to the National Government's Amnesty Ordinance, Wang Shu and Zhang Guiqing's sentences were reduced to twelve years of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for ten years. Zhu Songcheng and Li Hongda's sentences were reduced to seven years of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for five years. Guo Shiyuan's sentence was reduced to ten years of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for eight years. If the defendants are not satisfied, they can appeal to the Supreme Court within ten days. After the verdict was announced, Guo Shiyuan was stubborn and continued to argue unreasonably with the court. The presiding judge ordered him that if he was not satisfied, he could appeal, but he should not say more. The court adjourned at around 3 o'clock, and the defendants were escorted back by the bailiffs.

Since the trial implementation, the results have been very good. The branch bureau chief, Yao Rui, and others have also instilled spiritual education into the model police.

### Insurance Companies Increase Capital - Procedures for Deposit and Withdrawal Established

The Insurance Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, in order to improve the organization of insurance companies, has been approved to handle the increase in capital of insurance companies.

The deadline for increasing capital is from January to the end of June of this year, after which the capital increase procedures must be completed. A total of 89 insurance companies in the city need to carry out capital increases. Recently, insurance companies have been ordered to handle capital increase procedures very actively. It is now known that in order to facilitate the capital increase procedures of various companies, the following procedures for depositing and withdrawing capital increase funds for insurance companies have been drafted: The company should contact the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank Western District Office to open an account (the account name is the capital increase fund of a certain insurance company). After the company has fully paid the capital increase funds, it should submit a bank certificate to the bureau to verify the capital.

### For the Dangerous Future of the Securities Market

From the beginning of this year to the present, the market price of Chinese stocks has plummeted, and the trend is continuing. At the same time, commodity prices are still high, and the money market is extremely tight and interest rates are extremely high, so that the entire economic market, although not collapsing, has already formed a depression that has never been seen since the Greater East Asia War.

The stock market is a decisive factor in the prosperity and decline of the modern market, which is beyond doubt. At the same time, stock investment and stock speculation are also decisive factors in whether or not a capital market can be established. Originally, the task of the stock market, especially during wartime, is to not only manage the funds of enterprises, but also to supply the industrial capital market. If the stock market is completely based on speculation, it is better to have no securities market.

Stock speculation is a phenomenon that should never exist in a normal capital market. Once this phenomenon occurs, stock prices will be in turmoil, and the securities market will never have a peaceful day. Shanghai is a society that is habitually speculative, with those above influencing those below, and deeply ingrained habits are difficult to change. Because of this, the Chinese Securities Exchange, which has the mission of establishing a Chinese capital market, should shoulder the responsibility of being a pillar in the middle stream, and should not follow the tide to survive unnecessarily. Otherwise, why do the elites in the industry advocate that the exchange should be run by the government? In short, since the securities market and the national industry are interdependent, the widespread and unreasonable surge and fall of securities should not be ignored. Furthermore, during the period of insane surges, it should not listen to the speculators who stir up trouble, and during the period of terrible declines, it should not allow the speculators to throw stones down the well. In addition, the inside and outside of the exchange mechanism must be completely sound, and it should not inherit the bad habits of the corrupt officialdom of the past, and only know how to be selfish and self-serving. Otherwise, who will worry about the dangerous future of the exchange market!

### The Truth About Wartime Japan: 100 Million People United as One, Victory is Life

The 100 Million Japanese People Under Harsh Wartime Conditions, Taking the Same Steps as the Government's Announced "Emergency Measures Outline," Their Fighting Spirit Against America and Britain is Intense. There is No Distinction Between Front and Rear Lines Now. I Spent Three Years in China, and Upon Returning to My Homeland, I Was Amazed by the Drastically Changed Rear-Line Decisive Battle Life. Every Citizen Overcomes a Life of Hardship and Scarcity, Determined to Stake Their Lives for the Survival of Their Ancestors, Marching Forward to Overthrow America and Britain. Because of This, Japan is Strong! I am Extremely Grateful. Although the Japanese Residents in Mainland China, Such as Shanghai and Beijing, are Taken Aback by the Soaring Prices, They Can Still Live a Life of Adequate Food and Clothing. Now That I Have Returned, I Will Describe a Glimpse of the Rear-Line Decisive Battle Life That I Have Seen and Experienced in the Imperial Capital, For the Overseas Chinese Gentlemen in China:

Visiting the Imperial Palace Before the Nijubashi Bridge

In Order to Visit the Imperial Residence. Coming from the Province. The Streetcar... Near Nijubashi, The Provinces... Even on Sundays, Special Representatives Often Come. Inside the Crowded Streetcars, More Than Half are Women, Dressed Simply and Neatly. They... Center... A Group... Also, No One Plays Games and No One Steals Things, Because "To Increase the Number of Airplanes, Electricity Must Be Conserved." Generally, Families Turn Off the Lights at 10 PM. Walking on the Gravel Road to the Nijubashi Bridge, Regardless of Rain or Snow, People Constantly Come to Pay Homage. The Conscripted Men Wearing Badges on Their Chests Especially Attract Attention. The Lush Green Pine Trees Stand Tall Against the Sky. We Look Up at Them and Cannot Help But Be Moved. We Have No Other Thoughts, We Only Feel Reverence in Our Hearts. The People Around Us Must Think the Same. Especially for the Brave Warriors About to Embark on Their Journeys, the Thought "Japan Will Surely Win, and Absolutely Will Not Be Defeated" Arises Spontaneously, Just Like in Front of the Yasukuni Shrine.

Observing the Lives of Citizens, When I Was Living in Shanghai, Many People Who Came Back From Japan Told Us About the Dire Electric Power Situation and the Shortage of Materials Such as Clothing During Wartime. It Seemed Like the Homeland Was in a Worrisome State. However, Upon Returning, I Found That Neither the Cities nor the Villages Were Lacking in Clothing. Clean Clothes. Someone Said That... Chinese Coolies. All Lies. Especially the Young People, They Adapt to the Situation, Wearing Long Pants, Working Actively. The Women Encouraging Labor Everywhere Contribute to Enhancing Combat Power. They Are Agile and Their Expressions Are Bright. For Everyday Meals, They Cook Millet, Soybeans, and Brown Rice Together. Having Just Returned From Shanghai and Being Accustomed to Eating Rationed White Rice, I Felt Uncomfortable at First, But Unconsciously I Got Used to It. The Ration is 2.3 合. At First, People Felt That It Was Not Enough, But Now They Don't Feel That Way Anymore. There Are Also Many People Who Adopt a Two-Meal-a-Day Diet. Also, For Single People Who Have Food Coupons, They Can Eat Out When Mealtime Comes.

A Single Life is Not at All Difficult

On March 5th, the "Emergency Measures Outline" Was Announced, All Waiting Rooms and High-Class Restaurants Partially Stopped Business. High-Class Cuisine Can No Longer Be Eaten. However, the Government Guarantees the Minimum Standard of Living. Single People with Dining-Out Tickets Cannot Eat Exquisite Food, But They Can Eat Their Fill. I Have a Friend Who Returned From the Southern Front Lines and Recently Got Married. He Said That the Rationed Amount is Enough. Originally, Japanese People Prefer Coarse Food and are Vegetarian. Moreover, There is Occasional Beef and Pork Rationed, So They Can Live a Comfortable Life.

Women and Children Diligently Work

When Walking on the Street, You Can See Young Ladies Helping Various Military Stations Carry Goods. Also, School Children Help Dig Shelters in Open Spaces. Because They Hold the Thorough Belief That Enemy Aircraft Will Not Wait For Us for Even a Moment. On the One Hand, The Girders of Bridges, The Iron Stairs of Department Stores, The Elevators in Western-Style Buildings, and Water Faucets Have All Been Dismantled, Providing A Lot of... The Iron Shutters of Stores Are Also Very Useful. Department Stores of Six or Seven Floors Have Reduced Their Merchandise to About Three or Four Floors, and The Things Sold Are Limited to Necessities of Wartime Life. Now, All Unmarried Women Up to the Age of Forty are Mobilized to Devote Themselves to Labor. A Certain Young Lady I Know, Just Graduated From Girls' School, and Hoped to Go Directly to a Military Factory. She Didn't Want to Be a Bank Clerk. Her Father and Mother Gladly Sent Her There.

Now, The 100 Million Japanese People Are United as One and Marching Forward. Because We Must Achieve Victory, We Must Overcome Any Suffering. (Former Shanghai Correspondent of the Mainichi Shimbun, Shimao Sei) (Translated by Xian From the March 22nd Mainichi Shimbun)

### Reader's Scholarship News

Woolen Fabric Store Owner Treats People with Loyalty and Forgiveness, To the Attention of the Shen Bao Scholarship Office: Last September, My Wife Was Supporting My Daughter When Passing by Yicheng New Woolen Fabric Store at the Corner of Foch Road and Tongfu Road, She Carelessly Bumped Into the Bicycle Placed in Front of the Store, Shattering the Large Glass. The Store Owner Came Out, Not Only Did He Not Scold Her Harshly or Demand Compensation, But He Comforted My Wife in a Very Sincere and Friendly Manner, Telling Her Not to Panic. The Store Owner Reprimanded Any Staff Who Complained. When I Arrived, the Store Owner Only Asked to Send 100 Yuan in Savings to Your Newspaper as a Scholarship Fund, to Benefit Society. I Was Overjoyed and Thanked the Store Owner and Left. I Intended to Offer the Money Immediately, But Unexpectedly, the Situation Has Changed Endlessly in the Past Six Months. I Was Running Around and Could Not Rest. Recently I Returned to Shanghai and Passed by Yicheng New Woolen Fabric Store, I Suddenly Remembered...

### Concerning the Shanghai-Ningbo Transportation

— Nie Shi

Before the War, the Shanghai-Ningbo Transportation Was Known to Be Convenient. All Shipping Companies Competed to Attract Passengers. Currently, However,

The Number of Ships Has Decreased and the Sailing Time Has Been Extended

Before the War, There Were 7 or 8 Ships Running on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line; They Sailed Daily Without Interruption, Reaching the Destination Every Other Night, Without the Suffering of Long Stays and Waits. Currently, Only Two Ships Maintain the Route, But the Sailing Time Has Been Extended. This is Because the Ships are Often Stranded in Shanghai and Ningbo. Of Course, At This Time of Wartime Tension and Lack of Ships, We Often Extravagantly Hope for an Increase in Ships. However, We Hope That the Shipping Companies Will Consider the Method of Sailing Between the Two Places Every Day Before the War. If This Can Be Implemented, It Will Be Equivalent to Increasing the Number of Ships.

Tickets Are Difficult to Purchase and the Black Market is Skyrocketing

Because There is Not Enough for Everyone, a Black Market Has Emerged. The Black Market Ticket Prices Are at Least Five Times Higher Than the Prices Set by the Shipping Companies, and Up to Ten Times Higher. These Black Market Tickets Are All Sold by Various Travel Agencies (Or Black Market Brokers), While Those Who Purchase Tickets Directly From the Shipping Companies Often Fail to Obtain One, Even After Waiting for a Long Time. Here, We Cannot Help But Wonder Whether These Black Market Tickets Are Intentionally or Unintentionally Created by the Shipping Companies, and the Travel Agencies' Sale of Black Market Tickets is Also an Illegal Transaction. Moreover, Most of the Buyers of Black Market Tickets Are Small Merchants Who are Seeking Profit. They Only Seek to Buy Tickets and Do Not Care About the Price. However, Ordinary Travelers, Even if They are Willing to Pay a High Price, Cannot Obtain Black Market Tickets. Therefore, Cracking Down on Black Market Tickets is Essential to Solving This Problem. In Addition to Prohibiting Illegal Transactions by Travel Agencies, There is No Other Way Than to Sell Tickets Directly to Travelers by the Shipping Companies in a Fair Manner.

The Ship is Crowded and Hinders Hygiene. In Principle, One Ticket Should Correspond to One Berth. In Reality, Even if You Have a Ticket, You Still Need to Pay a Berth Fee to the Room Attendant (Varying From 200 to 300 Yuan). Even if You Have a Berth, You Definitely Cannot Stretch Out and Sleep Comfortably, Because There Are Passengers With Tickets But No Berths Around You. The Crowded Situation is Worse Than That on a Train. We Still Remember the Past Ships. Even if a Tragedy Does Not Occur, With Summer Approaching and Epidemics Prevalent, the Hindrance to Hygiene is Self-Evident.

It is Heard That the Shipping Company Authorities Have Adjusted the Prices of Ship Tickets (Starting on April...), About 200% to 300% Higher Than the Original Prices, in Order to Eliminate Black Market Tickets. If This Price Adjustment is Said to Improve the Transportation Situation, Then It is Too Optimistic. I Am Afraid That the Tide Will Rise and the Boat Will Rise, Only Causing Suffering to the Passengers. We Believe That the Fundamental Problem Lies in Improving the Ticket Sales Method. In Principle, It Can Be Based on the Following Points: Tickets Should Be Sold Directly by the Shipping Companies, Not Through Other People; Ship Tickets Should Be Sold to Legitimate Travelers (The Method Can Imitate the Railway Method, Limiting the Description and Weight of Passengers' Luggage); One Ticket Should Correspond to One Berth (The Company Should Train the Tea Houses, Not to Solicit Extortion, Not to Make Things Difficult for Passengers, and the Tea House's Small Account Can Be Added to the Ship Ticket). If the Above Points Can Be Realized, Then Our Ningbo Fellow Villagers Will Definitely Celebrate.

### Navy

— Iwata Yu Translated by Hong Yang

(This is Pearl Harbor!)

The Real People All Know That They Know This Point tacitly. However, When the Scenery of Pearl... Was Opened, The American Automobile Driver Soldiers Intentionally Increased Their Speed. Under the Constant Hindrance of Coconut Trees, Civilian Houses, Hills, etc., The Real People Focused on Looking Closely.

(There is the "Enterprise" Ship!)

On the Green Sea Surface, There Floats an Aircraft Carrier Like the Back of a Squid.

(There is also the "Indian Police" Ship!)

The Real People Remembered This Ship Type in Their Hearts. In Addition, There Are Two or Three Destroyers.

(Oh, It's the Scouting Fleet!)

Then He Paid More Attention to Watching, and Increased the Nervous Tension During the Martial Arts Competition.

After a While, He Was Very Happy. He Was So Happy That He Wanted to Hide Under the Floor of the Car-

(Ten)

On the Day of Departure, Iwate Invited Japanese Residents to Hold a Hometown Banquet. The Real People Also Led the Whole Family of the Doctor Who Took Care of Them in Many Ways, Visited Model Shops of Fish Rice and Dumplings, and Also Visited the Kendo Competition with War Prizes.

However, His Heart Was Very Incompatible With the Laughter Around Him. This Was Not Because of the Disgust Caused by the Happy and Vain Descendants. It Was Because the Feelings After Seeing Pearl Harbor Were Reflected on the Heart Board Again.

At Three O'Clock, the Hometown Banquet Was Over, and the Invited Guests Became the Senders, Building a Black Wall on the Shore.

"Hello, Hey! I Wish You a Safe Journey!"

The Doctor Still Spent a Lot of Money to Buy a Bunch of Expensive Fresh Flowers and Draped Them on the Shoulders of the Real People.

The Departure Time Came, and the Sound of the Bugle in the Ship Echoed Through the Clouds. The Candidates, Arranged in a Team on the Deck, Performed the Salute of Cheering on the Shore. After a While, the Fleet Departed for Hilo, Hawaii. The Doctor's Figure Waving His Hat on the Car Cover Gradually Became Smaller. When It Drove to the Outside of the Port, It Stopped Slightly to Let the Pilot Disembark. The Fishing Boats and Speedboats That Sent the Farewell, Flying Long Banners to Send, Gathered Around This Ship.

### Radio Fee Problem Reply from the Broadcasting Association

Regarding the Letter From Mr. Yan Jie Xiong Published in the National Forum on April 18th, We Hereby Answer the Following:

Recently, When Collecting Wireless Radio Subscription Fees, the Situations Such As Loss of License and Change of Radio Owner Have Increased Significantly. Therefore, We Have Set Up an Inquiry Office to Speed Up the Handling of Procedures. This is Because the Subscription Fee System is Still in Its Initial Stage, and Listeners Are Still Unfamiliar With the Laws and Regulations. Therefore, the Inquiry Office Was Established. As for the Procedures and Fees for Replacing Lost Licenses, There Have Been Notices Posted. We Believe That There Will Be No Improper Behavior Such As Collecting Tips.

In Addition to the Internal Staff of This Department, There Are Also Field Staff. Most of Them Are Chinese. If, As Mr. Yan Said in His Letter, There Are Rumors of Collecting Tips, Then It Must Have Occurred Between Chinese Staff and Chinese Listeners. This is Due to Mutual Lack of Self-Respect, Which is Very Regrettable. Therefore, If There Are Any Requirements in Addition to the Prescribed Fees, Please Reject Them Immediately and Report...

In Addition, Regarding the Three Proposals Mentioned in Mr. Yan's Letter, The Answers Are As Follows:

It Seems Possible to Pay for Listening with a Temporary License, But the Number of the Temporary License is Different From the Number of the Formal License. If Temporary Licenses Are Used Exclusively, It Will Be Quite Difficult to Handle the Procedures. Therefore, It is Necessary to Apply for a Formal License Again With the Temporary License, But There is No Need for a Guarantor.

The Reason for Requesting the First Payment Slip From the Previous Period is Because When the Formal License is Lost, Or When the Month of Payment is Unknown, It Must Be Referenced. Therefore, It Must Be Properly Preserved.

Taking This Opportunity, I Would Like to Say Something Special. Please Pay Special Attention to Each of You, "Broadcasting is Set Up for All Listeners." Therefore, In Order to Clarify the Broadcasting Business, Please All Listeners Comply With Half of the Responsibilities So That There Are No More Unlicensed Radios and the Elimination of Bribery and Other Behaviors. We Hope That All Listeners Will Cooperate. Sincerely. Shanghai... Radio Station Listening Section.

Brown Rice is Better Than White Rice Perseverance Turns Weakness Into Strength Healthy Person

People Who Live in Shanghai Used to Eat White Rice. For Brown Rice, They Always Said It Was Rough and Difficult to Swallow. However, In Terms of Food, Often the Expensive and Delicious Foods Are Not the Most Nutritious for the Human Body. On the Contrary, If You Can Eat Green Vegetables, Tofu, and Brown Rice Every Day With Perseverance, It Will Be More Nourishing Than Any Delicacy. This Is Because In Brown Rice, All Kinds of Nutrients Are Basically Available. Healthy People Can Make Their Bodies Stronger, and People With Weak and Sick Bodies, If They Can Develop a Love for This Kind of Brown Rice and Often Maintain a Sweet Taste, Then Weak Bodies Can Regain Health. Ding, A Great Doctor in Our Country, Eats Brown Rice as the Only Good Way to Strengthen His Body and Personally Follows It. Therefore, Even Though He Is Now in His Old Age, His Body is Strong and His Spirit is Full, Which is Even More Than That of Ordinary Young People.

Based on My Experience, Since It Has Been Difficult and Expensive to Buy White Rice, I Have Changed to Eating Brown Rice. I Feel That My Body is Stronger Than Before. I Have Not Been Sick Once in One or Two Years. This Is Probably Thanks to Brown Rice. Therefore, I Do Not Secretly Covet It, But Make It Public to the World. Although It Is an Old Saying, It Is Still a Practical and Beneficial Method.

### Wooden Spinning Machine Experiment Report

Reading Mr. Zhu Shuxun's "Advocating Native Yarn and Native Cloth Should Improve the Wooden Spinning Machine" on April 22nd, I Also Have the Same Feeling. Regarding Wooden Spinning Machines, Advertisements for Sale Are Often Seen in the Market, But The Results Have Not Met Expectations. I Have Worked Hard on Research for More Than a Year, and I Have Recently Made Some Progress. The Twist is About Equal to 16 Count. This Machine is Made Entirely of Hard Trees, and Materials Can Be Obtained Everywhere. Each Machine Has 60 Spindles. It Works 10 Hours a Day. Each Spindle Can Spin 1 Ounce of Yarn. Each Machine Can Spin 60 Ounces of Yarn. The Above Output is Still Managed by Inexperienced Female Workers. If The Training Is Purely Skilled, Then The Output Can Still Be Increased. Now, Spinning and Weaving Have Begun in the Countryside, Achieving the Goal of Spinning and Weaving Ourselves. Those Who Are Interested in Joint Research, Please Send a Letter to Liu Zhenyao, 439 Yuyao Road.

### New Puyutang Various Departments Equipment

Nursing Home When People Reach Old Age and Have No Means of Support, They Are Taken in by the Hall. Those Who Are Physically Stronger Help With the Hall's Affairs. There is One Large Dormitory and One Dining Room. In the Dining Room, There Are Also Long Tables and Long Benches, Providing Them With a Place to Sit and Relax or Sew After Meals. The Number of People is 64 Men and 70 Women.

Poor Hospital There Are Two Male and Female Wards, Each of Which Can Accommodate 250 Patients. The Equipment is Perfect, Tidy, and Clean. Although It is Free, It Can Compete With the City's Charging Hospitals. In Terms of Numbers, There Are 84 Men and 69 Women.

Outpatient Department Every Time Medicine is Prescribed, About 200 People Come to Seek Treatment, All of Whom are Poor People in the South City. Those With More Serious Illnesses Are Also Given Free Hospital Stays.

There are Three Meals a Day, Congee in the Morning, Rice at Noon, and Noodles in the Evening. They Eat Vegetarian Every Day, and Sometimes There is Meat. Recently, Because of the Soaring Rice Prices, There Has Been Some Panic About Not Having Enough Rice to Cook.

### Self-Police Pavilion Should Be Kept Clean Do Not Become a Beggar's Dormitory

Since the Establishment of the Baojia System, Self-Police Posts Have Been Set Up at Self-Police Group Positions. Some Were Purchased Through Fundraising, and Some Were Donated. The Former Were More Common. In Terms of Quantity, There Was One Pavilion for Each Lianbao in the First Eight Districts. Because the Area Divided by the Lianbao in the First District Was Wider, The Number of Pavilions Was Also Increased. Each Lianbao Had Three, Four, or Five Pavilions. The Use of Setting Up Police Pavilions is to Provide a Place for Self-Police Group Members to Rest and Shield From the Wind and Sun. The Law is Very Good. However, Chinese People Lack Civic Virtue. They Arbitrarily Damage Public Property (Self... Pavilion). The Baojia Chief Sees This, But Doesn't Care at All and Doesn't Protect It At All. It Is As If This Is Not My Thing, Just a Formality. As a Result, Some of the Police Pavilions in Each District Are Incomplete. Some Have Broken Glass, Some Have Missing Windows, And Even the Seat Boards and Shelves Have Been Stolen. The Door Locks Are Not Wide and They Fly Away. Fortunately, The Police Pavilion Has Not Been Moved Away, Which is Considered Great Luck. People Temporarily Borrow a Night's Stay, (Every Crystal Constantly) In the Morning, When the Group Members Go to Their Posts, The Beggars Are Still Sound Asleep and Snoring. When They Are Driven Away With Sticks, They Start to Stagger Away. Over Time, White Wind Gathers in the Pavilion, and Those Who Are More Evil Even Defecate in It. The Foul Smell Touches the Nose and Makes People Want to Vomit. If Group Members Place Themselves in the Pavilion, It is Almost Impossible Not to Contract an Infectious Disease. Moreover, In The Future, The Days Will Be Warmer, And The Harm Will Be Even Greater. We Urgently Hope That the Responsible Personnel of Each Lianbao Will Clean It Up, Wash It Once a Week, And Repair the Broken Windows and Broken Glass as Soon as Possible, and Install Door Locks. Every Night, the Self-Police Group Members Responsible for the Last Drop Are Responsible for Locking Up, So That Beggars Cannot Enter, and Investigate Those Who Damage It and Punish Them With Several Times the Price of Repair, So That The Pavilion Can Maintain Its Due Cleanliness.
