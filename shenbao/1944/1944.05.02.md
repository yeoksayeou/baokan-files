### Requesting Government Incentives for Agricultural Production

Since the 26th year of the Republic [1937], much farmland in rural areas has been left uncultivated. Although there are no comprehensive and accurate statistics on the total area of cultivated land, according to partial surveys by various economic organizations, there has been a considerable decrease compared to before the 26th year of the Republic. This situation has not yet returned to its original state. From the perspective of increasing production, this is of course an urgent matter that needs to be addressed. However, in recent years, comparing the types of crops, rice ranks first, wheat ranks second, and then cotton. Before the 26th year of the Republic, the area planted with cotton was greater than that planted with flour, the opposite of the current situation. The main reason for this is that grain prices have risen sharply in recent years, making rice cultivation more profitable than cotton cultivation. This trend is a natural result.

However, since the implementation of grain control, farmers have felt that the purchase price is too low, coupled with the malfeasance of the purchasing personnel who oppress them, making it unprofitable for them. As a result, they have gradually adopted a negative attitude towards planting grain.

However, the former change from planting cotton to planting rice can still be seen as an adaptation to needs from the perspective of the grain problem. There is still something to be gained. The latter, from the perspective of increasing food production, is a very serious problem. If measures are not taken to remedy it urgently, a fundamental crisis in the food problem will occur. The impact will be far from being made up for by empty words, and it will be impossible to save it in the short term.

According to actual field reports and observations, in recent weeks, during the time when farmers are planting rice, their psychology is generally hesitant. Planting rice, they feel oppressed by the low purchase price and cannot muster any interest. Planting cotton, they fear they will not be able to solve the food problem for themselves and their families. After experiencing pain, they are torn between conflicting choices, which may lead to two results. The first is to reduce the area planted with rice to avoid the discomfort of low-price purchases. The second is that even if they plant rice, they will adopt a passive attitude, unwilling to work diligently, only producing enough for themselves and their families, and not bothering to work hard, which is tantamount to doing it for nothing. Both of these results create a serious crisis of reduced food production. This year is the year of increased production proposed by the government, but isn't this going in the opposite direction? In fact, the production of flour and food is already insufficient to maintain the previous amount. If there is a further trend of reduced production, the insufficiency will be even greater. Wouldn't this be heading towards self-destruction?

Therefore, whether from a theoretical or practical standpoint, we believe that the current period of farmer hesitation in choosing crops is the most critical opportunity for the government authorities to guide them to the right path. If appropriate guidance is not given, the opportunity will be lost, and it will be too late to save the situation. It is like eating a chicken or eating eggs, which is more beneficial? If you want to eat eggs permanently, you must protect the health of the hen. If you want to eat the chicken and kill it, then there will be no way to get eggs. If you want to eat the chicken and kill it and still want to eat eggs permanently, it is impossible. We believe that rather than killing the chicken to eat it once and not being able to eat eggs permanently, it is better to eat eggs permanently and keep the hen alive. Therefore, we propose:

First, we request the government authorities to promptly order military organs to instruct all units in all regions to prohibit direct purchases of grain from farmers, and to issue a notice to the people to make this known. The military's grain can be collected and distributed uniformly by unified organs at reasonable prices. At the same time, we hope that the Allied military authorities will fully assist and also issue an order to prohibit similar direct purchases. This will reduce the threat and panic experienced by farmers in their minds.

Second, the necessary amount of grain purchased must be calculated based on the costs incurred by the farmers. The calculation should include the labor portion of the farmers and provide some profit to ensure they can realistically benefit. This will reduce the biggest emotional blow to farmers.

Third, the method of controlling grain has been implemented for several years, and it is undeniable that it has failed and is not in line with the current environment. Recently, valuable opinions from experienced people believe that, in addition to purchasing military grain as necessary, calculating the most reasonable price, and adopting the most fair method, entrusting local authorities and local chambers of commerce to directly purchase from farmers, the remaining rice and flour for civilian consumption can be released from control and freely circulated and bought and sold. In view of the painful experience of past control, in view of the current reactionary trend, and even more in view of the serious crisis in the future, this is indeed a point worthy of review and consideration.

The three points mentioned above are the last opportunity for urgent measures, and cannot be delayed. These three points are prerequisites. Only after they are resolved can we talk about increasing production. If we ignore the prerequisites and talk about increasing production, we are simply dreaming.

### Confusion Around Imphal; Brave Japanese and Indian Troops Inflict Heavy Damage on the Enemy; Six Enemy Aircraft Shot Down Near Meiktila

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain base on the Indian front, the main force of the stubborn enemy's 20th Division and a part of the 23rd Division, totaling about 12,000 men, who were defending the deep position east of Imphal, began a full-scale retreat on the night of April 28th. They are currently retreating from various mountain peaks towards the Imphal pass. Currently, enemy retreating troops are seen everywhere around Imphal, and they have fallen into a state of confusion. The elite troops of the Japanese and Indian armies are fiercely attacking these enemy troops, inflicting heavy damage on them. One unit of the Japanese army broke into a corner of Height 4562, 2 kilometers northwest of Dinobal, while another unit circled behind the Sebaum position, fiercely attacking about 3,000 enemy troops between Sebaum, Senani, and Height 4562. These enemy troops possessed 2 15-centimeter howitzers, 8 12-centimeter howitzers, 7 mountain guns, and other mortars. The Japanese army has caused them to collapse and suffer heavy losses. Furthermore, one unit of the Japanese army advanced to Falburn, 10 kilometers west of Imphal, annihilating the stubborn enemy in that area. Another unit of the Japanese army shelled about 1,000 enemy troops on the Tamu-Wagyu road. The Indian National Army is also coordinating with the elite troops of the Japanese army, advancing rapidly, threatening the enemy's retreat route. In short, the operation to annihilate the enemy around Imphal has reached its climax.

Rangoon, 1st (Central News Agency) – On the Burmese front, the Japanese army's fighter squadron intercepted about 30 enemy aircraft that came to attack the vicinity of Meiktila on the morning of the 29th, shooting down one enemy P-24 aircraft and five other types of aircraft. The remaining enemy aircraft fled. The Japanese side suffered no losses.

### Smooth Operations by Japanese and Indian Troops Inflict Heavy Blows on the British Side

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – Because of the smooth operations of the Japanese and Indian troops in Imphal, they have inflicted heavy blows on the enemy in terms of strategy, economy, and politics. The enemy has not only lost an important strategic stronghold, but the connection between the north and south has also been severed, and the only Bengal-Assam railway in the north is under serious threat. At the same time, the development of the Chungking bloody road has also been halted. Now the initiative in operations and strategy has been seized by the Japanese and Indian troops. In terms of economy, the petroleum produced in the fertile areas of eastern and northern Assam accounts for about 76% of the total production in India, and 300,000 tons of coal are produced annually. The industries in these areas have also been halted due to the smooth progress of the operations of the Japanese and Indian troops. The tea production in the northern plateau area of Kunming will also be halted, and the largest military industry areas, such as the raw material supply areas for coal, manganese, and ore in Bihar and Orissa, are now within the scope of Japanese military action. Therefore, not only can the military production and combat power of India be dealt a fatal blow, but the combat power of the eastern Indian provinces themselves can also be weakened. The anxiety and embarrassment of the British and Americans have been increasingly magnified due to the advance of the Japanese and Indian troops towards Bengal. In terms of politics, the Indian people in the rear are in great confusion because the British and Indian troops have been defeated in all battles and have learned that Jiang Jieshi has formed the Indian National Army. As a result, strikes, slowdowns, and demonstrations are endless, and riots such as tax resistance movements and obstruction of traffic have occurred one after another. They first destroyed the railways, and scattered anti-British leaflets with slogans such as "Long Live Free India" and "Long Live Jiang Jieshi" in the stations and trains of the Assam-Bengal railway. As for strikes and slowdowns, they started in factories and farms. Furthermore, many residents of eastern India are migrating to other places due to strong anti-British sentiments, creating a chaotic phenomenon of social unrest. Indians are scrambling for large quantities of food, which is driving up prices and causing a shortage of materials. It is rumored that the National Congress Party still exists and is engaged in various activities. In order to suppress this, the British authorities have dispatched troops to maintain order. On the other hand, movements against feudalism and the oppression of feudal lords are becoming increasingly active in the native states. In addition, the people are burdened too heavily due to the war, and food is scarce, so the social and political unrest is gradually intensifying. Not only can the British not get financial and military assistance from the native states, but they also feel threatened by the joint front formed by Indians, including British Indians and the native states.

### Reasons for British Failure in Kaladan Area Operations

Kaladan, 1st (Central News Agency) – The enemy, having suffered a disastrous defeat in the first Arakan campaign, has adopted new and bizarre tactics in Kaladan. They are using African blacks accustomed to forest warfare as the vanguard to reduce the sacrifices of British soldiers, utilizing air transport for ammunition and supplies, and deploying machine guns and mortars in mountainous and treacherous areas, attempting to exhaust the Japanese army with attrition tactics. This is the so-called strategy of Mountbatten and his ilk. However, the swift operations of the Japanese army have left no room for these tactics to be effective, inflicting a devastating blow on the enemy. They are overcoming treacherous roads with new and bizarre artillery, advancing bravely, and inflicting heavy damage on the enemy, causing even the black troops to be terrified. All of this is a manifestation of the excellent strategy of the Japanese army and is worth writing about in detail. The Japanese army primarily eats rice, while the British army's food is mainly wheat, so the production of wheat and rice also has a significant impact on the war situation. It is impossible to produce large quantities of wheat on the narrow plains of the Arakan Mountains and the Bixian Mountains, which stretch for thousands of miles. However, the British army did not consider this at all and still launched an attack on Kaladan, which is one of the reasons for their own failure. Since the beginning of the Arakan campaign, the British army's supply replenishment has relied entirely on air transport, with seven or eight Douglas aircraft flying back and forth every day. However, apart from ammunition, weapons, and British officers, the number of supplies transported for the black soldiers was very small, which caused dissatisfaction and riots among the blacks, and this was also one of the reasons for their failure. Most of the food dropped by the enemy by parachute consisted of bread, Australian dried beef, dried milk, American potatoes, Alaskan salmon, various jams, and tea, all because India had difficulty transporting them. In particular, in the dense forest area of Kaladan, it is necessary to open roads before fighting. The British army found it extremely difficult to open airports and roads, and any that were opened were quickly occupied by the Japanese army with their swift operations. The enemy's main firepower was mortars, but their power was completely lost when they encountered the new artillery of the Japanese army. The Japanese army, which has entered Baretwa, is still advancing through the dense forests of Arakan. The enemy's dense forest tactics will be rendered useless under the swift advance of the Japanese army. At the same time, the Japanese army in southern India and Myanmar will also shine because of the victory in the north.

### Flood Control in Java

Bandung, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Java Military Administration Department has recently formulated a three-year plan for flood control on the Citarum River, which will be implemented soon. Officials from the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Priangan Residency have conducted on-site inspections on the 25th. The river is a major river flowing through the Priangan Residency and the Banyumas Residency in western Java. The upper reaches are rare dense forest wetland areas. During the rainy season, the river floods, causing significant damage to the surrounding farmland. More than 20 years ago, local residents requested the Dutch government to build a drainage project, but this has not been realized to this day. A dozen years ago, the local county government completed a 3,000-hectare irrigation and drainage project along the river, but it failed to prevent disasters. Therefore, this time a new plan has been formulated. In the first year, it is planned to complete several hectares of drainage and reclamation projects. After completion, it will not only benefit the residents, but also make a great contribution to increasing food production in Java.

### Inferior Equipment of American Aircraft Proves Material Shortages

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – Because the United States has suffered excessive aircraft losses, its efforts to increase production have resulted in a situation of shoddy and reckless manufacturing. On March 23rd, during an enemy air raid on Saipan, a bomber was shot down in the northwest sea. After it was salvaged, the shoddy aircraft manufacturing in the United States today could be seen from the aircraft's construction. The flight helmet worn by the deceased pilot could only protect his cheeks, the flight suit he was wearing was tattered and dilapidated, the parachute seemed difficult to open and was made of artificial paper, and there was no food carried in the aircraft, only a few emergency medicines. If even their well-equipped aircraft are like this, it is enough to see the current situation of severe material shortages in the United States. Because they are doing their best to mass produce, the quality of the aircraft is extremely poor. Although their bulletproof glass is still considered strong, the equipment of American aircraft is far inferior to one ten-thousandth of that of Japan.

### MacArthur Does Not Participate in the Election

### Preface to the Reprint of Yoshida Togo's Collection of Essays

— Chen Bin

The Shenbao published the first collection of Yoshida Togo's essays, 3,000 copies. Within a few months of publication, it was snatched up. From this, we can see the extent to which the general public values Yoshida's essays. Each of Yoshida's articles has a special fervor that is enough to awaken the resonance of every Chinese reader. In particular, it is because he has conducted in-depth and serious research on Chinese issues, understands the crux of the matter, and expresses his opinions, so he can naturally grasp the hearts of the people.

Yoshida's articles are not only loved by Chinese readers, but also by every Japanese friend who truly cares about Sino-Japanese relations and the future of East Asian national unity. Because from his articles, one can more clearly understand China and more correctly understand Sino-Japanese relations and the path that should be taken in the future. Therefore, when the Japanese version of Yoshida's collection of essays was published, it was also snapped up by Japanese people. We deeply feel that, for the sake of China and Japan, articles like Yoshida's are of greater value for more widespread dissemination.

Yoshida's essays have reached the point where they are eagerly read by people from all walks of life in China and Japan. However, he never makes hasty statements. The greater part of his time is spent on scholarship and research. He listens to the opinions of the Chinese people with an open mind and humility, and even accepts opposing criticisms with the same objective spirit and sincerity. We are fortunate that Japan has such a political commentator, and we are even more fortunate to have such an expert and scholar who earnestly studies and promotes Sino-Japanese relations. Although we deeply know that China currently lacks such people, if the authorities on both sides study and adopt Yoshida's essays, it will surely make an even greater contribution.

As Yoshida's supplemented collection of essays is published, we cannot but congratulate Chinese readers. We hope that Yoshida's spirit of diligence, fair attitude, and the great righteousness of his essays can generate a greater impact among Chinese and Japanese people. April 29th.

### Close Relations Between Japan and the Philippines; Economic Cooperation Further Strengthened; Manchukuo Emperor Received Aquino and His Entourage Yesterday

Manila, 1st (Central News Agency) – The reconstruction of the Philippines after the war, after six months of efforts since independence, is becoming increasingly consolidated. Since the visit of the delegation led by National Assembly Speaker Aquino to Japan, the relationship between Japan and the Philippines has become even closer. Ambassador Aquino, as the former Vice President of the National Labor Service, has been consistently supporting President Laurel since independence, and can be said to be the Vice President of the new Philippines. The accompanying members, including Chief Justice Yulo of the Supreme Court, Finance Minister Alas, and Vice President Osias of the Labor Service Corps, are all authoritative figures in the new government. As the Information Bureau announced, the delegation represents the Philippine people in expressing their gratitude to Japan for their support of independence, and in observing the posture of Japan under the decisive battle, to learn from it for the reconstruction of the Philippines. The visit of the Speaker and the Finance Minister implies that they will cooperate further on important tasks such as strengthening economic cooperation between Japan and the Philippines and transporting wartime materials to the Philippines in the future. The reorganization of the Labor Service Corps into a single political party, successfully gathering the total power of the nation, is a epoch-making innovation in Philippine politics. In today's wartime, the dissolution of the old political parties and the elimination of political party ideology are necessary for the construction of the new Philippines and the gathering of national power. Based on the above points, the newly formed Labor Service Corps will first engage in instilling the spirit of Eastern culture into the people and launch a vigorous national mobilization movement. At the time of independence, the Service Corps recognized the draft constitution, elected the President and members of Congress, and assumed the great task of giving birth to the new government. Now, to ensure the cooperation of the entire nation with the government, President Laurel has been appointed as the President, and it has been decided to implement a new outline. In the future, under the leadership of Laurel, the Service Corps will be responsible for the ideological guidance of the nation. The newly established Economic Planning Board is the supreme advisory and planning agency for the Philippine economic policy. Its primary goal is to achieve the national emergency policy of food self-sufficiency. Chairman Roxas is an outstanding figure in the Philippine political world and an economic authority. The other members are also heads of various ministries related to the economy or prominent figures in the economic world. Due to the strengthening of its lineup, it has become the highest economic authority in the Philippines. The Planning Board has established a Rice Advisory Committee, chaired by Roxas himself. Policies on rice production and distribution will be established. Roxas, who had previously refused to directly take on work due to ill health, is now boldly taking on the responsibility of the important national policy of food, and his attention and skill in handling it are highly anticipated.

Xinjing, 1st (Central News Agency) – Philippine National Assembly Speaker Aquino, along with Supreme Court Chief Justice Yulo, Finance Minister Alas, Agriculture Minister Alunan, and Executive Secretary Osias, visited the National Founding Shrine and the Loyalty Tower at 9:48 AM on the 1st. At 11:30 AM, they visited the Imperial Palace. His Majesty the Emperor granted them an audience and hosted a luncheon at the Jiale Hall. His Majesty the Emperor has always been enthusiastic about the friendship between Manchukuo and the Philippines. Aquino and others were given preferential treatment during their visit.

### When Will the Invasion of Europe Be Launched? Various Speculations Abound; Some Believe May Is the Most Suitable Time

Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency): The issue of the Second Front is currently causing a great deal of noise, leading to increased tension in the European atmosphere. Currently, both German and Allied forces are striving to prepare for a decisive battle, forming a confrontational situation across the Dover Strait. The British mainland is one of the bases for the invasion of continental Europe, so in the past month, various extraordinary measures have been taken. In addition to prohibiting diplomats from entering and leaving, the departure of the general public was also banned on the evening of the 27th of last month, resulting in a state of blockade. The purpose of this move is to distract the German forces, causing them to misjudge the situation, and to achieve the effect of psychological warfare. It also shows that the Allied forces are determined to launch a Second Front. Regarding this matter, a commentator from the London Times stated that, considering the situation in the Dover Strait and the combat season in Western Europe, May would be the most suitable time to launch the Second Front. Furthermore, many reserve aircraft have not yet been deployed, which also poses a difficult problem. The military correspondent of the London Times stated that it is quite difficult to destroy the railways of fortresses and bases. If it were easy, the Italian affair would not be so difficult to resolve.

Ankara, 1st (Central News Agency): ...will continue for some time. Some people are holding contests to guess the date of the invasion of Europe, and are discussing the advantages and disadvantages of landing in the dark of night or under a full moon, unanimously believing that the invasion of Europe is a matter of within a few months.

According to German sources, hundreds of American planes reached the airspace above Berlin, and the German air force shot down 129 of them. Furthermore, German aircraft also bombed Plymouth on the southwestern coast of England for about twenty minutes on the night of the 29th, achieving great results. A German heavy bomber squadron also fiercely attacked convoys gathered on the southern coast of England. As the establishment of the Second Front approaches, the air battle over Europe is becoming increasingly fierce.

### Bolivian Coup Fails

It is reported that they will go to Suzhou this morning to participate in a symposium organized by the Central China Railway Company, after which they will return to Nanjing and disband.

### Free Transportation of Paint Within Three Provinces and Two Municipalities

All types of paint are classified as lacquer and are not included in the scope of controlled goods. In the past, when paint was transported from this city to other locations, it was often detained by inspection personnel in the cleared areas. After inquiring with the Trade Control Association, it was learned that paint belongs to the lacquer category, and there are no explicit restrictions on its transportation within the area of the three provinces and two municipalities, so it can be freely transported. If it is moved from within the three provinces and two municipalities to other regions, approval for removal from the association should be obtained.

### British Navy Night Battle Offshore: Destroyer Sunk

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency): German naval sources: A night battle occurred off Saint-Brieuc on the Brittany coast. The Canadian destroyer HMCS Athabaskan was sunk by German torpedo boats. Two German torpedo boats participated in the battle. The enemy had several cruisers and destroyers, which were superior in number and firepower, but they avoided the range of German fire and did not approach to engage. Under heavy fire, an enemy ship was hit. One German ship initially fought actively but eventually left the battlefield due to damage. Another ship continued to fight bravely alone. The enemy ship was soon hit and caught fire, with flames reaching about 200 meters high, possibly due to a torpedo hitting its oil tank. The crew suffered heavy losses, and 85 people were rescued. According to rescued crew members, another enemy destroyer was also hit and sank. Details of the enemy's losses will be released after reviewing the testimonies of the survivors.

### Integration of Research, Education, and Production—The Appearance of Japan's New Industrial University—

—Tadao Yamamoto

Current Demands

Epoch-making increases in production have promoted students' diligent service. The ideal of education that unifies theory and practice, although deformed, has been realized to some extent. Especially for industrial knowledge, it is not enough to rely solely on abstract understanding; it must be accompanied by practical industrial technology. Moreover, under the current circumstances where national power and war capacity hope for mass production, in addition to the specialized and upward development of various industries, institutions and skills that can implement mass production are also required.

On the other hand, scientific weapons must possess new capabilities that exceed those of enemy countries, and must be produced and used quickly. Therefore, invention and research are particularly important.

Thus, although education, research, and production have related and inseparable relationships, in our country's education and industry sectors, these three are mutually separated and each pursues its own interests. The current situation prompts a correction of this situation. The education sector is undergoing drastic changes due to the relationship between military service and service, and cannot but experience considerable upheaval. Current industrial education must reflect on, plan, and make decisive decisions regarding this situation.

Awakening of the Business World

Under the international capitalist economic structure, during the era of commercial organization's industrial control using the gold standard as a weapon, industrialists operated their businesses with profit as their goal and profitability as their indicator. Especially in our country, due to being late to participate in the world market, the market was restricted, allowing merchants who imported new scientific products to run rampant. Later, pioneering individuals gradually created factory production institutions, and after several trials, progressed to large organizations. However, very few industrial companies had research institutions for their own businesses, and they were unwilling to create original new products through research, instead investing huge amounts of money to obtain patents and manufacturing methods invented by advanced countries. In this era, the academic community could not obtain the convenience of research institutions, and most researchers pursued theoretical teaching to guide the conclusions of engineering.

Since the Manchurian Incident, our country's national situation, politics, and diplomacy have undergone changes. Similarly, it has also promoted the awakening of industrial managers. On one hand, they abandoned the goal of profit and aimed to contribute to national power and war capacity. On the other hand, they did not hesitate to spend heavily on investigation and research, creating a positive trend of striving to create and improve products, and many people also supported students' research.

Two Aspects of Research

There are two aspects to research: basic research and applied research. Basic research uses scientific insight to analyze the constituent elements of phenomena and formulates them into formulas and laws under various conditions. Of course, integrating various elements and unifying them into more general laws is the path to approaching the truth of the natural world.

As for applied research, its mission is to drive and integrate already discovered laws to create practical machines, whose ingenuity can surpass the senses of human organs, and whose strength can replace the manpower of tens of thousands of people. Although humans are the spirit of all things, their mechanical evolution has passed its peak and entered a period of decline, but relying on auxiliary devices produced by labor, they infinitely expand their abilities.

In scientific research, basic research is its mission, because the development of theory has already immersed itself in the realm of philosophical thinking. There are two aspects to the exploration of these philosophical concepts, one is the setting of principles, and the other is to make them applicable to industry. This basic research is called engineering research. Although applied research can also be called industrial research, industrial experiments should be distinguished from this type of research.

Two Aspects of Engineering Education

Engineering education can also be examined from two aspects. Previous engineering education, especially university education, considered basic education to be sufficient. This was considered orthodox and became a habit. As for other methods, there was neither room for consideration nor enthusiasm for consideration.

However, in industrial practice, this type of education was found to be inconvenient and needed to be re-educated. For example, the industrial management department, in addition to engineering education, also added subjects such as law, economics, and management, but this was also intended to improve management efficiency. True industrial technicians should be those who have a deep understanding of factory life in order to conduct research and production in practice.

There are many universities named industrial universities at home and abroad, but apart from basic education based on past ideas and slightly advancing specialized industrial types, there are no special features. A true industrial university should operate research, education, and production in a unified form, integrating research institutes, factories, and university education. There are not a few examples of this in Europe and America.

The Path of the New Industrial University

Recently, Kiyokazu Iwasaki, the head of a radio equipment factory, and his partner technician, Kokichi Hayakawa, have completed their plan, and the government has given considerable encouragement and requested cooperation from all parties to create a new industrial university. That is an industrial university that integrates research, education, and production. Under the new ideal of making studying, researching, and practicing actual life, industrial educators have realized one by one what they had never thought of before and considered impossible.

Thanks to Iwasaki's provision of private funds and factory equipment, an industrial university that integrates applied research, studying, and factory life has been created. The new industrial university that was considered a fantasy among colleagues is about to be realized. This can be seen as a transformation in industrial education brought about by the national circumstances of the decisive battle.

In a comprehensive university, the engineering department, which has undergone a long period of experience, stands in a traditional and classical position. The new single-subject industrial university has completed a new development due to its characteristics. Adapt to the requirements of the country, accelerate our country's industrial education, complete the actual combat power in wartime, and enrich the national power in peacetime.

The ideal of this new industrial university, in addition to those engaged in industrial education. There are many supporters among the heads of large industrial enterprises, who regard it as a development of the highest industrial education in our country. The times have passed Dr. of Engineering, former Director of the Faculty of Science and Engineering of Waseda University, and Principal of the newly established Kugayama Radio Industry Vocational School (Translated by [unclear])

### Municipal Advisory Committee Holds First Meeting Yesterday; Mayor Chen Delivers Speech Explaining Significance and Expressing Expectations

In order to further promote the municipal construction of Shanghai, the Shanghai Special Municipal Government has specially invited 25 people who are reputable in the city and have a passion for local undertakings, such as Yen Hui-ching, Lee Shih-hao, Wen Lan-ting, Yuan Lu-deng, Lin Kang-hou, Shen Si-liang, Pei Fu-heng, Lee Chuan-shih, Chu Bo-chuan, Chou Tso-min, Chen Pin-he, Jin Xiong-bai, Feng Bing-nan, Wu Yun-zhai, Pei Ling-qing, Xiang Kang-yuan, Wu Zhen-xiu, Dai Ai-lu, Guo Shun, Tang Shou-min, Zhao Zheng-ping, Zhao Jin-xiang, Ren Xiao-shan, Yao Qing-san, and Chen Ri-ping, to form the Municipal Advisory Committee. Yesterday (the 1st), the first plenary meeting of the committee was formally held at 4:00 PM in the meeting room of the First District Public Office. In addition to Mayor Chen and Secretary Wu, the attendees included committee members Lee Shih-hao, Wen Lan-ting, Yuan Lu-deng, Yen Hui-ching, Tang Shou-min, Lin Kang-hou, Wu Ci-qi, Zhao Zheng-ping, Shen Si-liang, Pei Fu-heng, Lee Chuan-shih, Chu Bo-chuan, Chen Pin-he, Jin Xiong-bai, Feng Bing-nan, Pei Fu-xiang, Xiang Kang-yuan, Wu Zhen-xiu, Dai Ai-lu, Guo Shun, Zhao Jin-xiang, Tao Qing-san, and Chen Ri-ping. The directors of various bureaus and offices of the municipal government also attended the meeting. First, Mayor Chen delivered an opening speech, saying:

Mayor Chen's Opening Speech

Gentlemen, today is the date of the first meeting of the Shanghai Special Municipal Municipal Advisory Committee. It is also the first time that responsible members of society formally gather to jointly discuss municipal affairs after the Shanghai Municipal Administration took over the Public Concession and the French Concession, unifying the administration of Shanghai. You gentlemen not only bear the hopes of Shanghai, but also the hopes of China. With your knowledge and experience, your appointment as members of the municipal advisory committee is not only an honor for myself, but also brings endless expectations and excitement to the people of Shanghai and the whole country. I recall that at the beginning of the takeover of the concessions last year, I stated at the People's Representative Assembly that Shanghai must establish a temporary public opinion body. This so-called public opinion body could either restore the past Temporary Council or establish an advisory committee. The reason for the delay in establishing it until now is twofold. The first reason is that since the incident, municipal affairs have not been able to get on track, and social organization and people's lives have been chaotic. I deeply desired to first do my best to clear away the mess after the concessions were taken over and the municipal administration was unified, and then invite you gentlemen to jointly discuss the recovery and construction. Therefore, I scheduled the convening of the Municipal Advisory Committee on the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, because it was planned to implement a ban on gambling and plan a ban on opium before that date. I briefly reported this point to you gentlemen at the previous discussion meeting. The second reason is that there were many diplomatic procedures involved in the takeover of the concessions, such as the exchange of documents during the takeover and the organization after the takeover. Some of these procedures were temporary, and some were transitional, requiring a considerable amount of time to complete. For example, the Public Concession was initially called the First District, and the French Concession was initially called the Eighth District. The police agencies of the two concessions were also divided into the First Police Bureau and the Third Police Bureau until they were separately merged in February of this year. These procedures were due to diplomatic relations or factual relations. After completing the procedures first, they were gradually adjusted before opening this advisory committee, so that general affairs could proceed smoothly. Now the administration of Shanghai can be said to be unified, and all the procedures for taking over the concessions have been completed and corrected. From now on, we can discuss closely and jointly plan progress. As for myself, I have been serving as mayor from November 20, 1940, to this day, for three and a half years. The work of various bureaus and offices has been printed into a written report, which you gentlemen can criticize based on its achievements and give guidance in the future. What I want to say today is that the most pressing issue in Shanghai today is the economic problem. Shanghai has been able to become a world-class metropolis because of its economy. If the economic problem cannot be solved for a single day, then the Shanghai problem cannot be solved. In other words, with economy, there is Shanghai; without economy, there is no Shanghai. All other problems are secondary, and the economic problem is the fundamental one. We also know that Shanghai in peacetime relied on the collection and distribution of goods and production. Although the collection and distribution of goods in wartime cannot be as smooth as in peacetime, production must not be allowed to stop even for a moment. Since the Greater East Asia War, increasing production has been the focus of attention for both the government and the public. However, the production in Shanghai, and even the whole country, has not only decreased, but has even come to a standstill. I deeply hope that you will study this matter.

I also know that society has had many well-intentioned criticisms of the municipal government in the past. I have adopted all good words with the intention of being unreservedly responsible, and have been deeply self-aware. I have made every effort to encourage myself in all matters within my responsibility, and have also deeply reflected on myself in matters outside my responsibility. Because of my position, I am not only the mayor of Shanghai, but also bear a part of the central government's mission. Although I know that social criticism is sometimes excessive due to excessive expectations, as one of the persons responsible for the central and local governments, I will not shirk responsibility. I will be vigilant in matters that are my responsibility, and in matters that are not my responsibility, I will adhere to the principle that those who speak are not guilty, and those who listen are warned. In the future, I deeply hope that you gentlemen will speak frankly and without reservation about your personal duties. Secondly, regarding the administrative aspects of the city, we are about to reasonably re-divide the city area, and we are planning to reduce staff and increase salaries in personnel matters, so that the various agencies can be simpler and strengthened. We must ensure that Shanghai's general administration will be coordinated with restoration and construction in times of peace, and that Shanghai's security can be ensured in times of emergency. This is what I ideally hope for and hope that you gentlemen will assist in.

You gentlemen and I are close friends on weekdays and colleagues today. The nature of the consultants is different from ordinary public opinion bodies. Ordinary public opinion bodies are somewhat opposed to the government in form, while consultants are essentially integrated with the government in substance. On the one hand, they can represent public opinion, and on the other hand, they can assist the government. They are also my advisors, my good friends, and my critical friends. Although you gentlemen are consultants to the Shanghai Municipal Government, considering your prestige and considering Shanghai's position, you are no less than the center of gravity of China's land and people. Therefore, please speak frankly and exhaustively on matters related to the administration of a city, and even on economic and other issues related to the whole country. Moreover, I hope that you will not only speak exhaustively, but also jointly proceed. And I will only know everything and do everything, and if my strength is insufficient, I will persevere. We will encourage each other, and I believe that Shanghai can be restored, and if Shanghai is restored, then China can also be restored. This is my belief, and I hope you will guide me, and I will encourage you together.

Determining Principles and Electing Standing Committee Members

Following this, committee members such as Lee Shih-hao, Lin Kang-hou, Chen Pin-he, Feng Bing-nan, and Zhao Zheng-ping expressed their opinions on the organization of the committee. The following five principles were decided: 1. The task of the advisory committee is to provide consultations to the municipal authorities on the one hand, and to broadly collect the sentiments of the citizens and make suggestions to the municipal authorities on the other hand. 2. The number of members of the advisory committee is tentatively set at 25, and 7 to 9 standing committee members are elected. The standing committee members will attend at least twice a week to handle all matters. 3. Committee members are completely obligated. 4. Regular meetings will be convened once a month, and extraordinary meetings may be convened if the mayor has matters for consultation or if one-third or more of the committee members propose it. The office will be located in the First District Public Office, and the staff will be concurrently appointed by the municipal government. 5. Lee Shih-hao, Lin Kang-hou, Xiang Kang-yuan, Wu Yun-zhai, Shen Si-liang, Chen Ri-ping, and Chen Pin-he were elected as the seven standing committee members, and Feng Bing-nan and Chen Pin-he were elected to draft the articles of association. Subsequently, Wen Lan-ting, Lin Kang-hou, Xiang Kang-yuan, and others freely expressed their opinions on important municipal issues. The situation was very harmonious. They especially considered the issue of daily necessities to be of urgent importance, and resolved to establish a sub-committee to be responsible for research and discussion. Lin Kang-hou, Chen Pin-he, Xiang Kang-yuan, Feng Bing-nan, and Jin Xiong-bai were elected as the five committee members. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.

### Reflections on Attending the Advisory Committee Meeting

— Chen Bin

I consider myself to be of meager talent, and I am filled with trepidation to have been appointed as an advisory committee member by the municipal government. Yesterday, I attended the first meeting and, after listening to the free and open discussions of the authorities and fellow attendees, I wish to express my feelings and thoughts:

I have always believed that all citizens residing in Shanghai share a common responsibility for all issues concerning Shanghai. Only with this sense of responsibility can the power of citizen opinion be generated. The meaning and nature of the establishment of the advisory committee have already been explained in detail by the mayor and need not be repeated.

The initial draft principles for the advisory committee's mission, as agreed upon by the drafting committee, were: "The advisory committee is not a formal body of public opinion. Its mission is, on the one hand, to provide consultation to the municipal authorities and, on the other hand, to assist the municipal authorities in implementing administrative orders. At the same time, it widely gathers public opinion and makes suggestions to the municipal authorities. When necessary, it raises investigations or inquiries to municipal-related organizations." This was revised at the subsequent meeting to: "The advisory committee's mission is, on the one hand, to provide consultation to the municipal authorities; and on the other hand, to widely gather public opinion and make suggestions to the municipal authorities." However, at the conclusion of the meeting, Mayor Chen solemnly declared that, although the wording had been amended, he personally still hoped that everyone present would feel free to raise investigations or inquiries regarding municipal issues at any time, and that all municipal measures would be made public. This attitude is a bright attitude of a politician, extremely rare in the political scene of the last two or three years, and it is worthy of praise. I feel that the dawn of Shanghai's future lies in this.

Among the advisory committee members, Mr. Feng Bingnan had not attended any gatherings since 1937 due to slightly diminished physical strength. This time, concerned about local affairs, he attended punctually. Mr. Pei Yunqing, from the financial sector, had been ill for three months, and this was also his first time attending a meeting. This proves the two gentlemen's concern and sense of responsibility for local issues. Those who only seek personal wealth and disregard public welfare should be awakened.

My colleagues in the press requested to attend as observers, which is deeply appreciated. However, due to the limited space in the meeting room, seats could not be prepared in advance, and temporary arrangements were impossible. The authorities expressed their apologies. However, the meeting's proceedings and guiding principles were all compiled and published by the Propaganda Department.

### Shanghai Youth Delegation Assembled Yesterday to Proceed to the Capital

The 114-member Shanghai youth delegation participating in the National Youth Grand Review held in the capital assembled at 8:00 AM yesterday (May 1st). Led by General Team Leader Wu Pengfei, they boarded an early train to Beijing, preparing to participate in today's camping ceremony.

### Citizens Eagerly Await Authorities to Swiftly Issue Cloth Purchase Certificates and Commence Universal Rationing Soon

Regarding the temporary cotton cloth rationing in Shanghai, since the Commercial and Trade Association printed cloth purchase certificates and designated retailers to distribute the cloth based on household registration and rice rationing methods, all procedures have been completed. Universal rationing could have commenced earlier. According to reporters' inquiries with the United Cotton Cloth Dealers Association, the Commercial and Trade Association has already submitted the cloth purchase certificates to the municipal government based on the city's population statistics for distribution to district and neighborhood offices, which will then distribute them to households based on registration. Once the district authorities have issued the purchase certificates to households, universal rationing can begin on a scheduled date. Therefore, the general public eagerly awaits the prompt issuance of these purchase certificates so that they can receive their cloth ration.

### First Police Precinct Captures and Kills Stray Dogs

The First Police Precinct authorities have recently noted the prevalence of stray dogs, with a significant number of victims. To maintain public safety, they plan to cooperate with military and police authorities to conduct a stray dog capture and killing operation in the jurisdiction of the Tilanqiao Branch from May 2nd to 11th, for a total of ten days, daily from 6:00 AM to 8:00 AM. All ownerless stray dogs and those without dog tags will be considered stray dogs and killed. Dogs with tags but without muzzles will be captured.

### Bank of Communications Establishes Agricultural Economy Department

With the start of spring plowing and the significant need for agricultural capital, the Bank of Communications has established the Shanghai Agricultural Economy Office at its head office on Jing'an Temple Road.

### Children's Library Recruits Book Donation Supporters

Due to an increase in child readers and an insufficient number of available books, the Shanghai Children's Library held a meeting at the YMCA on Baxianqiao on the day before yesterday. Those in attendance included Lin Kanghou, Yuan Deng, Zhao Jinqing, Ying Yongyu, and others. They decided to hold a book donation campaign with a target of 10,000 books, from May 1st to the 31st. All sectors are welcome to donate generously. At the meeting, Ying Yongyu proposed that the congratulatory gifts for Director Fang Zijun's fiftieth birthday be used for the library's expenses.

### A Supplementary Opinion on Improving the Issuance of Rationing Certificates

— Zhu Yuan

In the supplement of the 20th of last month, there was an article by Hai Shujun on the continued request for the old district to improve the method of issuing rationing certificates. After reading it, I thought that Hai Shujun was only dissatisfied with the method of receiving rice tickets and wanted to discuss improvements, but did not know that the cancellation and reissuance of tickets and the purchase of application forms for moving families are extremely troublesome. Especially for ordinary citizens who have never handled rice before, there is no detailed announcement or information desk. As a result, those who have not completed the procedures correctly are running back and forth.

For example, after a child is born in a certain family, the family members must request a supplementary ration ticket. Because the report of the birth to the baojia unit does not have a stub left for proof, the application must be certified by the Lianbao office. If the certificate only has the seal of the Lianbao and not the private seal of the Lianbaozhang, or if the entire seal is used on ordinary paper, it must be run again. Each time you enter, you must enter through the same entrance as those who are applying, returning tickets, and reissuing tickets, and the population must be excluded, so it takes two or three hours to queue to enter once. Those who line up in the open square to receive the rationing certificates are exposed to the sun on sunny days and rained on rainy days, which makes it so troublesome and complicated for the ticket recipients that they feel extremely distressed. Here are a few points of hope for improvement, stated as follows:

Those who receive joint tickets, those who return tickets, those who buy application forms, and those who re-receive tickets should each have a separate entrance and exit, or an office desk should be set up at the window next to the entrance gate, so that those who receive tickets do not have to return to the same entrance, otherwise the time of bathing should also be arranged, and there should be no disagreement.

Shelters should be built in the queuing area for ticket collectors in the open space so that rain and暴日 do not directly affect ticket collectors. Moreover, the weather will gradually become hotter after this, and standing in the sun for a long time will inevitably cause weak people to faint. Standing in the wind, clothes clinging to the back, is extremely easy to get sick.

Set up an information desk to answer questions for people who receive ration tickets. When ticket collectors have no way to answer the methods and procedures in detail, they have to ask the clerks, but the clerks are too busy, and the answers are not clear, so the ticket collectors know that they are wrong but do not know how to correct them, and they make mistakes again and again after the mistake. It is common to see those who run around in vain.

Detailed announcements of the procedures for receiving tickets should be made at the entrance and outside the door. Which residents should receive tickets today.

The above few items can be said to be the minimum points that need to be improved. If the authorities can understand the sufferings of the ticket collectors, they will surely be able to accommodate them without doubt.

Shura (1)

"Haha!" He laughed out loud like that.

"Since that's the case, you don't like anything at all, do you..." Upon hearing these words, the youth couldn't help but be taken aback.

(Yes, that's exactly it. For me, there is simply nothing that I want anymore.)

He remained silent.

"Then, you have neurasthenia! Have another drink!"

Tsuruhara raised the bottle, and the youth slowly extended his glass.

"Of course, for a painter, there will always be a crisis that strikes once in their lifetime. Looking at the things they have done in the past, everything becomes empty, and they feel disgusted with everything. Seeing the art world also becomes厭的. But that kind of experience is something that happens after having ten or fifteen years of painting history. Someone as young as you, with extraordinary intelligence and talent, which I know very well, but already experiencing a crisis, I don't think is due to having a considerable history in painting. So you have neurasthenia, simply neurasthenia," Tsuruhara analyzed at length.

"Perhaps that's the case," the youth replied lightly, but in his heart, he felt that whether it was a painter's crisis or neurasthenia, it didn't matter much. He only felt that the ground beneath his feet was slippery, and he felt very uneasy and anxious, always wanting to escape this place.

"Perhaps working on one hand and studying painting on the other is inevitably too tiring," Tsuruhara added a bit of comfort. This youth and Tsuruhara were not related, because he was working part-time and studying painting part-time. He was serving in the publicity department of a large cosmetics company on the Ginza Avenue.

"Perhaps that's the case," he replied without thinking.

Since the conversation had strayed from the topic, Tsuruhara put his cigarette in his pocket and said, "Do you want to eat anymore?"

"No, I've had enough."

"Then, let's take a slow walk!" So the two stood up and paid the bill.

"Thank you for the meal," the youth said as he thanked him as he left the restaurant.

"Don't mention it. Then I'll have to excuse myself. Please come visit again. And about treating neurasthenia, you should take a vacation to the mountains or the seaside to paint to your heart's content, what do you think?" After Tsuruhara said this, he immediately walked towards the station. Because he had a small day studio in the residential area south of the station. But the youth was on the other side, living in a very rudimentary apartment.
