### Chongqing Under the New Circumstances

— Chen Binhe

A: Since the Allied forces assisted the Indian National Army in advancing into India, the situation in the Greater East Asia War has undergone another change, and the enemy's panic and helplessness have become even more obvious. What is the status of Chongqing under this new situation?

B: Since the Cairo Conference, Chongqing has emphasized the unity and cooperation of the so-called "Four Great Powers," especially focusing on military operations in Myanmar. The sudden actions of the Japanese army indeed came as a surprise, and all military plans since the Cairo Conference have almost fallen into a complete state of failure. Hearst newspapers such as the New York Journal-American and the New York American have recently published editorials, pointing out that "Japan's offensive in Myanmar has actually broken through the Indian border, which proves that it is extremely foolish for us to ignore the Pacific War." If the Americans themselves are so pessimistic, then it is not difficult to imagine the unease and fear of Chongqing, which relies on the United States like Mount Tai.

A: Although the military situation has suffered a devastating blow, some people say that Chongqing's recent diplomacy has been quite successful. What do you say?

B: This issue requires calm and dispassionate study. Chongqing has no so-called diplomatic policy of its own; its diplomacy is simply following the lead of Britain and the United States. However, it is very obvious that some people within the Chongqing regime have two major goals in mind: first, to obtain more support from the United States; and second, to provoke conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union, leading to war. This is the so-called "using barbarians to control barbarians" policy, which is also the more concrete content of the so-called "responding to all changes with invariance" policy.

A: Isn't this self-deprecating and self-abasing diplomatic approach something that the Chinese Communist Party has criticized thoroughly? But in reality, it seems that the United States is indeed pretending to be friendly?

B: In essence, the United States' diplomacy towards Chongqing can be said to be completely centered on "strategy." Chongqing cannot really talk about equality, let alone "success." As Lin Yutang bluntly stated in his recent book "The Gay Genius", the British and Americans have fundamentally not changed their contempt for the Chinese, and at the same time, the Chinese impression of the British and Americans will never be good. Recently, Wendell Willkie, in his US presidential campaign speech, also denounced Roosevelt's failures in domestic and foreign policy, especially mentioning the Eastern people's doubts about the so-called Atlantic Charter, which is tantamount to an admission of American fraud against the nations of East Asia. And Chongqing still boasts of the "success" of its diplomacy with the United States, is it not ridiculous?

A: Then, Chongqing's fantasy about a Japanese-Soviet conflict must be even more disappointing. Wasn't the agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union on extending the fishery treaty and transferring oil and coal rights announced a few days ago?

B: Exactly. For the past few years, Chongqing has been having nightmares about a Japanese-Soviet war. The establishment of this new Japanese-Soviet agreement, compared with the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact of April 12, 1941, has given Chongqing an even more serious blow, because this new agreement not only hit Chongqing, but also hit the British and American authorities that Chongqing relies on. The tone of the British, American, and Chongqing authorities on the new Japanese-Soviet agreement these past few days shows how panic-stricken they are!

A: Since the military and diplomatic situation is like this, Chongqing seems to be saying that it has some methods in domestic affairs. Isn't it currently clamoring for the universal establishment of local public opinion organs and actively preparing to implement constitutional government?

B: These messages are in fact close to exaggeration. If we take the constitutional movement as the most important and best manifestation of Chongqing's recent domestic affairs, I think that except for a very small number of people who have no political awareness or political activity experience, I am afraid that everyone will recognize that this is another new magic trick by Chongqing to try to regain popular support. In reality, where will they truly respect public opinion and truly prepare to return power to the people? Hang Liwu, a "councilor" who recently returned to Chongqing from a visit to the United Kingdom, in his first public speech, demanded that the Chongqing authorities respect the people's legitimate freedoms and not violate the people's rights to physical integrity, residence, speech, publication, and assembly, which is precisely an indirect accusation of Chongqing's fraudulent policies (because the so-called "councilors" do not have the right to criticize the government). Not only Hang Liwu, but even Chongqing's mouthpiece - the "Central News Agency," at its 20th anniversary celebration, the "president" Xiao Tongzi himself requested that the agency be given the freedom to handle news without violating national laws and party discipline, so as to avoid excessive restrictions hindering its progress, which just tears off the mask of Chongqing's so-called respect for public opinion, promotion of the rule of law, and preparation for constitutional government.

A: Does this mean that the Chongqing regime is facing a dangerous situation where it has no foreign support, has lost prestige at home, and even its own mouthpiece and confidants are rising up in opposition?

B: The only conclusion we can draw today is this. Let us watch the evolution of the facts!

### The Contradiction Between Attaching Importance to Chongqing and Distrusting Chongqing

Nimitz, Stilwell, Marc Mitscher, and other American Pacific War commanders, after invading the Marshall Islands, each published their strategies against Japan, and the basis of their strategies was to cooperate with the Chongqing army. The more the United States expects from Chongqing, the more arrogant and disrespectful Chongqing's attitude becomes, refusing to bow before the United States. If mutual trust collapses, cooperation will not be established. Moreover, the more information comes from the United States demanding Chongqing's cooperation, the more the United States distrusts and is dissatisfied with Chongqing. We dare say that the difficulty of supplying the Chongqing army and the poor quality of the army, in addition to making Nimitz and Mitscher feel difficult in the conduct of operations, also led to the failure of the joint operations of the anti-Axis forces because of the loss of mutual trust.

What the United States expects from Chongqing is the contribution of the Soviet Union on the European front, hoping that Chongqing will also make the same contribution on the Asian front. However, from the American perspective, Chongqing does not have the intention of fully cooperating in carrying out the war. The United States' promise to give Chongqing permanent assistance has two bad effects. First, it makes Chongqing feel that there is no need to exert its greatest efforts; second, it refuses to cooperate with the Chinese Communist Party and does not seek ways to gather all forces. Chiang Kai-shek uses his most elite troops, Hu Zongnan and Chiang Ting-wen's troops, to surround the Communist army like the Great Wall, while neglecting the war against Japan. The United States is extremely angry about this. From the American perspective, no matter how hard the Communist army continues to resist Japan with all its strength, the Chongqing army only stands by and watches, not taking the war to heart. Therefore, the anxious United States even went so far as to advocate supporting the CCP and overthrowing Chongqing.

A recent editorial in "The New Republic" magazine, entitled "The Trouble in East Asia," warned Chongqing by citing the example of Yugoslavia. In Yugoslavia, after Britain and the United States learned that Chetniks were fighting Germany while Mihailović was not, they supported the former and overthrew the latter. This precedent can also be applied to Chongqing.

The United States must defeat Japan, and there is no other way except to obtain a base on the Chinese mainland. As Nimitz stated, Chongqing's full cooperation is required. Anyone who hinders the war effort must be completely eliminated. The magazine said: If Chiang Kai-shek uses American aid and uses the war to attempt to ascend the throne, other methods must be used to suppress him. The so-called "other methods" are probably to stop aiding Chongqing and fully support the CCP. No one can deny that this warning is not authorized by the US government. In the Cairo Conference, Roosevelt and Churchill declared to Chiang Kai-shek that unless he cooperated closely with the CCP, aid to Chongqing would be stopped. This statement is enough to prove the recent news. The United States' distrust of Chongqing has developed into a theory of overthrowing Chongqing. The end of the theory of attaching importance to Chongqing is the theory of overthrowing Chongqing. The foundation of Nimitz's operations collapsed here, and the American dream of victory disappeared like a mirage. (Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, March 20th)

### Yesterday, the Supreme National Defense Council Passed a Resolution to Abolish the Ministry of Food; All Management Affairs Will Be Handled by the Ministry of Industry

Nanjing, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. Today (13th), the Supreme National Defense Council held its 45th meeting and resolved on several important cases. Excerpts are as follows: Matters for discussion: The Chairman submitted for discussion a proposal to abolish the Ministry of Food, with all matters under the Ministry's jurisdiction to be handled by the Ministry of Industry. The resolution was passed. The Chairman submitted for discussion the Executive Yuan's submission of the draft amendments to the Law on the Handling of Labor-Management Disputes, which were passed by the 203rd Yuan meeting and submitted by the Ministry of Social Welfare for review. The resolution was passed in principle and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. The Chairman submitted for discussion a case submitted by the Secretariat approving the Military Affairs Commission's letter on the amendment to the Council's organizational law, which was passed by the Council's 158th standing committee meeting, requesting transfer for review. The resolution was passed with amendments. The Chairman submitted for approval a memorial submitted by Liang, President of the Control Yuan, stating that there were still vacancies for members of the Control Yuan, and proposing Wang Hanliang to fill the position. The resolution was passed. The Chairman submitted for discussion the appointment of Zhao Muru, Huang Qingzhong, Xi Zewen, and Chen Duanzhi as members of the New Life Movement Promotion Committee. The resolution was passed.

Nanjing, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. At the 45th meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council on the 13th, a resolution was passed to abolish the Ministry of Food, with all matters under the Ministry's jurisdiction to be taken over and handled by the Ministry of Industry. This move is of great significance in strengthening the future of food administration during wartime and is universally valued by all sectors of society. After the National Government returned to Nanjing, stabilizing people's livelihoods was the top priority of governance. Therefore, the first step was to control and manage the food issue, first with the establishment of the Food Management Committee, and then, after formally entering the war, the Food Management Committee was expanded into the Ministry of Food to adapt to the wartime system. In addition to handling the unified purchase and distribution of food, more emphasis was placed on increasing production. The government authorities have made every effort to promote food administration over the years, seeking to smoothly supply the military and the people, which is universally recognized by the people of the country. The authorities' resolute abolition of the Ministry of Food this time and the transfer of all affairs to the Ministry of Industry demonstrates the authorities' further promotion of food administration in the future. At this time of wartime, the simplification of all administration is a necessary measure. Therefore, the abolition of the Ministry of Food this time is the first sign of the government's implementation of administrative simplification. In the future, after the Ministry of Industry takes over food administration, not only can manpower and resources be concentrated, but all powers and responsibilities can also be unified, which is an indispensable factor in promoting administrative efficiency. This shows that the change in the food administration organization, although superficially an abolition, will in fact enhance administrative efficiency. It is believed that under the unified management of the Ministry of Industry authorities, the two major goals of ensuring military supplies and stabilizing people's livelihoods will be achieved under the enthusiastic expectation of all parties.

### Japanese Major Shimada Explains the Situation in the India-Myanmar War

Nanjing, Central News Agency dispatch, 12th. Major Shimada of the Press Department of the Japanese Expeditionary Army Headquarters met with reporters from the capital yesterday (12th) afternoon at 4 o'clock and explained the situation in the India-Myanmar War and the Pacific War in detail, which lasted for more than an hour. The transcript of Major Shimada's speech is as follows: The entry of the Japanese-Indian Allied Forces into India's western border has two meanings: first, the British-Chongqing forces in that area have been driven out; second, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo has said that "we want to create India for the Indians." The four main points of the war in India are listed as follows: On the banks of the Fugong River in the north, the Chongqing forces in that area are under the command of American General Stilwell. The Japanese army is currently advancing along the railway towards that area. In the area of ​​Kasa, the enemy forces in that area have had 4,000 paratroopers descend, but this kind of warfare, given the Japanese army's past experience in annihilating small units and the difficulty of supplying the enemy forces in that area, will soon be reduced. In the Imphal area, the war is currently very fierce. The Japanese army is adopting a three-pronged encirclement tactic to attack. The fall of that area is imminent, and the enemy's rear will also suffer a major blow. The Japanese army is currently attacking the Ledo Road and the Moore Road, the forward of Imphal. The Ledo Road is the only lifeline for Chongqing's air and land transportation. If it is cut off, Chongqing will be greatly threatened. On the Kohima front, the Japanese army has achieved military success. The Japanese army is currently advancing along the Ledo and Moore Roads towards Imphal.

### Pacific War

In terms of the Pacific War, the enemy forces hope to end the war in a short period of time. Therefore, they are advancing into the central Pacific, which is a very clear fact. There are three reasons why they hope to end the war in a short period of time: The anti-Axis countries' war effort has failed to achieve its purpose. US productivity has reached its peak. A protracted war will cause war-weariness and other ideas unfavorable to the war to arise in the country. Therefore, the enemy forces hope to end the war in a short period of time. The enemy forces are occupying the small islands of the Pacific one by one, using the island-hopping strategy, which they believe is the key to achieving success in the mainland war. The enemy is eager to obtain air bases on the mainland, so it is expected that bombing of the mainland coast will become increasingly fierce in the future. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing cannot but fight like a cornered beast. As for the islands of New Britain, Bougainville, and New Guinea in the southwestern Pacific, there is currently no fierce war. In short, due to the success achieved by Japan in the India war, its impact on the entire Greater East Asia War situation is very significant.

### Central University Implements Military Training

Nanjing, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. The National Central University, in view of the extreme importance of student military training during wartime, began to implement strict training on the 10th of last month, and the results were very satisfactory. It is learned that the academic plan for military training is tentatively scheduled for the second semester of the 32nd year, with one semester consisting of ten weeks. The progress will be from basic training to combat training, which will be completed. Intensive training will be provided by personnel sent by the Gendarmerie Command to serve as instructors, and 30 outstanding soldiers selected from the Gendarmerie Training Institute will serve as training squad leaders.

### Mountbatten's Military Headquarters Rumored to Have Moved to Ceylon Island; British-Indian Troops Retreat South of Meilang

Zhaonan, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. According to information arriving here: Mountbatten's army, which attempted to recapture Myanmar last year, had its Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters in Delhi. It is rumored that the headquarters has recently moved to Ceylon Island.

A Certain Japanese Army Base on the Indian Front Line, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. The enemy forces south of Meilang have now received reinforcements. To cover up the general mobilization of their retreat, they are fiercely resisting with artillery fire, but a unit of the Japanese-Indian army is planning to maneuver around the hills northwest of Meilang to cut off the enemy's retreat route. Another powerful northward-bound unit is luring the enemy to the vicinity of Tairubon, where it is subjected to intense artillery bombardment. The northward-bound Japanese army has occupied a corner of the Imphal Basin and is now threatening a large force on the right flank of the 23rd Division, pursuing it near Meilang on the shores of Lake Loktak. Another vanguard unit of the Japanese army crossed the Leimanan Highlands northwest of Meilang and continued to advance towards a certain area. The final strategic posture of the northward-bound Japanese-Indian army is now complete.

Tokyo, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. According to a dispatch from a certain base on the Indian front, the first phase of the mop-up operation in Kohima has now reached its climax. Elite troops of the Japanese-Indian army, in order to respond to friendly forces attacking Assam, have wiped out 5,000 defeated enemy troops in the mountains north and northwest of Kohima. Currently, only about 500 enemy troops (including 100 British) remain in the highlands northwest of Kohima. The enemy forces relied on highland fortresses and artillery positions in the Jotsoma area to mount a stubborn resistance, but elite troops of the Japanese-Indian army launched continuous night attacks on them from the night of the 9th to dawn on the 10th, occupied their fortresses, and gradually narrowed the encirclement. Another powerful unit of the Japanese-Indian army is currently advancing along the Kohima-Dimapur road. The Japanese-Indian army, which started from a certain place eight kilometers northwest of Kohima on the 9th, strongly attacked a certain key point between Kohima and Dimapur via Kadwima, 15 kilometers northwest of Kohima, defeated the enemy garrison, and pursued the enemy forces that fled north along that road.

### The Nanjing-Tangshan Highway Begins Operation

Nanjing, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. The Highway Administration Office of the Department of Roads and Bridges of the Ministry of Construction, in order to facilitate land traffic between Nanjing and Tangshan, undertook the construction of the Nanjing-Tangshan Highway. After the project was launched, it was actively carried out by the authorities, sparing no effort. It was completed in full a few days ago and has begun operation. The authorities are now working on the repair of other highways according to the planned schedule. The entire plan for the construction of the highway between Bengbu and Datong has also been drafted, but due to the huge cost, which exceeds the budget by a large amount, it has been temporarily shelved and will be started once funding is available.

### The Ministry of Social Welfare Convenes a Working Meeting

Nanjing, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. The Ministry of Social Welfare convened the directors of social welfare bureaus from various provinces and cities to Nanjing on the 12th to hold a working meeting. The attendees included Minister Ding Mochun, Vice Minister Xi Zewen, directors of social welfare bureaus from various provinces and cities Mao Ziming, Wang Xiwu, Zao Shuqin, Xi Mingqi, Jiang Wenbao, Director of the Shanghai Office Chen Dongbai, as well as Chief Secretary Huang Qingzhong, Director Zhou Yuying, and more than 30 other people. On the morning of the 12th, the directors of social welfare bureaus from various provinces and cities reported on the work situation in their respective regions. In the afternoon, they discussed the direction of future work. On the morning of the 13th, the meeting continued, and there was a detailed discussion on various issues such as national health, national physique, rural welfare work, vocational guidance, national labor movement, and social services. After the discussion was completed, Minister Ding took the lead in sending a telegram to the Chairman to express respect and blessings. On the evening of the same day, Minister Ding also hosted a banquet for the directors of various provincial and municipal bureaus and senior colleagues in the ministry, which was a grand occasion.

### The Yu-Lu-Su War Zone is Officially Dissolved

Guangzhou, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. According to information from here, the Chongqing army formally dissolved the Lu-Su War Zone and the Yu-Lu-Su-Wan Border Region in early March and assigned them to the First War Zone, and appointed Tang Enbo, commander of the Yu-Lu-Su-Wan Border Region, as the commander of the First War Zone. The Lu-Su War Zone army under the command of Yu Xuezhong had suffered repeated defeats due to repeated punitive expeditions by the Japanese army and the Chinese Communist army's struggle for territory. Its morale had long been low. Furthermore, due to the return of generals Wu Huajiao and Rong Ziheng last year and the disintegration of the 89th Army, the relocation of the 79th and 51st Armies, the strength of the army had been greatly reduced. There had been news of the dissolution of the war zone last year. Since the spring of this year, the Chongqing army leaders have reached various agreements with Tang Enbo. As a result, the reorganization in mid-March was used as an opportunity to implement the dissolution of the war zone. Although Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to centralize the old Northeast Army faction, which still maintains its strength in North China, to simplify the command system, it cannot be said that it is a frank expression of reducing the front line to compensate for the decline in combat power. At the same time, it can be said that this move is tantamount to surrendering to the CCP forces in the area. In short, the Chongqing army's overall retreat from the Su-Wan area has brought about the loss of the only base for counter-offensive against Japan in North China.

### Rome Will Not Suffer from War; Spain is Negotiating; Herderna Claims to Have a Clue

Lisbon, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. According to a dispatch from Madrid, Spanish Foreign Minister Herderna told reporters on the 12th that the Spanish government had previously negotiated with the belligerent countries to ensure that the city of Rome would not suffer from the evils of war. Although the situation was satisfactory at the time, negotiations were still needed, and now there is a slight clue. The Pope's worry is the worry of the Spanish people. Therefore, the Spanish government's move is purely based on the hope of Christians, recognizing the privileges of the Vatican and the privileges of the city of Rome, where the Vatican is located.

### Chongqing's Coal is Lacking; Many Factories are Shut Down

Guangzhou, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. According to a broadcast from Chongqing, most of the small coal mines along the Jialing River have closed down recently due to transportation difficulties and the impact of rising prices. Although the wages of the miners have been increased by the government's adjustment, they still cannot obtain any profit due to the soaring prices. In addition, the coal prices stipulated by the authorities have only increased by 60%, which is not enough to cover the cost, and transportation is also extremely difficult. Therefore, military factories near Chongqing have long felt insufficient capital and materials and have fallen into a state of difficult maintenance. Now, due to the changes in the main supply area of coal, there is really no other way but to close down.

### The New Hangzhou Mayor Takes Office

Hangzhou, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. The newly appointed Hangzhou Mayor Chen Cibo took office at the city government at 8 o'clock yesterday morning. He was welcomed by former acting Mayor Cao and all the staff. After Chen rested briefly in the mayor's office, he took the seal and took office. Cao led his staff to handle the handover. Chen convened a meeting of all the city officials, gave instructions, and announced important personnel changes.

### The German Supreme Command Expands the Reserve Army; Fierce Fighting on the Eastern Front in the Soviet-Polish Border Area

Berlin, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. The Anti-Axis authorities have recently made various speculations about the future operational plans of the German army. The People's Observer published an editorial on the 12th entitled "Waiting Tactics," which stated that the German Supreme Command is actively expanding the reserve army in preparation for future operations. The German army's well-equipped divisions are still taking a waiting stance. German technicians and workers have been engaged in improving weapons for a long time. These reserve combat capabilities and technical capabilities must be seen in future battlefields to see the exertion of their power.

Berlin, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. The Sea Communication Agency's military correspondent, Lieutenant Colonel Ohrberg, said: There is fierce fighting south of Lake Peipsi and on the Crimean front on the Eastern Front. The Soviet Fourth Island Kerran Army is attacking the German positions in Crimea from the east and north. The German army has withdrawn from the Perekop region. The Soviet army is still increasing its troops to attack the West Sidech border and the German army in the city of Korsch after the German army withdrew from the city of Korsch. The Soviet attack on the Nava front has not yet succeeded. The focus of the attack has shifted slightly south, and the fighting is fierce, but they have all been repelled by the German army. The vanguard of the Soviet army that pursued the German army southwest of Odessa has been wiped out. The Soviet army attempted to cross the river in the Akkerman area downstream of the Dniester River, but has not yet succeeded. The Romanian army repelled the Soviet army northwest of Puyasi. The German and Romanian allied forces are holding the highlands at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains. The German army north of Senowitz has made considerable progress in its attack. The German army southeast of Stanislav has surrounded the Soviet army and is rescuing the defenders of Ternopil. The German army in the western part of the city is engaged in fierce street fighting. The German army is advancing east near Broddy and northwest of Kovel. The German army on the line from Stanislav to Kovel has begun a counteroffensive.

### Various Financial Institutions Change Lending Targets, Increasingly Focused on Agricultural, Industrial, and Factory Production
Following the authorities' strict crackdown on hoarding and speculation, prices in the city have stabilized. In particular, the Central Bank's tightening of interbank lending and restrictions on financial institutions' lending business have been highly effective in curbing inflation. The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Bank continues to inspect the business accounts of various financial institutions at any time. Those found to be engaged in speculative or hoarding lending activities will be dealt with immediately according to law. According to a Central News Agency reporter's investigation, since the Central Bank authorities restricted the lending business of financial institutions, various financial institutions have complied by changing their lending targets. Recently, the loans issued by various banks and firms have all been for the purpose of increasing industrial production, and a portion of the funds has been transferred to rural loans.

The Central North team boasts national players Li Zhenzhong, Shen Yugong, Xu Zhaoxiong, and Chen Xuechong, and under the leadership of Wang Zhongtao and the guidance of Dai Changling, they have a formidable reputation. Both sides are from the Northern school, so the performance is sure to be more tense and exciting than the first two games.

National Forum: Cracking Down on Disguised Gambling Dens

The harmful gambling dens were completely closed down on the evening of March 28th, which is a very gratifying event. However, after the gambling dens were closed, I went to Nanshi for a tour and found that there were still many open-air gambling dens near the gambling venues. It is said that these open-air gambling dens only emerged after the gambling venues were closed. The gambling venues were closed on the evening of March 28th, and these temporary gambling dens started operating on the morning of March 29th.

Returning from Nanshi, I walked to the vicinity of the Great World in the old Eighth District and saw "slot machines" still squatting there with their claws out. I don't know if the authorities consider slot machines to be beneficial and harmless? Or are gambling dens allowed to be closed while slot machines are not?

Then I walked to Fuzhou Road and saw people setting up chess stalls in front of the old World Games Bureau, with several accomplices enticing people to bet, with bets of three hundred or five hundred yuan, which is not a small amount of money. However, in broad daylight, how can these gambling stalls be considered less significant than a minor sorcerer compared to a great one? Why don't the authorities prohibit them?

"To cut grass, you must remove the roots, and to eliminate harm, you must be thorough." It is already wrong to prohibit the grand gambling dens while ignoring these "slot machines" and chess stalls. Moreover, allowing small-scale gambling to proliferate around the gambling venues is like chopping down the trunk of a tree while allowing the seeds to spread around. "A single spark can start a prairie fire." Perhaps the future gambling trend will be even worse than in the past! (Qichong)

Municipal Government Announces Protection of Wharf Service Centers

The Ministry of Social Welfare, in view of Shanghai being a major port for trade between China and foreign countries, and the wharves of various ports often being occupied by hooligans and thugs who extort, deceive, and humiliate, has specially ordered the China Social Work Association to organize the Shanghai Wharf Service Center to thoroughly rectify the procedures at all wharves in the city, eliminate long-standing malpractices, improve the welfare of dockworkers, register dockworkers, issue numbers and certificates, and implement management. Anyone without a numbered uniform, armband, or badge is not allowed to enter the wharves to provide services. Since the implementation of the service on March 15th, the order has been greatly improved and travel has become more convenient. However, Shanghai is a city with a mix of people from all walks of life, and the situation at the wharves is complex. It is inevitable that unscrupulous people will spread rumors and seek to issue notices to protect themselves.

Battle Report from the Bougainville Front: Japanese Army and Navy Seize

One morning, when the enemy with a large fleet landed at the western end of New Britain, a member of the naval base unit participating in the counterattack sent a surprising and rare battle report to the reporter. The following is the report:

The enemy preparing to land began large-scale bombing a month before the landing, that is, after November 29th of last year. The daytime bombing occurred five to six times a day, and on the most days, a total of 600 aircraft came back and forth. A certain mountain was the main target of the bombing. Due to the fierce air raids, the shape of the mountain almost changed beyond recognition. The mountain is located in the center, overlooking Bougainville Bay, at an altitude of 200 meters, and can also overlook the west Cape Gloucester to the Dampier Strait. Therefore, it became an important Japanese position. The vegetation on the entire mountain was burned to ashes and turned into a reddish-brown bald mountain. P-38s and small aircraft often patrolled in the air before and after enemy aircraft attacks, flying as low as the forest, conducting opportunistic strafing. Therefore, one could not be careless. If one saw a plume of smoke rising, the area around that place would be completely destroyed, with not a single blade of grass or tree left.

Enemy Landing Under Bombardment

The aircraft day after day were all enemy aircraft, only bombing the support of friendly aircraft. No matter how the enemy aircraft dropped bombs, we continued to repair the airfield at the risk of everything. On December 15th, when the enemy landed at Cape Magas, we already realized that the enemy would carry out a landing directly in front of us.

On December 26th, when the enemy landed, at 3:30 in the middle of the night, we heard a loud sound shaking the earth, and all our soldiers jumped up. This sound was completely different from the sound of ordinary bombs. Soon, the observer reported that it was the bombardment of an enemy cruiser. All soldiers immediately took their positions. The enemy's bombardment seemed to target our base, and it was extremely fierce. The shells exploded nearby, seemingly very close to the coast. Mixed with the sound of exploding shells, machine guns strafed our soldiers. After half an hour, at 4:00 in the morning, General Ming Longjie also gradually understood that about ten to twenty miles off the coastline, there was a black fleet, including transport ships of 10,000 tons and 5,000 tons, about a dozen ships, several escort cruisers, and about ten large destroyers. There seemed to be other fleets at sea as well.

Counterattack Preparations Completed

It could be seen that the enemy fleet was releasing boats one after another. After another half hour to 4:30, about 80 enemy bombers and fighters flew in, and the sky was already very bright. The gun ports of the cruisers and destroyers continued to fire, and under the cover of enemy naval guns and aircraft, the first landing began. The large numbers of troops in the landing craft all headed towards the airfield and the landing points at Cape Gloucester. Several enemy ships came in front of our naval base. We could fire at the landing enemy troops at any time, and we were waiting for an opportunity in our respective positions.

The Magnificent Appearance of Friendly Aircraft

The enemy's first landing ended about five hours after the start of the landing, that is, at 9:40 in the morning. There was fierce gunfire from Cape Gloucester to the west of our base. Because the connection with the army units was cut off, we were in a state of isolation, so we could not know the situation of the battle unfolding. Under naval and air control, the enemy landed in droves. If we had air support, we would never have allowed the enemy to set foot on this island. At 12:30, the second enemy fleet arrived, including several transport ships, several escort cruisers, and several large destroyers. The transport ships anchored in the waters five to ten miles off the eastern coast of Gloucester, with a gap of no more than one thousand meters between the ships. The escort ships patrolled at sea. Behind them were special transport ships with mechanized units for landing, which were about to begin landing, full of tanks, cars, and soldiers. At this moment, a fierce new roar came from the eastern sea. In an instant, we only hoped for the appearance of friendly aircraft. To the east of our position, directly opposite Cape Gloucester, there was a protruding cape. From the opposite side of that cape, a formation of aircraft appeared, the ranks orderly, with a gap of almost one thousand meters between the aircraft, rushing fiercely towards the enemy transport ships. Ah, these are friendly aircraft! The cry came from the members of the machine gun position. Enemy aircraft patrolling in the air and friendly aircraft began a fierce air battle. Our bombers only flew directly at low altitude, advancing towards the target. Before long, two large enemy transport ships were sunk by our aircraft. Then, an enemy ship of 5,000 tons and two enemy ships of 10,000 tons off Cape Gloucester spewed black smoke and sank one after another. At the same time, thousands of enemy soldiers and tens of thousands of tons of equipment that were about to land were annihilated in the depths of Bougainville Bay by the fierce attack of our naval aircraft in an instant. After the transport ships were attacked, the enemy cruisers and destroyers began to bombard our aircraft. In the dark barrage, the enemy ships fled to the sea at full speed. The second formation of our bombers attacked the fleeing enemy fleet. Because of the interference of enemy aircraft and the anti-aircraft fire of enemy ships, our friendly aircraft broke through the fierce fire net and rushed towards the enemy ships. Their appearance was truly "divine." In particular, the bravery of our aircraft that rammed the enemy cruiser and self-detonated was truly commendable. The bomber that rushed towards the enemy ship was hit by a shell, spewing a stream of black smoke. It was seen that the body of the aircraft was on fire, which was dangerous. At the moment of ignition, the aircraft hugged the bomb and crashed into the central part of the enemy ship under the bridge. Dense black smoke and permanent smoke rose together, and the enemy ship finally exploded and sank. In addition, another cruiser lined up next to it also suffered a fatal bomb and sank. Furthermore, three other cruisers and destroyers were also hit by shrapnel, and fled desperately while spewing black smoke. In just fifteen or sixteen minutes since our aircraft began the attack, such a great achievement was achieved.

Controlling Enemy Aircraft and Taking Counteroffensive Measures

All our soldiers watched from their positions. Every time we saw an enemy ship being sunk by our aircraft and making a loud noise, we couldn't help but clap our hands and cheer. In the past few months, we had been threatened by enemy aircraft day and night. Now we could vent our hatred. And bombing the coastline of the enemy landing point, we could see several places rolling up black smoke. While our aircraft controlled the enemy aircraft, the friendly army units on land were a hundred times more courageous, turning from defense to offense, and launching a fierce counterattack against the enemy.

The sound of lively gunfire could be heard in the direction of the enemy landing point. North American-style aircraft crashed in front of our eyes one by one, spewing flames. After our aircraft that had advanced three thousand meters from the coast to the sea flew away, a new batch of enemy aircraft, about one hundred, came again. These enemy aircraft, almost 200 with the previous enemy aircraft, began to frantically attack the friendly army positions near the mountain and the coastline again.

The report of a certain member ended here. In the Battle of Bougainville, our army and navy bravely fought and, although under the control of enemy aircraft, inflicted significant losses on the enemy. Now, we are reorganizing the battle line in the rear. (Translated from the March 15th Asahi Shimbun.)

German and British Methods of Defending Against Air Raids

Since the German Air Force resumed its heavy bombing of London in October of last year, the mutual and retaliatory bombing of cities, centered on the capitals of the British and American armies, has become increasingly fierce. Both armies are doing their best, exhausting human intelligence, and engaging in offense and defense. Due to the emergence of new aircraft and new weapons, there has been significant progress in the offensive. And the defense is also becoming more and more thorough and effective. Here, we will try to introduce one aspect of the recent German and British defense tactics:

England

The greatest strength of British air defense is the air defense mechanism integrating officials and civilians, which was produced from the difficult experience of the London Blitz in the autumn of 1940. As shown in the diagram, the most advanced air defense sensors, such as patrol aircraft, patrol boats, and coastal observation posts (mainly radio wave detectors) on the shores of the Strait of Dover, quickly transmit the "enemy aircraft arrival" warning to the advanced district headquarters. The method is by telegram, telephone, and flare signals. The alarm is transmitted from the advanced district headquarters to the air defense national headquarters - the fighter squadron headquarters - the district committee - the regimental headquarters - and the remote local control bureau. At this time, each unit takes the following steps upon receiving the alarm. That is, the advanced district headquarters informs the advancing fighter squadron, the air defense regimental headquarters informs the barrage balloon team, the fighter squadron headquarters informs the British Air Force Ministry and the air force headquarters, the district committee informs the special task force (including civilian air defense groups) and the bomb disposal team, and the remote local control bureau informs the emergency rescue team, the special task force, the observation posts, and other groups, reports and issues necessary orders. Direct air defense activities are handled by the fighter squadron headquarters, while the district committee and other organizations are responsible for preventing and handling disaster relief work.

Germany

Germany's air defense posture has become more passionate due to the bombing by British and American armies, and it has a much larger air defense mechanism than Britain. Unlike Britain, the distance from the coast to the main defenses of the German mainland is quite long, so its air defense mechanism is also greater and more thorough than Britain's. In addition, the German Air Force's "air fortress" interception tactics are also becoming more and more skillful and effective, as even Britain and the United States themselves admit. In the autumn of last year, when a US bomber squadron based in England raided Schweinfurt, Germany, the US Air Force was shot down by 60 aircraft and was noticeably overshadowed. This major blow was caused by the new weapons and new tactics of Germany shown in the figure. That is, rocket aircraft and "silver paper." To safely and effectively attack enemy territory, bomber squadrons must be organized into tight formations. Rocket aircraft were created to disrupt these formations. Rocket aircraft (some with twin engines, others with four engines, the details of which are unknown) chasing behind the flying "air fortresses" fire rapid-fire shells into the center of the formation. The formation is scattered, and the German fighter aircraft then fly down from above to attack. Another new weapon is "silver paper." German aircraft flying over the US bomber squadron suddenly release Qingbai-colored light, which rolls into a ball. When one of the fragments in this silver paper cloud is reduced, one "air fortress" after another is surrounded by flames and falls down. In addition, rapid-fire shells fired from the ground and new types of aerial time bombs have been very effective for the German army. Regarding "silver paper," it is still a mystery to the US Air Force, which finds it quite a headache. Even in Germany, because it is a secret weapon, it seems that it is not often used thereafter.

Recent Developments in Enemy American Aircraft Manufacturing: Super Heavy Bombers to Appear

The American "Boeing" B-29 long-range bomber, known as the "super-sky fortress," is now gradually entering the stage of large-scale manufacturing. At the beginning of this year, Harry Woodhead, chairman of the board of directors of the Heavy Bomber Manufacturing Company, declared: "The Fort Worth plant in Texas has produced a new type of four-engine super-long-range aircraft and will complete the production of the B-32 aircraft." The enemy American ambitions to use long-range bombers to carry out air raids against Japan are thus becoming concrete. The appearance of the B-29 and the planning of the B-32 can show that the production of enemy American aircraft is moving in the direction of super-giant aircraft. Supplementing the currently used B-17 "air fortresses" and Consolidated B-24s, they are fully engaged in the manufacture of long-range bombers. Since the autumn of last year, providing Gilbert to Nimitz (Commander of the US Pacific Fleet) The offensive entered the bombing stage, attacking Truk, Saipan, Tinian, etc., while strengthening bases in mainland China, attempting to control the Japanese mainland by air. The emergence of heavy bomber groups such as the so-called "super-sky fortress" and "air battleship" is naturally a matter of medical care.

The American Boeing Aircraft Manufacturing Company, famous for manufacturing giant aircraft such as the "Flying Clipper," has been test-manufacturing the "Air Fortress" B-17 since 1936, and has further refined the E and F models with practical experience. The main parts are 15 mm thick main panel armor, and the nose is equipped with five 12.7 mm caliber gun emplacements. A total of about 13 or 14 heavily armed heavy bombers have been completed. However, in the face of the vast Pacific theater, with a maximum speed of 488 kilometers per hour, the US military authorities encouraged domestic long-range bombers with a range of 10,000 kilometers. The Boeing B-29, Consolidated B-32, and Lockheed B-49 aircraft groups were born as a result. The following is an analysis of the B-29.

The Boeing B-29 giant bomber is equipped with four 2,500 horsepower engines, with a total weight of 40 tons, a maximum speed of 600 kilometers per hour, a service ceiling of 15,000 meters, and a range of 8,000 kilometers, possessing various advantages. However, according to foreign news reports, this aircraft, which is about to be launched, has a total weight of about 45 to 50 tons. When carrying 8 tons of bombs, it can travel 1,600 kilometers. When carrying 2 tons of combat supplies, it can travel 5,000 kilometers. The cruising speed is slightly less than 8,000 meters in altitude, and the speed is 400 kilometers per hour.

The United States after the start of the war has reached the highest level of production technology and theory, but whether it matches Mazer's disregard, after all, because it is equipped with four 2,000 horsepower engines, the range cannot be extended. The currently used long-range bombers want to be equipped with a true ultra-long-range bomber that has not yet been successful. How far it can be actively used in actual warfare is also a question. Moreover, attacking the Japanese mainland from the shores of Midway Island, 4,000 kilometers from Tokyo, is nothing more than a fantasy. (Translated from the March 24th Mainichi Shimbun)

The Death of Bai Maozhuqing by Zhu Lin

"Zhuqing committed suicide!"

"Died in Wuxi."

When Jiang Xia told me this on the phone in tears at noon, I was simply shocked.

Just ten days ago, she had left Wuxi with a heartbroken heart to meet a few acquaintances in order to express her life's challenges, but the cruel reality and the powerlessness of her friends only gave her disappointment and sorrow.

It was a quiet farewell, a quiet departure. Who knew that this silent separation would be our eternal farewell?

Two years ago, when Zhuqing was studying at Qing Girls' High School, I was their senior second-grade teacher. The children used their uninhibited enthusiasm and pure ideals to explore their lives. I gained heat and strength from the brave and progressive youth currents, and returned to my own young heart.

The incident lost our school, but the children did not leave me. In my small house, there was still the healthy laughter of the students. In the few months that the school was suspended, my home became the center of the students' gatherings.

In the endless chatting, Zhuqing was the one who attracted my attention the most. A small figure wrapped in a blue cloth jacket, a pair of bright black eyes embedded in a firm face, speaking with the Jiangyin accent at the end of her sentences, she was a good child with clear thinking, quick action, insight, and ideals, and was quite an extraordinary young person among her peers.

With the stability of the situation, the students all found new homes, and Zhuqing also returned to her hometown of Wuxi in February.

The dark society always gives youth only depression. For someone as upright as Zhuqing, she would naturally feel more troubled. Young people all have beautiful dreams, but the reality shows only the ugly dark side. Zhuqing was certainly disappointed in her smog-filled hometown, and the family composed of a stubborn father, a cowardly mother, a doting aunt, and a degenerate brother made her helplessly endure grief and indignation.

She first wrote to me to tell me like this.

"... Auntie is always throwing tantrums, Daddy is always smiling, Mom is sick, Dad is not even willing to pay the medicine bill, Brother is drinking and making trouble all day long, Sister-in-law just hides in the corner and cries. In the world's all-encompassing war, the times are turbulent, but they can't shake the "home" of my tiny self..."

"I can hardly study. Mom is careful under Dad's commands, and finally let her daughter into the school."

"Dad said: 'I'll marry you off after another year of study.' No, never mind her! Take care of the present first!"

Then, I received several issues of the mimeographed literary weekly "Nanguang" that they ran themselves in the countryside. I was so happy, because although it was only a thin mimeographed publication, the design on the opposite side, the layout of the format, the precision of the printing, and the richness of the content all surprised me. The creativity of youth is great. Young people are exploring the road forward themselves. Zhuqing asked me for contributions. I wrote an article "To the Young" and also attached a letter telling her: "Don't be too exposed, otherwise you will encounter difficulties." Sure enough, the letter confirmed my worries, and I never saw "Nanguang" again.

In the half year after summer, Zhuqing gave me many letters, each time heavily revealing her suppressed enthusiasm, and issuing righteous accusations against the suffering reality.

This spring, she was once again ignited by her dormant sense of justice because of the death of her aunt;

"Auntie is sick, she doesn't ask for a doctor or take medicine. She has been back since 'Uncle' abandoned her for more than ten years. Since Grandma died, Dad has never treated her well, and even in her illness, he has never mentioned her once."

"Peng the witch on the street said: 'The ancestral grave is not peaceful, we need to send ghosts.' So, in the noisy sound of sending ghosts, Auntie was sent to the ghost gate."

"Actually, the stingy Dad is not willing to spend money for Auntie. She is a married sister, and she is no longer surnamed ×, so it is not worth spending money to treat her."

"However, the funeral after Auntie's death was handled decently, spending a considerable amount of money. That was to avoid affecting Dad's position and face in the countryside, and also to indulge in the compliments of the guests: 'This old brother really has a conscience.'"

"Isn't the father with "conscience" the real murderer who killed Auntie?"

"So I would rather be a rebellious daughter without conscience, I hate them."

So he began to be uneasy about living in the countryside, and wrote many angry letters asking me to help him leave home.

I wrote back hoping that she would calm down, hoping that she could transform her anger into a deep understanding to help herself understand more and more thoroughly. But perhaps because she was disappointed in me as "such a healthy派" (she called me that in her letter), she stopped sending news for three or four months.

It wasn't until the beginning of July this year that I unexpectedly and excitedly received her letter, discussing with me the matter of applying for a medical school. It turned out that she was about to graduate from middle school.

"In the year or so since returning to the countryside, the painful reality has given me many twists and turns. I have lost my way like a blind person groping in the dark. Sometimes it seems that a spark of fire flashes somewhere, but when I try to grasp it, it hides far away. I think, instead of letting my thoughts collide in the boundless ocean, I should study a specialized skill step by step."

"Therefore, I chose medicine."

"I heard that John's medical school does not accept girls, so please get me a charter from Tongde!"

However, before I had time to reply, a series of express letters flew in one after another, because she discovered that her father was preparing to marry off his daughter.

"Dad never approved of girls going to school. The medical school thing was originally just Mom's soft heart, and she only agreed after the daughter repeatedly begged bitterly. Mom planned for me, saying that even if Dad was unwilling to pay for it, selling jewelry would be enough for me to finish six years of medical school. She has tasted enough of being a "madam" under her husband's tyranny for thirty years."

"But when Dad discovered my preparations for going to school, he said to Mom sternly: 'If you want Zhuqing to go out to study medicine, you take her and get out!'"

"What can Mom do? She has been humiliated for thirty years, can she still fight against her own destiny? What's more, Dad smiled maliciously at me and said: 'To tell you the truth, the Zhao family has already come to propose marriage. This year, I will definitely marry you over.'"

"This was like a death sentence to me, and I trembled."

I was really terrified. Facing such a realistic problem, what help would it be to Zhuqing if I only issued empty theories? Of course, I couldn't bear to see a good child being buried by marriage and ruining her bright future, so I tried to hope that she:

"Never act emotionally, calm down and deal with things calmly. Be considerate to Dad, and in unnecessary occasions, you can appear very gentle. You also have to be kind to your aunt, and get Mom to support yourself in reality. Don't oppose things from the front, just try to delay it for a year or six months, and then slowly strive for further education when the delay is successful."

However, reality is becoming more and more ruthless:

"Mom called the painter to lacquer 'my' buckets and furniture. This means that she has succumbed to me. Dad has recently shown me unprecedented concern and consideration. You will know why that is. The timing is extremely urgent. I heard that the date is at the end of the ninth lunar month."

"Rebel! Leave! But where to go? What about leaving the poor Mom behind? Dad is so stubborn that even running away won't scare him. All that's left is for Mom to suffer. 'Look at the good daughter you gave birth to!'" Obey! I love myself more than everything else. I can't bear to destroy myself to fulfill those who hate me."

"Feigning illness, threats, crying, none of them will have the slightest effect on my father, so one day I spoke of death! But Mom said: 'Let Mom go first!'"

"Mom is definitely not talking nonsense. She has been enduring humiliation for thirty years. Apart from the existence of her only daughter, what does she have to miss? In the teens of years that I have memory, I have seen Mom snatch back her life from the hands of death more than once."

"Only now do I understand why women and tears have an inextricable bond. Mom's tears and my tears flow together. She often trembled when I leaned against her and cried, saying, "Zhuqing! Why didn't you reincarnate as a boy to fight for Mom's dignity?'"

"Now it is really a dead end. The road of life is too narrow. In such a vast amount of time, there is no room for me, a small girl?"

This sad low voice pressed on my chest like a huge stone. I bravely mustered up the courage to find a prerequisite for Zhuqing to leave home—a way to live temporarily. However, the way out is very stingy for the unfortunate.

So, that time ten days ago, she suddenly appeared before my eyes. The pupils sunk deep in her haggard cheeks had lost the hopeful light of the past. The corners of her closed mouth had escaped the laughter that once radiated vitality. The whip of reality was cruelly tormenting a promising youth.

During the few days in Shanghai, we met three times. Most of the time, we were in silence. I didn't say any comforting words. When a person needs factual help, empty words of comfort are deceit to others and a disgrace to oneself.

However, the result of running around again could not give Zhuqing any help. The door to employment is not easy for women to knock open.

Finally, I勉强 agreed with Zhang Ti's opinion to stay in their Xiaxi when necessary.

Zhuqing was about to leave. She had to go home once more before secretly hiding in Xiaxi. I sent her off with heavy worries. On the eve of her departure, I held her hand tightly. Feelings of resentment and guilt blocked the throat of Luwo, and as if sending an innocent lamb to slaughter, I couldn't help but shed tears.

"I'll bring a few classmates to Xiaxi to see you in a few days!"

I managed to blurt out these words. She had already turned her head and got on the bus.

"Write to me: Man can conquer nature. There is always a way."

She turned back and nodded to me.

In this last glance, I only saw a trace of a smile on her pale face.

Like a stream of ice flowing into the bottom of my heart.

The memory is so clear, Zhuqing's impression flashes vividly before my eyes, and facing a pile of letters and manuscripts that she meticulously composed with her heart, I cannot believe that a lively and intelligent girl has quietly left her friends, left the world, and will never return to this ugly world.

But, it is absolutely true that she is dead. She was swallowed alive by this cursed society with its blood basin mouth. She was strangled to death by the stubborn and decaying family. I grieve that I have lost a rare student. I lament that the motherland has sacrificed an excellent descendant. I resent that the cloudy era has arranged only tragic fates for the children.

It is not right to praise escaping the painful reality with death, but can I slander Zhuqing with cowardice? When so many people today are confused about the journey of life and need to become walking corpses, Zhuqing's death at least expresses a protest against the times and maintains the integrity of the will to live.

Therefore, I cannot but offer my infinitely respectful condolences to Zhuqing, who is sleeping in the yellow earth.

Rest in peace: Zhuqing: Your the fall of the star will guide our progress.

Reading and Labor by Nilin

I hate those who use reading for entertainment. (Nietzsche)

Holidays call us not to read textbooks from school, but to read the greater society. (Schumann)

Regarding books, I have only one thing to say, that is, reading is not the main part of learning. (Locke)

To believe everything written in books is worse than having no books at all. (Ancient Chinese proverb)

If anyone wants to read good books, they should avoid bad books. (Schopenhauer)

I have read many bad books. Bad things, like good things, must be known practically and correctly. (Gorky)

Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested. (Bacon)

The matter of reading is by no means the same as so-called diligence, just as the matter of taking a walk is not necessarily rest. The true meaning of reading lies in how we read. (Tsurumi Yusuke)

Kites by Lan

It is spring, and there is already a feeling of warm spring. But it is not less stinging the wind, it should be the southeast wind, not feeling too cold. If you are lonely, walk on the street, stroll in the warm sunshine, and look up at the azure sky, then, one by one, kites appear in your eyes, and it makes you clearly feel that it is spring.

Relying on a little bit of intelligence, relying on a little bit of physical action, some paper, some bamboo layers, and a little paste, some strange birds and beasts are made. Children who have no fortune to receive education, God has given them this clever skill. Simple little souls! Protecting this temperament, there should be even greater success and inventions.

The kite on a weak and thin line, no matter how the wind can exert all its force to persecute and destroy it, is like a martyr of the professional art with a spirit of sacrifice, to complete the last stroke in a natural picture book, unyielding to soar straight into the clouds, so as not to fail to fulfill its due mission: This page is the best life symbol to describe life, spring should be the most proud time, the success of personal career, although it is said to have a satisfactory environment, but inevitably there are unexpected twists and turns, how much ability is needed in this question; How much talent is needed to display in this question: not afraid of setbacks, not afraid of failure, not worried about whether you will succeed, only worried about whether you can work hard. Then, you can steadily get a flat ladder, and soar straight into the clouds.

Often, when a kite is released into the clouds, it is no longer subject to any restraint, as if it is asking for a final liberation, and finally, it flies away with the wind! I feel that a person's career, position, and reputation should come to a halt at a certain period of time, so that they can reflect on themselves and not fall into a state of arrogance and extravagance. In this way, one can still preserve the original self, without seeking perfection, without seeking destruction, and the doctrine of the mean should have the value of preservation.

### Economic Security Office Officially Established Yesterday; Deputy Directors Su and Du Issue Statements

The Economic Security Office of the First Police Bureau of this city was officially established yesterday (the 13th). A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Deputy Director Su Chengde yesterday, who issued a statement regarding the establishment of the Economic Security Office, stating: "In order to adapt to the needs of the situation, this Bureau, after careful consideration and meticulous organization, formally established the Economic Security Office today (the 13th). In the past, there were three units in this city responsible for economic management: the Economic Bureau, the Economic Section, and the Economic Division of this Bureau. In the future, they will be unified. The Economic Bureau will be responsible for economic administrative matters, and the Economic Security Office will be responsible for economic investigation and enforcement, cracking down on illegal economic activities such as materials, prices, and finance. The sole purpose is to balance prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. A country should have an economic management agency to handle national economic administration, and allied advanced countries have long established such economic institutions. In a wartime state, Shanghai is an indicator of prices in four provinces and two cities, so the establishment of the Economic Security Office is a matter of urgency.

Strictly Investigate Economic Crimes

Now that it has been established, we will implement strict measures to thoroughly investigate economic crimes. Anyone who commits illegal economic crimes, regardless of their status, will be severely punished. Regarding personnel, after careful consideration, we are very pleased to have Mr. Wu Dao Mao and Yao Yunbo appointed as directors. Both have considerable experience and are very dedicated. In particular, Mr. Wu Dao Mao has been working with allied countries and relevant authorities and has made many contributions to the establishment of the Economic Security Office. I believe that under their leadership, we will not disappoint the public. At the same time, I hope that all citizens will assist us at any time and report illegal merchants. I also hope that knowledgeable people in society will supervise us. I believe that with the cooperation of officials and civilians, Shanghai's wartime economic situation will be brought back on track, and people's livelihoods will be stabilized."

Public Service, Law-Abiding, and Integrity in Policing

The Economic Security Office of the First Police Bureau of this city was officially established yesterday. Senior officials above the section chief level paid respects to Deputy Directors Du Zhengjian and Su Chengde yesterday morning, who gave them instructions. Du Zhengjian said in his instructions: "You are responsible for the important task of economic security and must strive to stabilize people's livelihoods at all times. You must also serve the public honestly, abide by the law, and maintain integrity in policing. Clearly identify goals, focus on facts, and never distort right and wrong. Your actions must be in accordance with public opinion. Although public opinion may not always be perfect, you must adhere to the principle of adopting public opinion."

### Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Hosted Banquet Yesterday for Japanese Count Kuroda

### Indian Community in Shanghai Held Mass Meeting Yesterday to Celebrate Victories of Indian National Army

To commemorate the Amritsar massacre 25 years ago and to praise the glorious victories of the Indian National Army, which entered India together with the Japanese army, the Indian community in Shanghai solemnly held an Indian mass meeting at the Yokohama Bridge Youth Hall at 2:00 p.m. yesterday (the 13th). After the meeting began, they first paid respectful silent tribute to the war dead of Japan and the Indian National Army. Then, Mr. Bao Bi, Liaison Minister of the Shanghai Branch of the Indian Independence League, gave a speech, encouraging the Indian people to be determined to achieve independence. The gist of his speech was as follows: Twenty-five years ago, in Punjab and Amritsar, a rare historical incident of British humiliation of Indians occurred. This is a fact that the Indian people will never forget. The time for revenge has now come. The key to defeating the British is in the hands of our leader, Jiangtela Bose. At the same time, we cannot forget Japan's material and spiritual assistance. The realization of permanent peace in East Asia will certainly not be possible if British forces remain in India. We must rise up together and drive out the Anglo-Saxons.

### Aircraft Donation Committee Issues Letter to Citizens

Since the launch of the aircraft donation campaign in this city, various circles have responded enthusiastically and donated generously. It is understood that the Citizens' Aircraft Donation Committee of this city has specially printed an article entitled "The Aircraft Donation Campaign and the Responsibilities of Citizens" to inform the citizens, and the full text is recorded as follows:

Fulfilling the Responsibilities of Citizens

National prosperity and decline are the responsibility of every citizen, which refers to every individual citizen, because the nation and the citizens are closely related. A nation without citizens is not a nation, and a citizen without a nation cannot be considered a citizen. Especially when the nation is at a critical juncture of survival, every citizen must do their best to shoulder the responsibility of defending the nation! What time is it for China now? Has it reached a critical moment of survival? In the Greater East Asia War, our China has already declared war. Generally, a country that participates in a war not only declares war in words, but must contribute the strength of every citizen to the government to assist the government in the war. This is considered fulfilling the responsibilities of a citizen! The aircraft donation campaign is fulfilling the responsibilities of citizens and is also a manifestation of patriotism. The strength of a nation lies entirely in the enthusiasm and strength of the people. The nation is the entire group of people. Every citizen must clearly recognize their obligations and responsibilities and work hard to shoulder them in their respective positions. No one can shirk this duty. A nation with strength can of course be strong. If citizens abandon their responsibilities in their positions, then the nation's strength will gradually weaken, and the fate and property of the citizens will fall into a tragic situation.

Striving for Victory with All Efforts

Recently, there are still some people who cannot clearly recognize their responsibilities and obligations, and of course cannot contribute to the nation as much as possible. Their hopes and slogans are nothing more than "independence and autonomy" and "freedom and equality." They think this is patriotism, but in fact this attitude is not only useless to the nation, but simply misleading the nation. May I ask, who should bear the responsibility for the nation's prosperity and revival? How can friendly nation Japan be a world power? Invincible in every battle, not only is its equipment superior, but the first thing is the unity of the national mindset, the widespread and enthusiastic patriotism, and every citizen is willing to contribute to the nation at all costs, willing to suffer themselves, then of course there is a way to strive for victory. Not only can it strive for victory, but it can also support other countries in East Asia to strive for independence and liberation. Now that the Greater East Asia War has reached the final decisive stage, since our China is a participating country, we of course have a common responsibility for striving for victory.

Protecting the Rear Base

At this critical moment of national construction, it is absolutely not allowed for every citizen to stand aside and watch, while the armed comrades of friendly nations are gloriously killing enemies on the front lines. We should protect the rear. The Shanghai area is the most important base in the rear. In today's military, the power of the air force is unpredictable, and a state of war can occur at any time, regardless of the rear or the front. I hope that the people of Shanghai will make practical donations to the aircraft donation campaign, and stop hesitating. Planning for the nation is planning for yourself. Even if you don't think about winning the Greater East Asia War, you should think about strengthening national defense, or think about preserving your own life and property. You must know that our government will never allow any citizen residing in Shanghai to stand aside and watch during this wartime period. The aircraft donation campaign is a way for every citizen to express their patriotic thoughts, exert their individual strength, and contribute their entire strength to the nation to complete the Greater East Asia War with "final victory."

### Various Trade Associations Establish Mediation Committees to Handle Black Market Disputes

Recently, the authorities' rapid progress in the investigation work has posed a serious threat to general speculative merchants. They are eager to lower the prices of long-stocked goods for sale, and even refuse to accept goods purchased on the black market in the past. As a result, disputes have arisen one after another, and the situation is quite embarrassing. They are now successively requesting their respective trade associations to take into account the welfare of their fellow traders, and to send personnel as soon as possible to impartially mediate the situation in order to achieve a satisfactory solution. However, each trade association only accepts mediation for its own trade members, and at the same time conducts a detailed review of the requests made by members in order to find a solution. It is understood that each trade association has separately established a "Mediation Committee" in order to be dedicated to the job. As soon as it receives a letter requesting mediation from a fellow trader, it will review each of the points raised and then notify each of the fellow trade members to attend the meeting on the specified date. Responsible persons will then be appointed to impartially mediate the situation. After both parties' representatives approve, the mediation record will be signed and the association will issue an execution order. However, in addition to all directors and supervisors being ex-officio members, each trade association's Mediation Committee will also hire experienced people from the industry to participate in order to achieve perfection.

### South City Special Consumption Tax Collection Office Strictly Prohibits Harassment of Businesses
