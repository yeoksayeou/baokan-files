### Current Problems in Elementary Education

Elementary education is the foundation of national education, the basic undertaking that determines the future of the nation and its people. Only when elementary education is well-managed can other secondary, university, and specialized education easily develop and achieve results. Since the 20th century, the elementary education in Japan and Germany has been the best. Those who are now dedicating themselves to serving their own countries and striving for national glory are all elementary school students from ten or twenty years ago! Looking back at our country, since the beginning of the new education at the end of the Qing Dynasty, although national basic education has also been vigorously promoted, the results have not been significant due to the evolution of the political situation. For the sake of the future backbone talents of the country and society, we really must make up our minds and put in painstaking efforts to establish a solid foundation for today's elementary education. The purpose of this newspaper's elementary education symposium, held after the two symposia on higher education, is also to achieve this, hoping to attract special attention and encourage the education authorities and the private education sector to strive forward! (The minutes of the symposium can be found on page 3 of today's newspaper.)

There are too many current problems in elementary education in our country. From the system, content, and methods to the textbook problem, it is truly a tangled mess, and it is definitely not something that can be solved by one or two symposia or one or two papers. However, the following problems are the most serious and possible to discuss, possible to solve, and must be solved first at this time and place:

First, improve the lives of faculty and staff, especially the lives of elementary school teachers. This newspaper has repeatedly appealed for this. Unfortunately, our power is too small. Apart from providing subsidies for faculty and staff and medical subsidies, there are no particularly gratifying achievements to report. What we expect from all parties today is: ○ We hope that the authorities will allocate daily necessities in addition to the special allocation of rice, and take other measures to give special preference to elementary school teachers. ○ We hope that all sectors of society, such as medicine, transportation, culture, and entertainment, will give special preferential treatment to faculty and staff; ○ We hope that wealthier parents of students will donate generously to establish undertakings that help improve the lives of faculty and staff, such as production loans for faculty and staff family members, etc.; ○ We hope that school authorities will implement economic transparency, improve the treatment of faculty and staff, and the most important thing is to increase salaries and provide reasonable board and lodging, and waive all fees for faculty and staff children to attend school. For private schools, in addition to those with excellent history, the education authorities should manage their finances to prevent the principal from controlling them alone. At present, there are many larger schools (referring to elementary, middle, and universities) that charge one to two million yuan per semester, and it is especially necessary to prevent principals from using money for speculative behavior.

Second, regarding strengthening the promotion of the student aid movement and rescuing out-of-school children, it still requires the cooperation of all parties to address the reality at this time and place! Our most urgent hope today is: ○ Wealthier families in society should donate more and more to jointly rescue out-of-school children. ○ Each school should set up as many free school places as possible. It would be best if every principal could take the initiative and consider the largest number of free school places as the greatest honor. ○ Each school should strengthen communication and cooperation with student aid organizations to jointly improve the technical aspects of the student aid movement, such as the screening standards and review methods determined at this elementary education symposium are very important. ○ In addition to striving especially hard, middle, high school, and university students who receive student aid should also participate in assisting in promoting the student aid movement as much as possible, such as investigation, publicity, and other affairs.

Third, is the issue of elementary school teacher qualifications: We have always believed that this is the most serious problem in current elementary education. Improving the material life of elementary school teachers only solves half of the problem. Further progress is needed in increasing the quantity and improving the quality of teachers. Here, we hope that the authorities will devote more efforts to improving and developing teacher training, and at the same time, we still hope that all of you who are currently engaged in elementary education will work hard on the following points: ○ Enrich your own knowledge and skills in your field, and strive to increase efficiency; ○ Enrich your social knowledge, mainly to have a correct understanding of current events, society, and politics; without correct and rich practical knowledge, you cannot teach students who can learn and be useful; ○ Promote the collective learning movement, first organize elementary school teacher learning associations, etc. We must solemnly point out that teaching dead books and teaching books to death is harmful and unprofitable to the country, the nation, and society!

What we have described above is, of course, in terms of the entire education system. Shanghai, as the center of national education, bears an even more arduous educational mission. If we try to review the educational administration of this city in recent years, it must be said that it has been too quiet and passive. The biggest shortcoming is the failure to closely connect with the private education sector. At the same time, the amount of education funding is too small. In the past, the first district only accounted for 9% of the total administrative expenses, and the proportion of education expenses in the municipal government was even smaller. This has also been specifically suggested in the elementary school teacher symposium.

The newly appointed Director of the Education Bureau of this city, Mr. Dai Yingfu, has now taken office. Mr. Dai is rich in experience in educational administration and is courageous in taking responsibility. He will definitely attach importance to the educational mission of this city and refresh educational administration. However, a clever woman cannot cook without rice. First, it is necessary to increase education funding in order to realize ideal plans. In summary, what we hope from the authorities today is: ○ Stabilize the lives of teachers. ○ Rescue out-of-school children. ○ Manage private schools and make their finances transparent. ○ Ban unqualified schools, because the harm of unqualified schools is actually greater than not having schools. We believe that public security, people's livelihood, and education are the three major problems in Shanghai at present, which urgently need the joint efforts of the authorities and the people to solve.

### Prime Minister and Premier of Manchukuo Exchanged Broadcasts Yesterday, Expressing Determination to Defend Greater East Asia and Seek Final Victory in the War

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Koiso and Manchukuo's Premier Zhang held an exchange broadcast at 7:00 PM on the 15th. The Japanese Prime Minister poured out his determination to defend Greater East Asia, saying that he would seize the opportunity, take the offensive, and seek the final victory in the war. Manchukuo's Premier Zhang expressed his deep gratitude for Japan's unchanging policy towards Manchukuo, saying that the 45 million people of Manchukuo are determined to unite with Japan to jointly destroy the enemy. It is also said that this year's Manchukuo harvest will solve the food problem between Japan and Manchukuo. The gist of the report is as follows:

### Speech by the Japanese Prime Minister

When your country was founded, the Empire took the lead in recognizing it. In the past twelve years, the Empire has helped your country to organize various domestic systems, ensure public security, enrich internal affairs, and abolish extraterritorial rights, establish joint defense between Japan and Manchukuo, and other measures, so that your country's foundation has become more and more solid. On the other hand, in terms of national defense, it has always maintained a relationship of two as one with Japan. Needless to say, it has gradually established diplomatic relations with the countries of Greater East Asia and even powerful European countries, and has jumped to become an independent and complete country, which is very commendable. At present, the Greater East Asia War has been going on for more than three and a half years, and the enemy is wantonly invading East Asia, changing its ways and intensifying its efforts. The Japanese Empire is determined to seize the opportunity and take the offensive to achieve the final victory. Externally, it will firmly adhere to its diplomatic policy and promote the spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Your country will contribute its material and spiritual strength and fully cooperate with Japan. In particular, it has made great contributions to Japan in the supply of military supplies and food. The 100 million people of Japan are grateful beyond words. At this critical stage of the decisive battle, the countries and peoples of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere must closely unite, give full play to their total strength, and strive for victory and destroy the enemy in the face of the common goal of revitalizing Greater East Asia. This war is a decisive battle for one billion people in Asia. Your country has a deep understanding of this, so it will be able to work with Japan to form the core of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, consolidate victory, and work hard to establish the way of righteousness in East Asia where all nations prosper together. People of Manchukuo, the time for the decisive battle is approaching, so you must work with Japan with one heart and one mind and move towards destroying the enemy, the United States and Britain.

### Speech by Premier Zhang

Japan has recognized our country for twelve years. During this period, Japan has devoted itself to overcoming all the difficult and inferior conditions and providing our country with the most important and great assistance in construction. At the same time, thanks to the concerted efforts of officials and civilians in our country, Manchukuo has also accumulated a solid national strength that is no less than that of advanced countries. At a time when the Greater East Asia War is becoming more and more intense and the future of Greater East Asia is becoming more and more difficult, Manchukuo, which has the mission of building Greater East Asia in politics, deeply feels that its task is arduous and its responsibility is inescapable. Today, the only way for us to repay the friendship of our allies for many years is to use our already enriched national strength to complete the Greater East Asia War side by side with Japan. The importance of this mission is no greater than today. His Majesty the Emperor of the enemy country specially summoned this official and Chief of the General Affairs Department Takebe on August 31 to give instructions, and instructed the people of Manchukuo, saying: Japan's prosperity is Manchukuo's prosperity, Japan's demise is Manchukuo's demise, and the rise and fall of Japan and Manchukuo is also the rise and fall of the entire East Asia. At this time, you should recognize this point even more and use all means to concentrate on completing the holy war. At the same time, he also donated internal currency to the Japanese military authorities for the production of aircraft to assist frontline operations. We are deeply grateful for the far-reaching nature of His Majesty the Emperor's measures. Our 45 million people should put the above-mentioned imperial edict into practice and strive to increase our combat power and destroy the United States and Britain in order to comfort the Holy Spirit in the slightest. Today, the Manchukuo authorities are actively raising war funds to increase combat power and destroy the United States and Britain. The people of Manchukuo are also pouring their hearts into completing the war. As for this year's crops, there will also be an unprecedented bumper harvest since the founding of the country, so there is no sense of insecurity in the food problem between Japan and Manchukuo, and the mission that the food base of Greater East Asia should have will be completed. In addition, the various mines and factories in Manchukuo are also launching an active movement to increase production and destroy the United States and Britain. As mentioned above, the heroic posture of officials and civilians as one is the posture of Manchukuo today. On this meaningful anniversary, I deeply hope that our people will renew their determination and work with Japan with one heart and one mind to destroy the United States and Britain.

### Commemorative Celebration

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japan-Manchukuo Central Association hosted a commemorative celebration for the 12th anniversary of Japan's recognition of Manchukuo at the Imperial Hotel on the 15th. Participants included Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu, the Ambassador of Manchukuo to Japan, and Japanese officials such as Information Bureau President Ogata, Minister of Education Ninomiya, Minister of Justice Matsuzaka, and many other generals and related representatives.

Ambassador Wang Yunqing of Manchukuo to Japan also gave a speech, the gist of which was: Japan's rise and fall is the rise and fall of Manchukuo, and also the rise and fall of the entire Greater East Asia. Manchukuo is now exerting all its strength to increase food production and is determined to rise up and strive for victory in the Greater East Asia War.

### Japanese Troops on Both Sides of the Nu River Take a Pincer Attack Posture

The Battle of Longling Intensifies

Nu River Front, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force has launched a large-scale counter-offensive to recapture the Yunnan-Burma Highway. However, due to the bravery of the Japanese troops and their fierce harassment of the rear base, their fighting spirit has been declining day by day. Since last autumn, only one division of troops has been able to sneak into the west bank of the Nu River to attack. Last year, large numbers of troops were sent across the Nu River one after another. In mid-May, the 11th and 20th Group Armies, with a total of 150,000 troops, were sent to the Tengyue, Longling, and Lameng areas, and fierce battles broke out between the two sides. The main force of the 20th Group Army was poured into Tengyue, and the Japanese troops continued to send new reinforcements to defeat the Chongqing troops everywhere. In addition to the existing divisions, the Chongqing troops in Longling have also transferred troops from other places in an attempt to recapture Longling, a key point on the Yunnan-Burma Highway. It is said that Wei Lihuang has been ordered to defend the current position to the death. The new Japanese reinforcements have gradually captured the strongholds of the Chongqing troops from the Xiaosongshan area in the south and the Daiyongshan and Xunshan mountains in the northwest, forcing them to the east of Longling. The Japanese air force in Burma is also cooperating with each other, so the military pressure on the Chongqing troops is gradually increasing.

A certain base on the Nu River Front, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese troops in Longling are currently launching an annihilation battle against the 11th Group Army of Chongqing near Longling with the cooperation of large formations of Japanese aircraft. Conversely, the Chongqing troops are transferring rescue troops from various places to strengthen their combat power and stubbornly recapture Longling, repeatedly carrying out counter-attacks. The Japanese troops immediately annihilated them everywhere, causing them to fall into chaos. One day, a powerful unit of Japanese troops who crossed the Longling River attacked the flank of the Chongqing troops and drove out the Chongqing troops on Anglong Mountain, and then advanced to a certain place north of the Nu River. A separate Japanese unit that echoed this also attacked the high ground south of the Nu River. The Chongqing troops near the high ground were attacked from the north and south. A large-scale encirclement and annihilation battle is currently being carried out with Longling as the center, echoing from north to south. The frontline combat strength of the Chongqing Provisional 39th Division has now been reduced from a division to a company. The Chongqing troops have suffered heavy losses, and there are signs of a comprehensive shake-up.

### Frequent Air Raids in the Pacific, More Than a Dozen Enemy Aircraft Shot Down

Southwest Pacific Base, 14th (Central News Agency) - On the 12th, a joint formation of enemy fighters and bombers, totaling about 90 aircraft, raided the Gama Bay area of Halmahera Island during the day. The Japanese army shot down eight of them. In addition, a total of 70 enemy small aircraft raided the Bula area of Tanahmerah Island. One was shot down. On the same day, 50 enemy aircraft, mainly B-24s, raided the Mindanao area. Local Japanese troops shot down four of them. In the Babo area of New Guinea, 40 B-25s raided. The damage to the Japanese side in all aspects was extremely minor.

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to statistics for August, a total of approximately 28,600 enemy aircraft raided the entire Greater East Asia theater. Conversely, the Japanese air force and ground air defense units achieved a total of 294 American aircraft shot down and 522 destroyed in offensive and defensive battles, totaling 816 aircraft.

### Ambassador Yamamoto's Speech

Bangkok, 15th (Central News Agency) - The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to Thailand, Kumaichi Yamamoto, gave a speech stating that Japan's fundamental national policy is to defend East Asia and liberate the nations of East Asia. Therefore, the Japanese government has decided to support Thailand's independence and prosperity. Therefore, the consistent policy will not change due to the reorganization of the cabinet and the change of ambassadors.

### Japanese Cabinet Passes New Bond Issuance

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - After Japan decided to add 25 billion yuan to the temporary military budget, it issued new bonds worth more than 5.197 billion yuan. In order to digest these bonds, it was decided to increase national savings in the 19th year. The National Savings Encouragement Committee was held at the Ministry of Finance on the 13th. As a result of the agreement, it was decided to increase the current target amount of 36 billion yuan by 5 billion yuan to 41 billion yuan. This was formally approved by the cabinet on the 15th and announced by the Information Bureau. According to Minister of Finance Ishiwatari, after the additional wartime military budget is established, the national savings target for this year will also be increased by 5 billion yuan, totaling 41 billion yuan. We hope that the people will practice wartime life and cooperate to complete this new target. Announcement by the Japanese Navy Ministry.

### Vice Admiral Tsukahara Appointed Commander of Yokosuka

Vice Admiral Totsuka Appointed Director of the Naval Air Command

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Navy Ministry announced at 4:30 PM on the 15th: ○ Vice Admiral Tsukahara Nishizo was appointed Commander of the Yokosuka Naval District. With this order, Admiral Nomura Naokuni, the former commander, was dismissed and will be given another appointment. ○ Vice Admiral Totsuka Michitaro was appointed Director of the Naval Air Command. With this order. According to reports, Vice Admiral Tsukahara, the newly appointed Commander of the Yokosuka Naval District, and Vice Admiral Totsuka, the newly appointed Director of the Naval Air Command, have both devoted themselves to building the Japanese naval air force. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, they served as commanders of fleets and were active on the front lines, demonstrating their military talents. This personnel adjustment shows the Japanese Navy's determination to engage in an air battle in the Pacific. Their future activities are highly anticipated.

### Quebec Conference: British and American Attempts Fail

Director Matsushima Gives a Speech

The Japanese Fleet Reporting Department in China specially met with Chinese news reporters in Shanghai yesterday (the 15th). Director Matsushima of the Reporting Department gave a detailed explanation of the recent Quebec Conference held by the anti-Axis powers, the Soviet Union's refusal to participate, which proves the rift between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and Chiang Kai-shek's reliance on foreign forces, which allows Britain and the United States to exploit Chinese resources, which deserves serious attention.

### Soviet Union Refuses to Attend Conference

Director Matsushima first stated: Regarding the Quebec Conference recently held by the anti-Axis powers, the purpose revealed is to address the problems of the Pacific and Europe. The content of the meeting disclosed by the Secretary of the President of the United States actually stated that it was to develop the ability of British and American joint military operations in the Pacific and Europe. The British and Americans hoped that the Soviet Union would participate in this conference, but Stalin refused to attend, which immediately caused the British and American attempts to fail. In his speech, he even falsely claimed that the Soviet Union and the United States were taking the same steps, which is actually wishful thinking.

### Chongqing Side Attempts to Rely on Foreign Forces

Secondly, the military talks between Chiang Kai-shek and Hurley have not yet been announced. At the same time, Song Ziwen also participated in the economic talks between Chiang Kai-shek and Nelson on the 14th of this month. The purpose of these two people's visit to Chongqing is to continue the meeting of Chongqing [Resistance War] and to discuss post-war development issues. Therefore, Hurley's visit to Chongqing deserves special attention. In addition to the fact that the Chongqing regime relies on foreign forces to facilitate its [Resistance War], it also needs to rely on foreign forces to engage in development and construction after the war, so we should pay serious attention. Especially the most obvious recently is the trend of relying on external strength and internal aid. For example, yesterday (the 14th), the Chongqing side promoted Germany's comprehensive peace, which had a huge impact on the local stock market. Director Xuan said: I deeply feel that if the reserve force itself in the future has to rely on the crisis of foreign forces, then the domestic people's livelihood will be affected even more, and this problem should be paid special attention to and studied.

### Confidence in Victory in East Asia

If you want to save yourself, you must rely on your own strength. Although the European war situation is tense at present, we will never let the European war affect the Greater East Asia War. We have a firm belief in completing the victory in the Greater East Asia War. Regarding the China issue, China is vast and rich in resources. In the past, as a result of the exploitation by Britain and the United States in many ways, the resources enjoyed by the Chinese people were quite small. In order to break the exploitation of small and weak nations, we launched the Greater East Asia War of Justice. However, the Chongqing side does not hesitate to flatter and rely on foreign forces to fight the war, and plans to rely on foreign forces to develop after the war. This action is particularly welcome to our ally Japan. Recently, Chinese youths have realized that the concept of saving China must rely on China's own strength and the assistance of its ally Japan to save China from danger. At the same time, Japan's actions should sincerely strive for comprehensive peace and seek the happiness of the Chinese people.

It was briefly stated that the agricultural production increase work this year has achieved considerable results since September, but it is still far from what we hoped for. Therefore, at the end of the production increase year, we are convening this meeting to review the past and plan for the future, which is of profound significance. We sincerely hope that the representatives attending will report in detail on the past work situation, especially the difficulties in promoting the work, and jointly discuss improvements. It is hoped that the central and local governments will move towards consistency in the agricultural production increase work in the future. Subsequently, the relevant agencies and representatives of various provinces and cities successively reported on the progress of the production increase work in their respective regions, all of which were very concise and well done. Then, the discussion began, and concrete conclusions were reached: (A) Regarding organization, ○ If the organizational rules of the Promotion Committees of various provinces and cities have not yet been drafted, they should be drafted as soon as possible in accordance with the organizational rules. ○ If the county and district Promotion Committees in the production increase areas have not been established, the provincial and municipal Promotion Committees should urge them to organize as soon as possible. (B) Regarding the distribution of production increase funds, ○ The Promotion Committees of various provinces and cities should apply for production increase funds in accordance with the regulations of the Central Government. ○ The application for production increase funds by local cooperatives shall be approved by the Promotion Committees of the provinces and cities first, and then the application shall be forwarded to the relevant ministries and commissions by the Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan. (C) In terms of work, ○ The work reports of the Promotion Committees of various provinces and cities shall be submitted to the Central Government on a monthly basis. ○ The Promotion Committees of various provinces and cities should maintain close contact with the county and district Promotion Committees and the Central Government. All the above issues have concrete conclusions. It is believed that the conference has achieved extraordinarily satisfactory results, which will be of great help to the promotion of future production increase work.

### Japanese Air Force Fiercely Bombs Liuzhou Airfield

Chongqing American Aircraft Raid Sanshui Unsuccessful

China Base, 14th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese bomber squadron raided Liuzhou, the Chongqing army's counter-offensive base, at dawn on the 14th, heavily damaging the area near the airfield. Another squadron of Japanese aircraft bombed Rongrong (27 kilometers northeast of Liuzhou), a key point on the Xiang-Gui Railway, near the station, and fiercely bombed the material warehouses and vehicle groups there before safely flying back to a certain place. A certain base on the China Front, 15th (Central News Agency) - At 11:00 AM on the 14th, approximately 20 P-40 aircraft from the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing raided Sanshui (40 kilometers west of Guangzhou).

### Japanese Army Completely Occupies Quan County

Hankou, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Japanese army base on the Hunan Front, the Japanese rapid troops have broken through the Guangxi Province and are advancing westward with the momentum of a broken bamboo.

According to reports, the county seat is located on the bank of the Xiang River, 80 kilometers from the provincial border, and is a key point on the Xiang-Gui Railway. It has been a key point of contact between Hunan and Guangxi provinces since ancient times, and is the military, political, and economic center of northern Guangxi Province, and is especially a forward stronghold for the defense of Guilin, which is of great military value. Due to the fall of Quan County, the strategic posture of the Japanese troops occupying Xinning and the Simen Bridge in the northwest and the Japanese troops controlling the Quan County plain has become more consolidated. This is a major threat to Chongqing and the Chongqing American Air Force.

### Japanese Troops Cross the Oujiang River Northward

Adopting a Cooperative Policy Going Forward
Fifteenth dispatch from the Central News Agency in Nanjing: In order to respect freedom of speech, accept public opinion and criticism, and ensure that the people of the entire nation truly understand the reality of the current situation and are not swayed by enemy propaganda, the Propaganda Department has formulated the following key points for improving news censorship: ○ Regarding the attitude toward newspaper and magazine commentary, the department will abandon the previous policy of passive suppression and adopt a cooperative policy.

### Canadian Troops to Participate in Pacific War

Being Discussed at the Quebec Conference
Fifteenth dispatch from the Central News Agency in Stockholm: The Haitong News Agency reports: A special correspondent from the "[Manchester Guardian]" says that the most difficult issue at the Quebec Conference is Canada's participation in the Pacific War. The resolution to this issue will be decided in the conversations between Churchill and Canadian Prime Minister King, because anti-overseas war sentiment is increasingly prevalent in Canada; therefore, it is expected that Canada will only dispatch a small number of troops to fight in the Pacific. American newspapers are generally predicting that the appointment of the new commander of the anti-Axis forces in the Pacific will be announced at the end of the Quebec Conference.

### Battle at the Belfort Gap Enters New Phase

Fight for Aachen Continues
Fifteenth dispatch from the Central News Agency at the Belfort Gap: The Haitong News Agency reports: The Allied offensive at the Belfort Gap may create a situation similar to Cassino. Geographically, the valley between the Vosges Mountains and the Swiss Jura Mountains is very similar to Cassino in Italy. The German troops now holding this area have the same determination to resist as the German troops who held Cassino this spring. Among the Allied troops attacking the Belfort Gap this time are those who fought at Cassino. The operation of the U.S. Seventh Army in the Belfort area has clearly entered a new phase, and the fighting is becoming more intense. The battle on the southern flank has developed into fierce trench warfare in most areas. The sudden northward turn of the U.S. Sixth Army Group, intending to advance from Zasu to Belfort, shows the failure of its original offensive plan. Fifteenth dispatch from the Central News Agency in Berlin: German News Agency military report: The focus of the Western Front is once again between Maastricht and a certain stronghold southeast of Aachen, where fierce battles are currently taking place to seize the outposts of the Western Wall.

### From Shanghai to Beijing

— By our Special Traveling Correspondent Wu Gong

This is the fifth time in my life that I have traveled to the North. The first two times were before the Incident [likely the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War], and although the latter two times were after the Incident, it has been two years since my fourth trip north. Originally, there was nothing worth recording on the journey, but due to the recent fluctuations in prices, I have seen many strange phenomena, which cannot help but make me speak out.

### Black Market Tickets and Unreasonable Extortion

Mentioning travel these days will probably give anyone a headache! For example, there's no way to buy train tickets, and in addition to being crowded along the way, you're subjected to all kinds of trouble everywhere, which is an undeniable fact. A first-class ticket from Shanghai to Beijing costs 2,850 yuan, which is probably half the price of a second-class ticket compared to the black market! However, in addition to the prevalence of black market ticket sales, after the recent rectification by the Huazhong Railway Authority, the boarding order at the Shanghai North Station has improved, and all the previous chaos and extortion have noticeably decreased. This shows that the suggestions made by Shanghai public opinion regarding transportation improvements in the past were not a waste of words, and at the same time, it clearly demonstrates the Allied powers' determination to cooperate. It only took six hours to reach Nanjing from Shanghai. Our train was not delayed that day, and it arrived on time at the Xia Kai Station at 2:30 in the afternoon. Because there was plenty of time, we did not delay in Nanjing and immediately crossed the river to go straight to the Pukou Station. But the situation there was different; not only was the order chaotic, but also we saw hundreds of yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes flying everywhere, which made us deeply feel the reality of the currency devaluation. Fortunately, a fellow traveler of the reporter had special escorts, so he was not affected, but one of the travelers I was with was extorted 5,000 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes because he was lost in the crowded mass of people. The truth is that he was a person specializing in the chemical industry who brought some samples of Western medicine from Shanghai to Tianjin to test and manufacture, but when he arrived at the Pukou Station, the inspectors used the name "[Western medicine]" to demand a fine of 5,000 yuan from him. He said that these were samples and not worth much, so you can take them for public use. But the inspector shook his head, did not want to confiscate them, and detained him with "[Bureau Take]", which finally made that friend sacrifice 5,000 yuan to catch the train. There was also a professor at Peking University who was fined because he had too much luggage, and it cost him a total of 4,000 to 5,000 yuan to pass through checkpoints with banknotes along the way from Xiaguan to Pukou. We couldn't help but feel chilled when we saw these facts! Someone calculated that these inspectors can extort a staggering one million yuan per train arrival and departure.

### Train Porters Are Arrogant and Overbearing

Because we had special escorts, we got on the Jinpu Line train very early. But when we got on the train, there were already many passengers on the train, especially the second-class seats were already overcrowded. Later, we asked them and learned that they had paid a huge amount of money similar to a toll to obtain such privileges. We went to the first-class carriage but there was no one there, but the words "[Designated by the Embassy]" were written on each seat in chalk. We had no choice but to go to another carriage, which was second-class, but half of the carriage also had "[Used as First Class]" written on it in chalk. At the same time, the train porters were busy, driving away second-class passengers on the one hand, and on the other hand, more experienced travelers were negotiating with them. We sat down without any trouble because we had first-class tickets in hand at this moment. After the train started, we learned that the so-called "[Used as First Class]" was originally a formality, and the situation of "money can make the gods move" made you fully understand its meaning there. When the train was approaching Xuzhou, these pot-bellied train porters quickly wiped off the "[Used as First Class]" chalk, and they were full of joy, planning how to spend this good evening! Speaking of train porters, they are just servants on the train, but they are especially authoritative on the Jinpu Line (referring to south of Jinan). They can use some clever methods to make a first-class passenger have no seat, and they can also make a second-class passenger feel as comfortable as a first-class passenger. We can hardly imagine that after eight years of war, the morals of the children who serve on the train have fallen to such an extent! And they think they have reliable support behind them, and they don't treat ordinary passengers as "[people]" at all, as if only train porters are authorities in the world! They scold and beat those who are more honest or poor. These are all facts that the reporter witnessed this time. I hope that the railway authorities from Pukou to Jinan will pay more attention, because this kind of fact is especially harmful to the feelings between the Chinese and Japanese people! I will now give an example: After midnight on September 5th, when the train departed from Xuzhou, we boldly walked into the real first class because the train porters had wiped off the "[Used as First Class]" chalk. About an hour later, a dispute suddenly arose in the carriage. It turned out that an extremely fierce train porter was gesticulating to drive away a colonel officer from the Nanjing Gendarmerie Headquarters of the National Government. The reason was that a Allied regimental commander came up at Lincheng, so he wanted to vacate the seat occupied by the colonel officer in advance. However, all the first-class carriages were mostly filled with passengers, and they had no place to make way for the three of them, so they quarreled over this. The extremely fierce train porter was not only arrogant but also had no human breath at all. Later, although the train conductor came to explain, the train porter still stubbornly insisted on his point of view and refused to budge. We clearly heard the train conductor say that because two Allied officers were coming up ahead, they asked them to give up two seats, but unexpectedly the train porter gradually wanted to force them to give up all four seats. As a result, the situation almost came to a standstill, because the officer did not understand Japanese and the train conductor did not understand Chinese, so the train porter could only stir up trouble in the middle. Later, we saw that we really couldn't bear it any longer, so we asked a friend who was proficient in Japanese to stand up and interfere, and loudly scolded the train porter, which made the train conductor understand everything and express his apologies on behalf of the train. Finally, in an atmosphere of understanding, two seats were given up. If it hadn't been for that friend's help that day, wouldn't things have come to a head in the end? We admired the train conductor's gentle and sensible attitude. If the people serving in our country in the Allies could all be like him, it is expected that the feelings between the Chinese and Japanese people would become closer day by day.

### Forty Hours to Beijing

Although I have been away from Beijing for two years, the scenery of Beijing is still lovely. What impressed me the most was that when I arrived at Qianmen Station at 1:00 a.m. that day, the electric lights were still shining brightly along the way. It can be seen that there is no panic about water and electricity here like in Shanghai. However, it is not easy to find a more comfortable hotel in Beijing due to the large number of tourists recently. For example, the Beijing Hotel, the Six Nations Hotel, the German Hotel, and the Embassy Hotel are all full, and there are still many tourists waiting on the registration book. Therefore, if you want to travel to Beijing, if you don't have relatives or friends, you must first telegraph to book a room in advance, otherwise you will have difficulties temporarily. We started from Shanghai this time, and it was very safe along the way, and the delay was not very long. It took a total of forty hours to reach Beijing. Compared with airplanes, it only took eight times as long, so it was a pleasant journey!

### Allied Military Police Crack Down on Imposters Demanding Money by Fraud

Citizens Should Report Extortion Immediately
It has recently come to light that unscrupulous individuals are exploiting the air raid blackout period to boldly impersonate Allied Japanese military police, extorting and terrorizing the people for money. The reporter interviewed Major Goro Mizutani, commander of the Shanghai North Detachment of the military police, yesterday (the 15th) to learn more about the situation. It has been discovered that unscrupulous individuals have been impersonating military police, terrorizing the people, and defrauding them of money. The military police authorities are conducting a thorough investigation and have arrested some perpetrators, but many remain at large. The military police authorities are intensifying their efforts to apprehend these criminals. Several days ago, the Shanghai North Detachment of the military police apprehended two lawbreakers impersonating military police, one Japanese and one Chinese. The Japanese individual impersonated a military police officer, while the Chinese individual impersonated a translator for the military police, engaging in extortion and terrorizing honest citizens in the city, resulting in numerous victims. Recently, they went to a cotton firm in an attempt to extort money, accusing the firm of supplying materials to the enemy and claiming that the military authorities were aware of this and were secretly investigating. They stated that if the firm provided a bribe, they could avoid punishment; otherwise, they would be severely punished. They also visited various brothels, falsely claiming to be smoking opium, and as soon as the madam produced the smoking paraphernalia, they impersonated military police to demand money. Furthermore, they exploited the air raid blackout period to sneak into hotels and extort money, using the excuse of leaking light. If residents were playing mahjong at home during an air raid, these individuals saw it as an excellent opportunity to knock on the door and threaten extortion, demanding money under the pretext of checking citizens' identification. Many cases of this nature have occurred, but only a few have been successful. However, after defrauding people of money, these individuals squandered it lavishly, while the defrauded citizens mostly remained silent and dared not report the incidents. It has been discovered that Chinese and Japanese citizens are working together earnestly to prevent air raids, and are united in foiling enemy planes' dreams of attacking Shanghai. Unexpectedly, these heartless villains have acted so wickedly and shamelessly, daring to commit such outrageous acts. Anyone who damages the reputation of the military police of the military authorities will be dealt with as a major criminal case in Japan, and their audacity in committing crimes by exploiting air raids is even more despicable. The two individuals have already been handed over to the military court for strict punishment, and will be charged with extortion during wartime. Whenever our military police go out on official business, whether in uniform or plainclothes, they carry identification. If citizens are subjected to a search by military police, they can request to see the identification and business card as proof. Major Mizutani sincerely hopes that the Chinese people will cooperate, and that any suspicious military police or instances of extortion should be reported to the military police by telephone or in writing. Otherwise, concealing such information will only encourage evil practices. A small matter among the people can have a large impact on the reputation of the military police. At this critical moment in the Great East Asia War, everyone in East Asia is rising up to fight for final victory. We are determined to unite and do our best to build a new Shanghai, protect the safety of the people, and jointly eliminate evildoers.

### 12th Anniversary of the Founding of Manchukuo Commemorated

Yesterday (the 15th) was the 12th anniversary of the founding of Manchukuo. The Manchukuo General Consulate in Shanghai held a reception for the Chinese and Japanese press on the 9th floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund at 3:00 p.m., hosted by Consul General Ye himself. During the reception, Consul General Ye stood up and delivered a speech, reporting on the founding of Manchukuo in detail and strongly declaring his determination to complete the Great East Asia War.

### Special Tax Office Established Today

In order to reorganize the city's special consumption tax and increase tax revenue to enrich the national treasury, the city's financial authorities have established a Special Consumption Tax Management Office, responsible for the investigation, inspection, and collection of special consumption taxes in the city. Mr. Li Junde has been appointed as the director of the office. It is reported that the office will be officially established today (the 16th).

### Police Consumer Cooperative Distributes Rice Already Shipped to Shanghai

The Police Bureau Consumer Cooperative of this city previously had manager Ding and section chief Tsuda travel to Wuhu to purchase rice. Since then, the bureau has hired Mr. Yoshiwo Miyara as a consultant, who spared no effort to go to Wuhu himself. On August 14th, 3,800 bags were loaded and shipped to Shanghai. Fortunately, consultant Miyara greatly contributed to the shipment of rice to Shanghai for distribution. Currently, people are being urged to pick them up, and as soon as the procedures are completed, the rice can be distributed according to regulations in the near future.

### Cotton Control Council and Flour and Wheat Council to Discuss Purchasing Cotton and Wheat

The Cotton Control Committee of the General Chamber of Commerce is currently meeting for several days to discuss the purchasing policy for new cotton after the autumn of this year. The cotton purchasing organization will also be adjusted, and it is reported that a reasonable evaluation will be made for the purchase price of new cotton. It is reported that the first phase of the wheat purchasing work of the Flour and Wheat Control Committee of the General Chamber of Commerce has come to an end, with more than one million bags of wheat purchased, which is a good result. It is reported that the second phase of wheat purchasing will begin soon. The council convened wheat purchasers from various regions to Shanghai the other day to discuss the steps for the second phase of wheat purchasing. It is reported that the purchase price of wheat in the second phase will also be adjusted.

### Shanghai Municipal Works Bureau Repairs Major Roads in Dachang

The Changzhong Road is the only thoroughfare from the Dachang Airfield to the urban area. The road, which extends more than six kilometers from Tianlu Road to the airfield, is frequently damaged due to heavy vehicle traffic. In view of this, the Shanghai Municipal Works Bureau invited tenders for construction in April of this year. Construction has recently begun and is expected to be completed by mid-November. However, because the road is a macadam surface, the required materials are not easy to find on the market. The bureau has negotiated with the Shanghai Gas Company to purchase 100 tons of asphalt. When the entire road is completed, vehicle traffic will definitely be convenient.

### Xu Shentang's Birthday Celebration Aids Education

Our newspaper's reader scholarship fund received a generous donation of 30,000 yuan from Mr. Xu Guanqun of the Xinya Weaving Factory yesterday. It is said that Mr. Xu's father recently celebrated his 70th birthday, and he strongly advocated against extravagance. In addition to distributing the gifts from relatives and friends to charitable organizations, he transferred 30,000 yuan to our newspaper's scholarship fund. His kindness is deeply appreciated. Mr. Liang Bingqian wrote: Dear Sir, My friend Mr. Guo Zhaochang previously completed a certain transaction with the help of intermediaries, and Mr. Guo said, "[Please have a simple meal to express my gratitude]." Unexpectedly, a letter arrived yesterday, saying, "[You are busy, I am afraid you will not have time to attend, so I respectfully offer a check for 5,000 yuan.]" At a time of crisis, material resources are scarce and we should be frugal. How can I enjoy such a lavish meal? Have you not heard of "[Behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine rot; on the roads, there are corpses of those who died of starvation.]" Those with compassion cannot allow this! Therefore, I dare to use this opportunity to donate the original check for 5,000 yuan to your newspaper's scholarship fund, not daring to claim it as a good deed, but actually creating blessings for Mr. Guo. Not only will the students benefit greatly, but I will also be grateful.] According to Mr. Guo and Mr. Liang, one is mindful of the source of water, and the other does not take wealth unscrupulously, which are both commendable and valuable. This is written to express gratitude. The scholarship fund received yesterday included 30,000 yuan transferred from the Xu Shentang birthday celebration, 6,600 yuan from colleagues at the Huamei Tobacco Factory, 6,000 yuan from Xiao Rulie (refunded scholarship), 5,000 yuan from Guo Zhaochang (delivered by Mr. Liang Bingqian), 2,000 yuan from Shen Zhongxian, 1,600 yuan from colleagues on Changbai Street in Huangpu District, 1,000 yuan each from layman Jin Su and Pang Benzhang, and 400 yuan (found items) from the Star Grand Theater.

### Symposium on Elementary School Education

This newspaper held a symposium on education in universities and middle schools on the 4th and 6th of this month to discuss the general guidelines for improving education. At 4:00 p.m. on the 8th of this month, a symposium on elementary school education was held at the conference hall of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. The attendees were Liu Huiyuan, Zheng Baozhang, Yao Shaoxiu, Zhang Xinbo, Shen Xibin, Gong Jiachang, Chen Hongbi, Wu Ruoan, Ding Yixin, Kong Yunfu, Yu Shumin, Xu Zichang, and Lu Zhaohai, Mr. Hu Weiqing. The chairman was still Mr. Huang Jingwan, director of the Social Service Department of this newspaper. The main points of the symposium are recorded as follows: Huang Jingwan: Elementary school is the basic education of the nation. Whether the education received is good or not is enough to affect one's life and conduct in a small way, and it is related to the strength of the country in a large way. Therefore, advanced countries attach importance to elementary school education no less than to universities and middle schools, because the education received in childhood leaves the deepest impression. [You reap what you sow]. With good seeds, you will naturally get good results. You have been engaged in elementary school education for a long time and have experience. You must have unique insights on the current problems of elementary school education, what should be promoted, what should be reformed, and how to improve it. Today, our newspaper is holding a symposium for elementary school teachers. We are grateful for your presence. Please express your opinions freely. Huang Jingwan: The pathological state of education is now a major problem that needs to be remedied urgently. The biggest crux of the problem lies in the instability of teachers' lives. In this extraordinary period, the lives of those in the education field are unspeakably difficult, especially elementary school teachers. While teaching at school, they are worried about firewood, rice, oil, and salt at home, and they cannot concentrate their energy, so they are perfunctory. Therefore, the current situation of the education field can be said to be in crisis. Today, our newspaper is holding a symposium. Please give your opinions on this issue. As far as this newspaper is concerned, we have always been sympathetic to elementary school teachers. At the same time, we have jobs such as subsidies for teachers and staff and medical assistance to fulfill our service duties. Gong Jiachang: Regarding the improvement of the lives of elementary school teachers, the main thing is to increase salaries. The economic situation of each school is different, and the salaries of teachers also vary greatly. Our school (Ningbo Luhai Elementary School) recently submitted a salary increase to the school board, and it is unlikely to be disappointed. In addition, there are two other methods: ○Fundraising. ○The school board runs scholarships to reward outstanding and poor students. Personally, I would like to offer a few suggestions: ○The economic situation of each school should be made public, and more than 70% of the total income should be distributed to teachers and staff. ○The media should advocate for the municipal authorities to find ways to increase special rations for education colleagues, and to increase the rationing of daily necessities in addition to rice. ○Organize production loans for the families of teachers and staff so that the families of teachers can engage in side businesses. Wu Ruoan: According to the regulations of the authorities, schools should allocate 70% of the tuition fees to teachers and make the economy as fair as possible. Our school (Nanyang Girls' Elementary School) has implemented the public system for three years and gives 100% of the tuition fees to teachers. As for office expenses such as water and electricity, they are all taken from miscellaneous fees, which will never affect the lives of teachers. The tuition fee for this semester has increased by about four times compared to the previous semester, but the income of employees has also increased by four times. Therefore, although the lives of the employees of our school are difficult, everyone can share the joys and sorrows and maintain education. Chen Hongbi: Our school (Guangdong Elementary School) has adopted an open economic system since its establishment in the first year of the Republic of China. We distribute 95% of the tuition fees to employees and issue several months of salary at the beginning of the semester to stabilize the lives of teachers. Wu Ruoan: Recently, a student from our school (Nanyang Girls' Elementary School) brought a letter from the section chief of the Works Bureau, requesting free tuition based on the qualifications of civil servants' children. Although the Education Bureau has expressed the principle of free tuition for civil servants' children, the implementation methods have not been announced. Our school also has free tuition methods, with free tuition reaching 100,000 yuan per semester. Before receiving the Education Bureau's methods, it seems inconvenient to accept the above-mentioned matters, otherwise, it will reduce the school's income and indirectly affect the lives of teachers. I wonder if other schools have encountered the same situation? Shen Xibin: Regarding this point, our school (Chongshi Elementary School) has also encountered it. As far as I know, the Education Bureau's principle is: [Children of low-level civil servants are exempted from paying part of the tuition fee], but the standard for [low-level] and [part] should be determined by the Education Bureau, and the application and investigation procedures should also be handled by the Education Bureau. Kong Yunfu: A student's parent even brought a letter to our school requesting a refund. Huang Jingwan: In short, the education cause is not only a problem for schools and teachers, but the government and society should also take responsibility. As it is now, the efforts made by the authorities in education seem to be too little. Huang Jingwan: This newspaper has been running student aid funds for seven sessions, and the amount of student aid funds received has been increasing in each session. This certainly shows the society's sympathy for students, but as the number of applications increases each session, we also feel the difficulty of distribution. Our newspaper pays equal attention to the four factors of physical fitness, family background, academic performance, and moral character of the applicants. We are grateful for the cooperation of the schools. Now, please give your valuable opinions on the application procedures or the methods of selection. Gong Jiachang: The selection criteria should be [poverty-based]. Although reporting is effective, it is ultimately a method after the fact. It is best to find ways to prevent it before it happens. When handling the application procedures, a detailed investigation must be carried out first, but the investigation is complicated and cannot be done without a large number of staff. In my opinion, high-grade students can be selected to take on this work. After each session, each student who receives assistance should be interviewed individually during a semester, and the interview records should be used as the selection criteria for the next session. Then the review of the next session will be easier to handle. Chen Hongbi: Regarding the review, if it is only based on the report card, it is often unreliable. According to my past experience in handling student aid funds for the Guangdong Alumni Association, many schools often cheat for students, issue fake diplomas, fill in fake scores, and deceive for profit. Your newspaper's method is to have the schools where they are studying recommend them and then conduct a selection test to prevent deception and ensure that the donations are used where they should be. This is admirable. As for the school, it is still a moral issue. Zheng Baozhang: Our school (Jingan Temple Elementary School) responds to the student aid movement, and the whole school sets a 10% free quota. In addition, the school board sets up five scholarships to provide students with book fees for students receiving assistance from Shenbao, Xinwenbao, and the Municipal Education Bureau. After 3 p.m., we use spare time and classrooms to run voluntary schools. Now there is a suggestion that the number of application forms issued by your newspaper to schools for recommendation should be limited to 5% of the total number of students in the school. This kind of restriction should be determined according to the status of each school. For example, in schools in high-end residential areas, most of the students' families are wealthy, and often there are no 5% of the students in the whole school who need to apply. On the contrary, in some areas, 5% of the application forms are not enough. Therefore, please consider the handling of your newspaper. Huang Jingwan: This newspaper welcomes your suggestions very much. The following turns to page 4

### Symposium on Elementary School Education

Continued from page 3 Huang Jingwan: Elementary school students are the future masters of the country. The health of elementary school students is greatly related to the prosperity and strength of the country. In this time of difficult living, maintaining health is really not easy, but the school should always take care as much as possible to protect this group of national seedlings. Xu Zichang: This problem is fundamentally in the business problem, but in such an era, talking about business is probably not easy to fit the actual situation. Since the root cause cannot be achieved in the treatment, I would like to contribute a few superficial views on the symptomatic aspects: ○ The school and teachers should promote good cleaning habits. ○ Your newspaper should run a circulating doctor. In the past, the Health Bureau often sent staff to schools to inject preventive injections and vaccinations, but now they often cannot be popularized. I hope that your newspaper will promote this and popularize this work. Zheng Baozhang: Hygiene habits are very important. Our school, Jingan Elementary School, has always attached great importance to it: ○ Morning exercises, limiting students to arrive at school before 8 am, the first class is set as morning exercises, which has great effects. ○ Cleaning inspection. Today's elementary school students are often thin and easily infected with diseases such as pulmonary tuberculosis. Our school is responsible for checking by the class teachers of each grade. Once a disease state is found, the parents are immediately reminded to send them to the doctor for treatment. Those with poor family conditions are immediately asked social groups to provide free diagnosis and treatment. The health of elementary school students is really too related to the health of the nation. Xu Zichang: Regarding the cleanliness and hygiene of children's lives, we should first pay attention to the habits of families and parents, but the responsibilities of the school are no less than those of the family. Infectious diseases such as meningitis, typhoid fever, and tuberculosis are easily spread in schools with a large number of people, incomplete equipment, and crowded school buildings. For example, crowded classrooms, space and area that do not meet the standards, and poor air circulation should all be the responsibility of the school. Often, many schools ask elementary school students to work outside of class to do sweeping, pouring sputum pots, wiping blackboards, etc. As a result, the tender bodies of elementary school students are greatly harmed. Therefore, I advocate abolishing this system. Each school should have at least two workers who are in charge of cleaning matters. Shen Xibin: At the same time, I feel that the lack of children's entertainment venues in this city, such as public playgrounds and children's parks, has no impact on children's health. The Municipal Park is now hoping to set up more children's parks and sports fields in each district. This time, Nanyang Hospital provided free physical examinations for the students who received assistance from the elementary school group of this newspaper, which is also a help for the health of elementary school students. I hope that all teachers will inform the students that they should go to the examination according to the scheduled schedule with the free examination certificate issued by this newspaper, and not miss the opportunity. Xu Zichang: In addition to good cleaning habits, good exercise habits are also very important. Gong Jiachang: Before the children's park can be opened up, it is best to allow elementary school students to enter the park for free. The current park is too aristocratic! In addition, I think that the improvement of curriculum standards and teaching methods also directly or indirectly affects children's health. Xu Zichang: General schools only value recitation. I think that except for a part of the Chinese class that needs to be read carefully, all other courses should not adopt the recitation method. Schools and teachers should never cater to the psychology of parents and make students [read books to death, read dead books, and die from reading books]. Huang Jingwan: From the habits of elementary school students, I think of the problem of children's extracurricular life. [Those who are near vermilion are red, and those who are near ink are black]. Children's very pure minds are easily affected by the so-called [alley education] if they are not properly guided. Each school has some special methods for guiding the life of elementary school students. You may wish to provide more. Yu Shumin: Most families in Shanghai do not pay much attention to family education, and it is difficult for schools to contact families. It is best for schools to extend the time for leaving school so that elementary school students can do more homework, singing and entertainment under the supervision of teachers. Especially important is that children should be absolutely prohibited from reading comic books. Chen Hongbi: Just like the lack of children's parks, there seem to be only a few children's libraries in this city, and the publication of children's books can be said to be almost non-existent. In addition to hoping that schools will provide more guidance, I also hope that the publishing industry will pay attention to this issue. Wu Ruoan: Our school adopts a class meeting system to organize elementary school students. In addition, we hold lectures, entertainment parties, and various competitions, which are guided by the class teachers. Xu Zichang: In my opinion, the current elementary school students in each school can be said to have [no life outside of class]. Schools pay too much attention to dead knowledge and too little attention to art. I advocate that schools should have at least a training committee, which often meets to study students' extracurricular and off-campus life. In student organizations, the Baojia compilation method is a very worthwhile method to adopt. In this way, with organization and guidance, we can achieve [truth, goodness, and beauty] and [hand, brain, and heart] education. Huang Jingwan: Now, please express your high opinions on the quantitative promotion and qualitative improvement of compulsory elementary schools in Shanghai. Xu Zichang: The biggest difficulty in running compulsory schools is the school building. I hope that each school can make more use of the time and space of leaving school. Wu Ruoan: Even if the school building problem is solved, the current power saving is also a serious problem. Huang Jingwan: In addition to night schools, I hope to set up more morning schools to help out-of-school children by using the energetic morning. Wu Ruoan: The biggest problem seems to be the problem of life. Without enough food and clothing, how can we talk about studying? Children who are young cannot afford to go to school because their parents cannot afford it. Children who are older stop studying because they help their parents earn money. Therefore, children have to throw away their books and pick up rice bags to sell rice or do small business. Zheng Baotong: In the families of poor people, it is certainly painful for children to drop out of school, but they have to take care of greater pain and resolutely stop studying. When our school first started an informal school, the number of children who came to study was very small because they thought that dropping out of school was not the greatest pain. Huang Jingwan: Therefore, in addition to hoping that each school will establish informal schools, we also hope that each factory, each union, and each professional group will promote and run informal schools to help this group of vast out-of-school children. Huang Jingwan: Now, please feel free to express your opinions. Zheng Baotong: The most important thing for elementary school students is moral education. If there is no profound and correct moral concept on the innocent and pure heart, then the next generation of the country is very difficult to be optimistic about. Chen Hongbi: The problem is still the cultivation of elementary school teachers. Huang Jingwan: Therefore, we hope that elementary school teachers will organize study groups. Shen Xibao: There is a very serious problem. Please criticize fairly from the standpoint of the media. I always feel that education should be a matter for the country, but the authorities in our country, especially the education authorities in this city, have not made the greatest efforts in education. It is said that the education funds in Nanjing and Hangzhou account for more than 20% of the municipal funds, but this city is the economic center of the country with rich tax revenue, and what is actually allocated for education, I don't know how many thousandths of it accounts for? Even in terms of the subsidy for private schools, it has only been issued for March and April, but the teachers cannot only eat meals for March and April! From various aspects, I really doubt the authorities' concern for the education field. Ding Yixin: Therefore, our greatest hope is that politics can get on the right track. Huang Jingwan: I am very honored to have everyone express their opinions today.

### Mrs. Xu's Birthday Banquet Funds Maternity Assistance

Mr. Xu Yunnan wrote in a letter: [I would like to inform you that a few days ago, it was my wife Xu Shiyi's 50th birthday. My children originally planned to celebrate and express our family's joy. However, considering that the time of birth is originally a day to commemorate the difficulty of the mother, at this time of high prices and food shortages, the masses are waiting to be fed. How dare we disturb relatives and friends and do anything that would increase our guilt? However, if we fail to live up to the kindness of relatives and friends, we also feel uneasy. Therefore, we will donate 10,000 yuan from the funds for the banquet on this day to the poor women's maternity assistance fund hosted by your office as a blessing to relatives and friends. I know that it is only a drop in the bucket and cannot help the righteous cause, but in this chaotic and difficult world, frugality and abstinence from killing may also be allowed by the benevolent. I am enclosing a check for 10,000 yuan, and I hope that you will check and issue a receipt.]

### Request to Benevolent Gentlemen to Donate for Printing "The Law of Preserving Wealth"

"The Law of Preserving Wealth" written by Layman Nie Yuntai has been popular since its publication and remains so. Just yesterday, the Shanghai Raincoat Factory purchased one thousand copies, valued at ten thousand yuan. Both previous printings of this book were made possible by donations from Master Ku Qi. Now, there are fewer than a hundred copies remaining, and given the current high cost of paper and printing, a reprint is exceedingly difficult. How can we find a benevolent gentleman like Master Ku Ji, who is willing to spend money to donate for printing, so that this cautionary and virtuous book will not be discontinued? This would truly be a boundless merit.
