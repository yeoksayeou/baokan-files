### Internal Draft of a Tobacco Prohibition Proposal Passed by the Executive Yuan Yesterday: The National Government Decides to Eliminate Drugs Within Three Years

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Executive Yuan held its 196th regular meeting today. The following is an excerpt of the proposals discussed: The Minister of the Interior, Mei, presented a draft of the major outline for tobacco prohibition measures, which was passed by the council and submitted to the National Defense Council for approval before being promulgated and implemented.

The New National Movement Promotion Committee proposed a plan for both tobacco and drug prohibition training. The proposal was resolved to be referred to the Ministry of Interior for reference. The Director of the Department of Health, Lu, submitted a revised draft on the management of narcotics (narcotics for medical and scientific use), which was resolved to be amended and passed according to review opinions and submitted to the Central Political Committee. This proposal will be promoted in parallel with the tobacco prohibition plan and is also one of the drug eradication measures. The Agriculture Production Promotion Committee, also serving as Chairman, submitted draft general rules for the organization of agricultural production promotion committees in various provinces and cities, which was resolved and passed. The Jiangxi Provincial Government was reorganized, with the heads of the Finance, Politics, and Construction Departments remaining in their positions. The position of the head of government affairs was taken over by Liu Ling.

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - Opium has plagued China for over a century, its harm exceeding that of floods and ferocious beasts. China's weakness is largely due to the deep penetration of opium into the people, leading to national weakness and poverty. In the 24th year of the Republic of China, Chairman Wang, while serving as the head of the Executive Yuan, recognized that without eliminating opium, there was a real danger of national extinction and racial decline. He then, with the greatest determination and strict procedures, promulgated a five-year opium prohibition plan. Unfortunately, due to the outbreak of incidents, the opium prohibition work was stalled. Now, the government authorities, in order to continue and complete the opium prohibition plan, aim to restore national health, cultivate national vitality, and contribute to the great cause of co-prosperity in East Asia. The major outline for the opium prohibition measures has already been drafted by the Ministry of the Interior, submitted to the Executive Yuan, and passed at the 196th regular meeting of the Executive Yuan. It has also been submitted to the National Defense Council for approval before being promulgated and implemented. The plan is set for a three-year period to completely eliminate opium and all drugs. With a shortened timeframe and strict measures, domestic opium can be swept away and cleared within these three years. The Minister of the Interior, Mei, and the Director-General of the Youth Corps, Lin, both made earnest speeches on this matter, explaining the government's determination to prohibit drugs. At the same time, the authorities of the Japanese Embassy in China also made a statement, expressing their cooperation with the National Government's opium and drug prohibition policy and warning Japanese residents to deeply refrain from opium and strengthen their cooperation in promoting the opium policy.

Key Points of Tobacco Prohibition Measures

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Minister of the Interior, Mei, discussed the key points of the tobacco prohibition measures as follows: Complete elimination of opium within three years. In the 24th year of the Republic of China, Chairman Wang, while serving as the head of the Executive Yuan, vigorously implemented opium prohibition and enacted "Implementation Measures for Opium Prohibition," which were promulgated on April 18th of that year, stipulating a five-year deadline from the 25th year to the 29th year of the Republic of China to eliminate opium. Subsequently, due to the outbreak of incidents in the 26th year, the implementation was suspended. Now, continuing the aforementioned policy, it is stipulated that from March 30th of the 33rd year of the Republic of China to March 29th of the 36th year of the Republic of China, a three-year deadline is set to eliminate opium. Absolute prohibition of opium poppy cultivation. To rigorously implement opium prohibition, prohibiting cultivation is the prerequisite. Once the source of opium poppy cultivation is cut off, prohibiting transportation and smoking will be easier to achieve. Furthermore, cultivating opium poppies not only is the root of opium addiction but also hinders legitimate agricultural production. At this time of encouraging increased production, prohibition is especially necessary. Therefore, within the peaceful regions, strict prohibition of opium poppy cultivation is enforced. Implementation of opium addict registration. All opium addicts who have not yet quit their addiction will be subject to registration and strictly ordered to quit in stages according to the three-year deadline. Establishment of widespread opium cessation hospitals. Opium cessation hospitals will be widely established in the central government and major cities to actively equip and enforce registration. Opium addicts will be required to undergo cessation treatment on schedule to eliminate bad habits. Immediate eradication of drug atmosphere. Drugs such as heroin and red pills are even more harmful than opium and will be immediately and strictly prohibited. Regardless of manufacturing, selling, or using drugs, all are absolutely prohibited, and offenders will be severely punished.

### Minister Lin's Broadcast

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department, commemorating the second anniversary of the Japanese army's occupation of Singapore and the government's passage of opium prohibition measures, held a broadcast at the Central Radio Station last night, the 15th, entitled "Eradicating Drugs and Prohibiting Opium to Strike Down Britain and America." It elaborated that eradicating drugs and prohibiting opium and striking down Britain and America are one and the same. To thoroughly strike down Britain and America, one must eradicate drugs and prohibit opium. To thoroughly eradicate drugs and prohibit opium, one must also strike down Britain and America, and so on.

### Statement Released by the Japanese Embassy

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - The authorities of the Japanese Embassy in China stated that the National Government's Executive Yuan meeting on the 15th of this month passed the major outline of the opium and drug prohibition plan, aiming to resolutely prohibit opium and all drugs within a three-year period, mobilizing national manpower and resources to seek China's recovery and fulfill the great mission of defending East Asia. This is a manifestation of the National Government authorities' door-to-door spirit and is sincerely admirable.

Since the beginning of secret trade by the East India Company, the harm that opium has inflicted on China is truly astonishing. It has been one hundred and five years since Lin Zexu burned 20,000 chests of opium. On this day, which coincides with the second anniversary of the fall of Britain's base for aggression in East Asia, the National Government raises the banner of opium prohibition, recalling the past, which is truly deeply moving.

The Imperial Government has experience in implementing opium prohibition policies in Taiwan and has also provided various technical assistance to the opium cessation policy in Manchukuo. Regarding the National Government's future promotion of opium and drug prohibition policies, if there is anything that needs assistance, we will not hesitate to provide all cooperation.

Regarding opium and all drugs, the Imperial Government has always strictly ordered the crackdown on Japanese residents in China. In addition to handling cases according to criminal law, we have also specially formulated the "Regulations for the Crackdown on Narcotics in the Republic of China and Detailed Rules for Implementation," strictly controlling the manufacture, transportation, and storage of narcotics and raw opium. However, after years of war, despite the strict orders of the consular authorities, there are still those who evade the law and commit illegal acts, which is truly regrettable. Now that the National Government has decided to implement the opium cessation policy, we will naturally impose decisive punishments on such illegal acts according to the law. It is hoped that Japanese residents in China will deeply recognize the importance of the current situation and that China and Japan will cooperate in promoting the opium prohibition policy. Those who use the name of extraterritorial jurisdiction to engage in misconduct will leave the greatest stain on the history of the Japanese Empire's advancement in the Greater East Asia War, and they must deeply reflect on their behavior.

### The Greater East Asia Ethnic Conference Is of Great Significance

Beijing, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Greater East Asia Ethnic Conference is scheduled to be held in Tokyo around June. Peng, the Director-General of the North China New People's Society, recently made a statement on this matter, stating that the Greater East Asia Conference held last November and the subsequent meeting of heads of the Asian Revival Organizations thoroughly explained Japan's broad intentions to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to all ethnic groups. At the same time, the enthusiasm of the one billion people of Greater East Asia to cooperate in the war has become more inspired. The Greater East Asia Declaration is to clarify the lofty ideals common to the one billion people of Greater East Asia. In order to implement it, if each ethnic group and country does not launch a strong national movement or ethnic movement, then the declaration of Greater East Asia will also become a mere formality, and the holding of the Greater East Asia Ethnic Conference is timely and appropriate.

### The Japanese Army Launches an Annihilation War in Buthidaung; The Enemy's Retreat Route Is Cut Off, Leading to Great Chaos

Rangoon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army front-line base in Burma, the elite units of the Japanese army are currently narrowing the encirclement line in a certain area northwest of Buthidaung. The main force of the British 7th Division, numbering approximately tens of thousands, possessing a number of tanks and hundreds of motorized heavy vehicles, is making efforts to replenish food and ammunition by air drop, attempting to break through the Japanese army's encirclement line, but there is no hope and is only awaiting annihilation. The enemy army is unable to reverse its decline, has lost its retreat route, and has fallen into great chaos. It appears that the enemy division commander and his staff have abandoned their troops in a certain area and escaped by plane. Furthermore, when the Japanese army began its offensive, enemy units in the Mayu Mountains attempted to escape to a certain area of Naft Head via the Naf River. These troops were also subjected to fierce attacks by Japanese aircraft and annihilated at the bottom of the Naf River. The Japanese army, coordinating air and land forces, launched an annihilation war in Buthidaung, which is now at its final stage.

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Indian National Army is cooperating with the Japanese army in combat, activating the battlefield and greatly shocking the enemy's Indian army. Hundreds of Indian soldiers surrender to the Japanese army every day. Therefore, the morale of the British Indian army has been shaken, spreading throughout the army. Arakan can be said to be the ignition point for a general uprising of Indians.

### Japanese Aircraft Attack Pingnan

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from Chongqing, Japanese aircraft formations bombed Pingnan, located on the north bank of the Xun River in eastern Guangxi Province, on the 13th.

### Japanese Aircraft Attack Enemy Ships Near New Guinea

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain Japanese army front-line base in the South Pacific, the Japanese naval air squadrons attacked and achieved the following battle results in various locations in New Britain and New Guinea on the 14th: One enemy transport ship was hit at Cape Cretin in New Britain Island, and one enemy destroyer was destroyed near the Bena Bena wharf south of Ufimshi in New Guinea. One enemy large transport ship was heavily damaged in Volgan Bay, New Britain Island. In addition, the enemy's spirit positions on Aroe Island and Zierb were attacked. In all these battles, the Japanese air squadrons suffered no losses and all aircraft safely returned to their original defenses.

### Enemy Aircraft Attack Hong Kong, Four Shot Down

Hong Kong, 15th (Central News Agency) - U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, using twenty-seven North American (B25) and Curtiss (P40) aircraft, attacked Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 11th. Japanese naval air squadrons immediately intercepted them in the air, and after a fierce aerial battle, shot down one (B25) and three (P40) aircraft. The Japanese side lost one aircraft.

### German Army Announces Withdrawal from Luga

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - The German Supreme Headquarters announced yesterday afternoon that the northern German army completely destroyed strategically important facilities and withdrew from the city of Luga. The city is located 130 kilometers south of Leningrad, between Lakes Ilmen and Peipus, and is a key hub on the Leningrad-Pskov-Riga railway and the Leningrad-Novgorod railway.

### Western Front Defenses Consolidated, German Army Ready and Waiting, Adventurous Landings Will Be Severely Struck

Paris, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a report by the Havas News Agency, General Rundstedt, the commander of the German army on the Western Front, met with the head of the Havas News Agency's interview department, Xu Luote, and elaborated in detail on the defenses of the Western Front. It was stated that "I know that the enemy has completed preparations for an invasion of Europe, but we are also prepared. The Atlantic Defense Line is densely covered with steel and concrete fortifications, all built based on past experiences in the Maginot Line operations. The Maginot Line lacked sufficient depth and was not strictly defended. Therefore, the fortifications and weapons could not stop the German army's advance, and the line ended in central eastern France, leaving it vulnerable to encirclement. The Atlantic Defense Line, on the other hand, is built to be strong and solid, invulnerable to air raids, with sufficient depth, and has no threat of encirclement. Behind the main line, field fortifications and strongholds have also been built, along with swamps, mines, and tank walls, which the dreams of building the Maginot Line could not achieve. Water obstacles along the coast and minefields along the beaches make it difficult for the enemy army to land. As for large-scale airborne troops landing in the rear, effective measures have also been taken, but the details are kept secret. In this way, after the enemy army lands, they do not need to disperse to attack each fortress, and the German army's tank fleets and motorized units are all ready and waiting for battle, ready to launch a counterattack within a few hours. The German army's spirit of defense is also unmatched by the defending forces of the Maginot Line," he said.

### German Bomber Squadron Night-Attacks London

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - Last night, well-informed military sources here stated that German aircraft launched their fourth large-scale attack on London, with intensity equal to the previous few times. German aircraft losses were far less than those of the British aircraft. The walls and other obstacles are something that the construction of the Maginot Line could not have dreamed of. The water obstacles along the coast and the minefields along the beaches make it difficult for the enemy to land. As for the large-scale airborne troops landing in the rear, effective measures have also been taken, but the details are kept secret. In this way, after the enemy lands, they do not need to disperse their forces to attack each fortress, and the German army's tank fleets and motorized units are all ready and waiting, able to launch a counterattack within a few hours, and the German army's defense spirit is something that the defenders of the Maginot Line cannot compare with."

### Materials Control Committee Holds Meeting Yesterday

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Executive Yuan's Materials Control Review Committee held its eleventh committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 15th) in Nanjing. The meeting was personally chaired by the committee's chairman, Mr. Zhou Fohai. The following committee members were present: Yuan Cisuan (also Secretary-General), Gu Binheng, He Bingxian, Chen Zhishuo, Jiang Zuoyi, Xue Fengyuan, Zou Jingfang, Tang Shoumin (represented by Luo Nezhai and He Yuanji), Wen Lanting (represented by Tong Lüqing), Yuan Lüdeng (represented by Luo Nezhai), Shao Shijun (represented by Bu Tugui), Chen Guangzhong (represented by Pan Wenxian), and Japanese committee members 　Nouchi, Tajiri, Sakata, Ikenaga, and Okada. The secretaries present were Yin Yixuan and the committee's secretary, Zhou Huapeng, and Director Jin Zuhui. After the chairman's report at the beginning of the meeting, discussion of the cases began. The following are the four major cases that were passed: Regarding the case of how to stipulate the standards for the distribution prices of cotton yarn and cloth as instructed by the United Control Committee, the committee's ninth meeting previously resolved to "hand it over to the Shanghai office of the committee to liaise with all relevant parties for review." According to the office's reply, "In addition to those distributed to various factories for processing, which should be studied by the Business Control Committee, those distributed for general consumption will be increased by one time the purchase price according to the Business Control Committee's proposed price for 20-count yarn, with each piece set at 20,000 yuan. Dragon head fine cloth will be increased by one time the purchase price, with each bolt set at 750 yuan. The distribution prices of other types of products will be deduced by analogy. This price standard can be revised once every three months. After discussion and resolution by the staff meeting, it has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation. The case is submitted for retroactive approval." Resolved to approve retroactively. Regarding the case of the Oil and Grain Professional Committee's proposed oil and grain prices, the committee's tenth meeting previously resolved to retain it, pending further study, and the chairman will approve it and submit it to the Executive Yuan for implementation. It will be submitted to the next meeting for retroactive approval. According to a report from the Shanghai office, it has been in contact with all parties concerned, and all believe that it is still feasible. In addition to submitting it to the Executive Yuan, the case is submitted for retroactive approval. Resolved to approve retroactively. The Rice and Grain Control Committee, based on the "Outline for the Implementation of Material Purchase and Distribution in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui," formulated a table of distribution groups for material distribution vouchers based on the quantity and amount of rice and grain purchased in various places. The process of contacting and coordinating was resolved and approved retroactively. Since the purchase of yarn and cloth, the business of members of the Shanghai Cloth Dealers Association (retailers) has been suspended, and their livelihoods are difficult. The association submitted a request to pay cash once according to the distribution price for the scattered cloth to be sold in order to provide relief. The motion was submitted for a decision and passed.

### German Army in Nettuno Area Completes Encirclement; Reinforcements for Cassino

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to front-line sources, the U.S. Fifth Army launched a large-scale offensive in the Cassino area since the 13th in order to contain the German army's heavy pressure on the Nettuno bridgehead. According to the United Press, the U.S. military has entered the city by about 200 yards since the general counteroffensive began on the 13th, while German reports state that although the U.S. military temporarily entered the central part of the city, it was later driven out by the German army's brave counteroffensive. German Army Commander Field Marshal Kesselring has completed the preparation of the encirclement of the Nettuno bridgehead and has been able to reinforce the fighting in the Cassino area. At the same time, a parachute unit was dropped on the Adriatic coast to strengthen the Cassino front.

### Assassin of Hangzhou Mayor Arrested

Hangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency) - Tan Shusheng, the mayor of Hangzhou, was assassinated by two bandits on Hubin Road at 1:25 PM on the 7th of this month and died. The military and police departments, upon receiving the news, immediately coordinated with the Japanese military police, ordered the interruption of traffic, and engaged in capture operations. After three days and nights of investigation, all the assassins were arrested on the 10th. The perpetrator, XX, was under a secret order from the Chongqing "Military Affairs Commission" and entered the urban area in the lower sentences of January, plotting to assassinate the mayor, which led to this incident.

### Telling the Truth

The Rice and Grain Control Committee held an expanded joint conference yesterday, with attendees including all senior cadres of the committee and responsible personnel from various regional offices. According to the report of Director Yuan, the purpose of the meeting was to "listen to reports and suggestions on business matters in order to determine the future direction of business facilities." Yesterday's newspaper reported that there were more than 70 proposals, more than 30 reports, and 10 points in the discussion outline.

Looking at the attendees of the meeting and the content of the discussion outline, it is indeed an important meeting. However, we believe that if everyone is present, the official proposals are numerous, and the reports are detailed, it is not enough to express the important significance of the meeting. The important thing is the "people's food," discussing the people's food problems related to people's lives, so as to achieve the goal of practical improvement. If there is still no achievement after the meeting, then it is not only superfluous, but simply makes the Rice and Grain Control Committee spend a huge amount of money and increases the burden on the people.

On October 19th of last year, the Rice and Grain Control Committee held a preparatory committee meeting of rice and grain procurement trade associations in various regions in Shanghai. Then, a symposium was held to exchange procurement opinions. On the 21st, a joint meeting of deputy directors in various regions was also held. It was also "everyone was present" and the work outline was discussed "thoroughly." However, now, four months later, what has the Rice and Grain Control Committee solved for the people's food problem? What has it improved? To what extent has the proposal been implemented? Perhaps many of the members attending this time are the members who attended last time. We sincerely ask all the gentlemen attending to first deeply reflect on whether they have fulfilled their responsibilities for their respective work. Especially the main responsible authorities of the Rice and Grain Control Committee, from the perspective of our people, the work of the Rice and Grain Control Committee in the past four months has absolutely not met the expectations of the people, that is, the last meeting did not achieve any results. If we measure this meeting with this standard, we especially feel that the gentlemen attending have a great responsibility and should be cautious and fearful.

We will contribute our views separately on the content of this meeting's discussion based on what we have seen. Just from Director Yuan's opening remarks yesterday, we already have a feeling of "not being rendered without exaggeration." For example, "Fortunately, the internal and external staff have worked together to avoid failure, gradually entered the right track, and moved towards the completion of the mission and goals, which is gratifying." Perhaps this is Director Yuan's intention to encourage and exhort his subordinates. If we strictly evaluate the work results of the Rice and Grain Control Committee in the past four months, although we cannot say that it is absolutely "failure," it is also not "gratifying." For example, compare the amount of rice distributed before and after the establishment of the Rice and Grain Control Committee, as well as the comparison of the high and low black market rice prices. A gentleman's words are yes if they are yes, and no if they are no. It is most sympathetic and understanding for those in power to tell the truth to the people. We hope that the reports of the participants will try not to be false, not to hide, and to tell the truth to win the trust of the people.

### Germany Is Fully Prepared for Inviting and Attacking the Second Front

The Retreat on the West Coast

The candidate areas for the second front that Germany is most concerned about are still Norway, northern France, and the Balkans. Norway is relatively easy to land on due to its coastal terrain and dense labor force, and it can advance to the Baltic Sea countries from that direction. The northern part of France is heavily defended, and it is impossible to invade the Balkans before spring. But in short, according to common sense, the enemy's main offensive will unfold on the Atlantic coast, so the residents of the west coast have been retreating to the interior in recent months, and the west European coast has become a no-man's land. It is blocked by densely laid barbed wire, and no one is allowed to enter except for military personnel.

The defense of this area has the solidity of a golden city with a moat. But under the conditions of modern warfare, even Germany itself does not double that this is absolutely impossible to break through, so several layers of defensive positions have been built behind it. In southern France, General Thunnert, commander of the troops in Avignon, built a defense base, and a trapezoidal defense network was set up behind this front to prepare for an offensive from the Mediterranean coast or the southeastern Atlantic.

But more important is the defense of the English Channel coast in northern France. If the British and American forces are able to secure a bridgehead, then the German army will hold on to Calais, Dunkirk, and Normandy in northern France. The defense line in this area is connected to the Maginot Line near Sedan to the east. Part of the Maginot Line has been modified, and its artillery positions have turned their muzzles to the northwest and west. In addition, fortresses have been built along the Scarpe River, the Saint-Pol River, the Dyle River, the Albert Canal, and the entire Dutch coast. The cities of Schelderecht, The Hague, Rotterdam, and Amsterdam are dotted with fortresses.

German Defense Lines are Solid

The trapezoidal defense phase vertical line with the Siegfried Line as the bottom has also been rebuilt by Soviet prisoners of war. Between the Atlantic defense and the Siegfried Line, there are twenty mobile divisions deployed from Dunkirk to Baan Noutz, ready to immediately rush to the aid of the enemy's attack location or the danger zone of friendly forces. The land battle in the middle is prepared on the premise of mobile warfare, and the center of its mobile warfare will probably use Poppau, Poassy, Angoulême, La Rochelle, Rennes, Tours, Amiens, and other French cities to invite and attack Eisenhower's main force. Marshal Rommel's reserve army forms a part of this defense organization, and the defense is quite strong.

Germany overcame many difficulties and organized this intermediate zone for mobile warfare. But the problem for Germany is the lack of manpower and equipment. The preparation for striking the second front, in addition to the above-mentioned defense facilities, the preparation of secret weapons that are currently being rumored cannot be ignored. It is not clear what kind of secret weapons have been prepared, but mortars with a length of more than 14 meters and a weight of more than 12 tons, and seaplanes with catapulte-style launchers are being imagined. Moreover, those are not defensive, but offensive weapons.

But the goal of German operations is to concentrate superior forces at a certain location and at a certain time to break through the enemy's forces one by one. The reason why Germany places special emphasis on discriminatory warfare is mostly due to this point. On the other hand, the anti-Axis side is eagerly awaiting the disturbances of the guerrilla forces; on the other hand, the German side believes that the guerrilla forces are not dangerous.

Meeting Proceedings

The meeting began with an opening address by Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Committee, followed by speeches from Vice Chairmen Hiroya Junichi and Chen Guoquan.  Commander Takagi Kenji of Unit 1629, Counselor Okazaki of the Embassy, Committee Members Lin Kanghou, Ueda Kenjiro, and Jiang Weisheng also delivered encouraging speeches.

After the conclusion of the general meeting at 6 PM, proposals from committee members and regional directors, as well as ad hoc motions, were immediately divided into eight small groups for specific discussions and solutions, with the intention to continue the meeting today to make decisions.

Chairman's Address

Chairman Yuan Ludeng's address stated: "It has been nearly four months since the establishment of this Committee. During these four months, we have been faced with numerous internal and external affairs. In the initial stages, everything was in need of attention. Fortunately, with the joint efforts of all staff members internally and colleagues in regional offices externally, we have largely avoided setbacks and are gradually getting on the right track... heading towards the fulfillment of our original mission. This is something I find gratifying and for which I am grateful to all my colleagues. However, the Committee's responsibilities are significant, and the path ahead is still fraught with challenges, requiring even greater efforts from us. Therefore, taking advantage of this post-Spring Festival break, I have convened this expanded joint meeting of senior officials and responsible personnel from regional offices to hear everyone's reports and suggestions on their work, in order to determine the Committee's future policies regarding operational facilities. Furthermore, there have been some factual changes in the Committee's affairs during these four months. Although the first phase of rice procurement has reached the planned quantity, the second phase is just beginning. Given the different situations in various regions, how should we proceed to fulfill our mission? And based on the past four months, what major aspects of rice affairs and operations should be established or reformed? These are naturally questions that I and all of you colleagues are eager to understand. I hope everyone will express their broad views and engage in open-minded discussions, so that we can gather wisdom and benefit from diverse perspectives, reach conclusions, and contribute them to the Committee as a reference for policy implementation. In short, the purpose of this expanded joint meeting is to review the past, examine the present, and contemplate the future. It is the first sincere and open gathering of the Committee's cadres and responsible personnel from regional offices. I respectfully offer my sincere appreciation and welcome the opinions of all colleagues."

### Matsudaira Information Director Discusses British Policy Towards Chongqing - Attempts to Alleviate Anti-British Sentiment

A Central News Agency dispatch states that Matsudaira, Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, made the following remarks on the 15th at a reception for foreign journalists, regarding Britain's policy toward Chongqing:

Growing Anti-British Sentiment

Recently, Britain has been employing deceptive policies towards Chongqing in an attempt to alleviate the anti-British sentiment among the military and civilians there. The Chinese people's anti-British sentiment has been growing ever since the Opium War due to Britain's increasing aggression towards China. Consequently, the anti-British tide has been rising, and there have been several anti-British movements. However, the cunning and treacherous British have repeatedly used force or honeyed words to appease China. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Britain's attitude towards overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Syonan was extremely cold, and in Burma, they stood by and watched the Chongqing army suffer losses, refusing to offer assistance. Furthermore, they imprisoned and mistreated Gandhi, Nehru, and other leaders of the Indian independence movement, and placed a portion of the Chongqing army under the command of Mountbatten. All of these actions have caused pain and indignation among concerned military and civilians in Chongqing, leading to a growing anti-British sentiment.

So-Called Loans Have Not Yet Materialized

Recently, in order to alleviate anti-British sentiment, Britain dispatched an official who had promised to provide Chongqing with a loan of 50 million pounds two years ago to China for inspection. At the same time, they verbally declared the abolition of concessions and extraterritorial rights and warmly welcomed a Chongqing delegation led by Wang Shijie, making every effort to please Chongqing. However, Britain's actions, as always, are merely empty promises with no substance. Therefore, not only Chongqing but even the United States government is extremely dissatisfied with Britain's actions. According to a recent Reuters dispatch from London, the 50 million-pound loan promised by the British government the year before last actually came with various conditions and has not yet materialized. The details are expected to be released soon. From this, it is not difficult to imagine that it is attached with various secret conditions. According to recent reports from those returning from Chongqing, numerous British and American firms have been established recently, totaling over 500, engaging in reckless exploitation for profit. This is also a cunning manifestation of the British-style exploitation of other nations.

### New Association to Host Banquet for Matsudaira Tonight

The Shanghai Press Association will host a banquet this evening (the 16th) at 6 PM at the Industrial and Commercial Association on the fourth floor of the Xingya Building to welcome the new Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, Matsudaira. The atmosphere is expected to be enthusiastic.

### Entertainment Consumption Tax to Be Implemented from April 1st, Divided into Three Categories with a Maximum Rate of 40%

The Special Consumption Tax on the Donation and Sale of Goods and the Consumption Tax on Banquets and Hotels have been implemented since February 1st. According to Japanese newspapers, the Entertainment Consumption Tax will also be implemented starting April 1st. This Entertainment Consumption Tax is divided into three categories. Category A includes movies, horse racing, ice skating, swimming, etc., with a tax rate of 10% of operating income. However, for horse racing, in addition to 10% of the total operating revenue, a 10% tax will also be levied on prize money. Category B includes singing and dancing, acting, etc., with a tax rate of 30% of the entrance price. Category C includes other luxury entertainment items, with a tax rate of 40% of the ticket price or the total daily operating income. The methods for tax collection, as well as regulations regarding business registration, accounting books, and penalties, will be handled in accordance with the thirteen articles of the promulgated Provisional Regulations on Entertainment Consumption Tax.

### Rural Pacification and Blockade Administration Hosts Press Corps

A Central News Agency dispatch states that the Shanghai Special Municipality's Rural Pacification and Blockade Administration hosted a grand banquet at the Hua Yan Apartment on the 10th floor yesterday (the 15th) at 5:30 PM to foster relationships with the city's press corps and report on the blockade efforts.

A Central News Agency dispatch states that the Municipal Baojia Committee, in order to curb the black market for coal briquettes in the Zhabei district, has decided to implement a rationing system based on household registration, following the example of the Nanshi district.

The official distribution will begin on the 21st.

Retail taxes will be waived.

### Daily Necessities Black Market Rampant - Municipal Government Orders Investigation and Suppression - Aiming to Make the Rationing System Comprehensive

(Central News Agency dispatch) The scarcity of resources during wartime is an inevitable trend. Furthermore, the hoarding and speculation by unscrupulous merchants have caused prices to rise continuously, directly and indirectly affecting society and threatening people's livelihoods. Therefore, the authorities are actively promoting frugality on the one hand and implementing a rationing system based on household registration on the other, with the aim of stabilizing people's livelihoods. Now that rationing has been implemented for (cotton yarn, cotton cloth, coal briquettes, candles, soap, and matches), the prices of these items should have stabilized. However, as soon as rationing is implemented, a black market arises, undermining wartime economic policies, which is truly hateful. A reporter has learned that the Shanghai Special Municipality has issued separate orders to its subordinate police stations to investigate and suppress any black market activities involving (cotton yarn, cotton cloth, coal briquettes, soap, candles, and matches) within their respective jurisdictions. They must not show favoritism and must strive to make the rationing system more comprehensive.
