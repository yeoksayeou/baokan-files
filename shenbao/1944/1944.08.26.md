### Editorial: Further Discussion on Municipal Administration and Personnel

Yesterday's discussion on municipal administration and personnel was merely a general overview, and much remains to be said. Now, based on my observations, I will further elaborate.

Let's analyze the current unsound state of municipal administration and personnel: Firstly, the inappropriate employment of some personnel; secondly, inadequate compensation; and thirdly, unfair rewards and punishments. I will elaborate on each:

Inappropriate employment of some personnel includes mismatches between talent and position, and the filling of positions with unqualified individuals. In some departments, there is a preference for hiring relatives and fellow townsmen, regardless of their skills or abilities. People are assigned to positions simply because they are available, leading to a situation where "everyone is idle, and nothing gets done." This results in low administrative efficiency and hinders the realization of political construction.

Inadequate compensation means that the provided salary cannot sustain the basic living needs of an individual and their family. Yet, life must go on, so they are forced to seek other means to make ends meet. These activities are often illegal, leading to a situation of "corruption breeding corruption." Administrative efficiency is out of the question, and the damage to the credibility of the government is enormous. Take the police as an example. Currently, a police officer's monthly salary is only two thousand and several hundred yuan. Given the current high cost of living, it is difficult for them to sustain the basic living needs of an individual and their family. However, they must live, so they strive to find "extra income," turning it into an open secret. If we do not start by adjusting their compensation to enable them to sustain the basic living needs of an individual and their family, and instead only talk about rectification and suppression, we will be going in the wrong direction and achieve nothing. Secondly, the same applies to civil servants. It is particularly evident in the case of the police because their duties bring them closest to the common people.

Unfair rewards and punishments refer to the past. Frankly speaking, in the past, there was no reward or punishment, or the rewards and punishments were unclear. In the recent special tax fraud case, the municipal authorities have resolved to investigate thoroughly and impartially, and the guilty will surely be punished accordingly in the future. We advocate that the ringleaders should also have their illicit gains confiscated to deter others from similar crimes.

We believe that the unhealthy state of personnel in municipal organizations is like the symptoms of a disease in the human body. If the symptoms are ignored and left untreated, health will not naturally return. The first two points mentioned above are like discovering symptoms in the human body. The third point is like a localized ulceration. The former requires immediate symptomatic treatment to prevent ulceration, while the latter requires debridement and regeneration to prevent it from spreading.

How do we treat the symptoms and promote regeneration? Regarding the first point, the inappropriate employment of some personnel, we proposed yesterday that the municipal government establish a personnel committee to manage personnel according to the mayor's personnel policy, correcting the "everyone is idle, and nothing gets done" situation. We hear that the municipal government established a personnel committee yesterday. We hope that in the future, personnel issues can be gradually rationalized. Regarding the second point, the inadequate compensation, we should promptly adjust the compensation of the police, security forces, and public school teachers. For example, regarding police compensation, the police authorities should quickly prepare the most ideal budget and submit it to the municipal authorities. The authorities should then convene community leaders to discuss ways to raise sufficient budgetary funds and implement the plan immediately. It is the responsibility of the police authorities if they know that the police compensation is insufficient to meet their living needs but fail to propose an adjustment plan. It is the responsibility of the municipal authorities and community leaders if they know that the police compensation is insufficient to meet their living needs but fail to consider an adjustment plan. It is difficult to expect the police to refrain from wrongdoing when their salary is insufficient to meet their living needs, and we only talk about moral training. Only by first adjusting their compensation, then providing moral training, and strictly enforcing penalties, can we address the root cause of the problem. Regarding the third point, unfair rewards and punishments, it will be easiest to correct in the future if we can avoid favoritism and act according to principles. This is because punishing according to the law does not require funding, and it will greatly refresh public perception and political atmosphere.

In short, the two phenomena of inappropriate employment and unfair rewards and punishments depend entirely on whether municipal authorities at all levels are willing to act; it is not a difficult task. However, adjusting compensation cannot be achieved through empty words, nor is it the sole responsibility of the government; the private sector should also fulfill its duty to cooperate. Adjusting compensation requires funding, and raising taxes is one way to obtain funding. If taxes are increased somewhat to maintain public security and build the municipality, and some of the funds are specifically designated for improving the compensation of the police and security forces, we believe that as long as we are earnest and conscientious in our efforts, citizens, despite the increased burden, will be willing to accept it. Community leaders, for the sake of the bright future of the municipality and the safety and well-being of its citizens, will also be happy to contribute to facilitating this matter.

### The Central Reserve Bank and the Bank of Japan Establish Another Credit Loan of 400 Million Yen, to be Repaid Within Five Years

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 4 PM on the 25th: "The Japanese government, in order to assist the sound development of the banknotes of the Central Reserve Bank of China, previously provided a loan of 100 million yuan from the Bank of Japan to the Central Reserve Bank on July 28th of Showa 17 (1942). Now, a large amount of 400 million yuan is being loaned."

### Remarks by Finance Minister Zhou

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency telegram) - Zhou Fohai, Minister of Finance of the National Government, recently made the following remarks regarding the loan agreement concluded between the Bank of Japan and the Central Reserve Bank: "Based on the mediation of the Japanese government, the Central Reserve Bank has decided to conclude a loan agreement with the Bank of Japan for 400 million yuan, which has been signed in Japan. With the establishment of this loan, the Central Reserve Bank's loan from Japan, together with the contractual loan of 100 million yuan established the previous year, will amount to 500 million yuan, which will greatly benefit the sound development of China's currency system and the credit of the Central Reserve Bank. I would like to express my deep gratitude to our allied country, Japan, for its assistance. Since its establishment, the Central Reserve Bank has made considerable progress. In this critical situation, the central bank of China, which is participating in the war, should, in cooperation with its ally Japan, first seek financial stability and maintain the value of its banknotes. The allied country's renewed loan of 400 million yuan will truly enable the central banks of the two countries to combine more closely. At the same time, it will further increase the credit of the central bank, which will greatly help in the completion of its mission. In the future, we will make even greater efforts to stabilize finance and maintain the value of the currency."

### Remarks by Mr. Shibusawa

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency telegram) - Zhou Fohai, Governor of the Central Reserve Bank, and Keizo Shibusawa, Governor of the Bank of Japan, formally signed the credit loan agreement at the Bank of Japan at 4 PM on the 25th. According to President Shibusawa, this measure is the same as the previous loan in that it is intended to assist the sound development of the Chinese National Government's currency system. In recent years, the business of the Central Reserve Bank of China has flourished, and the circulation of its banknotes has become increasingly widespread, with very significant development. Sino-Japanese relations have entered a new stage due to China's participation in the war, and the demand for financial cooperation has also intensified. Therefore, the Japanese side, in response to the current situation, decided to extend a credit loan to China. The Bank of Japan will follow the government's policy and do its best to support China's currency policy.

### Remarks by Mr. Shigemitsu

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency telegram) - Mr. Shigemitsu, the Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia, made the following remarks regarding the large loan extended by the Bank of Japan to the Central Reserve Bank: "Assisting the development of Chinese currency and establishing the foundation of the Central Reserve Bank is a consistent policy of the Japanese government. This loan of 400 million yuan from the Bank of Japan to the Central Reserve Bank is a concrete manifestation of this policy. Japan believes that the sound development of the Chinese economy and the stability of the currency's value are matters of urgent importance. Therefore, the Japanese government is strengthening its consistent policy and making every effort to assist the smooth progress of its currency policy, which is a fixed policy."

### Roosevelt's Envoy Visits Chongqing, the Enemy's American Plot is Unique, Remarks by Director Matsushima

Director Matsushima of the Japanese Naval Fleet Press Department met with the Shanghai Chinese News Reporters Corps yesterday (the 25th) as usual, and made remarks on the Eastern Front war situation and Chinese issues, among others. The main points are recorded below:

### Eastern Front War Situation

The German forces in Warsaw on the Eastern Front are now launching a very fierce counterattack, and the V-2 new weapon has also appeared on the Eastern Front battlefield. A decisive battle will soon unfold. Therefore, before seeing this decisive battle, we cannot recklessly criticize the fate of the belligerent countries.

### American Envoy Visits Chongqing

According to a Washington dispatch on the 21st, the Christian Science Monitor reported that Nelson, Director of the US War Production Board, and Major General Hurley will visit Chongqing as special envoys of President Roosevelt. The purpose of their visit is said to be to prepare to build a large arsenal in China, that is, the "freedom-loving" America intends to turn China into a large arsenal. Nimitz once said: "The Allied forces are landing in China..." This fact further illustrates Nimitz's policy. According to Roosevelt's announcement: "Hurley will negotiate with Chiang Kai-shek on military and supply issues, and Nelson on economic issues." Of course, in the process of modern heavy industry, it is not easy to build a large arsenal without considerable capital, machinery, and time. Therefore, it is impossible for the United States to send two people to China to make China a large arsenal. This is something we can imagine. If the enemy's American plan is implemented, will China's fate be remedied as a result? A few days ago, I made a statement on the fact that the "freedom-loving" country - the United States - is trying to turn China into a battlefield, prompting the Chinese people to wake up. Today, the United States wants to turn China into a large arsenal, a poisonous conspiracy to turn the heaven of China into the hell of . To use Chinese territory as a battlefield for Britain and the United States, we will not any sacrifice to prevent it.

### Worried for China

However, the situation is now going against this, and we are deeply concerned for China. Also, Zhang Pingqun, a member of the Chongqing Executive Yuan, told reporters: "After the war, British aircraft manufacturers are planning to provide China with £10 million worth of goods to develop China's aviation industry." At the same time, Zhang Pingqun added: "Regarding the development of post-war industry, China has extremely abundant natural resources, and human resources are also extremely abundant. However, the lack of capital and technology is recognized by everyone. Therefore, we warmly welcome foreign investment and technical assistance." Just imagine, will China really obtain happiness if the United States, which calls itself a freedom-loving country, wants to turn the happy China into an arsenal? It is worth pondering.

### Chongqing Newspaper Rumors

According to a dispatch from the Chongqing Central Daily News Anhui Special Correspondent on the 21st, due to the recent air raids and bombings in Shanghai, residents are fleeing in droves. Therefore, strict restrictions have been imposed on trains and vehicles. In fact, the main purpose of the current traffic restrictions in Shanghai is to transport rice and important materials, not to prevent ordinary residents from fleeing.

### Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry Strengthens Advisory System

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency telegram) - Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Shigemitsu, in order to strengthen the Greater East Asia policy, has decided to enrich the advisory system of the Greater East Asia Ministry. He has decided to hire former Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki Kazuo, former Bank of Japan President Yuki Toyotaro, and Masaatsu Yasuoka as advisors. The announcement was made by the Greater East Asia Ministry on the 25th. Therefore, the current Greater East Asia Ministry advisors, together with the current Supreme Advisor of the National Government Ogura Masatsune, number four in total.

### National Government's Economic Construction Work will See More Rapid Progress, Allied Nation's Huge Loan has Great Significance

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency telegram) - Allied governments, in order to help the National Government Central Reserve Bank's issuance system become sound, loaned 100 million Japanese yen from the Bank of Japan to our Central Reserve Bank in July 1942 to increase the Central Reserve Bank's issuance reserves. As a result, the Central Reserve Bank's reserves have been greatly increased, its credit has been increasing daily, and its circulation has been expanding daily. To date, the Central Reserve Bank notes are the only legal tender in Central China, South China, Huaihai and other places. It has achieved great results in the National Government's financial adjustment and economic construction. Not only that, but also this year, an exchange method for Central Reserve Bank notes with the Joint Reserve Bank has been confirmed, and a centralized remittance system for southern regions has been established with the Yokohama Specie Bank. Therefore, Central Reserve Bank notes have not only become the only credit currency in the country, but have also established its character as a trade currency. This time, the Central Reserve Bank obtained a huge loan of 400 million yuan from the Bank of Japan through the mediation of the Japanese government. This move has great significance for the National Government's decisive battle financial system and the future of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, the economic construction work in our country is deeply awaited. Therefore, when the news came out, the whole country was extremely excited, and we cannot help but express our gratitude and excitement for the re-establishment of this huge loan. At a time when the Great East Asia War is entering a decisive stage, the Allied government is still able to provide great assistance to our National Government's wartime financial resources in order to thoroughly implement the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, which we cannot forget and deeply appreciate. Due to the establishment of this huge loan, the future of economic construction in our country will have leaps and bounds of progress, which is predictable. Especially when the price problem has not yet been resolved reasonably, we now have this huge loan, and we feel infinite hope for the future of stabilizing people's livelihoods. At a time when the Great East Asia War is approaching a decisive moment, our country, which bears the important task of defending the rear, will also be more conducive to achieving winning conditions due to the increasing progress of domestic economic construction and the completion of the entire decisive battle economy.

### Financial Authorities Express Deep Gratitude

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency telegram) - Regarding the Bank of Japan's loan to the Central Reserve Bank, the financial authorities issued the following statement: "With the mediation of the Japanese government, the Central Reserve Bank concluded a loan agreement with the Bank of Japan for 400 million Japanese yen, which was completed in Tokyo today. With the establishment of this loan, together with the 100 million Japanese yen signed in the previous year, the total loan to the Central Reserve Bank is 500 million Japanese yen, which will greatly assist the sound development of our country's currency system and the infinite enhancement of the Central Reserve Bank's general credit. We express our deep gratitude to our ally, Japan, for its great support. Since its establishment, the Central Reserve Bank has been developing smoothly. However, in this critical situation, in our country participating in the war, the most urgent task for the central bank is to cooperate with its ally to stabilize finance and maintain currency. Now that we have a loan of 400 million Japanese yen, it is clear that the central banks of China and Japan are closely linked, and the credit of the Central Reserve Bank is enhanced, and the mission it bears will also be achieved. Therefore, the relationship is extremely important. In the future, we must work even harder to ensure that there are no regrets in stabilizing finance and maintaining currency."

### Great Contribution to Stabilizing People's Livelihoods

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency telegram) - After the establishment of a 400 million yuan credit loan between the Central Reserve Bank and the Bank of Japan, people from all walks of life here unanimously expressed their welcome. Especially in the financial sector, it is believed that the value of our country's currency can be further consolidated, thereby making a great contribution to suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. On a larger scale, when our country's entire economic system is gradually shifting to a decisive battle system, this assistance can be further promoted. Therefore, the establishment of this new loan of 400 million Japanese yen between the Central Reserve Bank and the Bank of Japan will definitely make a great contribution to the construction of our country's decisive battle economic system. All parties especially firmly believe that after the establishment of this loan, the production increase work and other construction projects that our country is actively working on will have even more rapid development. In this way, it will not only be of great benefit to the national life, but also further exert a strong force in the cooperative completion of the Great East Asia War.

Remarks by the Japanese Embassy Authorities: Regarding the establishment of a 400 million yuan credit loan between the Central Reserve Bank and the Bank of Japan, the authorities of the Japanese Embassy stated on the 25th: The Bank of Japan and the Central Reserve Bank concluded a 400 million Japanese yen credit loan agreement, which has been formally signed by the presidents of the two banks. In the past, the Imperial Government spared no effort to provide all support and cooperation to the Central Reserve Bank, the Central Bank of China, in order to maintain the value of its issued currency and seek its stability. This new credit loan agreement between the two central banks is a concrete manifestation of Japan's consistent policy. It is deeply believed that this will greatly benefit the sound development of the National Government's currency system and the sound progress of the Chinese economy. Therefore, it is also deeply gratifying.

### Thailand Announces Reorganization of National Army, Establishes Commander-in-Chief of Land, Sea, and Air Forces, Abolishes Title of Supreme Commander of National Defense Forces

Bangkok, 25th (Central News Agency telegram) - Thai Prime Minister Apaiwong announced the following statement: The recent changes in the military leadership, with General Baporn as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, are entirely for the benefit of the nation and its people. The people should not be unduly worried about this. Regarding the movements of former Supreme Commander Pibul, there are inevitably various rumors, but Marshal Pibul himself has denied these rumors and expressed goodwill towards the current government, so these rumors are completely unfounded.

Bangkok, 24th (Central News Agency telegram) - Since resigning as Prime Minister, former Thai Prime Minister Marshal Pibul has continued to hold all military power under the title of Supreme Commander of the National Defense Forces. In view of this, the new Apaiwong cabinet, in order to unify the military, issued an order on the 24th to reorganize the existing national army and abolish the title of former Supreme Commander of the National Defense Forces. It also appointed General Baporn as Commander-in-Chief of the Land, Sea, and Air Forces, and appointed former Prime Minister Pibul as a national policy advisor.

Japanese Army Decides to Support

Great Burma Alliance

Rangoon, 25th (Central News Agency telegram) - 1.6 million Burmese people, under the leadership of Bamo National Representative, formed the Great Burma Alliance. On the 24th, Commander Kawabe issued a statement stating that the entire Japanese dispatched army in Burma will devote all its efforts to support the alliance and jointly complete the war. Zhang Fakui, Commander of the West War Zone, in mid-July, in order to defend Guilin, specially established the Guilin City Defense Headquarters within the Guangxi Pacification Commissioner's Office, and appointed Group Army Deputy Commander Yi Yunqing as Commander. He has now obtained the assistance of the Guilin Air Defense Evacuation Committee to forcibly evacuate citizens, with the assistance of members of the Youth League Wartime Service General Affairs Team. The Chongqing Military Affairs Committee Guangxi Shipping Corps has established offices in Guilin, Wuzhou, Pingle, and other places. The Southwest Import and Export Promotion Committee is also actively evacuating and concentrating materials in Guilin and its vicinity. Many cultural figures have moved to Guilin, and they have repeatedly criticized the political policies of Chongqing, and most citizens resonate with them. The Chongqing inspection authorities, at this time of the Japanese military's sudden advance, are deeply afraid of the people's morale shaking, and are checking citizens' certificates and monitoring the actions of various groups every day. In addition, citizens are strictly prohibited from gathering. Before the Japanese military's attack, the Chongqing military authorities exposed a state of embarrassment, only inviting the ridicule and opposition of the citizens.

### Chongqing Defenses Strengthen Guilin and Forcibly Evacuate Citizens, Deeply Fearing the Southern Advance of Japanese Troops from Hunan

Guangzhou, 25th – The Central Government is extremely concerned about the movements of the Japanese army, believing that the Yuehan Railway will inevitably be opened by the Japanese. Furthermore, they anticipate that the Japanese forces in Hunan will advance southward, and are actively defending Shaoguan, Guilin, and Wuzhou, among other forward outposts. According to recent news from the area, the Japanese military is actively repairing the

Yuehan Railway.

China Frontline Base, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Chongqing army in South China is extremely alarmed by the gradual northward advance of the Japanese army along the Yuehan Railway. They have now evacuated residents along the railway line and are undertaking thorough demolition work. According to Japanese war correspondents, the devastation is indescribable. The railway has no rails, and weeds grow among the sleepers. Approximately 300 to 500 meters of railway line are intermittently destroyed. All bridges have been completely demolished, and there are many places where the embankments have collapsed for ten meters. They are also using natural water flow and rivers to cause further collapse. The Japanese army, however, is overcoming all difficulties, working day and night to repair the damaged locations and actively developing emergency highways. On the other hand, the Guangdong Provincial Government has established work teams to cooperate with the Japanese army. Along the railway line, each village is selecting fifty to one hundred people to engage in this restoration work. The highway south of Yuantan has already been completed for many years. Local residents, who have never seen cars before, are now joyfully helping the Japanese army build the railway.

### Chongqing and Communist Opinions Diverge, Cooperation Unlikely, America Aims to Use China as the Decisive Battleground

A Certain Base on the Central China Frontline, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The struggle between Chongqing and Yan'an, which has been undergoing adjustment, has progressed from preliminary negotiations in Xi'an to formal meetings in Chongqing. During these meetings, despite fervent support from anti-Axis powers and the encouragement of U.S. Vice President Wallace, the opposition between the two sides' demands has not been resolved. This meeting aimed to resolve the various incidents that have occurred between Chongqing and Yan'an since the Anhui Incident last summer, in order to restore the cooperation between the two sides at the beginning of the war of resistance. However, due to the vast differences in their political demands, and because the proposals made during the talks were all

fundamental issues

from the past, no matter how much Chongqing concedes, cooperation is unlikely until the Yan'an regime is denied. However, the anti-Axis countries also believe that this responsibility should be shouldered by Chongqing. Magazines such as Moscow's "War and the Working Class" and British Communist newspapers have criticized Chongqing's encirclement of Yan'an. The New York Times has also published Yan'an's attacks on Chongqing's one-party rule, considering it far removed from democracy. Therefore, Chongqing is in a difficult situation under American pressure and Yan'an's attacks. On the other hand, Yan'an's closeness to the United States also serves as a kind of check on Chongqing. America's ambition is nothing more than to sacrifice China to achieve its aim of fighting Japan. In insisting on resistance to develop China's

red revolution,

the two sides have the same goal, making cooperation easy. Furthermore, Yan'an's political theory is New Democracy, which has common ground with European and American democracy. Moreover, the recent direct request for air bases by the U.S. Air Force is the biggest reason for the easier approach between the two sides. It is an established policy for the United States to use the Chinese mainland as a base to bomb the Japanese mainland. The Twentieth Air Force, based in Chengdu, has launched four raids on Japan. Recently, due to the defeat in the Hunan campaign, the U.S. Air Force stationed in South China has had to retreat, which makes the need to establish bases in inland China and the Northwest region more acute. Now, a U.S. military inspection group composed of U.S. officers and military experts arrived in

Yan'an

on the 12th of this month.

Regarding the purpose of the inspection group, a Chongqing spokesman said at a meeting that it was to seek cooperation in assisting injured U.S. soldiers who had been forced to land, and to collect meteorological and other information. As for whether the Yan'an area will be used as a base for air strikes against Japan, it is not yet possible to say. The construction of new bases in the Northwest region is a fixed plan for Yan'an. At the same time, since the United States intends to bomb Manchuria, it is conceivable that it will seek bases in northern Shaanxi.

A U.S. Plane Crashes in Huduo Town

A Certain Japanese Military Base, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – A U.S. Air Force B29 aircraft stationed in Chongqing crashed in Huduo Town (28 kilometers west of Sucheng, Jiangsu Province) at approximately 10:00 PM on the 20th. The wreckage has been recovered by the local Japanese army. By investigating its direction of flight and airframe, it can be presumed that the aircraft was shot down by Japanese defense forces during the air raid on northern Kyushu on the 20th, and crashed in the area while flying back to China due to damage to its components.

Hangzhou Air Defense Conference

Hangzhou, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Hangzhou Air Defense Office held its first air defense conference in the City Hall meeting room yesterday to discuss air defense matters. It was decided to strengthen lighting control and enhance air defense equipment.

### Major Battle Underway in Southwest Suburbs of Paris, Invading Forces Advance Along the Yonne River

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The German News Agency quoted an official German war report stating that, in the northwest region of Paris, the enemy is pursuing the German army retreating down the Seine River with powerful forces from the southwest. The enemy is exerting strong pressure south of Elbeuf. West of Paris, the enemy, supported by numerous tanks, has advanced to the western suburbs of the city. Fierce fighting is currently taking place in the suburbs. During a counterattack, the German army repelled enemy forces attempting to cross the Yonne River west of Melun (southeast of Paris).

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The German News Agency reports that extremely fierce fighting continues in Normandy, one of its characteristics being the bravery displayed by German soldiers, which even the enemy acknowledges. The fighting in this part of France seems to have been divided into individual actions by fast-moving tank formations, but in general, the war has spread to major areas. German grenadiers are bravely resisting, regardless of the anti-Axis forces' numerical superiority, because German soldiers believe they are fighting for a just cause and the future of the nation, so they will do their utmost to achieve this goal. German formations, closely followed by anti-Axis forces, are struggling to maintain the general line from Lisieux to Orbec and on to Conches. This line runs from Conches to Evreux and Pacy and ends at Vernon. West of Evreux, U.S. forces have broken through northwards from Bonneville and reached the southeast of Le Neubourg. On Wednesday, anti-Axis aircraft bombed the small town of Conches eight times in a short period of time, showing that Anglo-American forces will soon continue to attack the area. In the Paris area, U.S. forces have so far only used tank reconnaissance units to explore the German lines, and the German army is engaged in fierce fighting with terrorists west and southwest of Paris. South of the capital, the German rear guard has retreated to the Corbeil-Fontainebleau line. The situation near Romilly and Toryes on the Yonne River (south of Paris) is not yet clear. General Patton, who is directing operations there, seems to aim to encircle the German forces south of Paris and east of the Seine, or to cut off all German communications with southern France.

German Troops Retreating to Lyon from Southern France

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The German News Agency reports that there is fierce fighting in the Toulon and Marseille areas of southern France. The German army has retreated to Lyon from several locations under the cover of coastal artillery, disengaging from the enemy.

### Romanian National Socialist Government Calls on Military and Civilians to Continue Resistance, Denounces the Treacherous Behavior of the King

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Haitong News Agency reports that the Romanian National Socialist Party government has been declared to be formed as necessitated by the situation. The Romanian King has formed a left-wing government and notified the military and civilians of the country to cease hostilities against the Soviet Union. The National Socialist government issued a hasty announcement, informing the Romanian military and civilians, which reads: "Romanians, the lives of us and our descendants, and the destiny of Romania, have reached a state of extreme danger. The brave Romanian military and civilians have shed blood for the soil of both countries for the past few years. Now the King, surrounded by treacherous villains, has dismissed our leader Marshal Antonescu and shamelessly allied himself with our enemies, handing Romania over to our deadly enemy, the communists. Although Britain and the United States guarantee Romania's independence and integrity, these are lies. They have long allowed Stalin to dominate Romanian territory. The King, in an attempt to seek protection from Britain and the United States, has completely forfeited the fate of the country and the future of the people. The King has prepared an aircraft to leave at any time. The King's treasonous behavior has harmed Romania and its people. Fortunately, the National Socialist government has now been formed, in order to preserve our ancestral Romanian territory and prevent it from being taken over by the communists." The announcement also encourages the military and civilians not to obey the orders of the King and his government, and urges soldiers to fight to defend the country.

German Troops in Romania Shifting the Frontline Back

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The German News Agency reports that the situation in the southern sector of the Eastern Front has been affected by the attitude of the Romanian army. Initially, the pro-Royal party was preparing to rebel before the Soviet army launched a major offensive. When the Soviet army attempted to break through the Axis forces' positions with a large force, some Romanian troops offered only slight resistance, while others continued to fight vigorously. According to well-informed sources, the German side is dealing with the current situation with a calm head. The German army has shifted its positions on both sides of the Prut River and in the middle reaches of the Siret River, and is now defending the natural defensive line to the west.

Hungary Orders the Dissolution of All Political Parties

Budapest, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Hungarian government ordered on the 24th that all political parties in the country, regardless of their political orientation, should be dissolved immediately, cease all political activities, and all assets of political parties should be frozen or confiscated. Violators of the ban will be severely punished.

Budapest, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Haitong News Agency reports that the purpose of the Hungarian government's order to ban political party activities is to safeguard domestic unity.

Nanjing Briefs

Rural Sketches of the Four Suburbs of Nanjing – Min Xian

A reporter and his party braved the summer heat for several days to visit rural areas such as Badou Mountain, Dashengguan, Xiaolingwei, Zijin Mountain, and Xiaohang Mountain, to conduct separate inspections. A detailed report on the overall picture of the rural areas on the outskirts of the capital is being compiled. Only the external circumstances of various places are reported in advance. It is hoped that it can attract the attention of the authorities to the revival of the rural economy.

First, Security – Because all the rural areas traversed are not far from the capital, there are not many unreasonable special circumstances, especially few activities of bandits and communists. The lives of the farmers in each village are relatively stable. However, in the villages on the outskirts, local soldiers often forcibly buy "or even forcibly demand" firewood and grass to bring into the city for profit (currently, the price of firewood and grass in Nanjing is about six or seven hundred yuan per load). It is inevitable that other farming families feel disturbed. It is heard that the authorities have repeatedly issued orders to ban this, but those who speak are unheeded. If you want to stabilize the countryside, it seems appropriate to start with small things and actually remedy them.

Urgent Need for Guidance – In recent years, the authorities have loudly called for the revival of the countryside and promoted increased production. We, who have been living in the city for a long time, cannot help but be moved by the grand speeches and great theories in the newspapers. However, in terms of improvement, it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve results if the countryside is not given practical guidance. For example, in the Yanziji district, which is very close to Nanjing, about 30 mu of land in the 4th and 5th bao are planted with pomegranates. The reporter saw rotten pomegranates discarded on the ground, and the pests on the trees were also gathering and no one was driving them away. It can be seen that the cultivation method is not scientific. When consulting a wealthy local farmer, he replied: "Most of these pomegranate trees have owners, and everyone just wants to be able to collect a little each year, and that's it." During the busy autumn harvest season, farmers are threshing rice in the fields using outdated methods, so although there are many rice beds, it is difficult to achieve twice the result with half the effort. During a break, I learned that there are also certain grassroots organizations here. The expenses are borne by the villagers according to household, and the right is to enjoy the allocation paper for daily necessities and technical guidance on agricultural products, but in fact, it is only a formality, and the allocation of goods is one in a hundred. In particular, the so-called agricultural instructor is a young man from a normal school. Although his hard work is admirable, his knowledge of agricultural science seems to be lacking, and it is clear that he cannot guide others. From this, we can further know that it seems insufficient for experts who only care about the countryside in the city to only summon meetings and shout for increased production. They must have real talent and practical knowledge, and experts who have a good understanding of the rural economy must go deep into the countryside, prescribe the right medicine, and actually guide the improvement of crops, and help them with materials, so that the potential of the countryside and the semi-barren land can be fully realized, and the effect of increasing production can be achieved. It is difficult to achieve success without this.

Lack of Cattle – Very few farmers in the villages own cattle. It is rare to have three or four cattle in each village. From this, it can be clear that the average farmer is not rich, and the rich are only a few large landowners. Farmers who need cattle to help with their work must rent them from the landlords, and the price is as high as 2,000 yuan per mu. Therefore, semi-self-cultivating farmers and those who have no strength are exploited everywhere. They still have difficulty getting enough to eat on weekdays, and they have no money to see a doctor when they are sick. The so-called "big fish eat small fish" also exists in the countryside. What is especially heartbreaking is that a few families with cattle sell the only cattle they have to get through their current difficulties, but the number of cattle is gradually decreasing, and the authorities have not taken strict measures to treat the symptoms, and there are very few agricultural loans to treat the root cause. If this continues, cattle will disappear from the countryside, which is not an exaggeration.

Superficial Prosperity – In the villages and towns that the reporter passed through, there are actually many modern luxury goods, colorful and all-inclusive. Those who enjoy them are either large landowners or special people with special power in the local area. The average farmer can't even dream of it. People in the city always think that food prices are high and farmers are rich, and deeply sigh that the city is not as good as the countryside. In fact, although the high price of rice is a fact, after repeated exploitation, the benefits that farmers get are minimal. In particular, most tenant farmers groan under high interest rates. "If you borrow 1,000 yuan, you have to pay back a load of wheat in addition to the principal after four or five months, which is worth 1,800 yuan." Similarly, farmers are sighing that the countryside is not as good as the city.

### Shanghai Area Edible Oil Management Essentials, Oil and Grain Association Formulates Measures and Submits for Implementation

The Business Control Commission's Oil and Grain Control Committee, in order to prevent hoarding of edible oil within the Shanghai control line, has formulated interim management measures and submitted them to the Business Control Commission and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government for promulgation and implementation in the near future. Details of the contents of the measures have been learned as follows:

Manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and buyers of edible oil must register with the guild, and all stocks must be sold within a limited time, otherwise they will be penalized. Manufacturers must register the warehouse receipts issued to wholesalers and retailers with the guild, sell them within a limited time, and have them stamped by the Oil and Grain Control Committee to be valid. Manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers may not store more edible oil than their usual actual sales volume. For business use, the amount of edible oil stored by each company is also limited to a certain amount according to the needs of the industry. The amount of edible oil stored by companies, factories, groups, organizations, and households should be determined according to the number of people in the household and the actual amount needed. To prevent non-industry people from operating the edible oil transportation within the control line, if the quantity exceeds the specified amount, there must be a purchase and sale registration certificate from the guild. Members with the same qualifications may not buy or sell from each other, or operate or store on behalf of others, etc. However, this restriction does not apply to purchasers who transport from outside the local area. If the provisions of these measures are violated, or if there are any concealment or false reports, once verified, the committee may purchase at the designated price, or send a letter to the competent authority to impose penalties depending on the severity of the circumstances.

### Strictly Enforcing National Banquets, Prohibiting Taoist Rituals

Under the wartime system, it is particularly urgent to save on extravagance and prevent the waste of resources. The Municipal Social Welfare Bureau and the Municipal Thrift Association attach great importance to this. Recently, in order to strictly enforce national banquets, assist in promoting electricity conservation measures, and prohibit superstitious behaviors such as holding Taoist rituals, they jointly convened hotel, restaurant, Chinese and Western restaurants, and district chief representatives in the city yesterday (25th) at 3:00 PM and 5:00 PM respectively in the conference room of the Welfare Bureau for talks. Minister of Social Welfare Ding Mocun personally delivered instructions. Details are recorded as follows:

Past Malpractices and Attempts to Conceal – At 3:00 PM, representatives of hotels, restaurants, and Chinese and Western restaurants in the city were convened to discuss the strict enforcement of thrift banquets and the promotion of electricity conservation measures. The representatives present, including Minister Ding, Director Sun Mingqi, Director Chen Dongbai, and Thrift Association Director Pei Qing, have been holding meetings for two months, but the effectiveness of the implementation has not been strictly checked. In the aspects of various industries, due to the needs of guests, they even use various methods to evade restrictions, attempting to cleverly conceal, which violates the principles of thrift. It is hoped that they will strictly abide by the rules. If the cost of raw materials rises sharply, they can also make a reasonable application to adjust the publicly announced price. The authorities will absolutely take care of the difficulties of businesses. At the same time, inspections will be carried out in the future. If any violations are found, they will be severely punished. It is hoped that all industries will voluntarily abide by the rules.

### Strictly Enforcing Thrift, Implementing Inspections

The Executive Director of the Thrift Association, Lu Feng, gave a speech, saying: "I hope to actively and automatically promote thrift measures. If Shanghai cannot implement thrift measures, it will have a significant impact on the country and the nation. Under this wartime system, it is inevitable to promote national banquets and prevent waste. High-end dishes and extravagant competitions will affect general prices, making ordinary people suffer from the pressure of high living costs. I hope that all parties will assist the government in strictly enforcing thrift and avoiding various illegal malpractices." The Director of the Thrift Association, Ren Yunpeng, continued to speak, pointing out phenomena such as the thriving of card games in hotels and the abnormal bustle in restaurants, where various industries cater to customers and do not hesitate to evade restrictions and other fraudulent behaviors in clever ways. He also announced the promotion measures for thrift banquets, and in the future, they will send young students to cooperate with the restaurant and other industries to carry out inspections, in order to complete the restriction of national banquets as soon as possible. Subsequently, the Executive Director of the Thrift Association, Gu Nanqun, gave a speech, hoping that all industries themselves would thoroughly understand the task of thrift. In the future, they should also cooperate sincerely in the inspection work and assist the government in promoting it. Later, representatives of the hotel industry, Ding Sheng, and representatives of the Chinese and Western restaurant industry, Wu Bingyong, spoke successively, expressing their approval of the strict enforcement of thrift banquets and electricity conservation measures, and decided to cooperate and maintain them. However, they requested the welfare authorities to assist in informing the market and lowering the wholesale prices for the purchase of raw materials.

### Official-Private Cooperation, Protecting Resources

Minister Ding's instructions were as follows: "Regarding electricity conservation, the power company has always strictly implemented it, and you are all enthusiastic about complying with it, so there is no need to explain it further. However, regarding thrift banquets, I would like to take this opportunity to clarify: the restriction of national banquets is advocated by the Welfare Department. It is by no means an official interference with the freedom of business operations. At this time of material shortages, the situation is becoming increasingly serious. If we do not economize, economic and price difficulties will increase in the future, and the excessive consumption of resources will not only hit people's livelihoods but also greatly damage the nation's vitality. Furthermore, due to the difficulty of transportation and the difficulty of material circulation, it is hoped that by reducing consumption, prices will tend to fall. In short, thrift is based on protecting resources. I hope you will understand this and cooperate and promote it in accordance with the regulations. The inspection personnel sent in the future have also been approved by the government authorities. They will closely cooperate in the same position to achieve success." Finally, Executive Director Gu expressed his deep gratitude for the enthusiastic participation of all industries and the personal instructions of Minister Ding. The meeting lasted for two hours.

### Breaking Superstition, Strictly Prohibiting Taoist Rituals

At 5:00 PM, a talk was started with the district chiefs. The district chiefs present included Zhu Qizhen, Xu Xiaochu, Zhou Mengbai, Le Fenglin, and Yao Jiangzhang. First, Minister Ding explained the significance of promoting thrift work and relying on the cooperation of the Baojia system, and stated that superstitious customs such as holding Taoist rituals have not been completely broken to this day. These superstitious behaviors not only cost people money, but also cause even greater losses of resources, and create opportunities for hooligans and local diseases to defraud money. He hoped that the Baojia districts would automatically persuade the people and cooperate in prohibiting them, which would be of great benefit to individuals, society, the country, and the nation. After Director Sun gave a speech, Baojia representative Zhou Mengbai expressed his views, expressing his approval of the ban on Taoist rituals and superstition. Then, the entire meeting unanimously decided to prohibit them completely. The method is to first have the district chiefs persuade the people in the district to prohibit them, and the Welfare Bureau and the Thrift Association will separately send letters to the city's police bureau and the Baojia office to instruct their subordinates to strictly prohibit them. The meeting ended at 6:00 PM.

### Order at the North Station Has Improved

Since the police affairs of the North Station in the city have been taken over by the Xihongkou Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau, the situation is still good. The maintenance of order inside and outside the station has been actively improved by the additional deployment of long-term police officers by the branch. In particular, the customary search inside the station has been prohibited. Regardless of large or small packages, they must not be inspected on the pretext of preventing malpractices. As for the black market ticket sales, since the China Railway Company formulated a new ticket purchase method, it has been reduced. The so-called "scalpers" who have always made a living from selling black market tickets are becoming increasingly depressed. In general, the situation can be said to be satisfactory.

### Completed Consolidated Tax Goods - Exemption from Transit Tax - Customs Administration Submits to Ministry of Finance for Record

Regarding goods subject to consolidated tax, tobacco and alcohol tax, or mineral tax, the customs authorities have always relied on tax payment receipts for verification and release. However, the collection or exemption of transit tax has not been consistent. Therefore, the Inspector General of Customs has submitted a proposal to the Customs Administration suggesting that all goods for which the respective taxes have been paid should be exempted from transit tax. The Ministry of Finance has reviewed the Administration's request and has now issued an order approving it for record and instructing notification. The original text is as follows: "According to the Customs Administration's submission of July 3, based on the submission of Aimoto Hirokichi, Inspector General of Customs, regarding goods subject to consolidated tax, tobacco and alcohol tax, or mineral tax, the customs authorities have always relied on tax payment receipts for verification and release. However, the collection or exemption of transit tax has not been consistent. It is now proposed that all goods for which the respective taxes have been paid should be exempted from transit tax. The reasons are respectfully submitted as follows: Consolidated Tax Goods: It has been found that consolidated tax goods, such as bran, wheat flour, rolled tobacco, smoked tobacco leaves, cement, matches, spirits, cotton yarn, and directly woven products, have been ordered to be subject to transit tax. However, for beer, except for those produced by breweries specifically exempted, the remaining products that have already paid the consolidated tax are still required to pay transit tax, resulting in inconsistent treatment. To ensure fair taxation and simplify customs procedures, it seems appropriate to improve this. All beer that has paid consolidated tax should be exempted from transit tax upon presentation of the tax payment receipt. Tobacco and Alcohol Tax (Special Tax on Native Tobacco Industry, Fixed Tax on Native Wine, and Tax on Foreign Wines): It has been found that tobacco and alcohol tax goods, such as native wine, native tobacco leaves, and shredded tobacco, have been ordered to be exempted from transit tax. However, for foreign wines, the scope of transit tax exemption is limited to products specifically approved for exemption from the breweries. This also seems unfair. The method of transit tax exemption for these tobacco and alcohol tax goods (including special tax on native tobacco leaves, fixed tax on native wine, and tax on foreign wines) should be handled in the same way as consolidated tax goods, with transit tax exemption granted upon presentation of the tobacco and alcohol tax payment receipt. Mineral Tax Goods: It has been found that mineral tax goods have previously been repeatedly ordered to be issued a list of mineral names and tax amounts. For all products listed, if they have a mineral tax payment receipt, the customs authorities have consistently followed the regulations of the Administration's Instruction No. 18115 of September 27, 1935, to exempt them from transit tax. Other products should also be treated uniformly, with transit tax exemption granted upon presentation of the mineral tax payment receipt. The proposed plan is that all goods that have paid consolidated tax, tobacco and alcohol tax, or mineral tax should be exempted from transit tax. To determine whether the reasons are sufficient, a list of cases of special exemptions for beer and foreign wines and various mineral tax cases, along with copies of the original orders, are respectfully submitted for review," and so on, with an attached list and copies of fourteen orders. Based on this review, the methods for transit tax exemption for goods that have paid consolidated tax, tobacco and alcohol tax, or mineral tax have been inconsistent, leading to disputes and misunderstandings. This time, a unified method is established to create a fixed rule so that everyone can follow it. After checking, there are no discrepancies. In addition to instructing approval, this document, along with the attached documents, is respectfully submitted for review." The Ministry has approved the request for record, instructing notification and dissemination."

### Knowledge of Air Raid Defense - Meaning of Air Raid Defense

Currently, some people still have doubts about whether air raids are truly unavoidable. However, the fact is that enemy planes have already attacked and may do so again in the future. However, if citizens adopt complete measures for air defense, even the largest enemy air raid will not be effective. Germany is a clear example of this. Conversely, if citizens lack preparation, they will inevitably suffer significant losses from enemy air raids. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize that a dismissive attitude plays into the enemy's hands. In essence, the purpose of defense is not about when enemy planes will come, but about creating a system that renders their attacks ineffective. Thoughts on Air Raids When a bomb explodes nearby or incendiary bombs fall everywhere, a fire can easily start if action is delayed. In this situation, anyone can easily panic. However, if one is well-prepared and trained for air raids in peacetime, one will not be thrown into chaos even when enemy planes drop bombs. Secondly, it should be noted that during air raids, some people will be exploited by various rumors and become even more flustered. After an air raid, when the situation is still not public and the situation is unclear, various rumors are likely to spread. These absurd rumors can be extremely outrageous. At this time, it is important to remain calm, not be swayed by them, and trust the authorities' instructions, so that order can be maintained. In emergency situations, chaos often arises from the abnormal behavior of citizens. The authorities must consider the overall situation and instruct and guide the general public with the most appropriate strategies. However, in such situations, if citizens act arbitrarily, the chaos will only worsen. In order to minimize casualties in such situations, the authorities have been studying and preparing to enable citizens to continue their work as usual. Therefore, citizens have an absolute obligation to trust the authorities' guidance, as this is the safest approach.

### Courts to Handle Cases Swiftly - Agreed Upon Methods

The Shanghai Local Procuratorate recently received an order from the Ministry instructing it to consult with the High Procuratorate and the High and District Courts to improve and simplify case handling procedures, ensuring speed and preventing delays, so as to avoid prolonged detention of the accused. The Chief Procurator, Zhao Zhengtang, convened an ad hoc meeting of all procurators. The main items discussed included:

(A) How to allocate cases submitted by the police after the summer break. (Resolution) The rotating daily assignment method of July and August will continue. Two procurators will be assigned to allocate cases received on that day. However, if the number of cases exceeds forty, the Chief Procurator will temporarily assign additional personnel to handle them. If the number of cases is less than twenty, only one procurator will handle them. Complaint cases will continue to be divided equally as usual. The above method will be implemented from September 1.

(B) The resolution of the Procuratorate's meeting on June 27 of this year regarding the vigorous implementation of bail must be strictly followed. (Resolution) To be implemented as directed.

(C) After the summer break, it is proposed that the police be requested to submit cases daily by 10:00 AM to expedite the process. (Resolution) To be requested of the police.

(D) In the future, requests for case files and other matters from the police should be sent directly to the sub-bureaus, rather than to the main bureau, to avoid delays due to back-and-forth communication. (Resolution) To be implemented as directed. Director of Public Health on

### Measures to Combat Smoking

Lu Runzhi, Director of the Public Health Administration, came to Shanghai the other day on official business. The main purpose of his visit was to instruct on the establishment of smoking cessation hospitals in Shanghai and various public health implementation policies. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Mr. Lu to inquire about the implementation policies of smoking cessation hospitals across the country. He kindly made the following remarks: Since the Central Government promulgated the anti-drug laws, the Administration has also been ordered to prepare for the establishment of smoking cessation hospitals across the country. Preparations began in May of this year, starting with the establishment of the Capital Smoking Cessation Hospital. The Shanghai branch was established the other day. In other provinces, it is planned to establish five Class A smoking cessation hospitals in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, located in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Suzhou, Wuhu, and Bengbu, ten Class B hospitals located in Changshu, Wuxi, Wutong, Zhenjiang, Taixian, Nantong, Kunshan, Songjiang, Ningbo, and Huaining, and seventeen Class C hospitals located in Jiangpu, Jiangning, Taicang, Kunshan, Wujiang, Yixing, Xinghua, Gaoyou, Dongtai, Gaocheng, Rugao, Haimen, Qingpu, Wuxing, Shaoxing, Hefei, and Jiashan. The total expenses are set at 500,000 yuan per month for Class A, 300,000 yuan for Class B, and 200,000 yuan for Class C, all allocated by the Public Health Administration for preparation. The local anti-smoking bureaus will first investigate the situation of suitable hospitals in their areas, and then organize a board of directors to start preparing for the establishment of the smoking cessation hospital. The Administration will separately appoint specialized personnel to manage the hospital and operate it in accordance with the methods stipulated by the Administration. Regarding the methods for smokers to quit, there are three types: persuasion, forced cessation, and voluntary cessation. Diagnostic fees will be determined with reference to local conditions. During the period when smokers are undergoing cessation, their relatives must personally supervise them, striving to thoroughly eliminate drug use within three years in accordance with the anti-smoking measures stipulated by the Central Government.

"New Interpretation of Mencius" to Be Published Zhao Zhengping, President of National Shanghai University, has recently authored a book titled "New Interpretation of Mencius." Based on the author's sharp and precise scientific methods, the book provides a detailed analysis of Mencius's teachings and elaborates on Mencius's concepts of benevolence and righteousness, democracy, and ideas on people's livelihood, people's happiness, people's opinions, anti-war sentiments, and personal cultivation. The entire book consists of twelve lectures, totaling over 100,000 words. It has now been typeset and is expected to be published at the end of this month.

Xingren Real Estate Shares to Be Listed The Xingren Real Estate Company on Fuzhou Road in this city was founded by Shen Changfu, Zhang Weiru, Xiao Xiling, Song Boquan, and others, with a capital of 10 million yuan in national currency. It specializes in real estate sales and architectural design, employing experts to oversee all aspects. Last year, it purchased hundreds of acres of vacant land and has been operating very smoothly. The company's shares, priced at ten yuan each, will be listed soon.

Simaito Brand Socks Listed The Tongxing Socks and Shirts Factory (i.e., Tongxing Industrial Society) in this city was founded by Xu Zhichao. Last year, it expanded its capital to 20 million yuan. Its Simaito brand horizontal striped socks for men and women have recently been launched on the market. The factory actively emphasizes both manual and machine production to meet demand. The factory's new shares have been available for exchange since August 25.

### Readers' Scholarship Aid News - Who is Not as Good as Me in Doing Good? - Mr. Zhu Shouzhi's Fundraising

Mr. Zhu Shouzhi, deeply concerned about the suffering of impoverished students who are unable to attend school, previously sent Mr. Guo Yongxi to the library to review the applications of those not admitted to high school and university. He carefully reviewed each application and selected five of the most impoverished high school seniors and university freshmen, requesting approval to provide them with a scholarship of 50,000 yuan, funded solely by Mr. Zhu, as previously reported. Subsequently, Mr. Zhu raised another 50,000 yuan each from the Yuhua Tobacco Factory and the Xinya Rubber Printing Factory, totaling 100,000 yuan. In the second selection, ten rejected university students were selected, each receiving 6,000 yuan, and ten high school students were also selected, each receiving 4,000 yuan, totaling 100,000 yuan. Mr. Zhu's benevolence and righteousness are truly rare. According to Mr. Zhu, there are wealthy tycoons and merchants everywhere in Shanghai. We only need to promote it sincerely, and it will not be difficult to raise large sums of money. As the saying goes, "Who is not as good as me in doing good?" These words are truly profound. We at this newspaper hope that our readers will emulate Mr. Zhu's spirit of generosity and promote it widely, contributing efforts and money to benefit both others and themselves, which is truly immeasurable merit. Cheng Yi Students' Enthusiasm is Commendable The students of Cheng Yi Middle School at 694 Taishan Road have been performing plays to raise funds, as detailed in previous reports in this newspaper. The faculty and staff of the school have wholeheartedly led the students in this charitable endeavor, which is commendable. Yesterday, they sent the net proceeds of the charity performance, totaling over 107,000 yuan, as follows: Student fundraising: 146,500 yuan Temporary donations: 4,200 yuan Sales of brochures: 965 yuan Total income: 151,665 yuan Expenses: 44,428.7 yuan Net income: 107,236.3 yuan.

Also, starting at noon on the 19th of this month, a special honorary seat invitation will be presented for every donation of 1,000 yuan or more, totaling 55 invitations.

The Buddhist Association Notifies Benevolent Men and Women The Shanghai Shenbao Newspaper relays that all Shanghai residents who are ignorant and rebellious, only know how to seek individual blessings, but do not know how to benefit society and repay the kindness of all living beings, which is the supreme field of merit. Educating young people and building the foundation of the country is the most excellent wisdom. If things are allowed to continue in this way, the Dharma will become increasingly obscure, and people will only engage in empty formalities, without focusing on practical work to save lives. This is far from the compassion and wisdom of the Buddha, and it causes those who believe in Buddhism to be seen as superstitious and passive. Upon investigation, the cause is that Buddhists are reaping what they sow. In fact, what the Buddha taught people is to lead them to the path of light and happiness in life, always putting the benefit of others as the prerequisite, with great compassion, great courage, great wisdom, and great vows. The twelve divisions of the scriptures reveal this to the disciples. Over time, falsehoods accumulate and distort the truth. Those who leave home do not promote the teachings, and lay believers also lose their true meaning. If Buddhists are ignorant of the path, the world will sink deeper into suffering, and the consequences in the future will be unimaginable. The heart of Bodhi arises from suffering, so today, the Association is taking the lead for our fellow Buddhists to respond to the scholarship and loan programs of the Shenbao and Xinbao newspapers, collecting a total of 112,500 yuan from the food rations and savings of various temples in Shanghai, and donating all of it in the hope that Buddhist believers will strive to rescue young people who have dropped out of school, embodying the spirit of great compassion, courage, wisdom, and vows, benefiting the future society, purifying the small self, and strengthening the great self. In terms of merit, this is greater than anything else. It is believed that among our Buddhists, there is no shortage of wise and wealthy elders, or powerful lay people who, with one call, will be answered by all. People's hope that their children will be educated and become talents is no different from their own hope, but due to actual economic conditions, they have to bear the sadness of young people dropping out of school. Preparing talents for the country is the same for everyone. Following the Buddha's heart, they should be brave and do what is right. The members of the Association directly express their humble feelings, striking Ananda's begging bowl and praising the generosity of the benefactors. Shanghai Special City Buddhist Association.

### Cambridge Elder Donates Scholarship - Wanhun Girls' Middle School Issues Enrollment Notice

The Cambridge Elder donated 30 scholarships to the Wanrun Girls' Middle School to celebrate his mother's 80th birthday, benefiting the impoverished and delighting the family, which is of great significance. The Wanrun Girls' Middle School was jointly founded by enthusiastic colleagues in the education field, with the aim of providing serious education and serving society.
