### Wartime Production Increase Is Essential

Japan's aircraft production, since focusing on ultra-priority production, has been more than a year, and the results have been remarkable. The aircraft industry has leaped from infancy to adulthood, and the speed of its progress and development is admirable (see the 18th issue of this newspaper). In summary, there are two main reasons: one is the increased efficiency of the workforce, and the other is the increased number of workers. This is the only way to increase production. Countries that want to increase production must follow suit.

China is a member of the Allied nations, but in terms of weapon manufacturing, China's basic steel industry in heavy industry has not developed at all, so there is no way to help in this area. What China can do in the current environment is only agriculture and light industry. During wartime, agriculture and light industry can help the country solve the problems of food and clothing. We must increase the yield of rice, wheat, and cotton per acre. We must increase the number of people engaged in agriculture. We must increase the yarn production in each yarn factory. We must also increase the number of people working in yarn factories. These are the only things we in China can strive for. The result of our efforts can stabilize people's livelihoods and increase combat power.

China's need to increase production in this area is very urgent, but observing the current production situation cannot but make us feel ashamed. Taking agriculture as an example, the number of people farming is not only unable to maintain the status quo, but is gradually decreasing. As for the yarn factories, some have already shut down, and some are reducing work day by day. Our goal is to increase production, but we are heading down the road of decreasing production every day. These are all facts, and we cannot hide them, nor can we deny them. If this situation is allowed to continue, not to mention whether we can cooperate in the war, the food and clothing of the Chinese people will immediately become a problem. How to overcome the difficulties? This is the most important issue that the government and all concerned people in the country should pay attention to, and we hope that the Allied nations will do their best to assist.

First, the control methods must be improved. The purpose of control is to encourage production and facilitate distribution, but the current control results sometimes make producers passive, thus making producers unwilling to produce. Since production has decreased, the distribution problem is of course more difficult to solve. Rice control is the best example. After a series of failures, we must find ways to improve. There is no doubt that the country should implement a control policy during wartime, so the problem is not in the system itself, but in the control methods and personnel issues. We have said a lot about rice control. These words are not only hopes for rice control, but other control industries must also improve in view of the failure of rice control.

Second, an overall plan to support agriculture and industry must be decided. Taking yarn factories as an example, if we want to continue mass production, we must set an overall plan. Those that meet the operating conditions must be made to operate, and raw materials and electricity must be supplied. Those that do not meet the operating conditions should be clearly instructed to stop work. The government must take an active role, support and encourage those who can increase production, and naturally gain control over the products. From the production of raw materials in agriculture to the manufacture of finished products in industry, and then to the distribution of finished products, these three steps are connected and whole, and a complete plan is needed. Dealing with them piecemeal cannot solve the problem. Although we cannot achieve the full support of agriculture and industry at present, we must at least establish a few models to gradually promote it.

Increasing production during wartime is certainly a difficult task, but not producing or reducing production during wartime has the danger of contributing to the overall unfavorable situation. Therefore, in any difficult environment, we must find ways to promote the realization of increased production.

### Japanese Troops Advance on Palel, Capturing Seven Enemy Forts; Battles Around Kohima Become Increasingly Fierce

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 25th – The elite Japanese troops on the Burma front launched another attack on the enemy troops who were desperately defending Palel on the 17th. Under the close cooperation of infantry, engineers, and artillery units, they gradually advanced on the enemy's strongholds. At 11:00 PM on the 18th, a Japanese infantry suicide squad, carrying landmines, approached the enemy's positions in the darkness to carry out explosive demolition work, and used new weapons to shoot at the enemy troops. By dawn, they had captured seven enemy forts, completing the offensive route.

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 25th – The enemy's counterattacks against the Japanese positions around Kohima have become increasingly fierce, and a large number of troops have been reinforced from the north in an attempt to open the road from Kohima to Imphal. To attack the enemy troops on Highland 5120 northeast of Kohima, after the attack failed on the 19th, at 5:40 PM on the 21st, 200 enemy troops, with tanks and artillery, attacked the highest point of the highland. However, after a fierce battle, they were finally repelled by the Japanese troops. In this two-day fierce battle, the enemy troops abandoned 115 bodies, and the Japanese troops destroyed four of their mortars. In addition, the enemy troops also increased their forces toward the Arraz area south of Kohima, advancing near Highland 1400. At the same time, they also transferred elite troops carrying mortars to the vicinity of Longpan Zimi, 30 kilometers east of Kohima.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 25th – According to a report from Contai, the Allied Southeast Asia Command announced that the Japanese troops in the Bishenpur area of the Imphal front had recently increased their strength and launched an attack under the cover of artillery fire on the 12th.

### Completing the Encirclement and Launching a Three-Pronged Offensive, Japanese Troops Captured Luoyang Yesterday Morning, Continuing to Pursue the Fleeing Enemy and Expand the Results of the Battle

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced (6:30 PM, May 25th): The base of the First War Zone of the Chongqing Army, Luoyang, which was under encirclement and surveillance, was attacked by Japanese troops starting in the afternoon of May 24th, and the area was completely captured today (May 25th). The main battle results obtained by the Japanese army in this battle, which have been identified so far, are as follows: The Japanese side recovered more than 2,000 bodies of Chongqing soldiers, captured more than 4,000 prisoners, and seized 15 artillery pieces and 800 firearms.

Central News Agency, Xinzheng, 25th – In Henan, Japanese troops used a portion of their forces to encircle Luoyang, the base of the First War Zone of the Chongqing Army, while using the main force to pursue the main forces of the Chongqing field armies of Tang Enbo, Jiang Dingwen, and Hu Zongnan. They launched a general offensive on Luoyang on the 24th and completely occupied it at 8:30 AM on the 25th. The Japanese army did not want to destroy Luoyang because it is a cultural area with many famous historical sites. Moreover, the main purpose of this operation was to destroy the Chongqing field army, so the damage to Luoyang was minimal. Therefore, powerful Japanese troops arrived in the suburbs of Luoyang one after another starting on May 10th, completing the encirclement. However, they were not in a hurry to attack. At that time, they encircled Luoyang with a portion of their forces and used the main force to sweep away the Chongqing field army. At that time, the Chongqing army believed that the loss of Luoyang would have a major impact on politics and military affairs, so they strictly ordered the approximately three divisions of Chongqing soldiers in Luoyang to defend to the death. At that time, the Japanese army believed that the defending troops in the city did not accept the Japanese army's advice, so they had no choice but to launch a general offensive at 3:00 PM on the 24th, forcing their way into the city from the northeast, west, and three sides. As a result, they were completely occupied at 8:30 AM on the 25th. In this battle, the Chongqing army abandoned more than 2,000 bodies and more than 4,000 were captured. The Japanese army also seized 15 artillery pieces and approximately 800 firearms, achieving a great victory.

Thoroughly Annihilating the Troops of the First and Eighth War Areas

Central News Agency, Xinzheng, 25th – In this operation in Henan, the Japanese army thoroughly annihilated the troops of the enemy's First War Zone and Eighth War Zone, a total of seven armies and twenty-eight divisions. During the entire operation, the Japanese army achieved this great victory with the speed of lightning. This was due to the effective guidance of the Japanese army's operations, as well as the brave struggle of all officers and soldiers. Tang Enbo had tried his best to avoid conflict with the Japanese army since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, while secretly building up his forces. Recently, the anti-Japanese strength of his troops has been enriched, and it is predicted that they are sufficient to cope with the Japanese army's offensive. Moreover, since around February of this year, it was speculated that the Japanese army would launch an offensive operation, so he made every effort to prepare for the war. Therefore, when the Japanese army started this operation, the Chongqing army took active tactics, which instead became a good bait for the Japanese army. Although he lost most of his troops along the Jinghan Railway and the Funiu Mountains during the first phase of the annihilation operation, he still gathered his defeated troops and the remnants of the troops commanded by Jiang Dingwen, the First War Zone Army, and the Hu Zongnan Army of the Eighth War Zone in Xin'an, west of Luoyang. After the tenth annihilation battle, the Japanese army immediately advanced straight to Luoyang, and it was determined that they were carrying out an offensive operation in the area, and began a major counterattack behind the Japanese army. However, the Japanese army led these enemy troops north, crossed the Yellow River in a surprise attack from the vicinity of Yuanqu, Shanxi Province, cutting off the Longhai Line and cutting off its connection with the Eighth War Zone. After the main force of the Japanese army forced its way to Luoyang, it turned around and approached the main force of the enemy army gathered near Yiyang Jining, chasing them to the Luoyang River and Yi River valley areas, and using a large group of tank units and cavalry units to drive straight to Lushi, blocking the enemy army's retreat. They launched a three-pronged assault on the enemy's positions in the river valley area, achieving a strategic victory of annihilation. The Japanese army is currently continuing to shake the defeated remnants of the enemy army and expand the results of the battle. In the area of Henan Province, since the Sino-Japanese Incident, this is a rare phenomenon in the Japanese army's offensive operations. That is, before the Japanese army started the offensive this time, the residents of Henan cooperated with the Japanese army and successively rose up to disarm the defeated troops of the enemy army. Henan, known as the fertile land of the Central Plains of China, has also been burdened for many years by the war, and the people cannot bear it. At the same time, the general public rebelled against Tang Enbo's harsh taxes and levies, and seized the good opportunity for the Japanese army to attack and rose up. Today, the faces of the residents in the newly occupied areas of the Japanese army are all happy, and prices have been reduced by 10%. According to the Chongqing-American air force, they took a bystander attitude at the beginning of this operation and had no active intention to fight. However, in the later stage of the operation, due to Chiang Kai-shek's weeping appeal, they used Chengdu, Liangshan, Hanzhong, Xing'an, and other places as bases, and approximately 200 combat-bomber joint formations flew from the southwest region. On the 12th, the Japanese air force launched a surprise attack on Suichuan Airport, destroying 45 of their aircraft in one fell swoop. In addition to the embarrassment, their attitude towards cooperating with the Chongqing army was extremely cold.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 25th – According to a report from Chongqing, the Chongqing Military Headquarters announced that the Japanese army had occupied Lushi on the 22nd.

Central News Agency, Xinzheng, 25th – The Japanese army's assault troops advancing on Song County attacked Jiang Dingwen's troops, which were retreating southwestward across the Luoyang Plain, everywhere. They advanced along the mountain road to Song County and Lushi, and have now reached the Lushi area, the forward base of the US military in Chongqing. From the 19th to the morning of the 20th, they repelled approximately 1,000 Chongqing soldiers near the city and occupied it.

Japanese Down 11 Enemy Aircraft

Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 25th – On the 17th and 18th, the Japanese army's land forces in Henan shot down two Chongqing P140 aircraft that attacked in the Xintoubi area of Changshuizhen (two kilometers southwest of Changshuizhen) with machine guns.

### Navy Day Special Collection Six

Special Attack Squads in the Russo-Japanese War

…In the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the battles of Sinai, Diego Suarez in South Africa, and Challes in May 1942, the Japanese special attack squads left immortal achievements. This cannot help but remind us of the heroic feat of the five warriors who, 39 years ago in the Russo-Japanese War, carried torpedoes to raid Port Arthur. It is a pity that this act ultimately failed at the time. Inoue Mikichi (age 60), a retired Navy Sub-Lieutenant, one of the five warriors, is still alive today. The following is what he said about the situation at the time:

…At the time of the Russo-Japanese War, I was a Third Class Petty Officer serving on the battleship Fuji. From February to August of the 37th year of Meiji (1904), the entire fleet and its officers and soldiers toiled extremely hard to blockade and attack Port Arthur, and there were also many sacrifices. The enemy, fearing an attack from the sea, laid down solid defenses in the harbor. So we planned to break through these defenses and launch a surprise attack on the harbor.

…So I, serving on the battleship Fuji, and the five people, including Anchorman Fan Ping and Asouchi Tsuchimatsu, discussed carrying torpedoes and swimming into the harbor to destroy the enemy ships. We applied to the commander, obtained permission, and began training. This was to use two poles with a torpedo on top. The four people each supported one end of the pole, and one person was the torpedo gunner who would fire when approaching the enemy ship. At that time, the torpedoes weighed about the same as floating on the sea.

…Preparations were completed, and training was perfected. So on the night of July 30 of the 37th year of Meiji (1904), we transferred from the Fuji to a torpedo boat and proceeded to the vicinity of Port Arthur. The five of us transferred again to a sampan and rowed to the harbor carrying the torpedoes. Looking back, it was dark, and the wind and waves were high, and the sampan almost capsized. When we arrived at the harbor, the five of us stripped naked, wearing only a pair of pants and a firefighter-like headgear, and jumped into the sea.

…But the wind and waves became more and more turbulent, and the searchlights of the enemy gun emplacements shone like daylight, making the defenses impenetrable. Of course, none of us wanted to return alive, but unfortunately, there was ultimately no way to break through, so we had to give up and retreat. However, we did receive an award.

### Marshal Togo's Golden Words

The Best Way to Remedy Shortcomings is Courage

It is not necessarily a matter of concern that the enemy's artillery is strong and ours is weak. Though our swords may be short, a swift advance can still strike a fatal blow. To evade the enemy because their bullets reach us while ours do not reach them is to be without courage and without wisdom. It is difficult to expect victory in this manner. If our bullets cannot reach the enemy, we should advance to a position where they can and fire fiercely.

The Spirit of Soldiers is Even More Important Than the Sharpness of Weapons

Looking at the Russian soldiers during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, one would have to call them strong soldiers rather than weak. Yet, after engaging with the Japanese army, they suffered defeat after defeat. Why was this? It was because the majority of them believed that fighting was the duty of the army or navy. Consequently, the outcome of the battle was limited to the existence of the army or navy. Once these were defeated, they thought their duty as soldiers was over and rarely continued to fight as individuals. I believe this was a major reason why they could not defeat the Japanese army. As for the Japanese soldiers, they would fulfill their duty and die for their country, not just as a ship or a team, but even as a single soldier. This kind of awareness is stronger than iron and stone. Only this is the treasure that protects the nation. In the future, along with the progress of weapons, we must cultivate this kind of spirit even more.

Honor and Surrender Are Absolutely Incompatible

They may have a concept of "honorable surrender," but for Japanese soldiers, honor and surrender are absolutely incompatible at any time.

To Die Rather Than Be Defeated is the First Duty of Our Soldiers; Any Other Pretext in Wartime is Mere Words.

The Awakening of Bushido

The unexpected progress of our country's medieval navy was not only due to tactics and technology but also to the awakening of Bushido. If this spirit is applied to today's naval warfare, Western strategists will see things they never expected. For example, the T-crossing and zigzagging tactics are merely creative ideas suggested by this spirit.

Lamenting the Enemy General From the Perspective of Bushido

Admiral Rozhestvensky was truly an extraordinary man. It is easy to imagine the painstaking effort it took to navigate such a large fleet on a journey of 15,000 nautical miles. However, it is difficult to agree with his hesitation and indecision along the way, instead of boldly advancing to reach Vladivostok as soon as possible. However, our fundamental moral values are different. It may be unreasonable to expect him to act according to our standards. But if I were to express my hope for him directly, it would be that he would continue to fight valiantly in the Battle of Tsushima and die for his country. To live on dishonorably and willingly become a prisoner of war is a regrettable thing for him.

### The Municipal Government Strictly Prohibits Manipulation and Hoarding of Rice: Regulations for Rice Merchants to Obtain Licenses and Purchase Rice

In order to suppress rice prices and regulate the food supply, the government has issued an order to ease restrictions on the movement of rice in the Shanghai area and to revise the transportation rules, which will be implemented first in Beijing and Shanghai. The municipal government, fearing that after the implementation of this policy, some people may seek to seize exorbitant profits, manipulate rice prices, and engage in hoarding to harm the food supply, has issued a notice to all merchants and residents to be aware that, in addition to ordering strict investigations, they should share the difficulties of the times, assist the government in implementing policies, and not test the law or face punishment. The original text of the notice is as follows: "Notice: The movement of rice has been eased and restrictions have been lifted, and the transportation rules have been revised. However, after the implementation of this policy, if anyone seeks to seize exorbitant profits, manipulate rice prices, or engage in hoarding to harm the food supply, they will be severely punished according to the law once discovered. This matter concerns the welfare of all citizens, and it is hoped that merchants and residents will share the difficulties of the times, assist the government in implementing policies, and not test the law or face punishment. In addition to ordering strict investigations, this notice is issued for public knowledge."

After the authorities established the "Temporary Measures for the Supply of Rice to the Citizens of Beijing and Shanghai," it was stipulated that all rice procurement merchants approved by the Rice Grain Control Committee, rice shops registered in Beijing and Shanghai, and nearby farmers transporting their own harvested rice to the city for sale may apply for rice grain transportation permits. However, the Rice Grain Control Committee may requisition a certain amount of rice for military use and important industries. The main points of the application process for rice grain procurement permits and rice grain transportation permits are excerpted below: Anyone holding a rice grain procurement permit or a rice grain transportation permit must conduct procurement or transportation according to the provisions of the permit. Applicants for rice grain procurement permits must fill out an application form in duplicate. Applicants for rice grain transportation permits must fill out an application form in quadruplicate. Procurement permits and transportation permits are limited to one-time use and must be returned to the issuing Rice Grain Control Committee for cancellation after use. Anyone procuring or transporting rice grain with expired or invalid procurement permits or transportation permits will be punished in accordance with Article 10 of the "Provisional Regulations for the Management of Rice Grain Transportation and Sales in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces."

### Celebrating Allied Naval Day: Lecture Tonight, Organized by Five Groups Including the New United Association

The presidium consists of Wen Lanting, Wu Yunzhai, Chen Binyu, and Feng Jie. The general director of the conference is Ren Yunpeng. Colonel Matsushima, the head of the Fleet Press Department, will give a special lecture. The Japanese Army and Navy bands will perform various pieces. Finally, the Japanese film "Kamuning" will be screened. All speeches will be broadcast live by the Shanghai Radio Station. Local and out-of-town residents can tune in to the conference starting at 7:30 PM. The China Film Company will film the newsreel.

Also, the tickets for the second and third sports fields of the sports meeting held by the News United Association have been sold out. Those from all walks of life who wish to watch the track and field competitions (performed at the racecourse) can prepare a formal letter to the Shanghai News United Association at 160 Da Shanghai Road to request them.

### Inventory of Warehouse Materials to be Reported by Deadline

In order to accurately ascertain the quantity of various material inventories, the First District Office of this city, in addition to handling the registration of daily necessities, has also stipulated that all businesses operating warehouses (including cold storage warehouses) or trust and custody businesses within the district should prepare a detailed list of the names and addresses of the depositors, as well as the names and quantities of all materials deposited or stored and the date of entry, as of the end of business on May 20 of this year, and submit it to Office 701 of the Economic Section of the office at 209 Jiangxi Road by May 31 at the latest. Thereafter, by the 20th of each month, they should prepare a similar detailed list and report it to Office 701 of the Economic Section of the office at the end of the month for verification.

### During Air Defense Training, Pay Attention to Alarms and Implement Evacuation Drills Effectively

The Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters issued a notice on the 24th, stipulating that civil air defense training will be conducted in the Shanghai area on any two days from the 26th to the 31st. Whether the training will be continuous or intermittent will not be announced in advance. Therefore, all citizens of this city should pay attention to alarms at any time during these six days.

Training Content

Regarding the content of the training, after an air raid alarm is issued, ordinary citizens, except for soldiers, should use buildings, etc., to take refuge for about 20 minutes, and air defense personnel should also do the same. Therefore, traffic will be suspended during these 20 minutes. Movie theaters, theaters, and dance halls, as entertainment venues that can accommodate a large number of people, should implement evacuation drills after the alarm is issued and should not continue to operate merely as a formality. Also, when evacuating, pedestrians should obey the command of the respective air defense units and should not act arbitrarily. Secondly, regarding light control, it is divided into three stages: normal control, warning control, and air raid control, and corresponding measures should be taken quickly according to the alarms. This time, it is especially hoped that residents of tall buildings and households with skylights will pay more attention. Also, after a warning alarm is issued, do not go out unless there is an urgent matter. Those who have already gone out should return home as soon as possible. After an air raid alarm is issued, going out is absolutely prohibited except for those with urgent business. The Air Defense Headquarters and other military and political organs will designate areas to conduct large and small training at any time. Therefore, in addition to the air defense units in the designated areas acting accordingly, ordinary pedestrians should also cooperate at any time and should not stand by and watch indifferently. Also, air defense training is not only limited to after the alarm is issued, but each air defense unit should also conduct training separately when the alarm has not been issued, in order to become proficient. In addition, there is also a need for thorough research and training in communication methods when power lines are cut. When an airplane drops a dummy bomb, it should be treated the same as a real bomb and should not be ignored. Finally, after the alarm is issued and lifted, check the equipment to ensure it is complete and make efforts to prevent injuries caused by the training.

### The Development of the War Situation and Our Awareness: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Continental New Report Broadcasts to Japanese Residents

Mr. Osako, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Continental New Report, gave a speech for about 20 minutes from 7:20 PM on the day before yesterday (the 24th) at the Greater Asia Broadcasting Station, titled "The Development of the War Situation and Our Awareness," to the Japanese residents in Central China. The main points of the speech are as follows, explaining the current stage of the decisive battle approaching in the Greater East Asia War, and at the same time expressing the hopes for the 600,000 Japanese residents in the current situation, giving a great sense of inspiration.

December 8, Showa 16 (1941), is a day that will never be forgotten by the Japanese people, and indeed by the one billion people of Greater East Asia, as the glorious Greater East Asia War began on that day. Since that memorable day, more than two years and five months have passed, and the continuous warfare has lasted for 874 days. As for the war situation during that time, as everyone knows, it has been either magnificent or fierce, with both sides exhausting their national strength and launching a life-or-death battle unprecedented in the history of world wars. Looking at it comprehensively or from a global perspective, it is truly a continuous series of decisive battles every day, and it is no exaggeration to say that neither side has relaxed its fighting spirit for even a day.

In this magnificent decisive battle between us and the enemy, truly a decisive battle within decisive battles, we are facing each other with bayonets aimed at the heart, so-called mutually taking each other's lives, as the rise and fall of the nation depends on it, and the decisive battle stage of the decisive battle is imminent, which you all know well. At this critical time in the war situation, looking at the fact that tomorrow is Naval Memorial Day, it is particularly meaningful. We, in this situation, should clearly and deeply imprint in our minds how the Greater East Asia War situation will develop in which direction and what thoughts we should have towards the current enemy, Britain and the United States. In any case, for this war that concerns the fate of our motherland, we should be calm, and our awareness of victory should be as solid as a rock.

Originally, this Greater East Asia War unfolded extremely rapidly at the beginning of the war, due to our side's fierce offensive. Just as the art of war says, "Strike first." Our army and navy skillfully and vigilantly utilized this good opportunity of "strike first." Judging from the facts, in less than a year since the start of the war on December 8, the great war results achieved by our army and navy were that in the East, the American Pacific Fleet was completely wiped out by the fierce attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, and in the West, following the fall of Hong Kong and Singapore, they swept through Malaya and Burma like a whirlwind sweeping away fallen leaves. Furthermore, in the South, they captured the Philippines and took the vast Dutch East Indies archipelago into their grasp. They advanced further and became active in the Solomon Islands area, and for a time their momentum was so great that they even completely controlled Australia's life. At that time, the disappointment and embarrassment of Britain and the United States were almost unbearable to witness.

Rising from Defeat in the Initial Battles

However, the enemy would never just weep and give up. As you all know, the United States has never lost a war against a foreign country since its founding, so the war leaders, centered on President Roosevelt, under the slogan "Remember Pearl Harbor," began to expand their military preparations fiercely in order to think about revenge in the future.

What kind of military expansion did the Americans undertake? First, they expanded their air power, and second, they strengthened their warships and ships. Then, when the operation was possible and the preparations were complete, they launched the so-called counterattack against Japan. The American counterattack began with the Gilbert Islands operation on November 19 last year. Looking back at the enemy's advance, starting with the landing on Gilbert Islands on November 19 last year, to the landing on the Marshall Islands in January of this year, and the landing on the Admiralty Islands in February, and the landing on Hollandia in April, step by step they got closer, and here they were able to consolidate their footing for the decisive battle against Japan.

Increasing Hidden War Potential

If we observe how the enemy will promote the war in the future, the first problem is the Philippines. The enemy's operational steps are to use the gradually advancing footholds as always, on the one hand dispatching mobile units and concentrating fierce attacks on the Philippines, and when they expect to occupy the Philippines, they will carry out large-scale landing operations around Guangdong Province in China, and use this as the largest counterattack base to completely defeat Japan.

As for what Japan is doing now, of course, the Japanese army will not stand by and watch the enemy's counterattack posture. Starting with the bloody battle of Tarawa during the Gilbert Islands operation, Japanese soldiers everywhere launched fierce attacks against the enemy's counterattack, inflicting extremely great damage on the enemy. What should be clearly distinguished here is that the methods of operation are different, and now we are standing on the defensive offensive position. Looking at the overall situation, we are engaging in what Sun Tzu also knew and said: "Warfare is won by offense." Needless to say, the first principle of strategy is offense. So why are we not launching an offensive now? In fact, our defense now is by no means just for defense, but to use the great war results gained in the various battles as a basis, and now take this opportunity to exhaust the strength of 100 million people, tirelessly building a new and resilient war fighting force, in order to obtain the final victory.

In the case of Japan, at first it used force to suppress the enemy, and although the enemy was incapable of being suppressed, they have gradually recovered recently. At this time, we are also preparing to seize the appropriate opportunity to strike down at once the enemy who has once again strengthened their military equipment and improved the war situation.

The Key to Victory in a Decisive Battle Life

In such a critical situation, there are two things that we local residents must keep in mind. First, we must devote more effort to strengthening Japan's war fighting force. The increased production of aircraft, warships, and ships goes without saying, and it is necessary for us to transport them to the Japanese soldiers on the front line, so we must vigorously save and reduce living expenses.

Second, we local residents must work more closely with the Chinese to win the war that determines the fate of the Greater East Asian nations. Now is not the time to say "we must understand the Chinese." Country A and Japan live in the same village and are neighbors. The exchange between the two countries began a thousand or two thousand years ago. During that time, there were also things that happened that caused discord between the two countries, but there were also things that helped each other. So if we associate with sincerity, then understanding can be generated. Especially since we have come to the local area and are bothering China, so we must take the lead in treating the Chinese with sincerity. In this way, the Chinese will surely trust us, and we deeply believe this now.

Our Great Future

In short, in the present critical situation, we deeply believe that the most important tasks of us local residents are, first, to stand up to strengthen the war fighting force, and second, to treat the Chinese with sincerity. When we fully understand this determination, we deeply believe that Japan will have a great future, and the countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can also open up our future together.

### History of the Development of the Japanese Navy

Naval Review at Tempozan

On March 26th of the first year of Meiji (1868), a naval review was held off the coast of Tempozan in Osaka. This marked the true beginning of the history of the Japanese Navy. Shortly after Emperor Meiji ascended the throne, he toured the outskirts of Kyoto, entering the sea from the Aji River by boat for sightseeing.

"The sea is truly a magnificent thing!" This was the word passed around at the time. The wider the sea, the wider the stage for the Japanese Navy to play on. This exclamation of the Emperor held boundless hope for the Japanese Navy.

A total of ten steamships participated in this naval review: "Denryu Maru" (from Hizen Province), "Banri Maru" (from Higo Province), "Chitose Maru" (from Kurume Province), "Sanpo Maru" (from Satsuma Province), "Kayou Maru" (from Choshu Province), and "Bannen Maru" (from Ise Province). Among them, only the "Denryu Maru" had a formal warship construction. As a gunboat of only 800 tons, it served as the flagship, and the condition of the other ships can be imagined. Who would have thought that after seventy-five years, this would become the world's leading navy?

Cuisine on Ships

Furthermore, in the early Meiji period, warships belonged to individual domains and were not yet part of a national navy, resulting in extreme disorder. On the deck of the "Noryo Maru," a ship from Kumamoto, were arranged tatami mats. Officers and sailors alike urinated into the sea from the railings of the gangway. Despite extreme Westernization, the cuisine on board included fermented soybeans and salted radish.

Once, while inspecting the inside of a ship, a salted radish barrel was spotted.

"What is this?"

"Radishes pickled in salt."

"Really? That's good."

To strengthen the Japanese spirit, it was necessary to have unique Japanese cuisine. Therefore, warships were equipped with pickled radishes, fermented soybeans, and other items, a tradition that continues to this day.

During the early stages of the Sino-Japanese War, the author served aboard the flagship that initially landed ahead of the enemy at Wusong. The next day, I was invited to dine by Commander Kiyoshi Hasegawa and thoroughly enjoyed the tofu and fermented soybean soup on the ship, a taste I still haven't forgotten.

First Time Aboard a Warship

On May 23rd of the fifth year of Meiji (1872), Emperor Meiji embarked on the warship "Ryujo" for the first time, departing from Shinagawa, crossing the Seto Inland Sea via Ise, Osaka, and Kobe, and touring from Nagasaki to Satsuma before returning. The Tokugawa shogunate had strongly requested that the Emperor not venture out on tours, as previous emperors had never stepped outside Kyoto. However, the times had changed significantly. On this occasion, Emperor Meiji also donned a military uniform for the first time on tour. This, too, is worthy of special mention. As this set a precedent, Emperor Meiji later wore army uniforms at every naval review. After the Russo-Japanese War, at the request of Naval Minister Yamamoto, a new precedent was set, and naval uniforms were worn at naval reviews.

Domestically Produced Warships

From the beginning of military construction in the Meiji era, the fundamental principle was to manufacture all weapons domestically, and this is where the strength of the Japanese military lies.

The Yokosuka Naval Arsenal had already built its first warship in the eleventh year of Meiji (1878). That was the "Seiki" warship. Emperor Meiji himself attended the launching ceremony. The "Seiki" was a wooden warship with a speed of nine and a half knots and a crew of one hundred and seventy-one. Looking back now, it seems like a cute, toy-like warship. Marshal Yoshika Inoue once served as the captain of this ship. The year after the end of the Satsuma Rebellion, in the eleventh year of Meiji (1878), it undertook its first overseas voyage, passing through European countries such as France and Spain.

During the Russo-Japanese War, after losing the two giant warships, "Yashima" and "Hatsuse", off the coast of Lushun, an Imperial Conference was held, resolving that they had to be replenished in Japan no matter what. Thus, Japan began building steel warships like those of today.

Shipbuilders opposed it, saying: "Because we cannot make steel plates and steel pipes that can withstand high heat." However, "Once a decision has been made by the Imperial Conference, it must be resolutely implemented."

So, they gradually began to build them, and battleships were created. The United States marvelled and said, "Looking at Japanese houses, they are hardly more advanced than nomadic tents. Yet they have built the world's most excellent warships, which is truly incredible."

Therefore, Dr. Hiraga and others are truly the gods of shipbuilding.

Battle of the Yellow Sea

No smoke, no clouds. No wind, no waves...

This is the war song everyone knows from the Battle of the Yellow Sea in the Sino-Japanese War. China possessed the largest warships in the East, the "Dingyuan" and "Zhenyuan," and when it combined the Beiyang, Nanyang, Fujian, and Guangdong fleets to fight us, it was three times the size of our Combined Fleet.

Japan was well aware that our navy was at a great disadvantage, and both the government and the public were deeply worried. First, we made the Chinese navy lose heart off the coast of Haiyu, and then we sank four warships in the Yellow Sea. The "Dingyuan" also suffered significant damage. It was the greatest naval battle since Nelson's Trafalgar.

Previously, the Russian strategist believed in the iron rule that battleships were bound to win, and Ding Ruchang, as a researcher of this, naturally adopted that tactic, but Japan broke it with unique new tactics, and the whole world was amazed. And the naval tactics after this were changed.

During this Battle of the Yellow Sea, it is known that there was a good omen: an eagle landed on the mast of the Takachiho. This eagle was later sent to the Hiroshima headquarters to be raised, and Emperor Meiji showed it great affection.

In the subsequent Battle of Weihaiwei, Ding Ruchang surrendered, and all warships were handed over to Japan. He committed suicide out of loyalty, leaving behind his name even after death. The end of a great general has been recounted for thousands of years.

Mother of Sailors

A sailor was crying on deck. An officer saw him and scolded him: "Base thing! Are you afraid of war? Are you longing for home?"

"No, it's not about those things. Please see." He took out a letter written in a woman's handwriting.

"I heard that you did not participate in the Battle of Haishima, nor in the attack on Weihaiwei. Your mother has no face to see the villagers. She prays to the gods every day that you will participate in the decisive battle soon."

The officer also shed tears for the mother's heart left behind. At that time, those who had not participated in naval battles comforted and encouraged each other with the idea that they lacked martial luck and that the war had only just begun. The strength of the Japanese Navy also lies in this kind of female prayer.

First Time Aboard a Submarine

In the thirty-second year of Meiji (1899), Dr. Holland of the United States built a submarine. "Seeking volunteers to experiment with underwater navigation," was announced to the world. Everyone felt it was dangerous, and no one applied. At that time, a Japanese man suddenly came forward: "Then, I am willing to give it a try." This was Lieutenant Junior Grade Takashi Sasaki of the Navy.

He happened to be stopping in the United States on an overseas voyage, so he took advantage of this opportunity. His experience on this submarine was presented to the authorities, and he requested the Navy Ministry: "I hope Japan will immediately start building submarines."

It was too early, and this suggestion could not be made at this time. Among thousands and thousands of white people, not one applied, which shows our unique spirit. This is the bud of the soul of the special submarines that attacked Pearl Harbor and Sydney.

Battle of Tsushima

Such a magnificent naval battle as the Battle of Tsushima can be called unprecedented and unequalled. The enemy was the Baltic Fleet. It was one of Europe's leading and well-trained fleets, and Kaiser Wilhelm had praised it as "resembling the Russian Emperor's headquarters floating on the sea."

Departing from Libau, it headed for the Straits of Tsushima -- a journey of thousands of miles. It took eight months. Such a great expedition had never been seen before in history. In today's era after the appearance of airplanes and submarines, it is absolutely impossible. From the opponent's perspective, they were truly flawless enemies.

Against this, what was our strategy?

In the Battles of Lushun and the Yellow Sea, we minimized our losses as much as possible while inflicting great damage on the enemy, because the Baltic Fleet was still remaining. In preparation for dealing with them, we had to make an all-or-nothing decisive battle. After this annihilation, there would be no other fleets. Only one ship escaped to Vladivostok. No matter how much damage was sustained, as long as it was all done, we would win this time.

Commander-in-Chief Togo adopted a desperate tactic. "Turning back in front of the enemy" has always been a tactic that is bound to lose and is absolutely avoided, but Admiral Togo resolutely implemented it.

When the enemy saw Togo's ship moving, they were overjoyed and said, "Ah! We have won! We have won -- Togo doesn't understand tactics."

Enemy shells hit the "Mikasa."

But at that critical moment, our fleet turned sideways, and we formed a "T" shape with them. The enemy could not pass, and the entire force of more than thirty enemy ships was wiped out. It was a refreshing victory.

In the Battle of the Yellow Sea during the Sino-Japanese War, the genius of the Japanese Navy, who broke the Lissay tactic and created a new tactic, created another new tactic in the Battle of Tsushima. Europe calls it the "Togo Turn." In the Battle of Jutland, Admiral Jellicoe of the United Kingdom adopted this tactic, sinking two British capital ships. A new record of glory in naval warfare created by Japan.

Therefore, May 27th is not only Japanese Navy Day, but also a naval memorial day for the whole world that will be forever immortalized in military history.

The Detestable Washington Naval Conference

However, the Japanese Navy did not complete its path to becoming the world's leading power smoothly. From another point of view, it was a road full of thorns.

In the nineteenth year of Meiji (1886), the warship "Tsukuba" went missing in the waters off Taiwan. It was an excellent ship ordered by Japan from France, and it held the greatest hope, so the shock of the Japanese government and public was like that of Britain when it lost the "Prince of Wales." The bud of building a great navy was snapped in this way, but "unyielding and untroubled" is the creed of the Japanese Navy. The greater the difficulties, the greater the courage. During the Russo-Japanese War, of the only eight battleships, "Yashima" and "Hatsuse" both sank at one time. At the end of the Meiji period, there was the tragedy of Lieutenant Commander Sakuma, which was a noble sacrifice.

But the most detestable thing was the Washington Naval Conference in the tenth year of Taisho (1921). Britain and the United States jointly plotted to force a ratio of 5:5:3. This was the greatest resentment since the Triple Intervention on the Far Eastern Peninsula. Britain and the United States, under the pretext of reducing the burden on their people due to increased naval expenditures and reducing the factors of war anxiety, used this得意diplomatic means to add to the heavy pressure on Japan.

Admiral Minoru Kato reported to Marshal Togo, saying, "It is truly an unreasonable oppression." The Marshal comforted him, saying, "But Britain and the United States cannot impose restrictions on training no matter what."

Since then, a new light has been discovered. Unprecedented fierce training courses have been put into effect. The seven days of the week, from Sunday to Saturday, have become "Mon-Tue-Wed-Thu-Fri-Sat-Sat." Let us wait and see what the results will be.

The Greater East Asia War

In the Edo period, there was a...

"...the leaf lets the snake dwell in its body, and when it exerts its strength, even a sword cannot match its sharpness."

No sentence is more fitting to describe the appearance of the Greater East Asia War than this.

The four countries of Britain, the United States, China, and the Netherlands jointly formed the ABCD line. The Bible says: "The love of a dove and the wisdom of a serpent." But they are yellow-cheeked snakes without the love of doves.

Japan is a pheasant with no other thought than to sing the praises of the sovereign's prosperity and the virtues of civilization in the spring countryside. The snake wants to eat this pheasant, using insidious means such as breaking commercial treaties, reducing quota systems, and freezing assets, surrounding it circle after circle. The pheasant folds its wings, holds its breath, and allows it to do as it pleases, without any resistance.

But everything has its limits. If the snake does not reflect, it must take the final and complete means.

Rise up in anger, and the snake will be cut into pieces.

Pearl Harbor, the sea off Malaya, Manila, the Aleutian Islands, and even the Solomon Islands.

How to deal with those scattered pieces of snake meat is a problem for Japan in the future, but the leaf must be on guard, and it must not become complacent. (From the Weekly Mainichi)

### The Four-Front Army Organized by the Enemy, America

The four-front army deliberately organized by Roosevelt. Its contents are as follows: In the Chinese mainland, it is the Chongqing troops. The Commander-in-Chief is Chiang Kai-shek, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief and Commander-in-Chief of the US Army stationed in China and India is Stilwell, and the Commander of the Sino-American Mixed Air Force is Chennault. In Southeast Asia, it is the Mountbatten Army. The Commander-in-Chief is Mountbatten, the Commander of the British Fleet in the Indian Ocean is Somerville, and the Supreme Commander of the British and American Air Forces stationed in India is Peirse. In the Southwest Pacific, it is the MacArthur Army. The Commander-in-Chief is MacArthur, the Deputy Commander and Commander of the Ground Forces is Blamey, the Commander of the Air Force is Kenney, and the Commander of the US Seventh Fleet and Commander of the Navy is Kinkaid. In the Pacific, it is the Nimitz Army. The Commander-in-Chief is US Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz, and the Deputy Commander is Dowes.

Regarding the amount of reinforcements for the four-front army, the MacArthur Army accounts for one-tenth to one-thirteenth of the US's total battle lines for supplies, and the Mountbatten Army is similar to the MacArthur Army. The Chongqing Army is on the first level of supplies. As for the Nimitz Army, at the end of last year, Nimitz boasted: "The United States currently has 880 warships, and most of the main fleet is concentrated in the Pacific. The fleet's organization has been changed to a transport-type formation centered on aircraft carriers." Therefore, the Nimitz Army is equal to the entire navy, and its strength is far greater than the other three armies. (Translated from Allied World Weekly, No. 1247)

### Rural Scenery

— Shi Yu

The pink peach blossoms, gently blown by the warm spring breeze, slipped down from the branches and landed on the muddy pond. They resented their own foolishness, regretting that they had left their mother to be trampled on here; when people's heavy footsteps trampled on their delicate bodies, they had cried out for help, groaned in despair, but people did not hear them and still cruelly trampled over them; sometimes they drifted down and landed on the creek, ripples rose on the creek, quickly engulfing them, no matter how sadly they sobbed! Silken willow strands, like a young woman's slender waist, sway gently in the breeze; clusters of white willow catkins, fluttering everywhere with the smiling spring breeze, the sweet fragrance of wheat fills the air, and the drooping wheat ears emit a dazzling yellow color in the sunlight. Lively fish often leap out of the water, raising "splish" and "splash" sounds on the water surface, and water droplets splash everywhere; afterward, the water surface returns to its calmness, and spring has already passed its peak. At this time, a five or six-year-old girl, carrying a bamboo basket on her back; with a sickle in her hand, a round face, dark and bright eyes, a high, straight nose, cherry-like blood-red lips slightly pouting, a thin layer of tears shimmering in her eyes. Her small hands were rubbing her eyes, a pair of dirty little feet, supporting a small body, shuffled on the muddy ground, the muddy ground emitting a faint sigh of relief. Suddenly, a cry of "Xiao Ling!" came from the woods, followed by a very beautiful girl, wearing shiny silk clothes, shouting as she ran, thinking of joking with her, she leaped and bounded over, shaking her shoulder with her hand, panting and saying, "Why are you ignoring me?" But when she saw tears on Xiao Ling's face, she exclaimed in surprise, "Ah! Why are you crying again?" Xiao Ling only mumbled a "Missing!" She used many words to tease her companion to talk, but Xiao Ling never opened her mouth, only cried sadly; later, she was also moved to tears by Xiao Ling, Xiao Ling then sobbed and said, "It's all your fault, you asked me to play at your house, my mother said I didn't cut enough grass, and scolded me, saying I was lazy, calling me a cheap girl, refusing to work all day long, just fooling around with rich young ladies, look, Mom beat my face..." "Wah!" She touched her scars and cried sadly again. "Why doesn't your mom ever like you?" She tilted her face and asked Xiao Ling naively. Xiao Ling cried and said, "Because I'm not her own daughter, so she doesn't like me, my own mother has already died, she is the one my dad married later, she loves my brother, because my brother is her own..." Xiao Ling kept rubbing her eyes, and the intermittent sobbing sound filled the air!

At this moment, everything in the universe seemed to have disappeared, only the sound of two small hearts beating, and the greatest friendship of mankind had tightly bound their hearts together.

### Rebirth

— Rong Ge

Today, settle the old accounts of the past, everything in the past must be discarded, no longer fantasize about beautiful dreams, no longer let sadness occupy the heart, no longer shed the tears of the weak, wave goodbye, stand up tall, starting from today, walk out of the gray swamp, hold on to a healthy heart, and unfold a new page of hope!

### In Memory of a Deceased Friend

— Tang Min

In just two years, I can count quite a few relatives and friends who have become people of the past. What is most painful is that most of them are still very young, they are stubbornly trying to take root in this world, but an irresistible force presses down on them, and they have to abandon their partners in suffering. Think about it: when they breathe their last breath, looking at such a broken world, can they close their eyes peacefully?

Except for a very few who died of illness, the rest died in very strange ways. Every time I hear such terrible news, I can't help but wonder with trepidation: how should I end my life? Then, I hold my head and cry.

Last year, I learned from a letter sent from faraway Liaoyuan that a former classmate had died. Similarly, this was something that could not be believed, he was so young and strong, but the letter clearly stated his tragic news, he drowned in the stream!

The friend who wrote this letter has a delicate writing style, and he described the circumstances of his death in detail with somber words, which reminded me of our half-year life together, and stirred up emotions from my memories, making me...

I used to live with him in the same dormitory, at that time, it was the first time I had left home, and things that I initially thought were not a problem turned out to be problems, and he always helped me to solve those difficulties. Once, I was troubled by the matter of washing clothes: washing them myself, pouring basin after basin of water in the kitchen was really too tiring; asking others to wash them, I often found lice in the clean clothes, what could I do? I don't know why, I smashed the washbasin on the ground and got angry. He smiled and said:

"It's better to wash them in the pool, there's plenty of water and it's very clean!"

From then on, I listened to his words, knelt on one leg on the rocks by the pool, leaned over to wash clothes. Sometimes, he and I were doing the same work, he rubbed soap on the clothes, pounded them with stones, and after a while, he rinsed them clean in the water, and lifted up a piece of clothing and it was washed. I praised him for his skilled technique, but he didn't treat me politely:

"What's there to praise about this?... I've been wandering outside for several years, of course I can handle this kind of thing." Who knew that his words were still echoing in my heart, but he, in a city, in order to handle this matter, slipped on a rock by the pool and fell into the water and drowned!

I remember how reluctant we were when we parted two years ago! My husband had urged me to set out several times, but when we thought about the hardships we had suffered together in life for half a year, we held hands tightly and could not separate.

"I wish you a safe journey!... When you return home, be sure to be affectionate with your mother!"

He was saying these words to me, what else could I say to him besides wishing him good health? I would be treating people's comfort as... a miserable person. I could only keep many words in my heart, expressing my feelings with my eyes.

The coachmen carrying me had already crossed a rice field, and he was still chasing after me, shouting:

"Don't forget me, remember not to forget me!"

I knew the hardships contained in this sentence, he was a lonely person, and he hoped that his friends could have spiritual resonance with him. Indeed, I have never forgotten him, especially the picture of him washing clothes with his lean body, it often appears clearly in my mind!

But he died, he didn't die in a wood, but died in the matter of washing clothes!... He died so accidentally, if there was a "what if", he would still be alive now, stubbornly alive!

The letter also stated that his body was desecrated after his death. Although this friend couldn't bear to describe the tragic state of his coffin being smashed, but when I closed my eyes, the situation seemed very clear. I saw the broken pieces of wood scattered on the ground, several dogs were watching over his naked corpse and gnawing on his flesh, chewing on his bones, and howling triumphantly in the forest, and several other dogs were panting as they rushed over, licking the bloodstains left on the ground, competing with red eyes...

### The Swallows Have Come

— Cheng Huican

The swallows have come!

Again, it is the spring season when birds are singing everywhere, and there are a few black spots floating in the blue, boundless sky. The warm sunshine stirs up a flurry of fluttering dust, gently sprinkling on people's bodies, sometimes scattering into their eyes, so people naturally rub their eyelids and then widen their eyes, looking around for something.

The swallows have come!

Slender wings, carrying light bodies, fly back and forth in the air, flying, flying. The scissor-like long tail retains some of the dusty scent of the south, and the dark black eyeballs show even more the hardships of the journey, but its "chirping" chirping still expresses the joy of freedom and the carefree life!

The swallows have come!

One, two, three,... each pointed beak contains a thin branch, they are working hard to build their camp, cooperating actively with one heart and one mind, not afraid of the wind blowing, not afraid of the rain beating, in such a self-built nest, they live by their own labor. When the osmanthus fragrance fills the air, they will leave without any nostalgia and turn to a vibrant place to pursue, forever pursuing without restraint!

Swallows, oh swallows! I admire your free joy, and even envy your carefree life. Although I am strong enough to support myself, I cannot leave the place I don't want to stay at will. The vibrant energy is only a moment of comfort to me, but I cannot pursue it freely forever. Swallows! I am willing to learn from you and wander with you. Are you willing to take me to the ends of the earth to seek a free life?

The swallows have come! They bring me some encouraging power, and slightly relieve my long-thirsty expectations!

### Green Parting

— Gu Yiqing

Fleeting like the flashes of shooting stars,

Fleeting like the dusks of summer days,

Fleeting like beautiful youth,

Friends! This short gathering of ours;

Is the swallow's yearning for warmth and sunshine,

Is the moth's hope for brightness,

Is the lark's desire to soar into the clouds,

Tomorrow, you will resolutely leave me and go far away!

We were originally floating duckweed in the world——

The breeze made us depend on each other and become intimate,

The gentle waves made us confide our innermost feelings,

But, now the beautiful scenery in the dream will eventually fade away;

In this dim lamplight,

In this sorrowful journey,——

Listen! The biting spring wind is frequently urging us to part!

Here I smell a hint of green fragrance——

Silently wishing my like-minded friend: "Goodbye, take care!"

### "Sister Thirteen" and "Yan Qing and Li Shishi"

— Gu Xin

"Sister Thirteen" is a "North China" product, and "Yan Qing and Li Shishi" is a "Manchukuo Film Association (Man'ei)" product. Both films are adapted from popular novels, but neither achieved satisfactory results.

When making films based on such stories, any kind of critical consciousness is completely out of the question. With heroes, beauties, and talented scholars, producers naturally just want to use these age-old, "well-known and widely recited" narratives to attract a "mass audience" with relatively low levels of knowledge. "Sister Thirteen" even uses Wu Suqiu, a "famous stage actress making her screen debut," as a selling point, focusing the entire film on her alone, showcasing martial arts, singing, and even inserting a fashionable scene of her before a battle scene, completely treating her as a vehicle for the film. Although some "progressive" words were added, they were entirely irrelevant.

As for "Yan Qing and Li Shishi," it seems they couldn't even settle on a theme. The screenwriter, on one hand, wanted to cater to the audience by focusing on the romance between Yan Qing and Li Shishi, while on the other hand, they wanted to shift the focus to Song Jiang's "seeking allegiance"—even after the script had been handed to the director, they (presumably together) were still undecided in their conflicting intentions.

What "Yan Qing and Li Shishi" presents to us is just a mess. The director also seemed overwhelmed by these one hundred and eight heroes, not knowing how to handle them. Fight scenes come and go chaotically, and emotional scenes are just a series of close-ups of Li Shishi's "affectionate glances." Transitions between segments (for example, between Song Jiang's return to Liangshan from Tokyo and Yan Qing's second visit to Tokyo) lack coherence. The audience's emotions are not captured at all.

In terms of technique, the director of "Sister Thirteen" is somewhat clever. The transitions from reality to fantasy, the symbolic representation of the passage of time, and other techniques are all decent, though not particularly outstanding. Some of the quiet scenes are also beautiful. But that is all he achieves. Furthermore, the portrayal of the characters and the coordination of sound and image are simply like a clash between Peking Opera and silent films, reeking of stale, outdated air.

The acting in both films is equally terrible. Even the personalities of the main characters are only vaguely outlined. Expressions are either stiff or superficial: the skin moves, but the flesh doesn't. The dialogue and editing in "Sister Thirteen" are even more cloying, still unable to shake off the outdated style of butterfly opera. Some actors in "Yan Qing and Li Shishi" seem to be imitating the strengths of Shanghai's Mingxing Film Company, which is, of course, good, but if they only imitate the form, then it's even worse.

### Tung Wah and South China United Team Success, Wins International Football Championship

This past Monday, the Chinese team and the Italian team met at the Happy Valley Racecourse to compete for the international championship. Before the match, both sides sharpened their swords and prepared their horses, each with the ambition to win. Our Chinese team gathered the elite from both Tung Wah and South China, forming an iron army, united in purpose, and determined to win. On the day of the match, rumors spread that the Tung Wah and South China teams had disagreements over personnel matters. Fans were worried upon hearing this, but in the end, the players from both teams were in high spirits and ready to play. The facts speak louder than words, and the rumors were dispelled. Tens of thousands of spectators cheered and danced, their enthusiasm and anticipation beyond description. After a fierce battle, our team, relying on the efforts of all its members, moved forward relentlessly and finally defeated the Italian team 3-1, triumphantly claiming the glittering international football cup, returning it to our embrace. This marks a glorious page in the history of Shanghai sports and is truly a joyous event.

Offensive and Defensive Coordination

In this match, all the players of the Chinese team were brave and performed exceptionally well, executing both offensive and defensive plays with expertise. The coordination between the front and back lines was seamless, especially the strong and unparalleled central defense line, which was like an impregnable fortress, preventing the enemy from crossing the line. Tan Fuzhen, with his relaxed demeanor and all-around awareness, showed the poise of a Confucian general, having made significant progress since his arrival from the North, a truly capable player. (Fuzhen's playing style is pure and surpasses that of the Italian player Ottorini, and it is no exaggeration to call him the best center-back in Shanghai.) The two full-backs were also intelligent and courageous, demonstrating great stability. About ten minutes after the start of the match, an enemy forward dribbled deep into our territory, only a few yards from the goal, creating a dangerous situation. Everyone thought a goal was inevitable. Fortunately, Zhang Lingen rushed in from the side like a flying general descending from the sky, making a desperate sliding tackle, turning danger into safety. The beautiful form was breathtaking. If this shot had gone in, the opposing team would have taken the lead, drastically changing the situation, and who knows who would have emerged victorious.

The forwards' short passes were delicate and exquisite, indescribably wonderful. The Italian team was known for its strong central defense line, but they were helpless against this. Throughout the match, we controlled the ball for two-thirds of the time. Although the enemy was tenacious, they could not avoid defeat. The national treasure Li Yichen changed his usual style this time, playing with extraordinary effort. Relying on his natural majestic physique, he charged east and west, scoring two goals in difficult positions, establishing an immortal achievement. His second goal was incredibly sharp and heavy, hitting the crossbar perfectly. The Italian goalkeeper, McNetti, stared in disbelief, unsure what to do, truly a masterpiece of Yichen's career. (Someone joked that Yichen's goal, compared to the price of a ticket, was worth twenty-five yuan, accounting for half of it.) Sun Guishun's skillful passing and threading played an indispensable role. The forward Qian Zhineng's success and strong offensive momentum depended on Sun's support from the middle. As time was about to expire, right winger Mao Youliang received a pass from the left, dodged the enemy defense, jumped up, and headed the ball quickly like an arrow. Although McNetti caught it, it made him break out in a cold sweat, and this wonderful header was worth applauding and will remain unforgettable in our minds.

In short, this match was one of the most exciting of the season, and the atmosphere was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. The Chinese team's victory and fulfillment of their wishes were particularly gratifying. Hereby, we extend our blessings to the brave Chinese athletes and hope for an even better performance in the competition against the Tianjin United Team. According to reports, the Tianjin United Team is similar to the Tung Wah and South China united team. Their goalkeeper is skilled, and their offensive strategy relies on short passes and exploiting the wings, but they rarely demonstrate any creativity. However, their central defense line is very strong. It is hoped that the Shanghai Football Association can accommodate them, so as to overcome the enemy. Then it would be fortunate indeed! (Mei Jie)

### Physical Education Performance at Guoqiang Elementary School - Programs Rich in Educational Significance

Children are the foundation of the nation, and children's education is the work of consolidating that foundation. Children are naturally active, and giving them proper education through wholesome games makes the effect even greater.

Urban children lack natural environments and spend their days studying, stifling their innate vitality. In Shanghai, apart from one or two parks for children to play in, there are very few other places for recreation, and even theaters for entertainment have recently become inaccessible. Guoqiang Elementary School on Datong Road held a physical education performance the day before yesterday (the 21st) to promote children's games and relieve their boredom, inviting parents and elementary school students from the city to enter with their school badges. Upon hearing the news, our reporter went to visit.

At the school, the reporter, greeted by polite elementary school students, entered the crowded field, which was decorated simply and solemnly. From the loudspeaker, a crisp Mandarin voice announced that the program was about to begin.

The program consisted of forty-nine items, including "Relying on Each Other" and "Sign Language" and "First Aid Practice", all of which had educational significance. A few of these items are briefly described below.

Relying on Each Other Helps Yourself and Others

This involved a blind person (blindfolded) supporting a lame person, reaching their common goal by listening to the lame person's guidance. Along the way, they helped each other and lifted obstacles. This tells us that mutual assistance is humanity's duty, and that people with disabilities can also achieve success through mutual cooperation. However, on the road to success, one must always be careful to remove obstacles.

First Aid Practice is Exceptionally Quick

This is common knowledge that everyone should know. The game divides people into groups of four, one of whom is assumed to be injured. At the sound of the command, six shadows are seen flying forward like arrows. In a moment, the injured person is carried, completely bandaged, and safely reaches the destination. Their agility is such that even nurses would be amazed.

Strong Chain, Everyone Works Hard

This program is a tug-of-war, fully demonstrating collective strength, with everyone united. All the power is focused on one rope, and the emotions of the crowd in the field shrink and expand with the movement of the rope.

Reluctantly Leaving the Polo Match

Polo is an interesting and novel game. Each team has four groups, each group having four people, one of whom is a jockey, and three who act as the horse. The rules and field are similar to lacrosse. Two groups are defense, and two groups are offense, passing and competing for the ball. The play is organized and orderly, with clear advances and retreats. The excitement is the same as basketball, but with a special "wow" factor. As it was getting late, the reporter reluctantly left during the exciting polo match performance.

The above is a fragment of the performance that is specially introduced. It is hoped that teachers who are enthusiastic about children's education and parents who love their children will promote it more. (Skinny Reporter)

### Easy Fitness Training Method (7)

— Written by Tom, Translated by I-De

Exercise Four

Stand upright between two desks or two chairs, or in front of a high-backed chair. Bend your body forward, placing your hands on the armrests and gripping them tightly. Step back a few steps until your toes are on the ground. Raise your head so that your entire body, from head to toe, is in a straight line. Slowly lower your body between the two desks, or two chairs, or two armrests, as low as your arms can support, and no lower.

To return to the original position, slowly straighten your arms and lift your body, with the center of gravity on your arms. When your arms are straightened, your body should not be bent.

This exercise is best for training the triceps.

Shoulders and Chest: Stand in front of the chair; hold the armrests with both hands; move your feet back; bend and lift your body (three times).

Note: To maintain the correct posture for this exercise, it is important not to be startled. Practice in groups, from three to five times; individual practice, from ten to fifteen times.

31. Neck Muscles

Special exercises for the neck muscles have been detailed previously. The exercises to make the neck joints flexible also activate the neck muscles at the same time, so it is not necessary to repeat them.

32. Waist, Ribs, and Back

Muscles of the Abdomen

Heart - Stomach - Liver: To keep the body's vital organs - heart, stomach, and liver, especially the stomach - in the correct position to maintain health, special attention must be paid to the muscles around each organ.
