### Preface to the Japanese Version of "Japan's Reflection and China's Reform"

— Yoshida Toyosuke

Many Japanese residing in China have witnessed and heard about the lives of Asian peoples. Assuming this morality only exists within the lives of the Japanese people, manifesting as a new system, while the old system remains unchanged in the lives of the people of allied China, then hoping that the people of both countries will be of one heart and mind, fighting shoulder to shoulder for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, is like trying to climb a tree to catch a fish. As Japan sees it, China's affairs can no longer be considered unrelated matters of another country, just as Japan's affairs are not those of another country to China.

The saying "China is China, Japan is Japan" is, of course, something that Japanese people with strong solipsistic tendencies should carefully consider. However, superficially, it is filled with an atmosphere of narrow-minded nationalism. As it stands, it seems to assume that the living problems of the Chinese people are internal Chinese matters and have nothing to do with Japan. This goes against the purpose of the new policy, and therefore Japan only focuses on its wartime system, only focusing on the "unity of one hundred million compatriots." Naturally, today's war requires the mobilization of the total power of the nation; however, the Greater East Asia War cannot succeed with Japan's total mobilization alone. The Greater East Asia War can only succeed when all Asian peoples participate with their total power. If anyone denies this, they are taking the Greater East Asia War too lightly. The United States has vassal states in North and South America, and Britain has many overseas territories. Chongqing occupies most of China's land. Each is mobilizing all resources and manpower to deal with Japan. Japan dares to fight bravely alone because it is supported by a spiritual power that transcends ordinary war science. This spiritual backing is the moral character of this war. If Japan rises up to fight for the independence of Asia, then other Asian peoples will also rise up to fight for the independence of Asia--if there is no such conviction and one believes this war can be won, then that person's ability to think is probably highly questionable.

In the past four or five years, Japan has continuously criticized Anglo-American ways of thinking. Thus, in opposition to Anglo-American ways of thinking, an Eastern way of thinking has been reactively established, namely, opposing the "logical method" and mistakenly establishing the "intuitive method." Because the Eastern way of thinking values experience and its form of expression is symbolic, people unknowingly develop a habit of looking down on the logic of thought principles. However, one cannot think without logic. So-called intuition is a leap in thought that occurs when thought develops logically to its extreme. Intuition is the perception when thought leaps in the logical stage and stands at a higher level. Standing in this position, one will recognize the previous logical experience. Therefore, intuition does not negate logic; rather, it is the culmination of logic. However, Japan says that future humans will consider "guts" more important than the brain. In order to create "guts," one needs to exert force in the *dantian* (丹田), and practice the physiological thinking method of preparing for action (?). "Guts" is the result of various logical thoughts and pursuits, feeling that there is no other way, that it must be decided in this way. The so-called "boldly going forward" is the result of logically thinking about all possible events that may occur in one's usual surroundings. Even if an unexpected event occurs, one will find a way to deal with it intuitively. Those who do not usually rack their brains and practice logical thinking, yet easily achieve "confidence," are people who mistake "delusion" for "intuition." Such people may be rich in action, but their actions are like "Don Quixote" charging at a windmill.

I firmly believe that Japan boldly launched the Greater East Asia War as a result of various theoretical considerations, and there was no other way. No matter how serious and pressing the situation of the Greater East Asia War is, those who believe that there is no other way but to launch it will not waver. If the Japanese people's belief in the future of the war wavers even slightly, it is because they have not thoroughly pursued logical thinking and are vainly satisfied with the "delusion" of "confidence." So, what is it that forced Japan to launch the Greater East Asia War? On this point, let us briefly explain the situation of various countries on the eve of the World War.

In 1917, the loans that the Allied Powers borrowed from American bankers amounted to as much as 1.5 billion gold dollars. At that time, the situation on the Allied side was not good. If the Allied Powers succumbed to Germany, then naturally the American loans would not return to the hands of American bankers. This would be a crisis for American bankers, especially the Morgan financial group, and also a common crisis for American financial capitalists. Due to the First European War, the American shipbuilding industry, machinery industry, military industry, and other industries have made rapid progress. Americans never wanted the war to end in the short term, causing their prosperity to fall into a deep abyss. Therefore, with the Morgan financial group as the vanguard, they demanded that President Wilson bring the United States into the war. This was the beginning of the United States' quest for world leadership. As a result, when the war was declared over due to Germany's defeat, the difficulties they encountered were even more serious than during the war. The question was how to maintain the American production mechanism that had developed during the war. American financial capitalists solved this problem by adopting the Dawes Plan of 1924. For example, the United States lent part of its capital to Germany and forced Germany to buy American goods, that is, creating "artificial" purchasing power, attempting to maintain American prosperity. The United States also copied this method and applied it to other European countries. Therefore, post-war American capitalism was temporarily blessed and enjoyed high prosperity. Thus, the United States believed that capitalism could prosper forever, so it named it "Eternal Prosperity." However, the "Eternal Prosperity" of the United States naturally had a certain limit, a point that anyone with common sense had long known. In other words, as long as a world mechanism where countries had to buy American goods--a world mechanism dominated by American financial capital--existed, it would prosper. This world mechanism actually only existed for five years, until 1929. At that time, German and other European capitalism, which had been revived by American loans, improved its unprecedentedly huge production capacity. These countries not only no longer needed to buy American goods, but also had to export their own products to all parts of the world. Therefore, what inevitably occurred was global overproduction. As a result, the "Eternal Prosperity" of the United States suddenly declared its demise, but what took its place was a worldwide depression. Although the depression era lasted for four years of destructive blows until 1933, it did not restore formal prosperity in the following years. At that time, the total number of unemployed people in the world was said to be 30 to 50 million, that is, even in the United States alone, the number of unemployed people reached as many as seven or eight million.

Dealing with this unemployment problem and how American capitalism would regain control of the world were the second propositions that American financial capitalists gave to the Washington government. Roosevelt's New Deal was born to solve this problem. The main points of the New Deal are as follows: 1. Absolutely maintain the high standard of living of American workers (this is necessary to make the "worker aristocracy" support the foreign policy of the American government and maintain the internal market of the United States). 2. Guarantee the lives of as many as 7 million unemployed people with a national subsidy system (this is necessary to maintain the political leadership of the financial capitalists who are in flux). 3. In order to implement the above two major policies, create a huge national consumption industry, and the huge funds required are supplemented by deficit public bonds.

This means that the government uses the policy of "plundering the rich to help the poor" to gain the support of workers on the one hand, and on the other hand, the government frequently uses huge national budgets to squander money to protect the interests of capitalists. The United States uses this policy of unlimitedly squandering money to try to save the day and maintain artificial prosperity. Of course, in order to maintain the huge productive capacity of the United States, it is necessary to establish a huge consumer industry. And war is the most needed consumer industry for materials, and for the world's most powerful American productive capacity, naturally, the world war is the only largest-scale consumer industry. Therefore, countries outside the United States face two dangers due to the above-mentioned inevitable requirements of American financial capital. The first danger is to completely succumb to the American financial capitalists. Any product that competes with American products must stop manufacturing. Whether they are willing or not, they must import American goods and must export raw materials according to their requirements. This is nothing more than completely becoming a slave to American financial capital. The most obvious example is the "independent and free" democratic country of Mexico. Let me give an interesting example to illustrate the situation in that country. (The following turns to page four.)

### The Entire Jinwu Road is Completed; Grand Inauguration Ceremony Held; Ticket Sales and Passenger Service Have Already Started on the 28th

Central News Agency Report - The Jinhua-Wuyi Railway newly built by the Central China Railway Co., Ltd. has great significance on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line. Since construction started in the spring of last year, it has gathered the manpower of millions and relied on the unified cooperation of the military, police, and civilians. In just eleven months, it was fully completed in the middle of this month. In order to celebrate the completion of the Jinwu Railway and to thank the assistance and guidance of China and Japan, the China Railway Company held a grand inauguration ceremony in Wuyi on the 26th of this month and invited officials from relevant authorities in China and Japan and guests from all parties to participate in the grand ceremony. The situation was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. The details are recorded as follows:

Grand Occasion of the Inauguration Ceremony

The inauguration ceremony of the Jinhua-Wuyi section was held on the 26th of this month in the square of Wuyi Station. The Chinese officials who attended included Chen Chunpu, Minister of Construction of the National Government, representing Wu Wenwei, Director of the Road Administration; Chuan Shishuo, Governor of Zhejiang Province, representing Liu Chuanliang, Commissioner of the Second District Administrative Inspectorate; and the magistrates of Shushan, Yiwu, Zhuji, Jinhua, and Wuyi.

At this point, the Jinwu inauguration ceremony was completed. It is learned that the official opening of the Jinhua-Wuyi section has already started selling tickets on the 28th, and the people between Jinhua and Wuyi will undoubtedly benefit from it in terms of transportation.

Shanghai Press Corps Participates

The Central News Agency's Shanghai Sino-Japanese press corps was invited by the Central China Railway Co., Ltd. to participate in the Jinwu inauguration ceremony and took the opportunity to visit eastern Zhejiang. The group of nine people departed from Shanghai on the morning of the 24th of this month, lasting five days.

Central News Agency Report - Wu Wenwei, Director of the Road Administration of the Ministry of Construction, told a Central News Agency reporter that the completion of the Jinwu Railway during the war period is of great significance. Its construction also used local materials. This not only promotes domestic materials, but also prevents money from flowing out, which is admirable.

### Ministry of Interior Establishes Narcotics Investigation Department

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - In order to implement the Central Government's policy of eliminating narcotics, Minister Mei of the Ministry of Interior specially established the Narcotics Investigation Department in the Ministry of Interior, specializing in the investigation of opium addicts.

### Six Items Including Guangdong Sugar Allowed to Resume Export

Guangzhou, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Guangdong Provincial Economic Bureau previously prohibited the export of thirteen items, including rice.

After careful consideration of the situation, it was decided that sugar, beans, flour, matches, cotton, and cotton cloth will be allowed to resume export from April 26. The remaining items such as grain, crude oil, raw kernels, and gold are still temporarily prohibited from being transferred.

### Fierce Japanese Assault on Palel: Enemy Begins Full Retreat; Imphal Also Nears Fall

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 29th – Enemy forces at the strategic choke point of Palel within the Imphal Basin have been under relentless attack by Japanese-Indian allied forces for days and are now unable to withstand the pressure. They have begun a full retreat. The second line of key strongholds on the Palel highway, including Jaj Bam and Shenam, have already been lost. The main force of the enemy's 23rd Division at Palel, numbering about 12,000, fearing encirclement by Japanese forces, abandoned their plan to defend Palel to the death on the evening of the 25th and at dawn on the 26th. They now intend to establish a final defense line at Heights 4562, leaving only a small force in the first line of trenches at Geljaga to attempt to slow the fierce Japanese-Indian allied advance. The main force of the enemy's 20th Division at Palel began retreating towards Wakching, 20 kilometers north of Palel and 25 kilometers southeast of Imphal, on the 26th. The main force of a certain Japanese army group is relentlessly attacking the crumbling enemy forces along the Palel highway and in the Yakuma River valley, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat. Part of the force has already broken through into Kunuda, 7 kilometers north of Palel, and another powerful elite unit has breached the remaining enemy defenses and is continuing its advance towards a location very close to Imphal. The enemy is in chaos.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th – According to dispatches from the Indian front, Japanese forces attacking Imphal have been steadily approaching the core of the enemy's defenses since the start of the general offensive. At the same time, the advancing strike force has destroyed the large reservoir 20 kilometers northwest of Imphal, causing great panic among the enemy. Furthermore, the Palel fortress, the most heavily defended strongpoint in the basin located at the eastern entrance, has been abandoned after repeated Japanese assaults, and a general retreat has begun as of the 26th. On the Bishenpur front in the southwest of the basin, the battle situation is also rapidly progressing in favor of the Japanese. The Japanese forces' campaign to capture the various fortresses around Imphal in the past twenty days has been steadily progressing. Moreover, thanks to the cooperation of the air force, the campaign against the enemy's aerial supply lines has been extremely effective. The fall of Imphal is now imminent.

### Japan and Manchukuo to Implement Entry-Exit Tax Exemptions Next Month to Promote Smooth Flow of Goods

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th – Japan and Manchukuo, in order to promote the smooth flow of goods and to achieve a high degree of development in the overall economic strength of both countries, have decided to abolish tariffs between the two countries. At the same time, they have decided to thoroughly simplify the procedures for the exchange of goods, passengers, and funds between the two countries. As a result of negotiations between the governments of both countries, consensus has been reached, and it has been decided to implement this starting on the first of next month. At 3:00 PM on the 29th, the Japanese Information Bureau issued the following statement: As a result of consultations between Japan and Manchukuo, the following measures have been decided upon in order to further facilitate wartime transportation and increase combat strength: Japan will exempt import duties on products from Manchukuo and the Kwantung Leased Territory during the Greater East Asia War. Manchukuo will similarly exempt import duties on products from Japan and the Kwantung Leased Territory. At the same time, Japan will also exempt export duties on products destined for Manchuria. Customs procedures for goods traded between Japan and Manchukuo will be simplified as much as possible, based on the principle of preventing illegal exports and relying on documentary review. Restrictions on luggage carried by passengers between Japan and Manchukuo will be simplified as much as possible, except in cases involving suspicion of violating public order, hindering security, espionage, or economic controls. Matters concerning exchange management and trade regulations between Japan and Manchukuo will be simplified as much as possible. Procedures for passenger handling will also be simplified. These measures will be implemented independently by Japan and Manchukuo, starting on May 1st.

### Gandhi Recovering

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 29th – A dispatch from Bombay states: The Bombay Provincial Government announced yesterday that Gandhi has recovered his health after suffering from a fever a few days ago.

### U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox Dies; Under Secretary to Act as Head

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 29th – Reuter reports: Washington officials announced that U.S. Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox died suddenly yesterday at the age of 70. Under Secretary James Forrestal (age 48) is the most likely candidate to succeed him, but Wendell Willkie has also been mentioned. Forrestal will continue to serve as acting secretary until President Roosevelt formally appoints a new Navy Secretary.

### Germany Actively Prepares for Future Battles; Biscay Bay Defenses Consolidated

Central News Agency, Berlin, 29th – The German News Agency reports: Both sides are intensifying their offensive activities on the Eastern Front, while on the Western Front, German forces are increasing their activity at various points ahead of the planned Anglo-American offensive. This is the current situation.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 29th – The German News Agency reports: A unit of German engineers has constructed a formidable obstacle zone, covering a depth of approximately twenty kilometers in the Bay of Biscay area within eight days. Within this short period, the engineers have laid over 200,000 landmines of various types and constructed over 100 kilometers of barbed wire obstacles, making the area a death trap for both men and tanks.

Imminent Attack on the Balkans

Central News Agency, Zurich, 29th – Reuter reports: Well-informed sources here report that an Allied attack on the Balkans is imminent. It is reported that large Anglo-American forces are concentrated in the Near East, and Allied Mediterranean fleets are frequently traveling off the Greek coast. It is believed that the Allied forces' attack on the Balkans is intended to aid the guerrillas under General Tito within Yugoslavia.

### Japan's Military Strength is Solid; Confidence in Victory; Minister Matsushima Speaks in Beijing

(Continued from yesterday) In order to break through Japan's defensive iron ring in the South Pacific islands, the enemy has suffered repeated losses. Recently, the enemy seems to be imitating Germany's old tactics of attacking Poland by mobilizing a large number of aircraft to assist in the forward areas.

As previously mentioned, the enemy's strategic objective is to use these islands as a bridge to the Chinese mainland. Therefore, they are doing their utmost to obstruct the consolidation of Japanese military strength and are deploying real troops wherever there are resources. At the same time, in parallel with this strategy, they have deployed more than fifty submarines in the Japanese inner lines to conduct a naval transportation blockade operation. However, due to Japan's strong defenses, the enemy's attempt ultimately failed.

Japanese Army Preemptive Strike

The achievements of the Japanese Army in the India-Burma region have dealt a severe blow to the enemy, not only hindering the construction of the Ledo Road but also forcing the relocation of the Allied Southeast Asia Command to the mountains of Ceylon. In the future, the enemy may launch a flank attack on Japanese forces from the Indian Ocean. If this is indeed the case, it should be noted that not only are the climatic conditions unsuitable today, but also the necessary large fleet is unlikely to be formed before the Second Front is established. Recently, the enemy conducted an air raid on Sabang Island in Sumatra, but this was merely a reconnaissance and diversionary tactic. The enemy is currently promoting the idea of uniting the defeated fleets of Britain, America, the Netherlands, Australia, and even Italy to participate in this operation.

The enemy, accustomed to fabricating propaganda, is using extremely clumsy tactics this time. It is not worth laughing at. "There are no great generals in Shu; Liao Hua acts as the vanguard." Even the Italian Badoglio regime is being dragged out to fight for them, which is truly pitiful. They cannot even fight for their own country with their limited strength, which is deeply lamentable. Secondly, attention must be paid to the activities of the enemy's air force on the Chinese mainland. Today, the Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force are constantly taking preemptive action to inflict severe blows on the enemy. The Japanese Army, which crossed the Himalayas from India, has cut off the enemy's supply lines, and the war in that area is gradually unfolding favorably. The enemy's ultimate goals are to carry out air raids on the Japanese mainland and to disrupt transportation in the south. However, Japan will, at the hands of the Japanese military, annihilate the arrogant enemy one by one. This is entirely not a problem. At the same time, the civilian population is working hard to consolidate the air defense system, so there is no need to worry about enemy air raids. The air defense tasks being carried out in various places are currently very active. The Anglo-American forces are attempting to concentrate the power of their army, navy, and air force in Chongqing to deal with Japan. As this Greater East Asia War enters its final stage, we must embrace the conviction of certain victory and crush the Anglo-American ambition to control the Chinese mainland. We must thoroughly destroy it.

Striving for Final Victory

U.S. military commentator Lieutenant Colonel Cagana once elucidated on America's offensive operations as follows:

"The United States should have invaded China during the Manchurian Incident. If so, China, in order to protect Manchurian territory, would have had to devote all its efforts to building aircraft factories and military airfields throughout China and East Asia as bases on the Chinese mainland, in order to accumulate the raw materials and resources necessary for strategic purposes. As a result, the United States would have had at least 300,000 troops stationed in China."

From this, it can be seen where America's true intentions lie. It is fundamentally different from Japan's just cooperation today. Therefore, Chongqing should give it deep consideration. Today, Japan's operations are based on the fundamental concept of striving for the final victory in the Greater East Asia War and preventing Anglo-American aggression against China, so that China's land and people can be spared from the ravages of war. This is also the ideal of the Greater East Asia Declaration.

On the other hand, regarding the situation in Europe, the establishment of the Anglo-American Second Front has become the top priority. Therefore, general speculation is that the Anglo-Americans may attempt this sometime in May. We deeply respect the indomitable spirit of the Germans. By resisting the establishment of the enemy's Second Front, the Germans are demonstrating their true strength and are embarking on a great and glorious enterprise for the construction of a new Europe.

The Greater East Asia War, running parallel to the European War, is now gradually entering a critical stage. By combining the full strength of China and Japan to strike down the stubborn enemy, we can simultaneously achieve the great task of destroying Britain and America in both the East and the West.

Japan's winning posture has become increasingly solid. In the future, it will increasingly demonstrate the wonders of its strategy. However, in order to maximize the effectiveness of this strategy, we must have immense strength in both material and spiritual terms. This is the unwavering belief and resolute action of the people in the rear, the so-called economic warfare and ideological warfare, which are the only ways for those in the rear to support the soldiers on the front lines. The continuation of three thousand years of glorious history in East Asia and the glorious construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere – these two heavy responsibilities rest on our shoulders. It is our sincere hope that in this decisive autumn, we will strive for victory with the determination to serve the state unto death. (The End)

### Germany's Lightning Measures Succeed in the Balkans

The center of gravity of the Eastern Front has shifted from Ukraine to the Balkans. The Soviet First Ukrainian Front, under Marshal Zhukov, aims to break through the Carpathian Mountains via Chernivtsi; the Second Ukrainian Front, under Marshal Konev, aims for Iasi, penetrating Romania; and the Third Ukrainian Front, under General Malinovsky, is advancing from Mykolaiv towards Odessa. The Red Army's future strategic locations are: first, to advance southwest from Romania, reach the Danube, and attempt to sweep across the Danube Plain; second, to concentrate its main force to attack central and southern Poland. In short, the Red Army will continue all offensive operations to the extent of its power to disperse the German defensive lines.

Strengthening Southeast European Fortresses

Germany, facing the Balkan crisis, has already moved into Hungary, and at the same time, is actively seeking to maintain the security of Romania and Bulgaria, devoting all its efforts to strengthening the first line of Southeast European fortresses. The general headquarters declared that this maneuver was performed to help the Badoglio regime. So far, Germany's lightning measures have been successful, and it has invisibly prevented the internal political turmoil that the Anglo-Americans hoped for.

In Hungary, a new cabinet led by former ambassador to Germany, Döme Sztójay, has replaced the Kállay cabinet, secretly carrying out a purge of the country with the Arrow Cross Party's Imrédy faction in the background. Chief of Staff Kuden Tayich entered and served as Minister of the Army, clarifying that the cooperation of the Hungarian military with Germany would not change.

As for Romania, it has already sacrificed hundreds of thousands of lives in three years of war against the Soviet Union. Now, under the threat of the Soviet Union, the country's leaders, such as General Antonescu, are not considering peace issues, and they are paying special attention to the security of Romania, especially because of the Ploiești oil fields. If the Soviet army continues to advance further into Romanian territory in the future, and the current government is unable to control the country, the Iron Guard will come forward to maintain order. The leaders of the peasant party, Maniu, and the volunteer party, Iuliu Maniu, whom the Anglo-Americans had hoped to use, currently have no political power and have no room for anti-government activity.

Crisis in Bulgaria's Internal Affairs

The guiding force in the current Bulgarian government is the regency government organized by Prince Kirill and former Prime Minister Filov after the collapse of Boris V. Because they are fellow Slavic peoples, the influence of the Soviet Union is quite deep in the folk, so they did not participate in the war against the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is also secretly trying to encourage pro-Soviet factions in the country to become active, and ordered former Third International Secretary-General Georgi Dimitrov (a Bulgarian) to sneak in. Germany attaches particular importance to Bulgaria, and does not neglect to be vigilant, for this reason.

In short, if there is any weakening phenomenon in the aforementioned three Balkan countries of the first line of Southeast European fortresses, it will threaten Germany's lifeline. Therefore, the measures taken to strengthen the security of the three countries earlier were quite timely. The German army, with the natural barrier of the Carpathian Mountains as its background, if it can stop the Soviet army's attack on the lines of Galați, Iasi, Chernivtsi, and Lviv, then Southeast Europe, politically, can be even more stable.

Yesterday was the third Emperor's Birthday celebration for Allied nation Japan since the Greater East Asia War. Japanese residents in this city displayed flags in celebration. At 10:50 AM, the Koa Hokokukai held a grand celebration ceremony at Hongkou Park. Japanese residents of the city gradually arrived to attend. At the time, they all faced the Imperial Palace to celebrate His Majesty's birthday and wish the Imperial Family prosperity. Then, they sang the national anthem, followed by Consul General Yano respectfully reading the Imperial Rescript and the Koa Hokokukai President reading congratulatory remarks. Finally, the entire group sang the Emperor's Birthday Commemorative Song, and Chairman Yasui of the Civilian Council led a triple banzai cheer, bringing the grand celebration ceremony to a close.

Aircraft Naming Ceremony

Japanese organizations and shops in this city, in order to express their sincere patriotism, donated aircraft to the Army and Navy authorities. The aircraft dedication and naming ceremony was held yesterday afternoon at Hongkou Park. Lieutenant General Nagatsu of the Army, Admiral Kondo of the Navy, Minister Usa, Consul General Yano, Commander Gojo of the Army Minister's representative unit, and Commander Kondo of the Navy Minister's representative China Fleet Command entered the venue with their staff. Everyone stood at attention and sang the Japanese national anthem, opening the solemn and grand ceremony. At the front of the venue were the fifty-six donated aircraft. On the right side were the seats for the Army and Navy ministers, followed by the Army and Navy generals and the band. In front were the representatives of the aircraft donors: Mr. Kuroda Keitaro, President of Shanghai Textile Company, Mr. Kobayashi Mamoru, President of China Central Silk Company, and twenty-two representatives from Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and other major trading companies and Japanese organizations in Shanghai. In addition, there were Consul General Yano, Civilian Leader Watanabe, local government and civilian representatives, general guests, and students from various schools. At the beginning of the ceremony, a purification rite, invocation of the gods, and offerings were performed. Then, Chief Priest Tsuruta Yasuyoshi of the Shanghai Shrine reverently read the congratulatory address. The representatives of the Army and Navy ministers and the representatives of the donors named the aircraft and offered tamagushi, with thunderous applause filling the venue. Pilots in flight suits stood respectfully in front of the aircraft, receiving bouquets of flowers and amulets from young girls. The flower-presenting girls, Fujii Fukuko, Shimoda Miyako, Kadota Yoshiko, and Torii Yodoko, recited their words of blessing: "May these flowers and amulets protect your beloved aircraft on its sortie, and may it return victorious." The three thousand attendees at the ceremony clapped their hands in unison, praying for lasting military fortune. Then, as the naval band played music and scattering confetti, everyone stood up together, the spirits rose, and the Army and Navy ministers presented letters of appreciation to the donors. Mr. Kuroda Keitaro, President of Shanghai Textile Company, and twelve others represented the Army aircraft donors, while Mr. Kobayashi Mamoru, President of China Central Silk Company, and twenty-two others represented the Navy aircraft donors, and they each received letters of appreciation. At this time, three fighter planes circled overhead, expressing their congratulations, and 200 elementary school students sang the naming song. The naming committee chairman then gave a speech, and Consul General Yano, representing the guests, led the triple banzai cheer, bringing the ceremony to a successful conclusion. Afterward, the Army and Navy military bands held a grand commemorative performance.

### Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Holds Medical Lecture; Invites Japanese Representative from Medical Association to Speak

The Sino-Japanese Cultural Association of this city, taking advantage of the rare opportunity presented by the gathering of representatives from various countries attending the Third Medical Congress in Shanghai, and fulfilling its mission of cultural exchange, specially requested Mr. Hayashi Haruo, the Japanese representative at the event, to deliver a special lecture yesterday (29th) morning at 10:00 AM at the Lyceum Theatre. Over a thousand students from the National Shanghai Medical College, St. John's University Medical School, Tongji Medical School, Southeast Medical College, Aurora University, Shanghai College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and New China Medical College attended. After an introduction by a representative of the association, Mr. Hayashi Haruo delivered a lecture entitled "New Pathways in Medicine," elaborating on the purpose of medicine as striving for the health of humanity, with the nation, ethnicity, and society as the object. It is not simply to treat the diseases of a few people, it is not a narrow definition of health, but a broad definition of health. He went on to say that medicine for the health of the nation and ethnicity should focus on how the entire nation prevents diseases and the spread of infectious diseases. Finally, he touched on the population problem in East Asia, in terms of population productivity, and the future new hopes of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, contrasting it with the fact that in countries such as England and the United States, the population is gradually decreasing despite having relatively good public health facilities, which is a sign of a country declining. Subsequently, Wushan Pharmaceutical Factory presented medical films entitled "Brain Tumors" and "Medical Japan," with excellent content, and the event did not conclude until 12:00 noon. It is reported that the association is scheduled to continue this morning at 10:00 AM, requesting Mr. Miyakawa Yoneji to lecture on the topic "The Special Characteristics of Medical Treatment and Ethnicity," and 武田藥廠 will present "Documentary on Self-Harm Among the Mentally Ill," "X-Ray Diagnosis of Duodenal Ulcers," and 製藥.

### Successful Conclusion of the Medical Congress: Reflections from Representatives of Various Countries

The Third East Asia Medical Congress, aimed at ensuring the health of a billion people in East Asia and promoting medicine in the Greater East Asia region, concluded successfully the day before yesterday. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Mr. Chu Minyi, the President of the Congress, Mr. Lu Runzhi, the Vice-President, and representatives from various countries yesterday (the 29th), who shared their thoughts as follows:

President Chu Minyi

Currently, East Asian countries are at war for justice, a time when material and human resources are insufficient. It is extremely valuable and gratifying to be able to hold such a grand and meaningful international academic conference, bringing together scholars from various Greater East Asian countries to jointly discuss and present new academic achievements and insights. It also demonstrates the spirit of unity and cooperation among the people and governments of East Asia, which is not merely empty talk. The future of East Asia is bright, and this is something to be celebrated. Recalling the East Asia Medical Association, the first congress only included China, Japan, Manchuria, and Vietnam. It gradually expanded, and this congress included seven countries: China, Japan, Manchuria, Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Apart from India, which could not participate due to its struggle for national freedom, I believe that this association will definitely make great contributions in the future.

Vice-President Lu Runzhi

Today, the Third East Asia Medical Congress has successfully concluded. As the chief of the national health administration, I would like to briefly express my thoughts on the congress. The East Asia Medical Association has only a short history of three years, but its development during these three years has been truly astonishing. In terms of the number of participating countries, it has included all independent countries in East Asia within three years. In terms of the content of the presentations, the new theories and technologies presented each year have been increasing and becoming more substantial. In terms of the number of members, it has increased from just over a hundred at the beginning to over a thousand now. These points are sufficient to demonstrate the enthusiasm among scholars from East Asian countries. This phenomenon is not only admirable but also exciting for all of us. The medical standards and public health knowledge in our country have always been backward. The holding of this East Asia Medical Congress in our country has at least provided the current Chinese people with a clear understanding.

Japanese Representative Hayashi Haruo

The Third East Asia Medical Congress was held in China this time. The opening ceremony was held at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association in Nanjing on the first day. Subsequently, lectures were held at Aurora University in Shanghai on the 26th, 27th, and 28th. Attendees included many medical scholars and health administration personnel from China, including President Chu Minyi, as well as dozens of representatives from Japan, over ten from Manchuria, and representatives from Vietnam and Burma (the Thai representative had not yet arrived due to climate conditions), totaling no less than two hundred people, making it an unprecedentedly grand occasion. There were eight special lectures and over a hundred ordinary lectures, all of which were the result of years of investigation and research by various scholars, making significant contributions to academia. A special feature of this congress was that, regarding the six research topics designated at the Second East Asia Medical Congress held in Tokyo last year, committees were established for each area, and they were able to present the results of their investigations and research. Small group committees were convened in the form of roundtable meetings to exchange opinions and learn from each other, with the aim of continuing the discussion next year. As for the details of this conference, a report was given at the venue on the 28th. The research topics included tuberculosis, leprosy, venereal diseases, and acute infectious diseases, all of which are the most relevant issues during wartime.

Philippine Representative

The Third East Asia Medical Congress has successfully concluded. We are honored to have been invited by the National Government of China to participate, and we would like to express our deepest gratitude on behalf of the Republic of the Philippines. As we return to our country, we have beautiful and indelible impressions of your country and its people, especially of the historical city of Nanjing and the major commercial port of Shanghai. We are deeply moved by the assistance of your country's senior officials in the completion of this congress. We hope that in the near future, the Philippines will also have the opportunity to host such an event to reciprocate your country's kindness.

Vietnamese Representative Le Na

I, representing the medical and pharmaceutical circles of Vietnam, have attended this grand event and presented a report on our recent work achievements to the congress, hoping for guidance from experts from friendly countries. I believe that in the current era, every corner of the world is facing the same situation. The implementation of public health and healthcare has become the most important issue. The authorities of the East Asian allied countries, recognizing this need, have held a major medical congress once a year for the past three years, exchanging new medical knowledge to protect human health, which can be said to be the most wise and effective strategy.

Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory Hosts Banquet for Representatives of the East Asia Medical Congress

The Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory in this city hosted a banquet at the Capital Hotel on the opening day of the Third East Asia Medical Congress to entertain all the representatives of the congress. Over two hundred people attended, including Dr. Chu Minyi, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government and the President of this congress, Lu Lanzhi, the Director of the Department of Health, and presidents and members from China, Japan, Manchuria, Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, and other regions, as well as representatives from the German Medical College and the German Medical Association in this city. They gathered together in a joyous atmosphere. Mr. Ling, the Bayer representative for all of Asia, and Mr. Fei Xuande, the General Manager of Bayer China and Manchuria, delivered welcoming speeches. Finally, Dr. Weilbang, the Chairman of the Bayer Scientific Research Department, elaborated on the contributions made by the Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory to maintaining the health of the people of East Asia during the current wartime, and its contributions to the development of German medical affairs around the world. The banquet ended on a happy note.

Economic Commentary

### The Shanghai Stock Market Problem

The Shanghai stock market problem in today's street talk is either "Why are stocks still not recovering?" or "When can we expect stocks to rise?" If we limit the scope of discussion on the Shanghai stock market problem to these two questions, we would be underestimating the future of Chinese stocks.

Regarding the Shanghai stock market problem, Mr. Ogura, the highest economic advisor, said in response to reporters' questions the other day: "The original motive for issuing stocks was to develop industrial and commercial enterprises. It must not be used for speculation, as this greatly affects financial affairs. In the future, those who engage in speculative behavior should be corrected to ensure normal trading." In a few words, he succinctly captured the meaning of stock issuance, the dangers of stock speculation, and the path that stock trading should follow.

How can stock trading be normalized so that it contributes to production and does not flow into speculation? This is a question that is of utmost concern to informed individuals in the economic sphere. We believe that the key to solving this problem, given the current stagnant and sluggish state of the entire securities market, seems to lie in two measures that should be taken: First, the government should adopt various effective methods to maintain the reasonable price of Chinese stocks, even imitating Japan's stock price control measures. Second, the business and securities sectors should deliberately implement securities according to a balanced plan, and even find ways to recover some of the overly rampant securities in circulation. In this way, we believe that the securities market can gradually stabilize, and at the same time, productive capital can be spared from a floating and unstable state, naturally contributing to the production of agriculture and industry. This is what we consider to be the key to the Shanghai stock market problem.

### Gu Baowei's Assets in Shanghai: District Procuratorate Ordered to Seize

Gu Baowei, the former Minister of Food, was found to have abused his power for personal gain and was dismissed from his post and investigated by order of the National Government. He is being severely questioned by the Mountain Special Court in accordance with the law. According to a Central News Agency reporter, the local procuratorate in this city has been ordered by the Special Court to seize Gu's real estate and other properties in Shanghai. Therefore, the Chief Prosecutor of the Procuratorate, Mr. Shen Wenjie, specially appointed prosecutors Wu Lidong and Zhao Zhenyu to formally execute the seizure starting the other day.

### Justice Minister Zhang Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday

Mr. Zhang Yipeng, the Minister of Judicial Administration of the National Government, came to Shanghai on official business and arrived here safely yesterday (the 29th) at 2:30 PM. He traveled in a simple manner with few attendants, and few people knew of his arrival.

### Reader Scholarship News

Responses to Various Suggestions

Since our newspaper's scholarship office solicited opinions from all sectors of society last time, we have received many suggestions. Furthermore, Mr. Shen Youqian, the director of the office, received valuable opinions from school principals or other responsible personnel during his visits to various schools. A summary of simple responses is as follows:

Regarding the standards for selecting students: There is no question that emphasis should be placed on conduct and service spirit. The office is currently studying methods to make the selection process more thorough in the next round. Some opinions believe that if a student's family situation is truly impoverished, academic performance should not be overemphasized. This point is also insightful. However, a certain standard in terms of academic performance is also essential, especially for students in higher-level schools. Not only must they be impoverished, but they must also be excellent to be eligible for assistance. Since education is not yet universal, outstanding individuals should be given priority. However, excellence is of course not only expressed in grades. In the future, applicants who have special expertise and can provide evidence will be given special consideration.

Regarding application procedures and screening methods: It has already been considered that application forms should be issued by the schools to save students' energy and time, and that the qualifications of applicants should first be reviewed by the schools and then screened by the office to ensure rigorous selection, and the next round will be implemented accordingly. Someone also mentioned that eligibility should not be approved through special considerations based on introductions from celebrities. If the introducer can provide reliable documentation regarding the applicant's family situation or academic performance, it can be used as a reference. However, merely speaking based on personal connections will of course have no effect.

Regarding contacting schools and urging students: Visiting schools, interviewing principals, and convening student talks are already in progress. Please pay attention to those who are enthusiastic. We hope that people from all walks of life will continue to provide guidance in the future.

Assistance Received Yesterday

Yesterday, we received a generous donation of 50,000 yuan from Mr. Uchiyama Kanzo. Mr. Uchiyama is the owner of the Uchiyama Bookstore at the end of North Sichuan Road in this city and has devoted himself to Sino-Japanese cultural undertakings for several decades, making great contributions.

Mayor Chen has specially appointed Xu Tianshen, the Director of the Bureau of Economics, and Lu Ying, the Director of the Second Police Bureau, as Standing Committee Members of the Shanghai Aircraft Donation Campaign Committee. The number of Standing Committee Members has been increased to five, strengthening the organization and ensuring that the work can proceed smoothly to achieve the expected goals.

### City Grain Bureau Organizes Household Registration in Nanshi

Feng Youwei, the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Grain Bureau, in order to earnestly revitalize grain administration and strengthen the allocation structure, has decided to first thoroughly organize household registration in the Nanshi area to make the allocation procedures more complete. Starting immediately, the Grain Bureau will issue household registration forms for applying for allocation certificates to each designated public grain sales office in the area. The head of the household should obtain the forms from the respective public grain sales office, fill in the number of people living in the household, their names, ages, and residence permit numbers in detail, and submit them to the respective Lianbao Chief and Baojia Chief for stamping, and then directly submit them to the Grain Bureau for review as a list of rice allocation. It should be noted that there are no fees charged for these forms.

### Weekly Commentary (Continued from Page 1)

In 1918, Mr. Frouba, the general manager of the Mexican Oil Company, publicly stated: "The truth behind the Mexican Revolution was initiated by Pierce. He held 35% of the shares in Pierce Oilotas Oil Company, which in turn held 65% of the shares in Mobil Oil Company. At the same time, he was a supporter of the Rockefeller (Rfeller) financial interests. This Pierce had requested President Dias to cancel the oil import tax, naturally because he hoped to import American oil. President Dias refused. So Pierce supplied Francisco Madero with money to start the revolution. However, to Pierce's and others' surprise, Francisco Madero, sent by Mobil Oil, was attacked on February 18, 1913, and sentenced to imprisonment by Huerta of the Victoria faction. As a result, the revolutionary movement became more vigorous and high-spirited, and the civil war between Venustiano Carranza in the north and his subordinates Pancho Villa began."

This should be clear enough! In short, history has proven that in the eyes of the Mexican government, the demands of American financial capital are supreme orders. If a national politician appears who does not obey, he will be driven out by a "revolution" created by "the will of the people." It must be remembered that Mexico is a "independent and free" country among democratic countries. Therefore, in democratic terms, the prospect of "complete independence and autonomy," or in our words, the danger of "complete enslavement," is now deeply felt by the countries of South America. In addition, although the degree of enslavement varies from country to country around the world, all face this danger of democratic enslavement.

The second danger is that American financial magnates, in order to maintain their production mechanisms, are constantly seeking opportunities to provoke absolutely necessary wars (large-scale consumption businesses). If a dispute occurs between two countries, even if a political settlement is possible, American financial magnates immediately take advantage of it to develop it into an unmanageable large-scale war. The World War is a good example of this type of fact. At first, the United States publicly declared that it would not participate in the World War, but it exported a large number of military supplies to Britain and France, thereby highly encouraging domestic industry. Financial magnates also hoped that the government would gradually export military supplies in large quantities. The Washington government responded to this hope and finally promulgated the Lend-Lease Act of 7 billion gold dollars. As the risk of debtor countries of the Lend-Lease Act being defeated by the Axis powers increased, the US government, following the same process as in World War I, incited domestic public opinion to advocate participation in the war in order to draw the people into the vortex of war. Therefore, everyone understood that participation in the war was only a matter of time. The purpose of participation was to strive for actual world leadership, which became increasingly clear during participation in the war (this tendency was especially evident in the Atlantic Charter and the Cairo Conference).

In short, will the world essentially submit to the old world order under American control, or will it destroy this old order and establish a new order? There are only two choices, and one must be chosen. Those who want to take the latter path are the German movement to establish a new European order in the West and the Japanese movement to establish a new East Asian order in the East. Perhaps this does not need to be explained in detail! The so-called new order movement, in a sense, is a defensive movement by Japan and Germany against American financial magnates. Naturally, this alone cannot fully explain the American character, but in a practical sense, the main motivation lies in establishing the "independent autonomy" of the country and in laying the foundation for the prosperity of its nation for generations to come.

However, what becomes a problem here is the construction of the new order. If the world dominated by American (with Britain as a vassal) financial magnates is opposed, and a new world dominated by other financial magnates is created, then even if it is a new order in form, it is essentially a disguised old order. For this type of constructed new order, just as Japan and Germany opposed American finance capital before, dissatisfaction with the leadership of Japan and Germany will naturally arise among other nations. At the same time, if it is for the prosperity of one nation while suppressing the prosperity of other nations, then no matter how much it costs to create this new order, which goes against morality and justice, and is characterized by narrow "nationalism," it will all be in vain. Japan, within the Greater East Asia area, is now facing this big problem. Regarding Japan's own desire to create a new Greater East Asia order, it is necessary to truly re-examine the intentions of other Greater East Asia nations, especially the intentions of the Chinese nation. I believe that China is closely watching Japan. If the construction of the new Greater East Asia order that Japan should complete in the future can practically prove that it guarantees the true independence and autonomy of the Chinese nation, then the Chinese people will wholeheartedly join the construction of Greater East Asia. Since the Xinhai Revolution, the Chinese people have experienced many years of anti-imperialist struggles, so they absolutely cannot be unaware of the world rule of American finance capitalists. The Chinese, who are of the same yellow race, naturally feel proud that Japan has eliminated the forces of American finance capital within Asia through the Greater East Asia War. However, why don't the Chinese in the anti-Japanese war zone actively help Japan? This is because they have doubts about the form of Japan's construction movement of the new Greater East Asia order and the practice of its policy towards China in the process of that movement.

We Japanese must now give a practical answer to the questions of the Chinese people. It is no longer a time when we can simply perfunctorily deal with the Chinese with mere politeness. Only a genuine attitude that is consistent in word and deed will be effective in dispelling their doubts. In my capacity as a Japanese, I wrote the book "Reflections of Japan and Innovations of China" in order to solve this difficult problem. Therefore, this book does not talk about policies or ideals, but only provides honest words necessary for self-criticism.

### Lung Disease, Stomach Disease, and Hemorrhoids: The Most Common Ailments Among Chinese; This Office Donates Effective Medicines

Since the establishment of this office's medical and pharmaceutical aid fund, it has received vigorous support from people from all walks of life, and the donations have been quite considerable. Therefore, it has been possible to provide free medical care and medicines, alleviating the great difficulties of the general poor and sick who have no one to turn to, benefiting the population immensely. However, according to the statistics of past treatments, lung disease and stomach disease are the most common, followed by hemorrhoids. Although the latter has a surgical treatment method that is effective relatively quickly, the cost is already considerable. As for the former, it will not be effective without long-term recuperation and precious medicines. This office has limited funds and cannot provide widespread and long-term assistance. This is what is meant by "giving extensively to help the masses is also a mixture for the sages." Fortunately, Mr. Zhang Ci'an, the owner of the Zian Pharmaceutical Factory on Changde Road in this city, is enthusiastic about public welfare and is particularly concerned about impoverished patients suffering from the above-mentioned diseases. He is specially willing to sell his effective medicines for treating lung disease, stomach disease, and hemorrhoids at a low price to this office for distribution to patients. We have already purchased a batch from this office. Anyone who suffers from these diseases and is unable to afford treatment can present proof from their service organization that they are indeed impoverished and can come to this office to obtain the medicines starting May 1st. Each person is limited to one dose free of charge. Those who need to obtain more will have to pay the cost of the medicine and can also be given an additional dose. In addition, in order to test the effectiveness of these medicines, we hope that those who try them will provide a detailed report.

Any impoverished apprentices in the hardware industry who are dismissed from their shops and can provide proof of their poverty from the shop or are referred by this service center, can visit the Health Association's outpatient clinic at 587 Jing'an Temple Road for medical examination (5 to 7 p.m.). All departments are available and medication is provided free of charge. The benevolent act of the proprietors of Gongxingchang is truly admirable.
