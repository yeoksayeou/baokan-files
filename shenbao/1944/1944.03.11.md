### Contributing to Japanese Language Teachers

After the 26th year of the Republic (1937), everyone began to focus on Japanese language education. After the Greater East Asia War, everyone paid even more attention to Japanese language education. Just look at the so-called "100-Day Mastery," "Rapid Success Method," "Self-Study Method," etc., published by bookstores now, and the advertisements for Japanese language schools in newspapers, such as "Individual Instruction," "Success in Three Months," etc. Studying Japanese has become a social trend. However, it has been seven years since the 26th year of the Republic, and more than two years since the Greater East Asia War. What are the results of Japanese language education? We certainly wouldn't dare say there are none, but the poor results are also a fact.

Recently, the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry, in order to promote Sino-Japanese cultural exchange, specially dispatched twenty-four Japanese language instructors to China, distributed to major cities in Central China. The instructors have all undergone rigorous examinations and selection, and the teaching subjects can naturally be unified. This is the beginning of planned Japanese language education, which has great significance for the communication of Sino-Japanese culture. We would also like to offer three points as humble opinions, contributed to the instructors.

In the past six or seven years, the unplanned cultivation of Japanese language talents in society has had a worst outcome, which is to make the general public detest Japanese language talents. The most obvious example is the so-called "interpreters." They studied Japanese for a short time, learned very superficial and simple conversation, and had no understanding of the Japanese people or Japanese culture at all. However, after rapid success, they became self-important and acted as interpreters everywhere, with faces full of Japanese knowledge. They acted as a fox exploiting the tigerâ€™s might, oppressing the people. Not only could they not convey Japan's sincerity, but they could also arouse the Chinese people's aversion to Japan. In this situation, the more Japanese language talents there are, the more obstacles there are to Sino-Japanese relations. We hope that the instructors coming to China should explain this to Chinese students in the very first lesson.

In the past, Chinese schools, from elementary school to university, mostly used English as the first foreign language, with others as the second foreign language. This was the result of the cultural invasion policy of Britain and the United States, but as a result, Chinese people have made great progress in researching methods of learning English. It is especially convenient for beginners and can better suit the Chinese people's temperament, arousing their interest in learning. Now, the importance of Japanese has been understood by the general public, and it is natural for Japanese to become the first foreign language. However, how to compile a textbook that suits the temperament of the Chinese people? How to plan a set of teaching methods that arouse the Chinese people's interest in learning? How to compile many tools that are convenient for Chinese people? Everything depends on the hard work of the Japanese language instructors. This is the cornerstone of Sino-Japanese cultural exchange, which is our second point of hope for the instructors.

Cultural exchange is mutual. The instructors have come to China during this extraordinary period to spread Japanese culture, and they also have the mission of spreading Chinese culture after returning to Japan. China respects teachers the most. The relationship between teachers and students in Chinese society is the most solemn and affectionate. The saying "A teacher for one day, a father for life" best expresses the Chinese spirit. From the mouths of ordinary people, one can hear the most honest words of a nation. From the conversations of students, one can see the true heart of the Chinese people and the future trends of Chinese culture. Introducing Chinese culture to Japan is certainly not the task of the instructors, but being in a favorable position, the instructors should make twelve points of effort for the sake of the national fortunes of China and Japan. This is our third point of hope for the instructors.

Today, this newspaper publishes a record of a symposium on "The Greater East Asia and the Japanese Language," which is an abridged translation from a Japanese commentary, discussing the importance of the Japanese language in Greater East Asia. We welcome all the instructors with this, and we hope that you will all work hard.

### Mr. Guo Pei'er Writes an Article on the European Situation; Germany Prepares to Deal with Any Eventuality

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) German Propaganda Minister Guo Pei'er published an article in the German magazine, stating: Communism has gained a foothold in both Eastern and Western Europe, and the first victim in the West will be Britain. What do the British hope to achieve by continuing the war? Do the British still really believe that they can restore the balance of power in Europe after the war? The Germans do not attach importance to the exaggerated announcements of political and military plans by the enemy. What the enemy is doing is only a sign of weakness. If the enemy could realize its intentions in the possible meetings, it would not need to speak more. If not, then its more speech is only a propaganda deception by Britain and the United States. If Britain and the United States are capable of deceiving people, they will lose their prestige. A third possibility of exaggerating their strength may be because Britain and the United States have to make exaggerated propaganda for political and psychological reasons, but the alliance of the anti-Axis alliance has unnatural conclusions. As a result of the Tehran Conference, only Stalin was satisfied, because he knew his own value and refused to let his allies give up an inch of European land. In 1939, the British participated in the war because they attempted to prevent the unimportant modification of the eastern borders of the General State, believing that this change would lose the balance of power in Europe and benefit Germany. But since then, the changes in the borders of European countries have made London have to admit the fact that the European continent can never restore the situation of 1939. This shows the error of Britain's war aims. And what the British want to prevent will be formed with double the material. The current situation is either favorable to Germany or to the Soviet Union. The comments of London newspapers seem to be able to understand this fact. Only the Jews in Britain and the United States think that they are still in a superior position, and the development of the situation is undeniable, that is, the development of the situation is just as the Jews want, and communism has gained progress in Eastern and Western Europe. The British will be the first to bear the brunt, so the British suddenly have to take advantage of the political truce announced by Berlin to temporarily prevent the misfortune from coming, but they will also encounter the same fate. Who will the British believe to restore the balance of power in Europe? If the British think that they are threatened by the Germans, they want to defeat the German military forces to eliminate the danger they have suffered. If the British can achieve success, then the Soviet Union may not be able to constitute a greater threat to Britain. Now, for the purpose of discussion, if the British dream can be realized and Germany collapses, then London's celebration of victory will be interrupted by the communist demonstration. The British have created a situation that even the combined forces of Britain and the United States cannot control, and the Germans regard this as the most important issue in the war. Soon the British will invade Europe in a great adventure. We believe that Britain and the United States will be injured and retreat. Then what will be the result? And what the British can hope for is only the communist conquest of Germany. Is the communist victory the victory of Britain and the United States? And the current symbols have shown that what we have described is a deduction based on facts, without the slightest error. There are also people in London who can foresee this tragedy, but they cannot find a way out. It is no longer a British war. The British once wanted to make their allies take chestnuts from the fire for the British, but the British have now discovered that they have the task of taking this risk for their allies. And in Germany, preparations are being made for the development of the crisis that will occur automatically. When the war reaches its climax, there will be a solution. The German command can know the situation of the environment and make the most favorable action with absolute self-confidence. The Germans are determined to achieve victory at any cost with enduring confidence. The military success of the Germans is the inevitable result in history, so no matter what happens, it is not enough to surprise us, because we have decided to deal with any eventuality.

### Japanese Military Authorities in Myanmar Issue a Statement: The Common Defense Posture is Increasingly Strengthened

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military front-line base in Myanmar, the Japanese army authorities in Myanmar issued a statement on the 10th as follows: The enemy's means of calling for the recapture of Myanmar are to advance troops to the southern border of India and Myanmar, capture Rijie, and after the Japanese army voluntarily withdrew due to strategic relations, they were able to invade Mengduo. Thus, the world was greatly publicized that the counterattack was successful. In fact, the Japanese army in that area had preemptively, with the close cooperation of the air force and the Indian National Army, annihilated at least most of the British Fifth Division, which was touted as the most elite. The Japanese army's jungle combat team, with more fierce attacks from all sides on the surviving British Fifth Division, repeatedly defeated its main force, and repelled the enemy who invaded the Kaladan area. The enemy's counterattack attempt in that area was completely frustrated. The elite of the Japanese army units in the Fugong area also heavily damaged the Chongqing army and thoroughly shattered its combat power. The Japanese army on the Nujiang River is currently strengthening the defense of the forefront of the Nujiang River against the recent movements of the Chongqing army in that area. The Myanmar National Army in the central border area has also repeatedly achieved brilliant results in the Jiahua West and Alakangaijin areas under the cover of a superior air force and artillery team. A few days ago, in the vicinity of the lower reaches of the Gengdiwan River, they fully demonstrated the spirit of their new national army and took on the important responsibility of defending their country. In order to carry out the task of common defense, the Japanese army also learned to defeat the enemy forces that often invaded the Myanmar border in the area in front of Fort Wat and disrupted the people's peace. The situation of common defense on the Myanmar border is becoming more and more strengthened. Around the 10th, in order to thoroughly defeat the enemy forces, the attack was started, and it is believed that the enemy's reckless actions will soon be put down by the Japanese army.

Minister Sampu's Speech on Japanese Army Memorial Day

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch)

Yesterday (the 10th) was the 39th Japanese Army Memorial Day. The Japanese residents in Nanjing held a large gathering in the evening at the Donghe Theater with speeches, movies, and music. Minister Sampu of the Information Department personally delivered a speech, explaining in detail the lessons of the Russo-Japanese War and the belief in the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War. The text of the speech is as follows:

"As we examine the world powers of that time, Japan, considered a third-rate country, faced Russia, the strongest and largest in the world, in a decisive battle for the fate of the nation. Overcoming weakness and defeating a formidable enemy, it promoted its prestige and saved the Empire and East Asia from crisis. At this time, we should handle the completion of the Greater East Asia War, which is currently in progress, and resolve its several serious lessons. The purpose of the Russo-Japanese War was to secure peace and independence for Asia and to resist the eastward aggression of Imperial Russia, the eastward expansion of Western powers. On February 1, the 37th year of the Meiji era, when we received the 'Imperial Rescript Declaring War on Russia,' the great cause was already clear. If we compare this with the Greater East Asia War, the war aims are purely consistent. In the case of China, it was the target of Anglo-American aggression in East Asia and a market for capitalist exploitation. This was a matter of life and death for East Asia, especially for the two nations of China and Japan. Since the China Incident, Japan has been striving to resolve this problem, but it has been met with the ambition and oppression of Britain and America, and has been disregarded. This is something we cannot tolerate. However, in both the Russo-Japanese War and the war against Britain and America, we first sought peaceful solutions through diplomatic negotiations. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, when negotiations were on the verge of collapse, even the Hearst newspapers in the enemy American camp acknowledged the legitimacy of Japanese arguments and warned the U.S. government authorities. As a result, Roosevelt's resolution for war against Japan met with opposition.

Here, let us compare the national strength and military strength of the two countries at the time of the Russo-Japanese War. The population of Japan was 47 million (about four times less), and the total number of men was 24 million. Russia's population was 74.5 million (about three times more). Japan's peacetime military strength was 170,000, while Russia's was 1.24 million (about eight times more). Japan had 690 cannons, while Russia had 4,200 (about seven times more). (At the end of the war) The number of divisions on the battlefield was 25 for Japan and 45 for Russia. The number of military horses on the battlefield was 172,000 for Japan and about 400,000 for Russia. (Losses) The number of deaths and injuries was 200,000 for Japan and 140,000 for Russia. The number of prisoners of war was 2,000 for Japan and 80,000 for Russia (about ten times more). In total, Japan had 202,000 casualties, and Russia had 220,000. Furthermore, if we compare the organization and equipment of the enemy and ourselves, the examples of the Russian army being superior to the Japanese army are too numerous to mention. In short, an examination of the enemy's military strength at the time of the Russo-Japanese War reveals an absolute advantage. Therefore, the material power of Britain and America today is not to be feared. However, how did we achieve such a great victory against this superior enemy? The reasons for the victory are as follows:

Before the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese government sent Viscount Kaneko Kentaro to the United States, where he told the American people that 'this war is for the survival of the Empire, and there is no means of self-defense other than war.' As a result, they gained their understanding. Before departing, Viscount Kaneko had inquired about our army and navy's predictions of success or failure in the war. He had personally asked Army Minister Terauchi about his predictions. The Army Minister replied that there was no clear advantage or disadvantage and that details should be sought from Vice Chief of Staff Kodama. When asked, Vice Chief of Staff Kodama gave the same answer, saying that there was no clear advantage or disadvantage. Next, the Navy Minister replied that he anticipated no clear advantage or disadvantage and that Viscount Kaneko might hear the bad news that half of the Japanese fleet had sunk during his speeches in America. This was the prediction of the central command at the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War." (To be continued)

U.S. Under Secretary of State's Mission to Britain

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch)

According to informed political circles: The purpose of U.S. Under Secretary of State Stettinius's visit to Britain in the near future is to pave the way for the post-war imperialist plans of the United States. It is said that Stettinius will present a lengthy list of U.S. desires, creating many difficulties for British policy. The topics to be discussed will likely include the supply of military supplies to the Soviet Union, the distribution of oil, colonial policies in Africa, and issues directly related to Britain in the Mediterranean. The U.S. seems willing to make concessions to the Soviet Union on certain rights. The various difficulties encountered by the anti-Axis powers in the Pacific will also occupy a large part of Stettinius's talks. The presidential election will be held this year, and these issues must be resolved.

### Fierce Street Fighting Breaks Out in Tarnopol; German Forces Retreat from Key City of Uman

Initially, only the eastern part of the bridgehead was flooded, but now the entire area has become a swamp. Shells falling cause mud and water to splatter, and soldiers are covered in mud. Under these conditions, combat is impossible, and only reconnaissance patrols and artillery units remain active. The sound of artillery can be heard in Rome every day, especially clearly at night, and windows shake. However, the citizens of Rome remain extremely calm and indifferent to the impending major offensive by the anti-Axis forces. On the contrary, they have great faith in the defense of Rome. As Easter approaches, residents are busily preparing to celebrate the holiday, seemingly unaware of the proximity of the war to Rome.

### German Aircraft Recently Used Gas-Based Self-Igniting Bombs in Raids on London; U.S. Air Force Again Attacks Berlin in Daylight

Zurich, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Swiss newspapers on the 7th commented on the new tactics used by German aircraft in bombing London: In recent air raids on London, the German air force used stratospheric bombers, which ascended to an altitude of 6,000 meters above London and then dropped bombs. The bombs were made of flammable gas and ignited automatically after being dropped, making them more effective than the stick-shaped incendiary bombs used by the U.S. Air Force.

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to military sources: On the afternoon of the 9th, residential areas of Berlin were again bombed by U.S. aircraft. The U.S. Air Force used dense cloud cover to carry out terror attacks, causing casualties among civilians in the city. Despite the unfavorable weather, anti-aircraft guns put up strong resistance, destroying several four-engine bombers and fighter aircraft. The heavy cloud cover prevented enemy aircraft from identifying targets, and they dropped bombs blindly and aimlessly. During the previous daylight raid, the U.S. suffered losses of over 250 aircraft and over 2,000 aircrew. They now seem to have changed their tactics and are coming in cloudy weather.

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a London dispatch, the U.S. Air Force Command announced that seven bombers and one fighter aircraft were lost during the bombing of Berlin on the 9th.

Paris Air Raid Damage Statistics

Paris, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - An official announcement states that the greater Paris metropolitan area has been bombed twelve times by British and American air forces, resulting in 1,930 deaths, 3,430 serious injuries, 54,847 homeless individuals, and 3,531 houses destroyed or severely damaged. As of December 31, 1943, the government had spent 30 million francs to assist the victims.

Reporter: The topic of today's discussion is "Greater East Asia and the Japanese Language". I hope everyone will share their views...

As you all know, the war is intensifying. At the same time, the strength of our Japanese nation has extended militarily, politically, culturally, and economically into every corner of the vast Greater East Asia. The most effective medium for the Emperor's benevolence to shine upon these areas is undoubtedly the Japanese language! The trend of learning Japanese has become prevalent in the South Seas. I have heard that government authorities and various organizations are working very hard to study Japanese. I believe there are many issues to discuss regarding the relationship between the Japanese language and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. If you think about it carefully, it is not just a simple language problem, but the language also contains significant meaning. With this in mind, there are many issues to discuss regarding the current spread of the Japanese language throughout Greater East Asia. It is indeed a joyful and commendable thing to see the Japanese language becoming so popular today. However, we must consider that there are extremely diverse and complex language systems within Greater East Asia. Therefore, when it comes to coordination, we must resolve it based on the actual political and cultural situation, and then implement a language policy for Greater East Asia. Of course, this is not simply about popularizing the Japanese language throughout Greater East Asia. Based on a grand language policy, I believe there are many issues. Today, in this regard, I would like to ask everyone to share their insightful views to enlighten me.

The Current Situation of the Japanese Language in Various Regions of Greater East Asia

Nakajima: We have directly undertaken the task of promoting and teaching Japanese in places like Malaya. Generally speaking, the local residents' learning of Japanese can be divided into two types: passive acceptance and active demand for learning. Our group of Japanese language promoters must also consider the needs of both the givers and the receivers in order to achieve successful promotion. The issue of "Greater East Asia Construction and the Japanese Language" is not simply a local issue. On the one hand, basic Japanese language research and establishment are also necessary for Japan itself. On the other hand, from a non-academic perspective, if we want to make local residents sincerely like or need to learn Japanese, we need to win the war in order to proceed smoothly in an ideal manner.

Hasegawa: What is the current status of the promotion of the language issue in Greater East Asia? And how can we get the other party to accept it now?

Nakajima: From the perspective of teaching Japanese locally, the direction of progress must be to seek as much universality as possible and to penetrate deeply into the people. Japanese language teacher cadres have been trained in the South Seas and dispatched to work in various places! As for the results of the work, firstly, the schools received by the Japanese side teach young students step by step. Secondly, we promote the establishment of cram schools and night schools for the other party to learn Japanese on their own initiative. Speaking of the speed of popularization, compared with the language policies of various countries towards their colonies in the past, the speed can be said to be astonishing.

Japanese as a Common Language in Greater East Asia

Regarding the countries in various regions of the South Seas that have declared independence, their education and culture also have their autonomy. Although they do not reject Japanese, the other party also has a language, and the language is even more complicated due to religious beliefs. If we want to unify them, we must have a dominant common language, and the Japanese language should emerge and occupy this position, becoming the common language of Greater East Asia! However, if the assimilation policy goes too far, it may become an obstacle to the popularization of Japanese. However, we cannot adopt a laissez-faire policy and have to force people to learn Japanese! This is the current focus of the problem, which is enough to affect politics and should be closely watched.

Hasegawa: How about using Japanese as a common language? In terms of the extent to which it can be accepted in Greater East Asia, how does Japanese compare to English and Dutch?

Nakajima: In the transitional period, it is still more convenient to use English, but now, due to the awakening of nationalism, and also because of the Asian problem, although I dare not say it is the general public or the insightful people in the country, they still want to accept Japanese from the perspective of nationalism within Asia. Perhaps, in terms of language structure, there are also places that are difficult to accept, but I think that if political power is strengthened, it will be beneficial to the war. If the policy of governance is not mistaken, then Japanese is very likely to become a common language.

Jinbo: Moreover, based on objective facts, Japanese is not difficult to learn. The local residents accept it quite easily, and the results are very satisfactory! In Malaya, whether inside or outside the school, they are quite interested in learning Japanese and Chinese characters.

Difficulties in Seeking Popularization

Hasegawa: The extent to which a language is popularized abroad is consistent with the strength of the country. Therefore, the so-called difficulty of the language is not something that needs to be seen as a fundamental problem. If Japan's national prestige is promoted in all directions, then the other party will naturally develop their own genius for accepting Japanese and overcome all learning difficulties.

Furthermore, those who consider the writing system to be the most difficult are often the countries themselves. For example, the British think English is the most difficult, the Chinese think Chinese is the most difficult, and the Japanese are the same, thinking Japanese is the most difficult. This is because the people of the country are always striving for perfection in the use of words, so they feel it is difficult. However, foreigners do not need to pursue in-depth study when learning Japanese. They only need to be satisfied with reaching a certain level.

Izui: Therefore, the issue of popularization has nothing to do with the difficulty of the language itself. Now is the time to build Greater East Asia. We must consider that the popularization of Japanese is related to the active expansion of national prestige. We also need to add some help and not allow the acceptance or rejection of Japanese to be left to nature.

Izui: The so-called language policy is also closely related to the issue of ethnic policy. Moreover, language is a manifestation of the spirit of the nation. There are many aspects that form the characteristics of a nation, but I think these are all mutually integrated among the various ethnic groups. Therefore, as long as the language is understood, the things that accompany the language will naturally be understood. Therefore, as long as you learn Japanese well, you will come into contact with Japanese people. You will also write words into articles or read Japanese publications. In this way, you will also develop a psychology of admiring the Japanese spirit. Therefore, even if it is not urgently needed in a practical sense at present, we must popularize Japanese in the long run.

Jinbo: Initially, Japanese was developed automatically, and then it became a matter of current language policy, and it has reached the point where Japanese must be popularized. I think it is inappropriate to immediately pass Japanese for the simple purpose of practical use or as an extraordinary means. It should be said that it is because the future is long, and in order to convey the heart of Japan, we cannot help but spread Japanese. Continued on page three.

Focusing on Curbing Hoarding

Today's economic problems are concentrated on the issue of prices, and the price policy is focused on curbing hoarding. In his remarks during his recent inspection of North China, the Japanese Ambassador to China Gu stated that he firmly believes that the core of the price stabilization policy must be to suppress the abnormal price increases caused by speculative hoarding, which can be described as hitting the nail on the head. The commentary in yesterday's newspaper, "The Core of the Price Problem," based on the editorial of the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on February 25th, specifically pointed out that the core of the price issue lies in reforming politics; only by exerting political power and coordinating economic measures can the crisis be thoroughly resolved.

One is that good governance lies not in many words but in vigorous action, which is the guiding principle of clear governance throughout history and in China and abroad. Today, price control is to relieve the people's suffering, and its importance and urgency are probably above any other economic issue at present. Since the core of solving the price problem lies in curbing hoarding, the decision of the recent price coordination conference of five provinces and one city in Central China should be strictly enforced, without fearing resentment. This decision is that in the future, those who engage in speculative hoarding and violate economic regulations will be severely punished.

In recent days, the general investment merchants engaged in speculative hoarding, and some financial institutions that secretly hoard goods using depositors' funds, have felt great panic, and there are daily reports of price reductions. The downward trend in the past two or three days still shows a tendency to worsen. The authorities should take advantage of this period to take decisive action, cut the weeds and eliminate the roots, not miss the opportunity, and not yield to sentiment, so that those who hoard for exorbitant profits will never be able to recover, so that the future of the people's lives will not be in irreversible crisis.

Greater East Asia and Japanese (Continued from Page 2)

Characteristics of the Japanese Language

Hasegawa: Using Japanese as a common language is a set policy, and there is no need for us to elaborate.

Jimbo: The so-called common language is the result of natural growth. Since we are constructing a common language, then the best language among the languages of East Asian countries is Japanese!

Tokieda: Moreover, whether in political significance, economic aspects, or cultural aspects, Japan is the leader in the core. It is because of this natural trend that it is regarded as the common language!

Jimbo: I also think that it is a good thing to use the power of the state to make Japanese the common language, but in terms of linguistic research, it can also prove that Japanese is the most beautiful and good language!

Izumi: Then, where is the beauty?

Tokieda: The beauty of the Japanese language, I think, lies in its ambiguity and double entendre... (laughter)

Nakajima: The excellence of Japanese is also recognized in linguistics, such as the richness of vocabulary and the infinite mystery of expression. These are its characteristics.

Hasegawa: I think this problem is better called the characteristics of Japanese life than the characteristics of Japanese, because Japanese is produced from life and used to express attitudes to life. Therefore, Japanese artists can understand the strong characteristics of Japanese, which is not the same as learning through oral transmission, but the result of tacit understanding. Therefore, the language art of Japanese cannot be studied simply in terms of language form, but can only be studied by combining the whole aspect.

Tokieda: The characteristic that I think of is the historical characteristic of Japanese, which is very different from the historical characteristics of European languages. Generally speaking, the original Japanese language, that is, the Yamato language, absorbs the Chinese language components, which does make the current Japanese language very complicated! I think this kind of characteristic is very important when talking about language policy and the national language problem. There are very different factors gathering and mixing together. It is impossible to solve it simply.

Izumi: What was imported into Japan in the past was Chinese characters, so it can be used freely and fully exerted for Chinese. However, recently, the same attitude of digestion and absorption has been adopted for European writing. Then, when evaluating Japanese in the future, it will have two historical characteristics. If this point is ignored, Japanese cannot be studied. If it is said that Chinese characters are too difficult, and one wants to abolish Chinese characters without considering the past history, I am afraid it will not work.

Hasegawa: If people generally think it is difficult to use, it will naturally be gradually eliminated. Let it be eliminated by itself, and the teachers will just teach, so that natural elimination and subjective efforts will naturally intersect! Even if there is no need to propose restrictions on Chinese characters or not allowing the use of Chinese, those who can be abolished should be allowed to be abolished!

The Problem of Chinese Characters

Tokieda: Therefore, when talking about the beauty of Japanese, one will also feel the beauty of both Japanese and Chinese. However, from the standpoint of a linguist, from the perspective of consciousness and technique, the two seem to be very harmonious, but in fact, in ordinary language, they are parallel and completely different things.

Izumi: From the standpoint of ordinary people, if Chinese characters are removed in the future, Japanese will be incomplete. Let's not talk about this for the time being. Then, what will happen in the future if Chinese characters are mixed in Japanese? I think that the problem of Chinese characters will be eliminated by itself in the future. Whether from the aspect of writing or from the aspect of grammar, Japanese will slowly simplify. Generally speaking, the so-called great language is one that has a large function and a tendency to simplify the structure. Furthermore, according to the ideal, the structure is relatively simple, the writing is also easier, the expressive force is richer, and it can be used in a larger field. This is ideal. I think the Japanese after the Meiji period has this tendency.

Hasegawa: We don't like to create Chinese characters as much as possible, but in fact, they are still being added.

Izumi: Now, because special technical terms are constantly emerging in society, in terms of form, it seems very far-fetched and unreasonable to create new characters, but in fact, it may not be new words at all, but the original words in that society. If Chinese characters are regarded as the backbone of Japanese, the way to use them must be different, and the entire Japanese will also be simplified!

Nakajima: However, if too many Chinese idioms are used, in terms of linguistics, it is using a foreign language. In addition to analyzing language and conducting various researches in the same relationship, some kind of sorting is needed. It is not a question of arbitrarily wanting to make it simple, nor is it a question of creating words, but a need for a sorting that adapts to reality in some sense. Even if Chinese characters are not written now, many words in Yamato language have long been similar to the sound of Chinese characters and have already been considered mature and commonly used words!

Hasegawa: If we don't use borrowed words and write Chinese in letters, wouldn't that be possible too?...I think that is a characteristic of Japanese. Instead of calling it difficult Chinese, it is better to call it a foreign language, and constantly using foreign languages is a natural habit of Japanese people since ancient times. The import of Chinese during the Middle Ages is also an example. In daily speech, we like to use difficult words and allusions. Why has this characteristic developed in Japanese? I dare to say that this is due to the equality of education of the Japanese. The people in the lower classes do not think that the words of the people in the upper classes are words of another world, but as long as it is Japanese, people of all classes can use them freely. This is indeed a characteristic, and it is also a linguistic attitude that transcends good and evil.

The Urgent Task of Investigation and Research

Nakajima: Although it is good or bad to say it from a guiding standpoint, what kind of condition is Japanese actually in? There is still a great lack of specific research on this. I hope that there will be great works on policy, technique, or logic. At the same time, I am very much looking forward to doing a most basic in-depth research.

Izumi: Regarding this point, I also had a plan to sort out the Japanese vocabulary and divide it into many departments. If it is arranged successfully, it will not only be convenient for Japanese people to understand and learn, but also for the ethnic languages â€‹â€‹of Greater East Asia, this simple and clear vocabulary can also be a standard to follow! At the same time, there have also been special books published on the outline and system of vocabulary simplification. However, to complete a more detailed and concrete work requires a lot of manpower and a lot of costly work.

Tokieda: The national language problem that the government is currently engaged in research on will not be possible to stipulate immediately without fully carrying out a certain investigation. First of all, it is necessary to widely collect data and then systematically sort out it to facilitate the selection of standards.

Jimbo: Therefore, I hope that the government will adopt a more detailed policy for unifying the language. Nakajima: In order to popularize and develop Japanese in the future, I think it is necessary to study the past history based on literary and social historical materials. At the same time, it is also necessary to study the constantly changing vocabulary at the present time. Furthermore, it is necessary to see how the basic culture that constitutes the backbone of language is related to each other. Now is a major turning point in the entire linguistic knowledge, and there is no doubt about it. The words we are talking about today may seem to be curious Qing talks to others. However, in fact, it is an extremely urgent issue, and it is also an issue related to the prosperity and decline of the country. This is because the current language problem is not only an ideal problem, but also a realistic security problem, and it is also a war problem now, so it must be understood to this extent and be able to develop to this extent. In the final analysis, language itself is a reflection of the entire culture, so it can be understood that good Japanese is good Japan! And do not simply say good and relax, so it must also be treated as a practical problem and worked hard!

Jimbo: In this serious sense, I hope that linguists can step out of the ivory tower and the palace of art.

Reporter: Let's talk about the recent rejection of enemy languages. Is this simply because they are the languages â€‹â€‹of enemy countries? Or is it to purify Japanese, to restore Japanese to its pure state, and to have historical significance? Nakajima: Because we are currently in wartime, from an overall point of view, it is still right to reject enemy national languages. The so-called rejection of enemy languages, at a minimum, from the mental problem, from the operational problem, I think it is necessary. I think this problem is a well-understood common sense, this can be regarded as a common sense problem!

Tokieda: The common sense problem is to eliminate that extremely curious state of mind or that almost worshipful expression for speaking foreign languages!

Hasegawa: It's really strange to deliberately speak foreign languages â€‹â€‹when there are ready-made Japanese words, but it is also impossible to completely cancel the families that have been Japanese-ized today. This situation will continue to exist. But I think, at a minimum, don't adopt the active attitude that was adopted in the Meiji era! (Excerpted from the February issue of Japanese Review)

### Registration Required for Major Commodities; Non-Compliance Will Be Prosecuted

In order to stabilize the market conditions of various industries and alleviate the suffering of the people, the authorities are paying close attention to the buying, selling, and pricing of major commodities. To prevent illegal hoarding and to ensure an adequate supply on the market, all parties storing, buying, and manufacturing major commodities (including raw materials and finished products) must register in accordance with regulations. (A) Individual applicants can apply to the local competent authority. (B) Applicants who are members of trade associations should have their applications compiled and forwarded by their respective trade associations to the local competent authority. The items to be filled in are as follows:

Type and name of the commodity; Quantity of the commodity; Source of the commodity and the time and value of its acquisition; Packaging method; Location of storage; Brand name, business location, and the name and address of the responsible person of the commodity owner; Brand name, business location, and the name and address of the responsible person of the applicant; Date of application.  However, each trade association should report the registration matters of its members, together with the compiled forms, to the respective trade union federation. The trade union federations should forward the reports of the respective trade associations, together with the compiled forms, to the National Federation of Commerce Control. When there are changes or terminations of registration items, the applicant should submit a monthly report to the local competent authority in accordance with the regulations. However, in order to understand the actual situation of major commodity storage, the competent authority will send personnel to inspect warehouses and companies at any time. If the report and the actual storage quantity, address, type, etc. do not match, they will be prosecuted in accordance with the law.

China Film Shareholders Meeting

The China Film Company convened its 32nd annual shareholders meeting yesterday. Chairman Lin Baisheng was in Beijing on official business. Vice Chairman Kawakita Nagamasa, as well as over a thousand directors, supervisors, and shareholders attended. The Vice Chairman proposed that Executive Director Feng Jie be the chairman of the meeting. The chairman first reported on the legality of the meeting quorum and the company's operating status, asset liabilities, and profit surplus for the 32nd year. All present approved without objection. During the general discussion on the re-election of directors, Wu Tong'an (China-Japan Industrial Bank) was unanimously elected. Furthermore, as the term of the supervisors had expired, a re-election was necessary. Wei Nailun, Tang Chengbo, Uemura Taiji, Kitamura Saburo, and Yan Chuntang were unanimously elected as the second term supervisors. Finally, the chairman announced that the proposed capital increase, which was originally planned for discussion at this meeting, had been carefully considered by the joint meeting of directors and supervisors. It was believed that the economic situation had changed drastically in the two months since the call for the meeting, and that it was more appropriate for the company to maintain its original capital and develop gradually, rather than expand and risk potential dangers, which would also be in line with government policy. Therefore, the original proposal for a capital increase would be shelved and not discussed. All present agreed unanimously, and the meeting was adjourned.

### Navy

â€” By Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Yang Yi

One day in September, the sound of swords clashing against each other reached Masato. Covered in sweat, he had just finished his exercises and was coming out of the dojo.

"Cadet Taniâ€¦there's a telegram for you here?" The adjutant of the company, Major S, personally handed him the telegram, which was something Masato felt unworthy of.

Masato opened the telegram in front of the instructor and saw:

"Takao is missing. If he comes to your place, please let us know â€“ From Takao's Father."

The word "missing" struck Masato's chest with force. He must have changed color--

"What's the matter?" Major S asked. The company adjutant, like an army company commander, also inquired about the private affairs of his subordinates.

Masato did not hide anything and told the instructor everything. Takao, his close friend, had admired the navy since he was a boy. When he failed the physical examination this summer, he was deeply disappointed, and--

"I seeâ€¦poor child!" After listening, the major said, his words short but filled with emotion.

Three days passed, then a week, but Takao did not come to Etajima.

Masato understood the feelings of his missing friend. He also sympathized with the parents, who only had one son, and imagined the sadness they must be feeling. So, if Takao came to visit, he would definitely find him a hotel in the village and comfort him as much as possible. But no news came, no matter how much he waited.

He could no longer wait and finally sent a telegram to Takao's father.

â€”â€”Takao hasn't come please provide details

A reply came along with a letter.

According to his father's imagination, Takao may have gone to Masato's place. Takao had disappeared while staying at Kirishima Onsen. Before that, he had sent a letter to his father asking for a lot of money to pay for the hotel room. Although he disappeared with a lot of money, that was not the main reason for his disappearance. The evidence was that before going to Kirishima, he had withdrawn all his savings and taken clothes such as winter underwear. This was all discovered later.

"Serving the country as a citizen is not limited to joining the navy.

Before graduating from middle school, he ran away from home. His stupidity is truly pathetic. But the old man only has one son, and my wife is overcome with grief. If he doesn't go to your place, where will he wander? I am also deeply concerned."

Takao's father's letter was deeply moving. Unlike Masato's family, they had plenty of income and property. No matter what school he attended, it wouldn't be a problem. But running away before graduating from middle school was truly irrational behavior. Sometimes he thought about scolding him, but at the same time, he felt a sense of sympathy for his friend Takao, who had yearned for the navy but ultimately failed and gave up on himselfâ€”

(That guy is stubborn...)

Takao, who was nervous and paid attention to trivial matters, but who disregarded everything once he got angry, had a personality opposite to Masato's. Yet, the two of them were particularly close because of this. They were old friends who had played together on the coast of Tenpozan before entering elementary school, so Masato could clearly understand Takao's current feelings. Thinking about his feelings, he could guess that Takao, who had failed the "navy," would not sneak into the gates of the military academy to see him.

"What happened to that child who sent the telegram the other day?" One day, Major S unexpectedly asked this. Masato replied with tears in his eyes.

"I don't think he'll come."

Autumn deepened.

On the orange mountain, as the students called it, oranges and grapefruits were turning yellow. Etajima was famous for its citrus fruits and sweet potatoes, so large red sweet potatoes were often served on the dining tables of the military academy.

"Tani! In your hometown, are Satsuma potatoes also called Satsuma potatoes?" A classmate asked Masato.

"No, we call them Tang potatoes."

"Tang potatoes is a good name. So, what do you call them if you go to Tang (China)?"

"No, then they're Ten (Heavenly) potatoes."

Another classmate imitated Masato's accent, and everyone burst into laughter.

Masato could only smile and endure their teasing, but he felt an infinite sense of loneliness in his heart. It didn't matter whether his classmates laughed at his hometown dialect or not. Satsuma potatoesâ€”seeing Tang potatoes reminded him of the past when he and Takao would roast Tang potatoes on the beach of Tenpozan in winter. They would dig a hole in the sand, light a fire, and roast the sweet potatoes there. The outer skin would be charred, but the center would be pale white--

(Where on earth did you go, Takao...)

Recently, Masato often thought this during his free time or after lights out. Whenever he thought of it, he felt an indescribable emotion.

### Preventing Meningitis Transmission Requires Emphasis on Cleanliness; Nanjing's Garbage Is Fundamentally Unclean

Recently, there have been cases of infectious meningitis in this city. Although health authorities are making efforts to prevent and control the disease, many people in the vicinity of Nan Shi Li Bin Road have contracted it, and citizens seem to be overlooking this. It is thought that the fundamental way to prevent the epidemic is to emphasize cleanliness, but when looking at Nan Shi, even just speaking of Min Yi Road where I live, the sewers in areas like Gu Jia Heng Kou are blocked, and the filthy water has become stagnant. In the Guang Yi Street Bei Duan area, garbage piles up, almost forming hills. In this early spring, the foul odors are already difficult to bear, and passersby cover their noses. In the coming warmer months, when the scorching sun is burning, what will it be like? I urge the authorities to supervise the residents to thoroughly dredge and manage the area as soon as possible to eliminate hidden dangers. (Sun Yuan)

Reports say that local lockdowns are being implemented separately in the meningitis-affected areas of Nanshi. It is said that "as long as the accumulated filth in Nanshi is not cleared, the source of the chaos will be difficult to eradicate." This sentiment is deeply felt. Upon inspection, garbage mountains accumulate on all streets in Yushi, such as Chenghuang Temple and Houjia Road. Even on the extremely bustling and prosperous Fangbin Road and Fuyou Road, there are piles of garbage. Even behind North King Hospital and Xiaoshijie, the piles are so high that it is impossible to pass, and one must go around them. In this cold weather, meningitis has already become prevalent because of this. If it is summer, the epidemic will inevitably be even worse. The people's livelihood is of utmost importance. The cause of this is partly due to residents' lack of attention to hygiene and dumping of garbage everywhere. And when a garbage pile starts, more follows. Over time, it accumulates into mountains. The other part is the lack of attention from health authorities and the lack of trash bins. Garbage trucks are too few and are not used effectively. They are often only seen on the main streets and not in the small alleys. As a result, all the small streets are even more difficult to navigate due to the filth and dirt. Consequently, the accumulation of filth in Nanshi is increasing, and the epidemic is even worse. It is hoped that the health authorities will thoroughly eliminate this filth. (Yu Naihong)

Treatment for Meningitis

Recently, there has been an epidemic of epidemic meningitis in this city, and people are talking about it with fear. Even mild colds and fevers are mistaken for this disease, causing unwarranted panic. Its main symptoms are fever, vomiting, headache, stiffness in the neck, and impaired consciousness. It is necessary to recognize the two prescriptions of Nieâ€™s, Kuyeqiu and Wenbi, but it is feared that it is not that simple. The Annao Pill formulated by my former teacher, Yun Tieqiao, has a miraculous effect. He advocates that if there is fever, headache, and soreness in the back of the head, and abnormal colors in the eyes, use a combination of Xinliang Jiebao and Longdancao Kujiang, which is really able to eliminate hidden dangers before they happen. It is a good method created by the sages, but the Chinese people often ignore it, which is regrettable. (Zhang Jucai)

Preparation method of "Zao Fan", a special medicine for treating meningitis. Zao Fan is the green alum used in the ancient method of dyeing bright blue, also known as black alum. During the roasting process, select the crystals, remove the gravel, put them in a tile container, and roast them on a charcoal fire. At first, it will turn into a liquid, and when it dries, its color will turn red. Grind it into a fine powder and sift it. Leave it on the ground overnight to remove the fire, and store it in a glass bottle for future use. Patients should not underestimate it simply because it is a simple method. (Liang Yihui)
