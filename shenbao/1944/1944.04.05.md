### Reforming Local Governance

Reforming politics is our consistent proposition. In peacetime, it is a necessary path for the country to move towards prosperity. In wartime, it is a major step to enhance combat power. Especially now that the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage, China is a participating country, and the tasks it should shoulder are very arduous. Therefore, reforming politics is an urgent matter both subjectively and objectively.

Our proposition for reforming politics is based on establishing expert governance and establishing people's representative bodies. We have discussed the importance of these two and the steps to establish them many times. Establishing expert governance means using talent wisely and improving personnel management. However, political systems and sound personnel management are equally important. Therefore, improving the political system is also a major item in reforming politics. Today, I would like to briefly express my humble opinion on reforming the political system.

Recently, the attention of most Chinese people has been focused on strengthening central politics. Of course, central politics is the central nervous system, and it is necessary to strengthen and improve it. Therefore, it is not inappropriate for the people of the country to focus their attention on the central government. However, from the perspective of overall politics, strengthening central politics is only a part of the whole. Equally important is local politics. Local politics is the foundation. It is like building a house. After the foundation is solid, the roof can be stable. Therefore, reforming the local political system should be given equal importance as reforming the central political system and should not be neglected.

Central politics is a point, provincial politics is a line, and county politics is a plane. If the point and the line are strengthened, but the plane is neglected, then the power of this point and line will not be enough to control the entire plane and make it follow suit. In short, if county politics is not strengthened first, then even if the politics of the central government and the provinces have been strengthened, the policies implemented will still not be universally promoted to the best stage and achieve the best results. Therefore, we advocate that reforming the county local political system should be carried out simultaneously with reforming the provincial and central political systems.

Today, this newspaper published an article by a reader, Mr. Xinmin, entitled "Humble Opinions on Reforming the Local Administrative System," which is quite insightful. In particular, the reform of the county system and the establishment of advisory bodies are particularly important. The county is the foundation of local administration, and all policies rely on the county government for direct implementation. At present, the county government organization is too simple, and the county magistrate's treatment and status are too low. Those with qualifications and abilities are unwilling to take the position, and those who take the position mostly have other intentions, so the county's political situation is unbearable to hear about. All political affairs are only responsible for design and guidance in the central government, and must be effectively implemented in the local government. If the local government does not have competent personnel responsible, then even if the central government is determined to govern well, it will be difficult to achieve practical results. These situations are the biggest shortcomings of the current local administration. Therefore, it is especially important to improve the status and treatment of county magistrates and attract qualified and capable people to take office, so that the central government's policies can be thoroughly implemented and achieve the effect of responding to each other and maximizing benefits.

Secondly, people's representative bodies should be established in both the provincial government and the county government to communicate the people's opinions on political matters that should be developed and reformed. Before the establishment of a council, an advisory committee should be set up first for government consultation and suggestions. These proposals are essential points that must be considered in reforming the political system.

In addition, we believe that the most important issues to pay attention to in reforming the local political system include preventing political sabotage by the Communist Party and Chongqing. The methods of prevention, not only in politics, but from a practical analysis, should be 20% military, 40% political, and 40% economic. Because the destructive work of the Chongqing Communists is particularly strong within the areas of local governments, prevention, in the military sphere, is limited to the local area, and in the political sphere, it cannot be universal. Only by coordinating prevention with the same strength of the economy as we do with politics can we block all exploitable gaps.

### Striking Results Achieved by Japanese Forces in Seas South of the Carolines; Enemy Mobile Force of Considerable Strength Attacking Suffers Heavy Damage

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency): The Imperial Headquarters announced at 3 p.m. on the 4th: On March 29th, an enemy mobile force of considerable strength appeared in the sea south of the Caroline Islands, and our air force in that area immediately went out to intercept it. From the night of March 29th to April 1st, bombing was repeated, sinking two enemy cruisers, damaging two battleships, one aircraft carrier, and one large warship. From March 30th to April 1st, the enemy also launched air raids on the islands of Palau, Yap, and Melejon. Japanese forces immediately intercepted and shot down more than 80 enemy planes, suffering slight losses on the Japanese side. During the above period, the enemy dispatched its air force from its bases and launched air raids on the Marshall Islands, the Eastern Caroline Islands, the Bismarck Archipelago, and New Guinea. Japanese forces in various places immediately counterattacked, shooting down and destroying about 60 enemy planes and driving them back.

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency): On March 29th, Japanese forces discovered an enemy main mobile force centered on aircraft carriers and battleships in the sea south of the Caroline Islands. The Japanese air force on alert immediately attacked the enemy ships, and from the night of the 29th to April 1st, repeated fierce attacks resulted in the severe damaging of one enemy aircraft carrier on the 29th, which caught fire. The other three ships were also hit by torpedoes and capsized. Two enemy cruisers were sunk, and one other battleship was also hit by torpedoes and caught fire. One large enemy warship was also severely damaged and caught fire. In addition, the enemy mobile force attacked the Palau Islands, Yap, and Melejon from the 30th to April 1st. Japanese forces in that area immediately attacked the enemy forces east of Palau Island, shooting down more than 80 enemy planes. Specifically, 13 were shot down in the Palau area on the 30th and 31st, 60 were shot down south of Peleliu Palau on the 30th, and 8 were shot down at Melejon on April 1st, totaling 81. During that time, although enemy planes dispatched their air force to continuously raid the Marshall Islands, Truk, Taroa Island, the Eastern Caroline Islands, Ponape, the Bismarck Archipelago, and Rabaul, Wewak, and Trobriand, the newly deployed Japanese forces in these areas fiercely counterattacked and shot down 15 enemy planes in the Wewak area. A total of 56 enemy planes were shot down in other areas, and more than 14 enemy planes were destroyed.

### Japanese-Indian Forces Advancing Steadily; Battle Reaches Climax; British Admit Communication Line Cut

From a certain Japanese military base on the Indo-Burma border, 4th (Central News Agency): After the Japanese-Indian allied forces completely cut off the enemy's largest supply route from Imphal to Kohima at 10 p.m. on March 28th, they advanced towards the Manipur Plain, successively defeating the advance guard strongholds of Imphal, moving south, and launching a general offensive. Since March 29th, they have also been engaged in preliminary battles against the enemy in the vicinity of a point 20 kilometers downstream of the Khil River (east of Imphal) prior to launching a general attack. The Japanese-Indian forces have reduced enemy strongholds everywhere, threatening to break into the Manipur Plain. Another unit of Japanese-Indian forces advanced 30 kilometers north of Sangak (east of Imphal) on March 28th and has now broken through the Manipur highway, rushing south, completing the posture of attacking Imphal. The general offensive centered on Imphal is becoming increasingly urgent, and the battle situation in that area has reached its climax.

From the Burmese border front, 4th (Central News Agency): The remnants of the British 17th Division, about 4,000 men, in the mountains north of Tonzang in Burma and near Sinkal, were routed by the fierce Japanese attack and fled to Chindas, 15 kilometers north of Sinkal. An investigation of the enemy's losses in the battle near Sinkal showed that 975 bodies were left behind, along with 16 mortars and many other weapons. In addition, a considerable number of enemy troops were killed and wounded in the battle and transported to the rear. From this, it can be seen that the remnants of the enemy's 17th Division have been completely annihilated here.

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency): According to a report from New Delhi, the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Headquarters officially acknowledged on the 3rd that the communication line between Imphal and Kohima had been completely cut off.

### Japanese General Suematsu Discusses the Southern Pacific Battle Situation; Enemy's Attack on the Carolines Was a Reconnaissance Battle

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency): The enemy, anxious about the stalemate in the South Pacific battle situation, launched a powerful attack on the Caroline Islands. The Japanese army has inflicted heavy damage on them and achieved great results. The Japanese Imperial Headquarters has announced this today. Japanese Navy General Nobumasa Suematsu recently commented on this, saying: The enemy mobile forces previously launched strong attacks on Truk Island and the Marshall Islands, so this attack on the Palau Islands, etc., is a natural consequence. The Japanese air force in that area was fully prepared and immediately attacked the enemy fleet when it was discovered, achieving considerable results. This proves that the Japanese air force has gradually begun to exert its power. The enemy is now vigorously publicizing that the South Pacific battle situation has entered the second stage since this event. However, regarding the strategic significance of this air raid, we can point out no more than two points: 1. Air raids carried out by mobile forces are only temporary and have no decisive effect. 2. The losses suffered by land bases that have been bombed are extremely minor. After all, one or two days of air raids cannot change the strategy of the attacked location, and the losses suffered can be repaired at any time. Therefore, the enemy's propaganda is only a kind of tactic. The Japanese military's strategic posture will not be shaken by this. In short, this battle was a reconnaissance battle by the enemy to assess the strength of the Japanese forces in the Caroline Islands. The Japanese air force is increasing its efforts day by day. If the enemy still does not know when to advance or retreat, the Japanese army will soon be able to achieve the great results that the nation expects. Therefore, the transformation of the battle situation is not far away.

### Japanese Planes Attack Yushan

### Incident of Chongqing Troops Invading Outer Mongolia; Soviets and Chongqing Blame Each Other

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency): It is regrettable that at a time when we are all working together to oppose the Axis powers, a conflict has occurred between the Chongqing troops in Xinjiang and the Outer Mongolian troops. It is noted that the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia concluded a military alliance treaty in 1936, stipulating that the Soviet army would guarantee the security of Outer Mongolia. However, before the conclusion of that treaty, Chongqing and the Soviet Union had already concluded a basic treaty in 1924, stipulating the legitimate relationship between the Soviet Union and Chongqing. At that time, the Soviet Union also recognized Outer Mongolia as the territory of the Republic of China. However, now, when a conflict has occurred on the border between Xinjiang and Outer Mongolia, the Soviet authorities have taken the above measures, wanting to support the Outer Mongolian army by means of the Soviet-Mongolian military treaty. The Chongqing authorities do not agree with this view. If the Soviet Union recognizes Outer Mongolia as part of the Republic of China, then the Soviet Union should not interfere in the disputes between Xinjiang and Outer Mongolia.

### Chongqing Evacuates Citizens

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency): According to a Reuters report from Chongqing, the Chongqing authorities have decided to evacuate 60,000 residents from Chongqing in order to strictly prevent Japanese bombing, and have also decided to increase the number of air-raid shelters in Chongqing.

### Red Army Launches Counteroffensive in the Carpathian Foothills Amid Snow; German Forces in the South Able to Control the Situation

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency): The German authorities announced on the 3rd: The main force of the German army in the lower reaches of the Bug River, from Nikolaev to Berezovka, has decided to withdraw to Odessa and the lower reaches of the Dniester River, covered by the German defensive forces on the Voznesensk, Berezovka, and Tiraspol lines, and carry out withdrawal operations. The Soviet offensive in the area between Chernivtsi, Kolomyia, and Stanisławów, and the central area of Ternopil, has weakened significantly. It is expected that the Soviet army will not be able to use its reserve forces to launch attacks on the Hungarian border and in the Carpathian Mountains. The Hungarian army is now launching counteroffensives against the Soviet army in that area amid snow. German forces in Ternopil, Brody, Kovel, and other places, although surrounded, have repelled the Soviet army after two days of brave fighting.

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency): The German News Agency reported: Although the Soviet army attempted to ravage the German line with a twenty-fold advantage, the German line south of Pskov remains unmoved. News from other parts of the eastern front stated that the Soviet army has no large-scale activity because the major defensive battles are still concentrated on the key points in the southern region. The Soviet army has failed to achieve any goals on the southern front, and the German line in that area has been consolidated. The German High Command is now able to control the situation.

### 180 American Planes Re-attack Budapest

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency): According to a report from Havas, enemy planes re-attacked Budapest and its suburbs on the evening of the 3rd.

German and Hungarian aircraft intercepted the enemy planes over southwestern Germany before they reached Hungary, shooting down at least 14 enemy planes. The number of enemy planes shot down by anti-aircraft guns was roughly the same.

### Revolution in El Salvador Fleeting

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency): According to recent intelligence, the revolution in El Salvador broke out, but due to the government's forceful suppression, it was unsuccessful.

### The Offensive Route for Decisive Battle Living

Active Utilization of Held Resources

The active utilization of held resources, whether in government offices, companies, or households. All materials that have been collected and unused until now, are to be taken out at this time and contribute to combat power. For example, old magazines and useless books should all be recycled into paper. The implementation of this method does not adopt special legal measures, but relies solely on enlightenment and publicity campaigns. In government offices, banks, companies, etc., regulations that originally prescribed the storage period for account books and other items should shorten this period in order to promote the use of old items.

Strengthening Air Defense

The key to strengthening air defense is to be in a state of urgent circumstances where air raids are inevitable, and to further prepare an iron-like defense posture. At the same time, shift the various defensive measures from the past into a practical direction. The main topics are the completion of factory air defense, the limitation of air raid damage, preparation for post-air raid measures, and the promotion of evacuation. The Air Defense General Headquarters will then prepare and decide on its specific plan, because it has already convened a meeting of the General Headquarters Bureau Chiefs on the night of February 25 to implement it quickly. Four months since the Air Defense General Headquarters began its initiative, with the issue of evacuation as the center, promote recent air defense administration, expand the scope of the revised Air Defense Law, mobilize the entire Bureau, and give full play to the functions of the General Headquarters in all fields of air defense. And to minimize the impact on productivity and the shaking of national life during air raids. Therefore, emphasize the preparation and training for factory air defense facilities and organizations and damage limits, the recovery and repair of damaged objects, food distribution, rescue, and the construction of simple housing. Regarding the evacuation issue, in addition to relocating or removing facilities that do not affect production or vulnerable buildings in terms of air defense, a new method of evacuating general population groups is also being considered in order to achieve results.

Delegation of Authority

Regarding the delegation of central supervision affairs to local areas, the government and each central government agency have agreed on the items to be delegated, and a decision has already been made by the Cabinet. Already over a thousand matters have been delegated from the center to local areas. To further strengthen and activate this, in principle, except for matters that are absolutely necessary, the remaining parts are thoroughly delegated to local authorities or officials. If necessary, the central government only provides general guidelines or handles matters through ex post facto reports. Regarding each matter, the Cabinet and each ministry should decide as soon as possible and implement it as quickly as possible. (Translated by Hong from the Asahi Shimbun, February 27)

### Preliminary Thoughts on Reforming the Local Administrative System

— Xinmin

(A) Shortcomings of the Current Provincial and County System

The provincial government is a guiding and supervisory body for local administration. In the past, provincial areas were vast, making thorough supervision difficult. Although there were proposals to reduce their size, they were never implemented. In recent years, administrative supervisory commissioners have been appointed to oversee specific areas. While this has been somewhat effective, there are still many shortcomings.

Provincial governments are not directly involved in executing administrative affairs, so their organizations should not be too large. Currently, the organizational structure of provinces and counties is disproportionately top-heavy, and the concentration of talent in one area is uneconomical.

Provincial departments simultaneously direct county governments, resulting in conflicting instructions from multiple sources, which makes it difficult for county governments to respond. Furthermore, having too many superiors leads to frequent errors, hindering the implementation of county-level administration.

The status and compensation of county magistrates are too low, deterring qualified and capable individuals from taking on the role. Those who do accept the position often have ulterior motives, rendering effective county administration impossible.

The county is the foundation of local administration, and all government orders rely on the direct implementation by the county government. However, the current county government organization is too rudimentary, and the division of labor is insufficient. While the central government is only responsible for design and guidance, effective implementation must occur at the local level. If there is no one specifically responsible at the local level, either matters are ignored or dealt with perfunctorily. As a result, even if the central government strives for effective governance, it is difficult to achieve practical results.

(B) Methods for Reforming the Provincial System

To concentrate power, expedite operations, and save manpower and resources, the organization of the provincial government should be as simple as possible, with all existing departments abolished.

The provincial government should establish the following offices:

First Office: Handles general affairs. Second Office: Handles finance and land administration. Third Office: Handles agriculture, industry, commerce, and cooperation. The provincial governor, acting on orders from the Executive Yuan, manages all provincial administrative affairs.

The provincial government should have a secretary-general and a deputy secretary-general, each, and six to eight counselors.

Each office of the provincial government should have a director and an assistant director. Offices should not issue official documents to external parties.

Before the establishment of a provincial assembly, the provincial government should establish an advisory committee, recruiting local gentry and prominent figures for consultation and advice.

The secretary-general, counselors, office directors, inspectors, and county magistrates should all be selected by the provincial governor and submitted to the central government for appointment.

The provincial governor should also serve as the provincial security commander, responsible for provincial security and anti-banditry affairs. They may also establish a security command and provincial security teams. The commander should have a chief of staff and a deputy chief of staff, both of whom should be military personnel.

If the provincial governor is a member of the Kuomintang, they should also serve as the chairman of the provincial party headquarters, with two to four standing committee members appointed by the central government.

(C) Methods for Reforming the System of Administrative Supervisory Commissioners

The title "Administrative Supervisory Commissioner" seems cumbersome and should be changed to "Inspector," which is simpler and more respectful.

Each inspector should oversee a district of three to four counties. Overseeing too many counties would make management impossible and render the position useless.

The counties under the jurisdiction of each inspector should be specified in their title. For example, if the district includes Zhenjiang, Danyang, Jintan, and Jurong, the inspector should be called "Zhen-Dan-Jin-Ju District Inspector," which is clearer than "District No. X."

The status and compensation of inspectors should be equivalent to that of the original department directors. After the abolition of the original departments, the department directors should be transferred to the position of inspector, which would be a win-win situation.

The inspector's office should establish the following groups:

First Group: Handles general affairs. Second Group: Handles education, propaganda, the New Life Movement, social affairs, customs, and hygiene. Third Group: Handles finance, land administration, transportation, water conservancy, forestry, economic affairs, and cooperation. Fourth Group: Handles police administration, baojia, and anti-banditry.

Inspectors, acting on orders from the provincial governor, supervise the administration of their entire district.

Inspectors may also serve as county magistrates, using the performance of their county as a model for other counties.

Inspectors should also serve as district security commanders, responsible for security and anti-banditry in their entire district. All security and anti-banditry affairs should be handled by the fourth group of the inspector's office. A separate district security command should not be established, but district security teams may be established.

(D) Methods for Reforming the County System

The official rank of county magistrates should be universally raised to "Simplified Appointment," and their status should be equivalent to that of the provincial government office directors. In addition to their salaries, their official expenses and confidential funds should be stipulated.

As the county is the foundation of local administration, the county government organization should be complete, and the division of labor must be meticulous. As times evolve and administrative affairs become more complex, a rudimentary organization is insufficient. Therefore, the county government should establish the following sections: 1. General Affairs Section, 2. Finance Section, 3. Land Administration Section, 4. Economic Section One, 5. Economic Section Two, 6. Public Works Section, 7. Water Conservancy and Forestry Section, 8. Education Section, 9. Propaganda and New Life Movement Section, 10. Social Affairs and Customs Section, 11. Hygiene Section, 12. Police Administration Section, 13. Baojia Section, 14. Security Section.

The county magistrate, acting on orders from the provincial governor, manages all administrative affairs of the county and is subject to the guidance and supervision of the inspector.

The district chiefs, police station chiefs, tax office chiefs, relief home directors, and school principals should all be selected by the county magistrate and submitted to the provincial government for appointment.

The county magistrate should also serve as the county security commander, responsible for security and anti-banditry in the entire county. All security and anti-banditry affairs should be handled by the security section of the county government. A separate command should not be established, but county security teams may be established.

If the county magistrate is a member of the Kuomintang, they should also serve as the chairman of the county party headquarters, and the remaining committee members should be appointed by the provincial party headquarters.

Before the establishment of a county assembly, the county government should establish a consultation committee, recruiting local gentry and prominent figures for consultation and advice.

### Modified Procedures for Household Registration and Movement Certificates - Old Zhabei Police Station Reissues Announcement

The Old Zhabei District of this city has previously established modified procedures for residents to register new households and report changes of address, in order to facilitate household matters. As residential certificates are now being reissued, it is feared that citizens may not be fully aware of the procedures. Therefore, Sub-Bureau Chief Hong Hanbin has reissued an announcement stating: "Since the implementation of the Baojia system in this district, household registration has been conducted to eliminate hiding places for criminals. For the past two years, banditry has been suppressed, and citizens have been able to live and work in peace. However, household registration is based on citizen certificates. In some cases, people coming to Shanghai from inland areas have not prepared the necessary movement procedures and are unable to obtain citizen certificates. Others have taken their citizen certificates with them when returning to their hometowns, creating obstacles for registration. To facilitate household matters, if the above situations occur, the head of the household, the head of the Jia, or the Bao chief can provide certification for registration purposes. This has been the practice, and as residential certificates are now being reissued, it is feared that citizens may still not be aware of the modified procedures. This announcement is hereby reissued to ensure that all residents comply."

Short Commentary

### Municipal Advisory Committee

According to yesterday's news, the Municipal Government of this city will convene a Municipal Advisory Committee in the coming days to jointly discuss the advancement of the new Shanghai. We believe that this is a sincere expression of the Municipal Authorities' desire to engage with citizens, and also a starting point for the Municipal Authorities to establish a representative body. It is a commendable and wise move.

This newspaper has consistently advocated for the establishment of a representative body for over a year. We believe that national rejuvenation requires political reform. Political reform requires the establishment of a representative body. Therefore, this newspaper has repeatedly emphasized this point. In our editorial on March 17, we still advocated for the speedy establishment of a representative body as an important task in reforming Shanghai, on par with streamlining personnel and unifying the economy. In the past week, the Municipal Government appointed Wu Songgao as the head of the First District Public Office and Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and appointed Tai Jiandong as the Director of the Security Department and Director of the Anti-Banditry Bureau. This is the beginning of streamlining personnel. Now, with the establishment of the Municipal Advisory Committee, this is the beginning of establishing a representative body. At the same time, it is also the beginning of reforming Shanghai and building a new Shanghai. We, standing from the perspective of citizens, support the development and implementation of these wise measures. In addition to making every effort to cooperate, we will wait and see the results.

The joint reserve fund of the money shops in this city is contributed separately by each participating money shop in accordance with the regulations.

According to sources, the fund is now actively preparing to increase its funds, planning to have its 207 members each contribute 100,000 yuan, totaling over 20 million yuan, to strengthen its reserves and meet actual needs. It is expected that this measure will be implemented soon.

Children's Day Special - Part Two

### The Big Family of Orphans - A Tour of the Shanghai Fu You Home

Tucked away in a corner of Dongjiadu in Nanshi, in a large open space, the big family for wandering children – the Shanghai Fuyou Home – is located at one end of this space. Its history is only two years and three months, but the internal facilities and layout are beyond imagination.

The children here are partly referred by the Children's Protection Section and partly those who are seen on the streets and are homeless but can still be developed. They are brought back at any time.

Deputy Director Mr. Dong is a person who is enthusiastic about childcare. He loves the children very much, and the children are also very close to him. When I went there, there was a group of older children talking closely together. When they saw Mr. Dong, they all bowed politely. Their clothes were very neat, and their faces were quite upright. It is said that they were originally orphans adopted here. Now they have been introduced to studies outside. Today is Children's Day, and they have specially come back to see their younger siblings and also to see their kind Mr. Dong. They have all recognized this place as their second home.

The spaciousness of the buildings is their characteristic. The entire home currently has 230 children. It is said that if funding is available, it would be no problem to adopt 500 children. There are nine large bedrooms, all with tatami mats on the floor. Large red blankets are spread on the floor of the room, and the quilts are folded neatly to one side. Young children sleep in the same room with their caregivers. Those with skin diseases and illnesses are separated into two rooms. There is a medical room with simple medical equipment and a female nurse. The children's toothbrushes and cups are placed on a numbered wooden rack. Their clothes and bags are hung in a room, also numbered and not chaotic. The indoor and outdoor areas are swept and kept very clean. These are all done by the children themselves.

A Glimpse of Life

The daily routine has a fixed schedule. The lifestyle also adopts a work-study system. However, lower grade children attend classes all day. Only middle and high grade children implement half-work and half-care. There are four workshops: sewing, painting, woodworking, and shoemaking. All are working, and some have experts to guide them. There are four classrooms and a large playground. There are seven teachers and the curriculum is entirely elementary school based.

In terms of food, there are two porridges and one meal. The porridge is made with rice and potatoes. The side dishes are vegetables and tofu. There is a serving of tofu as a snack every afternoon. Children with poor health are given two eggs per meal, and those who are weaker are given one egg per day.

The home's expenses are around 150,000 yuan per month, which entirely relies on social donations. Here, they feel that reading materials for the children, medical supplies, and recreational toys are lacking and needed. They hope that enthusiastic people in the community will donate as much as they can. Any amount is welcome.
