### Impeachment and Appointments

Recently, the National Government imposed the death penalty on Hu Zheng, a major offender in a bribery case. We believe this is the beginning of the government's efforts to cleanse the bureaucracy and enforce official discipline. The National Government has appointed Zhang Yipeng as the Minister of Judicial Administration, and the Shanghai Municipal Government has appointed Wu Songgao as Secretary-General and Xiong Jiantong as the Director of the Public Security Bureau. We believe this is the beginning of the government's efforts to establish expert governance and improve personnel management. The Shanghai Municipal Government has established a Municipal Advisory Committee, which we believe is the beginning of the government's preparation to establish a public opinion organ and start anew with the people. In summary, these measures all demonstrate the government's determination to strengthen politics and are signs of political improvement. The political integrity that we, the people, have long dreamed of is now being addressed by the government in response to the people's demands. From the people's perspective, we should do our utmost to support and assist, so that the beginning develops to completion and the determination becomes more firm. This is a shared responsibility of the government and the people.

Yesterday, we discussed the sense of responsibility that the people should have towards the nation and society, and we demanded that everything in the nation and society be on the right track. The government certainly has its responsibilities, but the people should also have their responsibilities. Standing idly by is certainly not acceptable, and watching from the sidelines is even more unacceptable. Today, we offer some suggestions on the government's efforts to cleanse the bureaucracy and improve personnel management, in order to achieve comprehensive success through mutual cooperation.

Supervision and impeachment are originally a method of cleansing the bureaucracy. Examination and appointment are originally a method of improving personnel management. Therefore, the power of supervision and the power of examination are both listed as one of the five powers. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's unique Five-Power Constitution is based on the spirit of the independence of the five powers, clearly defining the limits of authority, and each being responsible for its own duties. However, in terms of the current reality, although the Control Yuan is nominally the highest independent supervisory organ of the central government, it is constrained and suppressed in terms of its functions and cannot exert its effectiveness. This makes the five powers stand side by side, but dimmed and lackluster. To put it bluntly, the current supervisory power is not even as good as a prosecutor in a court, because after a prosecutor files a public prosecution, they have the right to jury trial and appeal to the judge, while the Control Yuan has no opportunity to investigate after an impeachment case is filed. Secondly, after the impeachment is sent out, not only is there no opportunity to investigate, but if there are special relationships involved, those who filed the impeachment are ridiculed for "not knowing what's good for them," and may even suffer as a result. For example, the incident in December of the previous year, when Control Yuan members Ma Mengzhuang, Lü Yifeng, and others jointly impeached the authorities of the Ministry of Food, and as a result, they were dismissed from their positions, can be lamented.

However, now that the government authorities have the determination to cleanse the bureaucracy, we hope that the supervisory authorities must also exercise their functions. Although the current powers given to the Control Yuan do not include the power of questioning and suggesting beforehand, nor the power of judging and punishing afterwards, but only the power of impeachment afterwards, at least they should fulfill the responsibility of impeachment. They should present evidence against corrupt officials and exercise impeachment, so that the corrupt know to be cautious, and the people know that there is still supervisory effectiveness, and contribute to a comprehensive cleansing of the bureaucracy.

Secondly, the examination and appointment effectiveness of the Examination Yuan must also be fully exerted, especially the work of appointment. Although it is a passive prevention, those who seek advancement through luck cannot succeed, and those who are incompetent will not fill the ranks. If the government adopts the principle of using people based on their talents, then strict appointment is especially indispensable, and it will contribute to a comprehensive improvement of personnel management.

### Fierce Battles to Unfold in the Imphal Hills; Japanese-Indian Allied Forces Fiercely Attack Palel

From the Front Lines in India, 10th (Central News Agency) — The Japanese-Indian forces moving north, after capturing Hengtam between Imphal and Tonzang, quickly advanced deep into India. They completely eliminated the enemy forces eight kilometers north of Tingtat Hengtam and are rapidly pursuing the remnants, now reaching the Imphal Plain. On the night of the 7th, the various units of the Japanese-Indian forces on the front lines had crossed Jirighat-Churachandpur, the swampy slopes of the southern highlands, a crucial point in the Imphal Plain, and broke through the Mata River crossing. They attacked and occupied Churachandpur at night, […km] away. Afterwards, they struck hard from the left, right, and rear against the main force of the 23rd Division and the 37th Brigade, as well as the remnants of the 27th Division, which were gathered in the Churachandpur basin. As a result, the vulnerable British forces fled to Bishenpur, about 25 kilometers south of Imphal. The enemy forces, which had been fighting on the Indo-Myanmar border for over a month, are now out of ammunition and have no fighting ability. Furthermore, they have been thrown into disarray by the rapid attacks of the Japanese-Indian forces, abandoning weapons and vehicles all over the ground. It is expected that fierce battles will soon unfold in the hilly areas of Imphal.

From a Certain Japanese Military Base on the Indo-Myanmar Front, 10th (Central News Agency) — The annihilation campaign launched by the Japanese-Indian forces against a brigade of the British 23rd Division and a brigade of the British 20th Division has now reached its climax and will soon be able to annihilate the enemy. The British Fourth Corps is urgently trying to rescue the enemy forces in that area and has gathered the main force of the 20th Division, about 12,000 men, in Palel. Relying on a large number of heavy artillery, the air force is desperately trying to launch a counterattack, attempting to open a retreat route. In order to destroy the enemy in Palel, the Japanese forces launched a general offensive on the morning of the 6th against the enemy forces of about 2,000 men on the highlands 18 kilometers south and 8 kilometers west of Tiddim and 10 kilometers east of Palel. They forced the superior enemy forces at Laimatak and 10 kilometers east of Palel, carrying heavy artillery, to collapse towards Palel. The enemy forces are also actively counterattacking with the support of the air force. Palel is a key point controlling the Imphal Plain. Under the fierce attack of the Japanese forces, its fall is only a matter of time.

### Japanese Maritime Defense Force Active in the North and South Pacific; Sinks Multiple Enemy Submarines in a Wide Area

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) — The Japanese Maritime Defense Force is active day and night in the vast areas of the North and South Pacific, and its remarkable achievements have been repeatedly seen in war history. The following is a record of the sinking of enemy submarines by the team at a certain base. One, on the morning of April 3, a Japanese convoy departing from the base was sailing in a certain direction when a patrol plane responsible for defense suddenly discovered the periscope of an enemy submarine about 10 kilometers behind the convoy. It immediately bombed the submarine, hitting the rear of the submarine's conning tower. The bow of the submarine immediately rose to the surface at a right angle and soon sank. Two, on the night of April 4, a Japanese patrol ship on guard duty in a certain area suddenly detected the sound of an enemy submarine submerged nearby using a hydrophone. It immediately rushed to its vicinity and attacked. As a result, the ship was hit and, in a panic, it leaked a large amount of heavy oil and sank within one kilometer. Three, on the morning of April 5, a Japanese defense ship responsible for defending the fleet in a certain area suddenly detected several submarines lurking in front of the convoy using a hydrophone. It immediately rushed to the vicinity of the submarines and bombed them with depth charges. As a result, a large number of bubbles floated to the surface. After repeated bombing with dozens of depth charges, the heavy oil gushing from the enemy submarines covered the surface of the sea. Four, on the afternoon of March 31, a Japanese escort plane responsible for defending the convoy in a certain area suddenly discovered an enemy submarine lurking nearby and immediately bombed it. At the same time, the convoy's defense ship also rushed to the location and jointly bombed it with depth charges. Soon, the enemy submarine simultaneously gushed a large amount of heavy oil from three locations and sank.

### Random Notes from the Indian Front

The elite units of the Japanese army have crossed the Indo-Myanmar border and are advancing into India with unstoppable momentum. This reporter is traveling with the army and is now advancing step by step towards the foothills of Manipur. Along the way, I have heard and witnessed various situations in the Manipur princely state. I am recording them here for the readers.

The Manipur princely state is located in the southeastern part of Assam, India, extending approximately 150 kilometers from east to west and 200 kilometers from north to south. It is an indigenous princely state. The state is surrounded by the Himalayan mountain range, which is 2,000 to 3,000 meters high. The basin in the central part is Imphal, where the capital of the princely state, Manipur, is located. The total population of the princely state is approximately 445,000, of which the Manipur people make up the majority. The mountainous areas are inhabited by minority ethnic groups such as the Chin and Kuki. The origin of the Manipur people is difficult to trace. Some say they are a mixed race of the Meitei and other ethnic groups in the northwest. Most of the Manipur Hindus who met with the reporter were tall, had beautiful skin, and neat features. Both men and women loved cleanliness, and the women were especially innocent and lively. This gentle Manipur people have fought bravely against British aggression twice so far.

Two Anti-Aggression Wars

The first anti-aggression war was fought to reject British interference in Manipur and has become a historical relic. After entering a state of British rule, the hatred of the tribe deepened. From around 1890 to 1891, the tribe, under the leadership of King Kolairein, launched a revolutionary war. However, due to the overwhelming disparity in strength, the Kolairein Kingdom finally perished in the final, tragic resistance against the British. However, the current prince has reversed course, practicing pro-British policies, providing the British with a 2,000-strong contingent of Manipur native troops, willingly recognizing the thief as their father and acting as an accomplice to the tiger.

However, the indigenous people all admire the legacy of King Kolairein, and anti-British sentiments in their hearts are gradually rising. Now, after the Japanese-Indian forces entered India, they have come to welcome them. They have been heavily conscripted and extorted by the British army, and have reached a state of exhaustion. However, they still use their limited sugar and sheep's milk to comfort the Japanese soldiers after their busy military life.

Chin People are Brave and Fierce

The Chin people live in the dense forests from the Chin Hills of Burma to the southeastern mountainous areas of Assam. They are also known as "Naga," which means "naked" in Hindi. In fact, they are similar to the Papuans of New Guinea and the Polynesians. They are warlike and fear shooting. They are able to take objects in the shadows of the dense forest with perfect accuracy. When the reporter passed through the Naga people's residential area, I felt a little uneasy.

The youth of this tribe take pride in wearing ornaments made of shells around their waists. It is said that the number of shells is related to marriage. The Chin people worship ghosts and gods, and they do not marry until men and women have equally distributed their property. There are countless strange customs like these. I will now record one interesting item: "Dog Rice."

Dog Rice Used as a Delicacy

That was when we passed ten kilometers beyond the Burmese border into a certain Chin tribe outside of the Khampat region. It happened to be after plundering defeated and残兵. The Chin people signaled to the reporter to be careful of the surrounding area and not to approach. So, the reporter gave a handful of salt to a young man and asked for permission. With great difficulty, the cordon was opened, and they led the reporter and his party to the chief's residence. The so-called chief's residence was a dug-out hut with a roof thatched with withered leaves, just enough to keep out the rain. The chief invited us to drink strong liquor and, in order to entertain the honored guests from the east, presented a delicacy that was rolling and moving, and I didn't know what it was. I took a bite and found it had a strange taste. I couldn't help but exclaim "Wonderful!" The chief was very proud to see my expression of praise. The soldier translating next to me explained to me that this was the Chin people's delicacy "Dog Rice." Dog Rice is made by taking a young dog, not feeding it all day, and then suddenly giving it a large amount of rice at a certain time. After it finishes eating, it is immediately killed, roasted on a fire, and the cooked rice in its stomach is eaten. After enjoying the meal, the reporter was very grateful for the chief's hospitality. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, April 2nd)

### Ministry of Interior's Recent Work Focuses on Eliminating Opium Addiction; There are a Total of Thirteen Local Anti-Opium Bureaus

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) — The Ministry of Interior met with Chinese and foreign reporters in the capital at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (the 10th). As Minister Mei was in Shanghai on official business, Chief Secretary Pan E'nian represented him at the meeting and gave an overview of the ministry's recent work. The main points of his speech are recorded as follows: The most important work of the ministry recently is to handle opium suppression. Regarding opium suppression work, we will certainly follow the government's intentions and strictly implement it in order to achieve the goal of eliminating opium addiction. As for the principles of opium suppression, Vice Minister Yuan of the Ministry of Interior has already mentioned them to you some time ago, so I will not repeat them here. I will only briefly report on three points regarding opium suppression: administration, operations, and personnel.

Administrative Aspect

In terms of opium suppression administration, the ministry has established a Central Anti-Opium Bureau, and local anti-opium bureaus have been established in various places. The local anti-opium bureaus have established offices within their jurisdiction to show their special responsibility. There are a total of thirteen local anti-opium bureaus and seventy-five offices. The (thirteen) anti-opium bureaus are: (Nanjing District Local Anti-Opium Bureau), offices include Nanjing City, Jiangpu, Liuhe, Jurong, Jiangning, Lishui, Gaochun. Shanghai District Local Anti-Opium Bureau, offices include Shanghai City. (Suzhou District Local Anti-Opium Bureau), offices include Wu County, Taicang, Changshu, Wujiang, Kunshan. (Wuxi District Anti-Opium Bureau), offices include Wuxi, Wujin, Jiangyin, Yixing. (Zhenjiang District Local Anti-Opium Bureau), offices include Zhenjiang, Danyang, Jintan, Yangzhong. (Yangzhou District Local Anti-Opium Bureau), offices include Jiangdu, Tianchang, Yizheng, Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua, Taixian, Dongtai, Yancheng. (Nantong District Local Anti-Opium Bureau), offices include Nantong, Haimen, Rugao, Jingjiang, Qidong, Taixing. (Songjiang District Local Anti-Opium Bureau), offices include Songjiang, Qingpu, Jinshan. (Jiaxing District Local Anti-Opium Bureau), offices include Jiaxing, Jiashan, Pinghu, Chongde, Tongxiang, Haiyan, Wuxing, Yuhang, Changxing, Jinhua, Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, Deqing, Wukang. (Wuhu District Local Anti-Opium Bureau), offices include Wuhu, Huaining, Tongling, Dangtu, Chaoxian, Hanshan, Hexian, Hefei. (Bengbu District Local Anti-Opium Bureau), offices include Bengbu, Chuxian, Jiashan, Huaiyuan, Wuhe. (Ningbo District Local Anti-Opium Bureau), offices include Ningbo, Yuyao, Cixi, Shangyu, Zhenhai, Xiangshan. (In addition, an Anti-Opium Accounting Office has been established to manage the accounting affairs of the local anti-opium bureaus.)

Operational Aspect

Operationally, opium smokers are ordered to quit within three years. Opium smokers under the age of thirty are required to quit by March 29 of next year. Opium smokers between the ages of thirty-one and fifty are required to quit by March 29 of (35). Opium smokers (fifty-one years) and above are required to quit by March 29 of (36). Opium dens in various places have been completely closed in the capital. Shanghai is required to close them by June 30 of this year, and cities with local anti-opium bureaus are required to close them completely by June 30 and December 30.

Personnel Aspect

In terms of personnel, the candidates for the heads of the Central Anti-Opium Bureau, local anti-opium bureaus, and offices in various places are recommended from various parties who have no known addiction and are usually honest, and they are appointed separately. The above is a general overview of the ministry's recent opium suppression work.

Secondly, the ministry believes that cultivating good county magistrate personnel is essential for cleansing the government, so it has specifically changed the former County Administration Personnel Training Institute into the County Magistrate Training Institute to specialize in training county magistrate talents. Enrollment will begin soon. The qualifications for application require a degree in political economy or law from a university and three years or more of service in a recommended position.

Thirdly, the ministry has successively accepted the land and houses of non-resident owners transferred by the allied Japanese, totaling over 3,900 cases. There are 523 cases in Nanjing, 23 cases in Shimonoseki, 41 cases in Bengbu, 50 cases in Jinnan, 190 cases in Wuhu, 128 cases in Anqing, 158 cases in Luzhou, 26 cases in Changshu, 73 cases in Wuxi, 268 cases in Changzhou, 35 cases in Nantong, 129 cases in Hangzhou, 36 cases in Huzhou, 50 cases in Jiaxing, 57 cases in Ningbo, 35 cases in Jinhua, 93 cases in Yangzhou, 100 cases in Zhenjiang, 70 cases in Taixian, 25 cases in Danyang, 535 cases in Shanghai, and 98 cases in Xuzhou.

### A GlimPSE OF THE CAPITAL'S STREETS, FILLED WITH A DETERMINED SPIRIT

The Three Prohibitions Movement Against Smoking, Gambling, and Dancing Takes Effect

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – Since the Central Government's return to Nanjing, the capital has been rapidly revitalized. The city is flourishing, and various construction projects are progressing by leaps and bounds. After the National Government joined the war, Nanjing appeared on the East Asian stage in a wartime posture. Hundreds of thousands of citizens have become participants in the Greater East Asia War, each striving to fulfill their duties to defend East Asia and restore China. Recently, the general public has been filled with even greater enthusiasm for defeating Britain and the United States to complete the Greater East Asia War. In particular, the determination to fight to the end is most evident in the streets and alleys. Women are emulating Japanese women, wearing "monpe" trousers. Those who perm their hair and powder their faces are becoming fewer and fewer. Young people dressed in the black uniforms of the Youth Model Corps fill the streets. Citizens, regardless of age or gender, respectfully bow to the statue of the Founding Father as they pass through Xin Jiekou Square. Restaurants generally do not serve alcohol to customers, giving people a sense of being in a different world. Furthermore, Nanjing has implemented blackout regulations since March, and public order is excellent. Residents are thoroughly implementing the blackout regulations, and every household along the street has dug air-raid shelters. Citizens believe in cooperating with the agricultural production increase movement and are planting grains and vegetables in the vacant land in front of their homes, turning the entire Nanjing area into a rural landscape. Now, the people of Nanjing and Japan are working hand in hand, becoming comrades-in-arms, and studying each other's languages. The Japanese Embassy in China opened a Chinese language school within the embassy on April 1st, with the ambassador himself serving as the principal. At the same time, the authorities, starting from April 1st, are eliminating the bad habit of opium smoking. They have begun registering opium smokers, closing illegal opium dens, and reporting those who illegally sell opium. The Three Prohibitions movement against smoking, dancing, and gambling has received great support from young people and is progressing smoothly. The cultural and medical circles of Nanjing are working hard to prepare for the Greater East Asia Cultural Conference and the Greater East Asia Medical Conference, which will be held in Nanjing in May. It is expected that China's determination to fight will be further enhanced by the unity of the Greater East Asia cultural and medical circles. Furthermore, a new cultural cinema has been added in Nanjing this week. All of this fully reflects the war spirit of the general public in Nanjing. In summary, it can be seen that the situation in Nanjing is vastly different from what it was two or three years ago and is filled with enthusiasm for defending East Asia and restoring China.

### HULL BROADCASTS WARNING TO NEUTRAL COUNTRIES

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: According to news from Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Hull broadcast last night, warning neutral countries not to supply Axis countries any longer. He stated that many neutral countries are using anti-Axis resources on one hand while assisting in killing anti-Axis soldiers on the other. The anti-Axis forces can no longer tolerate this attitude. The United States highly respects the sovereignty of neutral countries and has never forced a small country to join the anti-Axis side in this war.

Expressing Attitudes on French-Italian Issues

Hull also stated that the French Committee of National Liberation could not be regarded as the government of France and therefore could not be recognized. What the United States is concerned with in Italy is attempting to help organize a free and democratic government, which cannot compromise with Fascism, but the development of the situation in Italy has not met the expectations of the United States. The policy towards Italy set at the Moscow Conference has been properly implemented by the British, American, and Soviet governments, with only the part about democratizing the Italian government not yet realized.

Relations Between Countries Need Urgent Adjustment

To seek lasting peace, there must be a genuine adjustment of the organized action of the anti-Axis countries and the basis of international relations. As for the Atlantic Charter and the declarations of the Moscow, Cairo, and Tehran conferences, they did not propose ways to solve various problems. The Atlantic Charter only stated basic goals. The United States is still willing to act as a mediator between the Soviet Union and Poland.

### GERMANY WITHDRAWS FROM ODESSA ACCORDING TO PLAN

Defensive and Offensive War Unfolds in Crimea

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency, citing a German official war report, stated: Soviet forces have expanded their offensives on the Syvash bridgehead and the Perekop Isthmus on the Crimean Peninsula and have penetrated several points of the German line. Fierce enemy engagements are underway. German forces are still conducting fierce defensive battles in the Odessa region. After weeks of preparation, destroying all military facilities, and removing wheel vessels, tanks, and other wartime materials, German forces have withdrawn from the city of Odessa to carry out a planned withdrawal. Soviet forces attacked near Orhei (in northeastern Romania), but were unsuccessful. During the counterattack, German forces leveled the sunken areas of the positions. East of Bukovina (in Romania), German-Romanian allied forces yesterday again blocked the enemy's advance on the Uzhok Pass line. The German garrison in Ternopol within the former Polish border is engaged in fierce street fighting with the invading enemy.

### FRICTIONS BETWEEN BRITAIN AND AMERICA IN THE RECENT WAR SITUATION – BROADCAST SPEECH BY CAPTAIN SHIODA YESTERDAY TO THE PEOPLE OF NIHONBASHI

The Nimitz fleet, which the enemy, the United States, has been clamoring about for a long time as the southern invasion route against Japan, is now doing its utmost to bomb and invade, attempting to fly over Truk and the Caroline Islands, via Manila, and land in southern China. Their strategy is to cut our mainland and southern regions in two.

On the other hand, under the command of Mountbatten, British forces are trying to retake Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam. The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, together with the Chongqing Air Force, totaling hundreds of aircraft, is launching guerrilla warfare against our ships sailing in the Yangtze River basin and the South China Sea. In particular, recently, they have increased the number of bombers, which is noteworthy. These U.S. Air Forces are watching for opportunities to act in northern Vietnam and are cooperating with the British forces in Burma in their operations. In the battle to occupy Cassino, they faced fierce resistance from the German forces and are still trying to carry out a breakthrough operation. Following the progress of the war situation, they also want to establish a second front in the Balkans.

Soviet forces crossed the Dniester River and entered Bessarabia, planning to adopt the strategy used in the Donbas region. The air war between the German and British forces is becoming more frequent. Recently, Britain and the United States, using joint forces, have attempted to destroy production facilities in Berlin, northern France, and the Netherlands.

As mentioned above, the current world war situation relies solely on the material strength of the United States as the only force. Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and their allies maintain very close strategic methods.

The impression we get is that Britain and the Soviet Union are mutually assisting each other with their military and economic power. In terms of troop organization, the British and American forces are even becoming integrated. However, behind the scenes, the three countries have different dreams and are eager to gain their own speaking rights and interests, resulting in fierce disputes.

At the end of March, Roosevelt answered reporters, saying: "In the war against Japan, the British and American forces have each set up assigned areas. The U.S. fleet is solely responsible for the Pacific theater, while Britain is responsible for the Indian Ocean." In this answer, he revealed his first-class diplomatic rhetoric.

In each front, the U.S. military often leads the British military. The territory of the British Empire, which was once scattered across the seven seas, is now completely invaded and trampled upon by the U.S. military. The British territory of New Britain Island was once announced to be transferred to the United States. Canada, New Zealand, and Australia are in fact already U.S. territories.

The United States increases its voice in India

Furthermore, before and after the battle to retake Burma, the United States dispatched land forces from the Pacific to the Burmese front, dispatched a flight squadron to India, and strengthened the Stilwell U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing. As a result, the United States' voice in India has greatly increased. This point painfully pricked the nerves of the British and the British military leaders who were worried about the war and the invasion of India. For Britain, even if it lost most of its overseas colonies, it could not tolerate a major blow if the U.S. military only verbally invaded India, which is known as the crown of the British colonial empire. Given this, in the enemy's counter-offensive operation in Burma, Stilwell's intervention in Mountbatten's operations revealed the inconsistency of British and American operations. A spokesperson in Chongqing also raised this issue.

Chongqing, whose lifeline is held by the U.S. military, is good at understanding the intentions of the United States and stated: "The British military's operations have hardly achieved anything." Chongqing's newspapers even criticized, saying, "Britain should abandon the difficult land operations and organize a powerful fleet to attack Singapore from the sea."

Roosevelt said, "The Indian Ocean is entrusted to the British fleet," which secretly meant, "The United States will not extend its power to India, the lifeline of Britain," wanting to reassure the anxious British. However, the reality is completely the opposite.

Nimitz's grand plan to use the Chinese mainland as a base for a counter-offensive against Japan is to place China and India under U.S. control.

The most pitiful person is Mountbatten. Boasting that he would retake Burma and promoting his strategy and military power, Mountbatten, who solemnly took office as the commander-in-chief of the Southeast Asian Army, has the U.S. military, which is encroaching on territory, and the anti-British Indian people internally, and the fierce attacks of the Japanese army externally. His plight can be imagined. Of course, Britain has gathered a portion of its fleet in the Indian Ocean, but it does not have sufficient resources and strength to attack our Singapore.

The U.S. military stationed in Chongqing, under Stilwell, is waiting for an opportunity to respond to Nimitz's offensive. The U.S. military stationed in Chongqing, with an overwhelming force compared to the Soviet Union and Britain, controls the lifeline of Chongqing. Therefore, Chongqing has recently dared to not cooperate with the Soviet Union. Furthermore, there was a conflict between the Chongqing army in Xinjiang Province and the Mongolian army, which was criticized by the Soviet Union. Chongqing proclaimed that it was exclusively cooperating closely with Britain and the United States, but in reality, the relationship between the United States and Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union, with Chongqing as the center, is extremely delicate.

The Chongqing leadership admires the large-scale offensive operations of the U.S. fleet in the Palau operation, or praises the strengthening of Chongqing's cooperation with the Allied forces, and sends delegations to the United States, wanting to cater to the United States at the expense of its own soldiers and endure the tyranny of the U.S. Air Force. However, some self-aware people in Chongqing believe that from the perspective of China's long-term plan, it is definitely not beneficial to allow the U.S. military to invade China. Moreover, this enthusiastic praise of the U.S. military in Chongqing is not appreciated in the United States at all, because the United States does not believe that it is fighting with Chongqing on an equal footing. Their goal is only how to achieve their own ambitions in China.

Last year, Stilwell incorporated the weak Chongqing Air Force into his own department, gaining great speaking rights, such as establishing infantry schools or training Chongqing troops, etc. The influence of the United States is increasing day by day. In the eyes of the United States, there is no longer Britain, and there is no longer the Soviet Union.

The United States Exclusively Occupies Near East Interests

Secondly, in the Near East, in places such as Iran, Iraq, and Arabia, which are completely British territories, the United States, despite British opposition, established a plan to monopolize Arabian oil and wanted to install oil pipelines.

As everyone knows, Britain has no oil fields in its own country. Therefore, Arabian oil can almost be said to be its lifeline today. The United States wants to cut off this lifeline of Britain. This matter was immediately transmitted to London, and Eden said in Parliament: "The Allied United States, regarding this matter, perhaps will notify Britain in advance!" He hoped to consult with Britain. However, the American Knox immediately said: "The extraction of Arabian oil is entirely due to the operational needs of the U.S. Navy." He completely overturned Eden's hope. Not only is the Arabian oil issue, there are many issues that are unresolved and affect the relationship between the two countries in the feelings. Therefore, Eden talked about the oil issue in Parliament, and Knox replied like this. Furthermore, a few days ago, when 38 small aircraft carriers were transferred to Britain, Knox also refuted.

The dying British region, due to the many assistance from the United States, the United States is gradually seizing British rights and interests, making Britain at a loss. In addition, the Soviet Union also wants to get involved, send troops in and out of the Near East, and wants to launch a Balkan operation.

Reuters' special correspondent in Chongqing issued a warning to Britain, saying: "The Soviet Union's most zealous research goal is to enter Central Asia."

In the Mediterranean, the dispute between Britain and the United States, with the strategy of the war against Germany and the establishment of a second front as the center, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union mutually want to obtain favorable speaking rights.

In order to advance the European counter-offensive operation, the British and American forces established the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force in January, but the commander, Eisenhower, and the chief of staff, Smith, were both Americans. That is, the Mediterranean operations that Britain is most focused on are also controlled by the U.S. commanders.

The Soviet Union knows that there is a lot of damage and difficulty in the British counter-offensive against Germany, so it advocates Pan-Slavism and directs its main force towards the Balkans, entering Romania. Furthermore, although the Soviet Union frequently asked Britain and the United States to complete the second front as soon as possible, Britain and the United States hoped that Germany and the Soviet Union would be defeated and injured, and did not lightly agree. Even among the two countries, Britain does not like the United States entering the Balkans, so the relationship between the three countries, centered on the Balkan countries, is also extremely delicate.

So what about Britain? Hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops are stationed in Britain. How will the so-called high-spirited British people view the U.S. military's intrusion into their own homes?

U.S. Secretary of State Hull asked the Republic of Ireland, which is close to Britain, to remove Japanese and German officials. Britain did not express anything about Hull's words.

As mentioned above, in the war situation in the Pacific, the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic, the United States completely holds the priority. In the middle of this, Britain is doing its utmost to prevent the invasion of the United States, eager to recover its own strength and preserve its main territory.

The Future of Britain is Bleak

Britain cannot but be aware now that the United States, which it has always trusted and relied on for help, is unexpectedly the most dangerous existence. Therefore, Britain now has no hope except to retain something with the status of a victor.

German Propaganda Minister Goebbels had an article in the Great German Newspaper saying:

"Britain, which entered this great war by tragic mistake, what hope is there for continuing the war? Assuming that defeating Germany succeeds, Britain will be engulfed in the flood of communism, and from a realistic point of view, Britain may have to implement a landing operation in the near future, but at that time, Britain will be beaten so that it cannot straighten its back, and this is already a foregone conclusion."

When observing the friction between Britain and the United States, centered on the war situation mentioned above, the tragedy of Britain is progressing with time. For example, if Britain gets 81% of the weapons lent by the United States to the Allied countries, then on the other hand, the losses taken away by the United States are also as considerable as this ratio.

### MANCHURIA HAS MADE SPECIAL PROGRESS IN VARIOUS CONSTRUCTIONS – COMMENTS BY AMBASSADOR CHEN RESIDENT IN MANCHURIA

Central News Agency – National Government Committee member and concurrently Special Envoy and Plenipotentiary Ambassador Chen Jicheng returned to the country this time to participate in the National Government's return to the capital commemoration. He was warmly received by Chairman Wang of North China and Japanese Minister Izawa in Tianjin, and Mayor Zhang of Tianjin. After arriving in Beijing, he also attended important banquets hosted by Foreign Minister Chu, Interior Minister Mei, Mayor Zhou, Allied Ambassador Guth, and Manchukuo Ambassador Lu, which were very busy. Ambassador Chen has been in Manchuria for a year, and the friendship between China and Manchuria is becoming increasingly close. He has paid particular attention to the special progress in production increase in recent years. He will introduce the advantages of that country to the people of the country to serve as a reference for increasing production through lectures and symposiums in Beijing. The reporter specially visited Ambassador Chen at his private residence in western Shanghai yesterday afternoon. The main points of his conversation are recorded as follows: The people of Manchukuo have a stable life and established public security amidst the worldwide turmoil, which is commendable. In the past two years, the Greater East Asia War has progressed in stages, and the abundance of materials is the biggest factor in obtaining victory. Manchukuo is a major base for supplying these materials, greatly increasing agricultural and mining industries, and strictly implementing controls. Young people throughout the country are also given wartime training to cultivate the national spirit of fighting to the end. The defense of the northern border is as solid as a rock. Its contribution to completing the Greater East Asia War is great, and there is much that can be learned from it by our country. This time, I returned to the country to participate in the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital and will have to return to my post soon. I will also devote myself to the exchange of materials and economic cooperation between China and Manchuria and will study and investigate the special advantages of Manchuria's industrial production increase as much as possible to introduce them to the authorities of our country, and so on.

### JUSTICE MINISTER ZHANG RETURNED TO BEIJING YESTERDAY AFTER COMPLETING OFFICIAL BUSINESS

He will strengthen the judicial administration institutions in various places, impartially and quickly handle various legal cases, and gradually improve based on the principle of focusing on talent and eliminating general bad elements.

### PRESIDENT ZHAO OF THE CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY ATTENDS BANQUET WITH TWO DIRECTORS-GENERAL OF THE DOMEI NEWS AGENCY

Recently, the Allied Domei News Agency has established the China General Office of Domei News Agency to strengthen the Domei News Agency's structure in China in order to adapt to the development of the new policy towards China. The former Director-General of the Central China Bureau, Kiyoshi Iwamoto, was transferred back to the country with honor. The newly appointed Director-General of the China General Office and concurrently Director-General of the Central China Bureau, Kenji Sasaki, has taken office. Zhao Muru, President of the Central Telegraph Agency, hosted a banquet at the Kang Le Grand Restaurant at noon yesterday (the 10th) to welcome and bid farewell.

### THE JIANGSU POLICE DEPARTMENT SENDS PERSONNEL TO INVESTIGATE SHANGHAI POLICE ADMINISTRATION

Zong Ziqiang, Director of the Police Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, sent personnel to various provinces and cities to investigate local police administration in order to improve police administration. In particular, the improvement and strengthening of Shanghai's police administration is worth learning from. Therefore, he specially sent Wang Ruqing, secretary and concurrently chief of the First Section of the department, along with teachers Kondo, Naomi, and Yu Jia, to visit the First Police Bureau in Shanghai yesterday (the 10th). The bureau sent personnel to warmly entertain them and visit various departments and training centers in detail.

### COMMENTS ON THE ONE-YUAN DONATION MOVEMENT FOR CITIZENS BY CAPTAIN SHIODA – THE FUTURE OF SINO-JAPANESE COOPERATION IS BRIGHT

In order to express our enthusiasm for supporting the Greater East Asia War, Mayor Chen launched the One-Yuan Donation Movement for citizens in elementary and secondary schools in this city, starting from the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. As of now, more than 10,000 yuan has been raised, of which a portion of 2,500 yuan was presented to the Japanese Naval Attaché Office and the News Department of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China on the 8th. Captain Takamichi Shioda gave the following comments to reporters yesterday when he met them:

"Chinese youths are able to recognize the great significance of the Greater East Asia War and are working hard to enhance combat power at all times and in all places. This is deeply moving to us. The aircraft donation movement by elementary and secondary school students in this city is also a manifestation of this spirit, and we are extremely pleased. If the spirit of these innocent youths can be thorough, it will give great brightness to the future of Sino-Japanese cooperation.

Japanese expatriates in China, in order to adapt to the country's decisive emergency measures, are giving up their individual selves and contributing everything to enhance national combat power. For example, when a naming ceremony for aircraft donated to the army and navy was held in Hangzhou the other day, a lecture meeting was held. When News Minister Matsushima reported on the current war situation, the audience was moved and donated 14,000 yuan. Furthermore, when the movie "Decisive Battle in the Sky" was screened for knowledgeable people on the Chinese side, they were able to recognize the reality of Japan's air power, and all were extremely excited and wrote articles expressing their feelings. As described above, the efforts of the Chinese and Japanese people with the same spirit to strengthen the combat power of the Axis are truly moving to the Japanese Navy," he said.

It is estimated that there are 31 shelters in the first fang, 9 in the second fang, 7 in the third fang, 8 in the fourth fang, and 7 in the fifth fang, for a total of 62 shelters.

### Brief News

Prohibition of Lewd Plays: Recently, some theatrical troupes in this city have been competing to perform obscene plays such as "Butterfly Dream" (i.e., Slicing the Coffin) and "Spinning Cotton." Because their words and phrases are vulgar and their forms are vile, they are harmful to social morality and corrupt the people's minds. Therefore, the Administrative Office of the First Police Bureau of this city will ban and prohibit them to purify the people's minds and maintain discipline.

Economic Circles: Economic Commentary

### Third Discussion on Economic Police

Regarding the economic police, we have repeatedly discussed them, because the primary defect of the wartime controlled economy is the lack of order and discipline, leading to rampant profiteering and speculation, which is beyond control. As a result, the entire people's livelihood is heading towards a dead end. What a serious problem this is! Under the unified step of the current government authorities to severely crack down on speculation and curb price increases, the imminent establishment of the new Economic Police Department has already demonstrated its preemptive power, because the complexity of Shanghai's economic maladies is like tangled hemp, which cannot be cut without a sharp knife, and the new economic police organization is a sharp knife to eliminate corruption in Shanghai's economic circles.

We have already stated the various essential conditions that the economic police should possess, so there is no need to repeat them. In addition to repeatedly discussing the issue of economic police, we hope to awaken the authorities to pay special attention to the Japanese economic police system and study and refer to it. What we can learn from it in terms of organization is merely mechanical and does not differ. Although we cannot list them due to space limitations, we must especially recognize the guiding principles of the Japanese economic police. Since January of the 16th year of Showa (the 30th year of the Republic of China), the guiding principles of the Japanese economic police have focused on the unhindered implementation of control swords. However, since the Greater East Asia War, in order to cope with the extremely severe war situation at this stage, special attention has been paid to: assisting the increase of productivity and transportation capacity, safeguarding the wartime life of the people, and eradicating malignant incidents that affect the war effort or endanger the people's lives. Regarding the third item, there have recently been more substantial and thorough measures in guiding and cracking down on economic crimes. From this, we can know the position of the economic police and their wartime mission.

### Police Consumer Cooperative Actively Promotes Affairs; Formal Establishment Soon

Since the preparation for the establishment of the Police Consumer Cooperative of the First Police Bureau of this city, various circles have been enthusiastic in supporting and providing capital. According to the person in charge of the cooperative, they told reporters yesterday, "We are very grateful for the enthusiastic support from all circles. At present, the fundraising and cooperative affairs are actively being prepared and progressing. Moreover, the location of the cooperative has also been finalized. It will soon be formally established and begin procurement and distribution matters. This can directly stabilize the police's lives, indirectly strengthen the police force, and ensure local security."

### After Cooperation and Adjustment, New Face of Huaihai Province; Interview with Information Department Chief Matsudaira

Information Department Chief Matsudaira of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai met with Chinese newspaper reporters in this city at the regular meeting on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel yesterday (the 10th) afternoon. He made the following statement regarding the cooperation and adjustment of various aspects of Huaihai Province by the Allied authorities:

"The Huaihai Province was formerly known as the Su-Huai Special District. Since the National Government returned to Nanjing, it has been under the jurisdiction of the North China Political Affairs Commission. Since it was directly under the central government two years ago, with the cooperation of Japan, the local agencies and their command systems have been gradually changed. By last year, various popular organizations were also gradually adjusted. For example, last year, the Central News Agency established a branch in Xuzhou, and the original branch of the China News Agency was cancelled. The Xuzhou branch of the Allied News Agency was also placed under the jurisdiction of the Central China General Bureau. At the same time, the Japanese-language "East Asia New Daily" in Xuzhou was changed to the Xuzhou branch of the Continental New Daily on February 1 this year and continued to be published. In addition, the Chinese-language Xuzhou Daily, formerly supplied with paper and other printing materials by North China, will be supplied by Central China from April 1 this year. In addition, the scope of activities of Sino-Japanese joint ventures,

Joint Ventures

also changed. The directors and shareholders of Sino-Japanese joint ventures were also uniformly adjusted with the full cooperation of both parties. For example, the railway from Xuzhou to Bengbu will be under the unified jurisdiction of the Central China Railway Company after April 1. Local telephone and telegraph services will also be operated by the Central China Electric Communications Company. The former North China Broadcasting Association's broadcasting in Xuzhou will be managed by the China Broadcasting Association. Except for agencies directly related to the Japanese side, other agencies will be generally adjusted.

Unified Currency

The currency issue in the province has been explained by Finance Minister Zhou in his statement. From April 10, the Central Reserve Bank note will be the standard currency and will be fully exchanged to unify the currency. Regarding the calculation of this currency, Japan, based on the spirit of cooperating with China, has also notified local shops and agencies to uniformly change to the Central Reserve Bank note as the unit currency, and to follow the National Government's policies and make adjustments.

In short, the province's politics were adjusted two years ago, and now economic and cultural aspects will be adjusted to connect with Shanghai's economy in the future. At the same time, it will be an important town for the National Government to revitalize the economy and develop resources. We deeply hope that after this thorough adjustment, both parties can cooperate further to complete the victory of the war."

Short Commentary

### Killing Two Birds with One Stone

Living a wartime life during wartime is an obligation that everyone should abide by. The so-called saving on consumption refers to consuming properly, but saving to the minimum extent possible. If it is "extravagance" and "waste" beyond consumption, then it is fundamentally not within the proper scope, and it is definitely not effective to use persuasive methods to save. It is simply necessary to use prohibition and suppression methods to make it no longer exist.

Chinese-style gambling has been banned, and the business hours of dance halls have been restricted. This shows that the authorities are determined to prohibit and suppress "extravagance" and "waste" beyond proper consumption. However, there are more than 40 dance schools in Shanghai that hang up the sign of learning ballroom dancing but are actually dance halls in disguise. Because they have the sign of a school, the time is flexible, and entry and exit are free. It is a medium for inducing young men and women to degenerate and get by, a trap. Waste of money already violates wartime life, and demoralization is especially a fatal blow to national strength.

Secondly, there are more than 100 singing girl agencies and guide agencies in Shanghai, which hang up the signs of singing and guiding and use women's occupations as bait to recruit nearly 10,000 young women through oppression and threats, causing them to sink into depravity. The agency owners sit back and reap the profits. As a result, they fill hotels, gamble and revel, and the three become one, forming a prosperous city with extravagant customs, which is especially contrary to wartime life.

In this decisive era of innovation, it is hoped that the police authorities will further pay attention to it and correct this unreasonable phenomenon as soon as possible. As for the issue of the singing girls' way out, in this year of increased production, in an environment where power machinery is restricted, the promotion of handicrafts is necessary. It is hoped that entrepreneurs will transfer part of their strength in real estate and stocks to establish handicrafts, recruit and train these women to engage in production work. This can not only help solve social problems but also promote production, which is also a way to kill two birds with one stone. I believe that major entrepreneurs will not ignore it!

The important personnel and organizational law will be announced in the next few days. According to this plan, work has been underway for a long time.

It has been prepared and will be formally established soon.

### The Organization of Trade Associations Will Be Effectively Adjusted

The authorities are taking increasingly strict steps to manage the operation of major commodities, absolutely prohibiting merchants from raising prices arbitrarily for profit or illegally hoarding and speculation, in order to balance the supply of spot goods. It was learned yesterday that the authorities have decided to effectively adjust the organizational structure of trade associations for major commodities in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations on the Law of Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations" promulgated by the Executive Yuan, so as to make the organization sound and seek the welfare of the industry. All trade associations for these major commodities must prepare a membership list in accordance with the law and submit it to the relevant authorities for verification. The items to be listed are: member brand name, name of the person in charge, location of business, type of commodity being operated, date of approval registration, registration certificate number, total capital, business policy, business status, telephone number, etc. At the same time, members of each trade association, whether they are specialized or concurrent operators, must report the purchase and sale situation to their respective trade association every ten days. The trade association will prepare a roster at the end of each month and submit it to the relevant authorities for reference, including: the quantity and price of goods purchased, and the name of the merchant from whom they were purchased; the quantity and price of goods sold, and the name of the merchant to whom they were sold; the amount of goods stored; the location of storage; the detailed address and telephone number of the merchant; and the name of the person in charge or manager. Those who violate the regulations will be subject to a huge fine.

### The Issue of Candidates for the Municipal Political Consultation Committee

— Pan Guangzhen

The upcoming establishment of the Municipal Political Consultation Committee can be said to be the prelude to a civil opinion organization, and can also be said to be the preparation for citizens to participate in politics. If this is the case, then the members of the Consultation Committee bear the responsibility of Shanghai's municipal administration and receive the entrustment of millions of citizens. The difficulty of their burden and the importance of their mission cannot be overstated.

Before the names of the committee members are announced, we should first review the candidates for the committee. Based on the previous precedents of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Senate, the members of this Consultation Committee will be largely the same. However, why did the Municipal Council and the Senate not achieve much success at that time? In short, the selection of committee members placed too much emphasis on reputation. As a result, the committee members and the citizens were still separated, the lower intentions could not reach the top, the upper instructions were difficult to implement as scheduled, and the establishment of civil opinion organizations was only in name and not in reality.

The selection of members for the current Consultation Committee should abandon the system of inviting based on reputation and emphasize academic knowledge and experience. Within the possible scope, it should extend to urban areas, expand to rural and remote areas, and recruit talented people in the countryside to serve, so as to be closer to the people and easier to implement policies.

The number of members of this Consultation Committee should be greatly expanded. The selection of members should adopt a recommendation system, with one member produced by one Lianbao (joint guarantee), one town, one village, or one district. This is the need of the environment and the expectation of the citizens.

### A Tour of the New Puyu Hall

— Chang Xin

The New Puyu Hall has quite perfect facilities. Middle and lower class families are not as good as it, and there are not many upper-class families. In addition, they use scientific management methods. Everything is really analyzed very clearly, and everywhere shows that there is spirit and steps. At the same time, they think about saving money in terms of expenditure. For example, they grow their own vegetables, raise their own pigs, and in terms of medicines, in addition to a small number of donations from all walks of life, they buy their own raw materials and manufacture them themselves (undertaken by a nun who once studied as a pharmacist). At the same time, they not only pay attention to saving, but also open up new sources of income. For example, work-study students can embroider, cross-stitch, weave socks, weave nets, weave cloth bags, etc. For elderly women, if they can sew, repair broken clothes, sew buttons, etc., although the production income is very small, it is still a small supplement. Everyone who is sheltered receives free clothing, food, and housing. The aim is to enable the young to grow up and the old to have an end. Clothing, food, education, and medicine are advanced at the same time.

Although the hall was founded by the late philanthropist Lu Bohong, who devoted his life to it (currently succeeded by Lu's son), the sisters of the Charity Society of the Catholic Church assist in handling all internal work. They sacrifice their own happiness to seek happiness for orphaned children and treat it as their own comfort. That kind of great spirit of sacrifice really inspires admiration and respect.

Sky and Sea (7)

The fleet's home port is Yokosuka. Before returning to Yokosuka, they passed by Futami, so they visited the Ise Grand Shrine, which was of great significance to them. Rather than discussing the national power a hundred times, it is more meaningful to visit the shrine once—at least that's what Makoto thought. And during the anchorage in Futami, the annual routine grand review was held.

From Futami to Yokosuka, this is the last route for inshore navigation. For Makoto, this was the first trip to the East China Sea since he was born. When he thought that the ancestors of the samurai came from Kura, he couldn't help but feel a sense of reluctance for the boundless blue sea.

When the warship was sailing in Shimizu Chong, Makoto finished dinner and ran to the rear deck alone. The white, green, and red navigation lights had already emitted faint rays of light. He suddenly discovered something amazing on the western land.

"Ah, Mount Fuji!"

It was a very foggy day, but fortunately it was blown clear by the wind, allowing him to see Mount Fuji. This Mount Fuji, apart from admiring it in photos and pictures, had never been seen with his own eyes, but the scenery of the mountain had long been known. Whether there was fog or not, he couldn't tell, but it looked like a beautiful silhouette. He only felt that there was an emotion in his heart that made him worship him. Makoto saw Mount Fuji and immediately felt that he had arrived in the center of Japan. So he thought of the inland navigation practice that would be completed tomorrow.

The two months of sailing allowed him to discover the vastness of Japan. At the same time, it made him understand what life was like in the ship. It also made him know the work, responsibility, and attitude of the officers. As for the grace and power of the instructors, it was deeply imprinted in his mind.

(However, what was the biggest experience among them?) Makoto shook his head.

(Ah, I know, I have subordinates.)

This was the first time he had approached non-commissioned officers and soldiers. The first time he felt emotions for his subordinates. As for the responsibility of superiors, he also realized it for the first time. This was Makoto's conclusion.

Social Service

### Vocational Training Class Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday

The vocational training class commissioned by the Social Service Department of this newspaper to be handled by Hualian Middle School was held yesterday afternoon at 6:00 pm at the school. Principal Chen Tianyu first reported on the preparation process. Mr. Huang Jingwan from this newspaper personally went to give a speech, saying in brief: "In order to meet the urgent needs of the times and assist high school graduates who have received scholarships to find employment, and to provide appropriate training in simple living skills, this newspaper has specially commissioned Hualian Middle School to first run the technical aspects of commercial applications, temporarily suspending three months as a period, which is a new experiment." And put forward three standards: in terms of intention, such as loyalty, forgiveness, faith, love, integrity, sincerity, perseverance, and impartiality. In terms of behavior, such as being willing to discuss, being cautious, removing what is bad, being quick, accurate, diligent, courteous, incorruptible, concise, and refined. In terms of life, such as discipline, artistry, populism, groupism, love, unity, and mutual help, I hope everyone can learn and apply them.

Guests such as Lu Buru, Yang Changzhi, and Hu Yuqing gave many words of encouragement, energized their spirits, and studied earnestly. More than 40 people participated in the training, most of whom were young people from various schools who had completed high school this year and were about to enter the workforce. They were full of energy, and the teachers were all well-known figures. If this pilot project achieves excellent results, and the participants can obtain practical benefits and contribute to society, the scope can be expanded and continued in the next session.

### This Office Newly Established a Document Specialization Office

The creation of writing lies in achieving the two major purposes of "recording events and conveying meanings." If writing fails to achieve the above-mentioned purposes, then the effect of writing will be diminished. Today, young people who have just left school are often able to write novels and essays of thousands of words, but for practical documents such as letters, official documents, contracts, regulations, etc., what they write does not meet the standards. This is the result of "aiming too high and being too ambitious," rather than what society universally needs. The Social Service Department of this newspaper is aware of this and has specially commissioned Xiuneng Yixiao to run a "Document Specialization School." In addition to the above-mentioned types of courses, the curriculum also includes "Abacus, Improved Chinese Bookkeeping, Regular Script, Document Management Law, Service Morality," and invites those with extensive academic knowledge or teaching at the Shangxiang to be professors, with the aim of cultivating specialized talents in this area in the shortest possible time. Simple regulations are available upon request.
