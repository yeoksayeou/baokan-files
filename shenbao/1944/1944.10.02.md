### Outlook on the Pacific War Situation

Q: The war situation in the Pacific has recently become increasingly intense. The United States is using its naval mobile forces to attack small islands in the Pacific at any cost. May I ask why the United States is taking such a risky action?

A: The United States has always been a liberal country. Since joining the war, it has gradually moved towards a wartime system domestically. In the early stages of the war, the atmosphere of war was strong, but as the war prolonged, the impact of the war on the country gradually became apparent. After several years of war, the people have a strong tendency to oppose the war. Therefore, the new operations of the US military in the Pacific can be described as a shot in the arm for the people at home. This is the first reason. This year, the United States is holding presidential elections, and Roosevelt has broken precedent to compete for a fourth term. Not only is the Republican Dewey a strong opponent, but there are also groups within the Democratic Party that oppose Roosevelt. Therefore, the future of the fourth election is full of hidden reefs. The biggest reason for launching the [new offensive] in the Pacific this time is to benefit his fourth election. This is the second reason. Therefore, the United States is taking a risky action at a huge sacrifice.

Q: So, is this kind of adventurous move by the United States beneficial to the future of the US war effort?

A: Although the United States landed on Peleliu Island in the southeast of the Philippines, and a small part of the landing was successful, it still cannot help the war situation. Now the largest naval and air base for the United States in the Pacific is of course the Hawaiian Islands. Now that Hawaii is more than 4,000 nautical miles away from Peleliu Island, its naval supply line has become an extremely serious problem. Now, assuming that the United States has a division of troops, it will take at least 300,000 tons of ships to supply this division with weapons and materials. According to military common sense, the ratio between offense and defense is three to one. Then, assuming that the Japanese army has a force of 100 divisions, the US military must have at least 300 divisions if it wants to fight a decisive battle with the Japanese army. At this time, the required ship transportation will increase to as much as 90 million tons. Although the United States is a country rich in resources, it is a huge question whether it has the ability to supply such a huge fleet. Therefore, the longer the naval front is extended, the more unfavorable it is for the United States.

Q: At present, the strategic trend of the United States in the Pacific seems to be divided into three aspects: first, attacking the Philippines to cut off the connection between Japan and the South Sea Islands; second, attacking the Ogasawara Islands to try to spy on the Japanese mainland; and third, implementing air strike tactics in an attempt to consume Japan's production capacity. I wonder what your opinion is?

A: Regarding the first point, I have just said that the longer the US front is, the more unfavorable the future will be. For example, although the United States has an absolute advantage in troops when it occupies the two islands of Saipan and Tinian, it still takes more than 60 days of fierce fighting to succeed; the difficulties of future operations in such a vast archipelago of the Philippines can be imagined. Regarding the second strategy, it contains endless dangers. The closer the US Navy fleet gets to the Japanese mainland, the closer it is to the Japanese aviation circle, which means more opportunities for the US fleet to be completely destroyed. The mode of naval warfare is absolutely different from land warfare. The main body of the navy is the fleet, and the gains and losses of the fleet can determine the entire war situation. During the Russo-Japanese War, no one expected that Imperial Russia would be defeated, but the complete annihilation of the Baltic Fleet in the Tsushima Strait was the fatal wound of the entire Imperial Russia and the biggest key to Japan's victory. Now, if the United States wants to attack the Ogasawara Islands, or even try to spy on the Japanese mainland, it must send a powerful naval mobile force to cruise in the waters near Japan, which is an excellent opportunity for Japan to destroy the enemy. In addition, when the US fleet sails close to the Japanese mainland, it enters Japan's powerful aviation circle. No matter in terms of quantity, quality, aviation speed, time, or distance, it is absolutely beneficial to Japan. May I ask how to confront the planes inside the Japanese mainland by relying solely on aircraft carriers or a few planes on the Chinese mainland? If the US fleet loses air supremacy, the navy is powerless. The day when the US fleet is completely destroyed will be the day when Japan wins.

Q: Then, what if the United States uses air strike tactics to bomb the Japanese mainland?

A: Even if the United States can bomb the Japanese mainland, this bombing method is by no means comparable to the large-scale bombing of Berlin and Hamburg by Britain and the United States. First, the British mainland is only one hour away from Germany; second, Britain and the United States have a strong air force and strong bases in Britain, so bombing Germany is not very difficult. However, if the United States wants to carry out air strike tactics against Japan, may I ask where the United States will get a large number of planes? Where will it get a strong base? And where will it get the spare time? As a result, if the United States uses air strikes as part of guerrilla warfare, it is possible, but if it wants to bomb Japan on a large scale, it is absolutely impossible in reality.

Q: In this case, it is unfavorable for the United States to attack the Philippines, and it is absolutely dangerous to try to spy on the Japanese mainland. It is impossible to succeed in implementing air strike tactics. As a result, Japan is in control of the initiative of the war, and the future is of course unfavorable to the United States.

A: That's right. The current trend of the war is unfavorable to the United States. This is not only our opinion, but the US authorities have to admit the difficulty of the future of the war. Not only is the future of the war beneficial to Japan, but Japan's domestic wartime system is also becoming increasingly sound. The complete militarization of enterprises, the general mobilization of the people, and the establishment of an air defense posture are all sufficient to prove the increasing strengthening of the domestic wartime system. In addition, since the establishment of the Koiso Cabinet, Japan has been united from top to bottom, and the people are united. In terms of both material and spirit, it has indeed moved towards the path of certain victory. The clarification of the Pacific war situation is not far away.

### Enemy Air Force Attacking Pacific Islands Suffers Heavy Losses

More than 170 aircraft shot down in mid-February. Central News Agency, Central Pacific Base, 1st. Twenty enemy aircraft attacked Chichijima and Hahajima in the Ogasawara Islands on the 28th, and one was shot down. More than ten enemy aircraft attacked Truk Island in the afternoon, and three were shot down. Twenty enemy aircraft attacked Koror Island in the Palau Islands, and several enemy aircraft attacked Minami-Tori Shima on the 29th, and one was shot down. Central News Agency, Southwest Pacific Base, 1st. The Japanese garrison in the Halmahera area countered the attacking enemy aircraft, and the battle became increasingly fierce. The comprehensive results of countering the enemy aircraft from July 27 to September 25 are as follows: ○ 37 B24 aircraft, 13 B25 aircraft, 2 P38 aircraft, 4 P47 aircraft, and 30 F4F aircraft were shot down, for a total of 86 aircraft. ○ 67 B24 aircraft, 2 B25 aircraft, 5 P38 aircraft, 2 P47 aircraft, and 6 F4F aircraft were destroyed, for a total of more than 82 aircraft, for a total of 168 enemy aircraft shot down and destroyed.

### Japanese Troops Fight Fiercely on Peleliu and Other Islands

Tokyo, 1st, Central News Agency, the following is a separate report on the recent war situation of the Japanese army in the south: ○ In the Peleliu Island area, after a part of the enemy troops landed on the northern end of Peleliu Island and Gritbus Island on the 26th, the Japanese garrison on the island immediately countered them, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. However, the enemy continued to bombard the island with artillery fire for days, which was extremely fierce. On the 26th, when the enemy was in chaos due to the bombing of the Japanese aircraft fleet, the Japanese garrison on Peleliu Island launched a bayonet attack, daring to charge and kill, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy, which deeply shocked the enemy camp. On the 27th, another attack was launched, and great results were achieved, but the details are still unclear. However, judging from the results of the battle of a part of the advance team alone, two mortars, two heavy machine guns, and one heavy machine gun for destruction were captured, and many enemy soldiers were killed or wounded. On the same day, a fierce artillery bombardment was carried out on the Suifu Mountain observation mountain, but the superior enemy still attacked Suifu Mountain, and all of them were completely defeated after suffering heavy damage. In addition, the enemy invaded the northern area of the mountain with 20 tanks and 4 field guns. The Japanese garrison immediately countered them, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. However, as of the 20th, many enemy tanks on the island have been destroyed (4 were destroyed on the 18th and 5 were destroyed on the 19th). On the 27th, the enemy air force on Angaur Island, Peleliu Island, also attacked Palau Island and Koromi with 90 aircraft, but after being countered by the Japanese garrison, 2 aircraft were shot down and 6 were severely damaged. The Japanese army in the Angaur Island area is still guarding the key points of the highlands in the northwest of the island, and is engaged in fierce battles with the enemy. On the Morotai side, the Japanese army continued to launch bayonet charges, which deeply shocked the enemy camp. At the same time, the Japanese aircraft fleet responded to the land troops and bombed the area near the enemy landing point day and night, destroying one medium-sized enemy transport ship and achieving considerable results. On the evening of the 26th, at dawn on the 27th, and on the night of the 27th, continuous bombardments were carried out near the enemy landing point, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy.

### Mr. Nagao Talks About the War Situation, Holding a Belief in Certain Victory

Central News Agency, Shanghai. Mr. Iwao Nagao, the Shanghai branch manager of Nippon Yusen, has repeatedly inspected various parts of the Central Pacific. He recently heard that the entire Japanese military and civilians on Saipan Island and Tinian Island had died heroically. The Imperial Headquarters announced on the 30th, and he expressed his views on the future trend of the war situation as follows: [I have always been very close to the people in the garrison forces on Saipan and Tinian Islands. Now I am overwhelmed with regret to hear the news of the heroic sacrifice of the entire army, but this will never shake Japan's decisive battle posture. In the past battle of Saipan, although we cannot ignore the enemy's superiority in local operations, we must not confuse the trend of the battle with the trend of the war situation. This time, the enemy US is stubbornly holding on to its superior material strength to attack, but due to the extension of the supply line and the difficulty of replenishing food and ammunition, the number of sacrifices is increasing day by day. According to the investigation, the US military lost an average of 56 people per square kilometer in the battle of Saipan, and the losses suffered today on Peleliu Island have increased sharply to 412 people. The US military's continued attacks at the cost of heavy sacrifices are purely a concrete manifestation of Roosevelt's arrogant ambition to achieve a fourth term as president. In particular, Saipan Island was originally Guam, which belonged to the United States, so [recovering lost territory] is the most effective propaganda tool. However, the US military used dozens of times the troops and a large number of warships and aircraft to conquer this small island, which took as long as 70 days. How can it attack Japan, which is far away and has strong defenses? The United States will not find it difficult to understand the many difficulties. On the other hand, the enemy US's wishful thinking of operating on the Chinese mainland has also been completely shattered because the Japanese army took the lead and achieved unprecedented success in Hunan. Therefore, in order to recover the situation, Roosevelt attempted to recapture Saipan Island and Tinian Island as exaggerated and obfuscating propaganda. On the other hand, he still did not give up the hope of attacking Japan. In short, since the establishment of the Koiso Cabinet, the establishment of the War Guidance Council has actively promoted the increase in aircraft production, and remarkable achievements have been made in all aspects. The whole country has a firm belief in the final victory. At this important stage of the war, we must rise up together to destroy the arrogant enemy, so as to comfort the heroic spirits. We will see that the United States' anxiety will become deeper and deeper with the intensification of the war against Japan, and Japan's belief in certain victory will become more and more firm.]

### Military and Civilians on Both Islands Sacrificing Their Lives Shows the Traditional Japanese Spirit

President Ogata's Speech. Tokyo, 1st, Central News Agency. Mr. Ogata, President of the Japanese Information Bureau, gave a speech on the 30th, the gist of which is: Regarding the news of the Japanese residents on Saipan Island and Tinian Island, the Imperial Headquarters has made an announcement. Now, I will summarize the telegrams from the local area and briefly describe the . The Japanese residents on the two islands worked together with the Japanese army to defend the islands. When the enemy army began to attack in July, regardless of age, all those who could fight cooperated with the Japanese army to attack the superior enemy army and engaged in fierce battles. There were about 15,000 Japanese residents on Tinian Island, of which about 3,500 young men aged 16 to 45 formed several teams of volunteer soldiers, worked closely with the soldiers, insisted on assisting in the war, and died heroically in battle. As for the old, weak, women and children, they gathered in the Carolinas area of the island to avoid the war and assisted the Japanese army in the war. When the enemy army approached and reached the rear defense line, they were unwilling to be humiliated by the enemy and all committed suicide. There were about 500 Japanese residents on Saipan Island, and they cooperated with the army to fight against the strong enemy in the same way as on Tinian Island. All the officers and men had the indomitable spirit of guarding the imperial land. Therefore, it fully showed our determination to kill the archenemy and fulfill the unfulfilled ambition of the martyred generals.

### War Results of the Japanese Army in Shanxi Province in September

Taiyuan, 1st, Central News Agency. In the punitive war in mid-September, the Japanese army in Shanxi Province collected 991 corpses of the Chongqing army, captured 255 people, seized 246 pistols, 144 landmines, 81 hand grenades, 16 light machine guns, 3 mortars, and 53 foreign guns. Destroyed 1 defense bureau, 2 barracks, 4 clothing depots, 3 cooperatives, 3 food depots, 3 material supply stations, 3 bunkers, 1 clothing factory, 1 weapon repair factory, and 1 district office of the Chongqing army.

### Japanese Bomber Fleet Attacks Liuzhou and Nanning

36 Chongqing aircraft destroyed. A certain base of the Japanese army on the Chinese mainland, 1st, Central News Agency. The Japanese bomber fleet attacked Liuzhou again with its main force on the 29th, and another team raided Nanning, destroying a total of 36 Chongqing aircraft and setting up two locations. The details are recorded as follows: ○ The leading Japanese aircraft in the attack on Liuzhou used moonlight to conduct a brief reconnaissance, and immediately bombed the covered trenches in the southeast corner of the taxiway, hitting two aircraft with four engines in the trenches and causing them to catch fire. The Japanese aircraft then concentrated their bombing on this flame as the target. A total of 13 Chongqing aircraft were damaged in this battle, including 5 Chongqing large aircraft, 2 with four engines, 3 small aircraft, and 2 facilities (1 was a fuel depot and 1 seemed to be an aircraft hangar). Destroyed 2 large aircraft and 3 small aircraft. ○ Another team of Japanese aircraft, while flying to raid Nanning, eliminated the interference of the US fighter aircraft stationed in Chongqing and the shooting of the Chongqing anti-aircraft artillery fire, and bombed the aircraft parking area, and immediately achieved the following results: ○ The Chongqing aircraft that were destroyed and burned due to the attack included 4 large aircraft with four engines. ○ The aircraft that were destroyed included 1 large aircraft and 10 small aircraft, for a total of 13 aircraft. In this battle, one Japanese aircraft was also hit in a vital area by the Chongqing side, but it was still able to overcome the difficulties and fly back to the base.

### Japanese Army Occupies Silong

Japanese Army Frontline, 1st, Central News Agency. The Japanese army continued to attack fiercely from Luoding on the 23rd. On the afternoon of the 27th, it attacked the headquarters of the 35th Army Group of the Chongqing army, which escaped into Silong, and eliminated the resistance of a part of the 158th Division of Chongqing and the Silong National Corps. It was completely occupied at 20 minutes at the same time, and it is currently advancing westward. On the other hand, another powerful force of the Japanese army in Guangping broke into Huilong, 50 kilometers southwest of Wuzhou, at 7 pm on the 27th, and is currently pursuing the Chongqing army and attacking the interior of Guangxi Province. On the other hand, the Japanese army unit advancing along the south bank of the West River occupied Yulin and broke through the border of Guangdong Province, and had advanced to 15 kilometers southwest of Wuzhou on the 28th.

### Development of the Eastern Front Threatens the Balkans

Soviet Army Fiercely Attacks Southeastern Hungary. Berlin, 1st, Central News Agency. Havas reported: The activities of the anti-Axis forces on the Eastern Front and the Western Front are focused on the flanks, while the center is relatively calm. On the flanks of the Western Front, in the Netherlands area and the Burgundy area, the anti-Axis forces are attempting to enter the northwestern industrial area of Germany in the north and invade southern Germany in the south. The flanks of the Eastern Front are related to politics. The north is related to the Finnish political situation, and the south is related to the situation in Romania and Bulgaria. A vast area has fallen into the hands of the Soviet army. In the Baltic Sea area, the Soviet army is driven by the old dream of controlling the Baltic Sea. Romania and Bulgaria fell into the hands of the Soviet army without a fight, but the Soviet army was met with strong resistance from the German-Hungarian coalition forces when it attacked the Sanok, Krosno, and Czło areas. The Soviet army is also fiercely attacking at the Iron Gate and other places on the Romanian-Hungarian border. The Soviet army's attack on the Iron Gate is probably to avoid attacking the mountainous areas head-on. The Soviet army attacked southeastern Hungary, launching a fan-shaped offensive towards Szeged, Gyula, and Grosswardein. The German-Hungarian coalition forces are conducting mobile warfare successfully. Szekler has been abandoned, and the Soviet army and the Romanian army have established contact in various mountain passes between Grosswardein and Klausen.

### Fourth Front Will Become a Reality

The Soviet army is operating south of Neumark, and the Soviet army is attempting to cut off the German army in the Hiiu and Saaremaa areas and encompass the entire Balkans. The Fourth Front, the Balkan Front, may become a reality in the near future. The Balkan Front will threaten southern Europe and connect with the Italian Front. The Soviet army is clearly attempting to cut off the connection between the Balkans and Europe in a straight line through the Serbian area.

### German Navy and Army Meet at the Iron Gate

Berlin, 1st, Central News Agency. Havas reported: A large German fleet, including about 100 tugboats, ferries, small minesweepers, and river gunboats, led by Major General Scherf, fought along the Danube River to the Iron Gate City and met with the German army. Major General Scherf is the director of the Galaţi Shipyard.

### US Production Bureau Director Nelson Resigns

Lisbon, 1st, Central News Agency. According to a German agency report from Washington: Nelson, the director of the US Wartime Production Bureau, has resigned, and his vacancy has been filled by Krug. President Roosevelt advocates that Nelson should still hold an important position in the government.

### Inconsistencies Exposed in Soviet-Soviet Issues

Berlin, 1st, Central News Agency. Havas reported: The spokesman of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that there were differences between Eden's and Churchill's speeches. Churchill said that the key point was to win the war, while Eden believed that international political problems were becoming more and more difficult. Therefore, Eden seemed to be weaker than Churchill, and the Yugoslav issue was one of these difficulties. The British side previously stated that the anti-Axis forces had landed in Albania, but this was not realized in the end. The Soviet Union stated the day after this report was released that Tito had allowed the Soviet army to enter southern Yugoslavia, and Tito said the next day that the US military aid he had received was still not enough. From this, it can be seen that there is inconsistency between Britain and the Soviet Union.

### A Glimpse of Danyang

— Min Xian

The reporter looked at the city wall of Danyang from afar on the train, which was quite ancient and fragrant. After getting out of the station, the rickshaw pullers and hotel receptionists seemed to be more simple and honest than those in other cities on the Beijing-Shanghai Line, which is a characteristic of Danyang.

### Commercial and Price Situation

Danyang was more severely damaged by the mutiny than Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and other places. Almost all the essence of Danyang's streets was reduced to ashes. The Zhongshi Street, which is now the only remaining street, is already considered the commercial center area, but there are still not many large-scale shops. However, there are many Wu Yang stores, which is true everywhere. There seem to be more Wu Yang and towel stalls in the small streets and alleys than in Zhenjiang, which is also a simple way. All the prices are very close to Zhenjiang. Except that the price of rice is about 100 to 200 yuan less per stone than in Zhenjiang, everything else is almost the same as in Zhenjiang. However, the hotel facilities are inferior to Zhenjiang, but the room rates are cheaper. Before the mutiny, Danyang's cattle were sold to other places in large numbers. This is because Danyang has many glutinous rice fields, and cattle mainly feed on the stalks left over from glutinous rice, so the cattle are particularly strong and fat. However, now, due to the lack of vehicles and many personnel difficulties, only more than 700 heads were shipped out in August, which is much worse than in previous years. As for Danyang's local silk and wine vinegar products, they are also declining due to the difficulty of loading and transporting, especially the personnel difficulties.

### Rural and Educational Conditions

Most of the rural areas in Danyang have good harvests in recent years, and many farmers have earth cloth weaving machines. Their general economic situation is still good, so high interest loans are not common. However, it is heard that the gambling style in the countryside is worse than before the mutiny, and there are quite a few people who are willing to spend a lot of money, which seems to need to be corrected by the authorities. Danyang's rice fields yield an average of about 4 stone of rice per mu. It is heard that the security in some villages cannot be guaranteed, and bandits often appear, and the farmers are suffering from it and are subjected to other kinds of exploitation. Education in Danyang is not very developed, and there are fewer schools. Although the county government also has facilities such as a mass education center and a public sports field, they are only for show. Because the county is very close to Zhenjiang, many students go to school in Zhenjiang.

### The Crisis Within the United States

A Living Hell: They are like people trapped in the deepest depths of the eighteenth level of hell, sinking deeper and deeper. They are desperately trying to reduce their expenses on clothing, food, and housing. Moreover, due to the decrease in actual income, they cannot make up for the accumulation of debt. Those involved in military affairs are also included in this category. Their families are also affected by the soaring cost of living. Most military families rely on their income, and like ordinary people, they are forced to reduce their standard of living. Approximately 15 million salaried workers rely on their monthly income; without them, there can be no war. Firstly, schools, churches, hospitals, federal, state, and municipal governments, stores, offices, hotels, and restaurants would be unable to function. Magazines, newspapers, and books could not be published. Mail delivery, bank check cashing, and long-distance telephone calls would all be impossible.

Civil Servants and Teachers: Among these salaried workers, 900,000 are school teachers. They live on an average annual income of less than $1,550. More than 250,000 of them have joined the military, while others have changed careers. According to Dr. Duana Deshun, president of the American Education Association, at least 30% of American children are being taught by untrained temporary teachers. This means that 7 million students are not receiving the necessary education. In addition, there are more than 4.5 million civil servants. Working in government offices from nameless villages to the capital, Washington, D.C., their average income has increased by 14% from January 1941 to July 1943, according to statistics. A clerk in the Rosenthal Court wrote:

[I am willing to sacrifice, as others are. However, my living expenses have increased by 40%, my income tax has increased by 400%, and my income has not increased by even 1%. But my nineteen-year-old neighbor girl earns more than I do in her first job, $250 a month.]

Most educated people have exhausted their savings and borrowed money to buy necessities. Among them are librarians, lawyers, social workers, architects, university professors, and scientists. However, according to a report from the American Association of Scientific Workers, [most scientists earn between $35 and $50 a week.] Of the 136,000 pastors, most cannot afford even a minimum standard of living.

The majority of people burdened by the heavy war burden are office workers, wholesalers, retailers, and peddlers. The American Chamber of Commerce surveyed 35,600 employees in 351 companies in 21 American cities last year and found that the average weekly wage was $22 for office clerks, $30 for stenographers, $25 for electricians, $25 for mechanics, and $23 for typists. These are the employees of relatively well-paid large companies. Small companies pay even less. In many cities, American women cannot live on less than $30 a week. The average salary for department store clerks in New York is $23 per week. The difference between salary and [actual income] is too great, as one office worker said:

[After receiving my salary, 20% goes to taxes, 10% to war bonds, 1% to group insurance, and 5% to the company's retirement fund, totaling 36%. At least 30% is needed for my wife and my food and clothing, and I still have to buy war bonds. I haven't had a raise, but factory workers have had two or three raises. After everything is deducted, life is much harder than it used to be.]

To improve the situation, a 15% wage increase was stipulated for the low-income class. However, some politicians said that this would create malignant inflation, but inflation did not occur as a result. A clerk earning $25 a week would never waste money. Unrestricted spenders cause inflation. The thousands of industrialists who can spend without restriction wear expensive foreign suits and spend huge amounts of money on food and drink. Most of the money they use is paid by the government under contract, which is wasted domestically and causes inflation. (End) (翔: Translated from the September 2nd issue of Mainichi Shimbun)

### Strengthening Surveillance and Establishing Air Defense Watchtowers: Police Defense Department Formulates Various Establishment Rules

The Police Defense Department of this city's Police Bureau, recognizing the paramount importance of aerial surveillance in air defense matters, a task previously undertaken solely by the military, now deems it inappropriate given the recent situation. Hence, it is imperative for both officials and civilians to promptly prepare and enhance surveillance efforts. Therefore, each branch bureau is directed to expedite the establishment of air defense watchtowers in accordance with the attached provisional guidelines. This is to achieve the purpose of monitoring and preventing various disruptive acts from continuously occurring, while also serving as a precursor to local air defense work. The relevant agencies must submit reports on the location and other essential details of the established facilities within the day to ensure flawless operation in the future.

### Establishment Guidelines

(A) Purpose of Establishing Watchtowers: Watchtowers serve as the eyes and ears of citizens for air defense. They monitor the lighting control situation within their respective areas, quickly detect and identify approaching aircraft, and promptly report their movements and the resulting damage to the Air Defense Headquarters, enabling appropriate air defense countermeasures. Additionally, they monitor ground defense strategies and communication activities, ensuring the smooth implementation of all air defense measures.

(B) Establishment Requirements: Air defense watchtowers are divided into the following two types: ○ Special Air Defense Watchtowers. Each General Joint Protection Area should have one specially established air defense watchtower, located at the most suitable point within the area for observation and communication, and directly commanded by the head of the responsible police branch bureau. ○ Protection and Defense Watchtowers. In principle, protection and defense watchtowers should be staffed by personnel from the baojia self-defense corps. One watchtower should be established per bao as a standard. However, when special air defense needs arise, one bao can be divided into several units, or several baos can be combined into one unit, to establish a corresponding number of watchtowers. ○ The location of the watchtower should be selected based on aerial and terrestrial observation and communication considerations, and should be located on the most suitable high-rise building. ○ Air defense watchtower personnel should be on duty during alert periods. ○ The number of watchtower personnel should be determined as needed (approximately four to ten people). Selected personnel should be physically strong, have good eyesight and hearing, be able to comprehensively assess local conditions, and be resolute, calm, and well-educated to be able to fulfill their surveillance duties. ○ Each watchtower should have one watchtower chief responsible for overall command and control. ○ Watchtower personnel should adopt a shift system with appropriate hours and be instructed to provide diligent and constant service. ○ Each watchtower should use the funds of the local baojia to establish defense facilities (against shrapnel and the shock of our own anti-aircraft shells, etc.) and complete lighting control equipment. ○ The results of surveillance should be communicated to the police branch bureau as soon as possible and accurately reported. The police branch bureau should implement various countermeasures based on the reports and as the situation warrants. ○ The police branch bureau should assess the reports from each watchtower and report necessary matters to the Air Defense Section of Headquarters at any time.

### Important Matters

The watchtower post should be equipped with an accurate map, a direction finder, and important communication items. ○ The time of enemy aircraft detection should be recorded using a 24-hour system, without distinguishing between a.m. and p.m., and the clock should be accurately set. ○ The direction of enemy aircraft detection should be distinguished by the eight directions of east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, north, and northeast, and should be noted with landmarks such as buildings, roads, and other features for reference. ○ Identify enemy or friendly aircraft, or aircraft of unknown origin. ○ Identify the type of aircraft (large, medium, or small). ○ Note the number of aircraft. ○ Note the altitude. ○ Note the direction of flight. ○ Note the wind direction. ○ Note the damage caused by the attack.

To avoid cumbersome and repetitive reports from each bao watchtower, the police branch bureau will designate the most suitable bao watchtowers, approximately one in each joint protection area, as Class A Protection Air Defense Watchtowers to be responsible for the aforementioned reporting tasks. Other watchtowers will communicate exclusively with the baos in their respective areas to maximize their functionality (referred to as Class B Protection Air Defense Watchtowers).

(C) Establishment Scope: ○ Watchtowers should be established urgently in the area under the jurisdiction of the former First Police Bureau in the city center. ○ The branch bureaus of the former Second Police Bureau in the city center should establish watchtowers as soon as possible within their capabilities. ○ Police branch bureaus in the suburbs should establish watchtowers within their capabilities in accordance with the provisions of these provisional guidelines. ○ The date for implementation in the Navy baojia area will be determined separately.

### Commodity Distribution Office Revises Bread Ration Prices

Retail Price: 57 Yuan per Pound

The City Commodity Distribution Office, due to the adjustment of the rationed flour price by the Flour and Wheat Committee from yesterday (1st), and the changes in the price of leavening powder sold on the market, has revised the retail and wholesale prices of bread at the request of the bread manufacturers. The announcement is as follows:

From October 1st until further notice, the wholesale price of plain white bread manufactured by registered bakeries in the city is revised to 50 yuan national currency per pound, and the retail price is revised to 57 yuan per pound (the price for less than or more than one pound is calculated proportionally). Packaging will incur additional packaging fees. Furthermore, the rationed flour received by each registered bakery is limited to the production of five types of price-controlled bread weighing 8 liang, 12 liang, 16 liang, 24 liang, and 32 liang. From the same date, the ration amount of No. 1 flour for bread coupon holders is also limited to one jin per coupon, costing 50 yuan national currency (without packaging).

### Unregistered Industrial and Commercial Enterprises Will Be Punished

The City Economic Bureau, in order to understand the operational status of factories and various commercial enterprises throughout the city, has been conducting industrial and commercial registrations, which have been repeatedly extended. It is now learned that the process officially concluded at the end of last month. It is also reported that the Bureau will dispatch personnel from the Economic Security Office to conduct investigations. Any factories or newly established businesses found to be unregistered in accordance with the law will be severely punished. According to regulations, all registered factories must apply for registration within three months after the implementation of these measures.

### Banks and Financial Institutions to Handle Loans Cautiously After the Holiday

Assisting the Government in Suppressing Commodity Prices

The Mid-Autumn Festival's financial year-end hurdle was safely navigated, with the banking and financial industries receiving financial adjustments from the Central Reserve Bank, preventing unexpected bankruptcies. Banks, financial institutions, and securities markets in this city are taking a compensatory holiday today (1st) and will resume business as usual tomorrow (3rd). According to a Central News Agency reporter, banks and financial institutions in this city, mindful of the recent potential for speculators to hoard commodities by utilizing funds, are determined to assist the government in curbing speculation and suppressing commodity prices. After resuming business following the holiday, they will handle mortgage loan applications with caution. If items related to people's livelihoods are used as collateral or if the funds are for improper purposes, loan applications will be rejected. The banks also plan to report applicants to the authorities for punishment.

### Weekly Market Review

The financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai last week showed a steady upward trend. The financial market was slightly tight due to the Mid-Autumn Festival financial year-end, with a slight increase after the shadow market stabilized. Although Chinese stocks were weak, the stock market fluctuated, with industrial stocks trending upwards. Other cultural and real estate stocks declined. The trading volume was less than usual. The industrial market faced limited electricity and raw material supplies, making it difficult to see optimism in production. Investors continued to buy up goods, leading to frequent price increases, especially for essential food items such as rice, oil, and fuel. This phenomenon has a significant impact on people's livelihoods. Therefore, the authorities have been secretly investigating business transactions and strictly punishing hoarding and speculation as a measure to suppress rising prices. Overall, the largest price increases last week reached 20%, followed by increases of around 10%.

### The Educational Character of Former Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Schools

— Ueno Taichu

○ The Cumbersome Nature of the Clerk's Duties: Besides copying documents in Chinese and English, the clerk also handles all accounting and general affairs of the school. Internally, they bear almost full responsibility for school affairs. However, they do not have the status of a general affairs director or head of general affairs in ordinary schools. As for compensation, even the highest-ranking first-class clerk does not earn as much as a second or third-class teacher, which is a mismatch between responsibility and pay. Among these clerks, there are many highly capable individuals or those with excellent English foundations.

○ Low Tuition Fees: The tuition fees of schools established by the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) were roughly equivalent to those of municipal schools before the Incident (referring to the Second Sino-Japanese War). After the Incident, they were lower than those of any other school. This is because tuition fees only covered a small portion of the school's expenses. In the spring of 1943, secondary schools only charged a little over one hundred yuan, and primary schools charged just over thirty yuan. Although these were meager sums, the following regulations were also in place:

One: Tuition fees were not uniform across all schools. Before the Incident, there was a detailed investigation into the monthly income of the parents of students at each school, and statistics were compiled. Schools where the average student's family was in difficult financial circumstances had lower tuition fees, while those where families were better off had higher fees. Generally, schools located in industrial and commercial areas had lower tuition fees, while those in residential areas had higher fees.

Two: Establishment of Free Places: In addition to students from primary schools who obtained scholarships and were entitled to free tuition, any secondary school student with two or more siblings enrolled could apply for [proportional free tuition]. Families in particularly dire financial straits could also apply for exemptions based on precedent. As for primary schools, it was stipulated that one-tenth of the total number of students at each school should be granted full exemption from tuition and the cost of books and supplies. One-twentieth of the total number of students should be granted half exemption from all fees, in order to show preferential treatment to poor students. This low tuition fee and free tuition policy may be one of the reasons why many students applied to SMC Chinese schools.

Three: Increase in the Number of Low-Fee Schools: In the spring of 1936, in order to enroll more out-of-school children, the SMC specially established half-day SMC primary schools in densely populated poor areas of industrial and commercial districts (Peng Road). These schools enrolled as many as 1,600 students, and the tuition fee was about one-fifth of that of other schools. Books and supplies were provided completely free of charge, while school facilities and teacher quality were no different from those of other full-day primary schools. After the Incident, although the school buildings were moved several times, this low-fee system was preserved.

○ Close Liaison Between Schools and the Various Departments Within the SMC:

In the SMC system, various departments seemed to be connected, and schools were no exception. Specific aspects are detailed below:

One: Liaison with the Finance Department: Although Chinese schools under the SMC had sufficient funding, school authorities had no power over circulating funds. Apart from teachers' salaries, which were paid monthly by the Finance Department, they only had a few dozen yuan in cash each month for purchasing items. All purchases were made by placing orders with major companies and stores using a purchase order, without paying cash. The principal would then send the invoices to the Finance Department for reimbursement. After the Finance Department approved the invoices, the stores could collect payment directly from the Finance Department, without the school's involvement. This was intended to prevent corruption. The difficulty was that if the Finance Department did not approve the purchase of necessary items, it would cause a major problem.

Two: Liaison with the Health Department: The Health Department had school inspectors and a school medical section. The former was responsible for inspecting the cleanliness of the school environment, drinking water facilities, toilets, and grounds; whether the number of students in the classrooms was too crowded; and the construction, lighting, and ventilation of school buildings. The latter checked the students' physical condition at a specific time each day. What is particularly noteworthy is that when doctors discovered that children were suffering from illnesses, they immediately notified the school authorities for isolation. Strict disinfection was carried out in cases of infectious diseases. Sick children were not allowed to attend school without a doctor's [certificate allowing them to attend class]. Children who were absent from school due to illness were also visited by nurses who would visit their homes to provide guidance on care, seeking medical attention, and other methods of dealing with illnesses. Moreover, the annual regular injections of typhoid fever vaccines, and vaccinations for disease prevention or smallpox, were routine matters.

Three: Liaison with the Engineering Department: All repairs and additions to school buildings were the responsibility of the Engineering Department. The Engineering Department regularly sent personnel to inspect and assist or supervise the maintenance of school buildings, the management of grounds, and the handling of general school facilities. In addition, all routine engineering maintenance of the school, such as roof leaks, broken doors and windows, cracked floors, damaged walls, and broken desks and chairs, only required a request for repairs to be submitted to the Engineering Department, which would immediately instruct workers to carry out the repairs. The expenses were paid from the school's budget, which was transferred by the Finance Department.

Four: Liaison with the Fire Department: The Fire Department regularly sent personnel to the school to guide staff and students in the use of fire-fighting equipment and to teach various fire prevention methods. At the same time, it rigorously inspected all fire-fighting equipment at appropriate times each year.

○ Characteristics of the Facilities:

Chinese schools under the SMC had significant differences in facilities before and after the Incident. About half of the schools could not return to their original school buildings and had to rent temporary school buildings for classes. As for school equipment and all facilities, much was lost. Although some schools made every effort to maintain the original facilities, it was difficult to restore the old appearance after the devastation. The following describes the general state of the facilities of typical schools:

○ School Buildings:

Some Chinese schools under the SMC had school foundations or funding donated by Chinese and foreign gentry and merchants, with the SMC constructing the school buildings (such as the Hua Tong Public School, Nie Zhongcheng Public School, and Ge Zhi Public School). Some donated self-built school buildings to the SMC (Yu Cai Public School). Other school buildings were mostly built or purchased by the SMC alone, as SMC property. Because funding was sufficient at the time, and the designs were excellent, most of the school buildings were magnificent and imposing in Shanghai. In particular, the construction expenses for the Girls' Middle School, Xinzha Road Primary School, and Jingzhou Road Primary School each reached 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. If the prices at that time were compared with the current prices, the cost of just one school building would be more than ten million yuan. The greatness of the engineering and the solidity of the construction go without saying. It was seen during the Incident that the Jingzhou Road Primary School was hit by a shell from a large cannon, and all the glass was shattered, but the school building only had one hole and no other damage.

○ Spacious Grounds:

Shanghai is a place where land is worth its weight in gold, but Chinese schools under the SMC mostly had spacious grounds, averaging more than ten mu. Moreover, many trees were planted, and lawns were laid, creating a peaceful and secluded atmosphere in the playgrounds and campuses. In the heart of a bustling metropolis, it was a world apart, truly a school with an excellent environment.

○ General Equipment of School Buildings:

Newer school buildings mostly had spacious and grand auditoriums that could accommodate all the school's students, and gyms. There were also cinema rooms, physics and chemistry laboratories, natural science rooms, woodworking rooms, music rooms, and so on, almost without exception. The cleanliness of the toilets was particularly noteworthy. In addition, there were desks and chairs suitable for children's height (primary schools would have the Chinese Education Department design and manufacture over a thousand sets of high, medium, and low-grade desks and chairs that were lightweight and sturdy, with separate desks and chairs that could be moved freely), non-reflective rotating blackboards, spring curtains that did not obstruct vision, clean sand-filtered water for multiple people to drink, door stops to prevent students from crowding and colliding when entering and exiting, etc. These were all special facilities. However, all of the above facilities had to be inspected and repaired by the Engineering Department at any time to maintain their efficiency. Otherwise, once damaged, not only would repairs be difficult, but they would also hinder school management.

○ Library Facilities:

The library resources of each school were not complete. There was only a small library fee each year, which was only enough to cover consumption and not enough to add new books. Even the existing books were only suitable for a small number of people to read, and the scope was narrow. All of this was not commendable. Therefore, most schools had to adopt a circulating library system or borrow books from each other in rotation to make up for the deficiency.
